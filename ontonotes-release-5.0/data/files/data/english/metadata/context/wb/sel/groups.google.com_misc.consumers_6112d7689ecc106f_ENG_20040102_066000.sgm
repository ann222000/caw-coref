Irwin Takes Baby to Crocodile Feeding

January 2, 2004 04:31 PM EST

BRISBANE, Australia - &quot;Crocodile hunter&quot; Steve Irwin's
honeymoon with the Australian public could well be over.

The television star and likely candidate for Australian of
the Year honors was being compared to disgraced pop star
Michael Jackson on Saturday, after he took his month-old
son to his first crocodile feeding, a moment that was captured
by television cameras and later broadcast.

Before a crowd of onlookers Irwin held his son Robert under
one arm and dangled a piece of meat from the other in front
of a 13-foot crocodile which quickly snapped up the offering.

&quot;Good boy Bob,&quot; Irwin said once the crocodile's jaws snapped
shut, the tabloid Herald Sun reported.

Viewers jammed phone lines at Channel 7 and Channel Ten,
the two networks that broadcast the footage, expressing their
outrage at Irwin's actions, news reports said.

The stunt drew comparisons with Michael Jackson dangling
his baby son over a hotel balcony in Berlin in Nov. 2002.

But Irwin defended his actions, saying his child was never
in danger.

&quot;I was in complete control of the crocodile. Robert was
tucked right in my arm,&quot; said Irwin, the Herald Sun reported
on Saturday.

His American wife Terri, who handed the baby over to Irwin
in the enclosure and giggled at the spectacle, agreed.

&quot;It was a wonderful sensory experience for him (the baby).
He dug it,&quot; she said.

Child support and family groups said Irwin's behavior was
almost like child abuse and he should never have exposed his
son to such peril.

&quot;Most parents would cringe at the sight of such things,&quot;
said Bill Muehlenberg from the Australian Family Association,
quoted in the Herald Sun.

&quot;One slip, one fall and he is the crocodile's lunch.&quot;

It was a major stumble in the so-far unstoppable career of
the gregarious Irwin, who was among the few to score an invite
to Prime Minister John Howard's barbecue for visiting U.S.
President George W. Bush in October.

His Australia Zoo reptile park in northern Australia is
popular with tourists, with different state governments at
one point getting into a bidding war to woo Irwin for his
potential tourist dollar.

It's not child abuse, it's just brainless. I never considered Irwin
intelligent, he often underestimates the danger of animals believing to be
untouchable. One day there'll be a croc showing him how nature works.

As well, Steve kind of &quot;dances&quot; the baby along the ground in the enclosure
near the pool but you can't see where the animal is.

I just think it was a really stupid thing to do in public. Surely someone
might have pointed out to him that people would have an issue with seeing a
1 month old being hauled around in an enclosure with a rather large croc.
All the more seeing that one young man was recently killed rather nastily by
a wild croc that had his 2 friends treed overnight while it moved around
underneath. He seemed very less-than-impressed on TV tonight about the fuss
being made.

steve reminds me of one of those loser parents that leaves their kid in the
car when they run into a store, only to find their car was stolen while they
were inside. neither thought they were endangering their child but the
reality was quite different.
the guy is a dweeb with really flawed judgement.

What seemed worse to me than having the baby so close to the deadly

While I wouldn't classify this as child abuse, it's most definitely child
endangerment. He may have thought he had the croc under &quot;complete control&quot;
but bringing a 1 month old baby into that kind of an environment is
completely inappropriate. It was just a pathetic publicity stunt, and it
could've cost him his son's life if things hadn't gone just so.

I have never thought Steve Irwin was the brightest bulb in the pack, and
this just proves it.

Typical poor judgement on the part of the parent. But not child abuse. And
leave it to the American media to spin it up out of control as soon as
there's a BAYYYBEEE involved. Pathetic. There are many &quot;wankers&quot; in this
situation...

&gt;Saw this on CNN, what is this guy thinking. No one has &gt;control of a

"/> Reptiles aren't dumb and they do recognise people. When I open my snake's
box and she can see other people, I'm still the one she pays the most
attention to. This is because I'm the one who handles her most and the one
who feeds her.

I was eating a microwave meal on the sofa and my iguana came over to me. He
smelt the food and before I could stop him, but his head into the plastic
microvave tray and snagged a potato wedge with melted cheese. It was a black
plastic tray.
Now whenever I sit down and the microwave tray is black or even if he see's
a black bowl Harvey stares at it and his pupil's get narrower as he focuses
on it. If I'm sitting near him he'll come over and try to steal from the
tray, but I always pick him up just before he reaches the tray and place him
back on the back of the sofa and he'll again make his way over to the tray,
I intercept him again, put him back on the sofa, he comes again...

Anyway, the crocodile would been intelligent enough to realise that Steve
feeds him and that standing still and having food dropped into his mouth is
far easier than catching his own.
BTW, Steve would have the croc well fed enough to ensure that it's not
hungry enough to want to attack him and make it easier to work with.

It also depends on what sort of crocodile Murray is. Is he a Freshie or a
Saltie? Salt-water crocs are larger and more aggressive than fresh-water.
The croc that killed that young man in Australia and stalked his friends was
a Saltie, they're very territorial, you'll only find one male in an area as
they chase their rivals out and you won't find any Freshies there either
because the Salties eat them.

&gt;sky news earlier, quite good, he said he didnt want to upset people but he
&gt;wanted to make sure his kids were croc savvy in his words

"/> At one month old, the baby is not going to be *croc savvy* though.

Here's a link to the interview. The guy is nuts. You cannot be
in complete control of a wild animal. Look at Roy of Sigfried and
Roy who has been in *complete control* of his tigers.

http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/0104/03crocodile.html

He also claimed the danger posed by the crocodile was exaggerated.

&quot;It's all about perceived danger; I was in complete control,&quot; said
Irwin, flanked by his father, his wife and his 5-year-old daughter,
Bindi. &quot;People say, 'Well, what if you had fallen?' But for that to
take place a meteorite would have had to come out of the sky and hit
Australia at 6.6 on the Richter scale like in Iran.&quot;

I remember watching a tv program where Terri Irwin was holding the tails of
rattlesnakes while she was pregnant with Bindi. She said something along the
lines of &quot;It's good for our developing baby to feel the enthusiasm we have
for animals.&quot;

I thought that was irresponsible and didn't make any sense. I also don't
think it makes a lot of sense to expect a one year old to learn to be &quot;croc

danger.

My brother's sister-in-law recently turned down a fully paid for family
vacation to spend a week in Mexico, because it's &quot;too dangerous&quot; to take
her two small children out of the country like that. What if one of
them got sick, or hurt? She would never take them on a boat, and, even
with two, is almost never out of arms' reach of both of her children.
She doesn't even cook while she's home alone with them if they are
awake, because kitchens are too dangerous. Come to think of it, she
doesn't do housework, either, as it might distract her from the
children. (I might add, she doesn't seem to be having a lot of fun as a
parent.) She thinks many things that other people do is &quot;endangerment&quot;.

Personally, I'm inclined to suspect Irwin's more knowledgeable about how
dangerous it really was than I am.

And it was the combined issues of him not holding a one month old baby in a
supportive, safe hold, combined with the obvious need for him to try and
concentrate on the job at hand - feeding a large and hungry croc. He could
have exposed the little tacker at more of a distance or waited until he was
a little older. What is a one month old going to remember about this

&gt;&gt; Yes, because he knows people are only making such a fuss because he's

&gt;&gt; wouldn't have been such a fuss.

&gt; Are you kidding? It's &quot;because&quot; he's well known that some people at least

&gt; experienced with the animals would have probably been charged with child

&gt; And it was the combined issues of him not holding a one month old baby in
a
&gt; supportive, safe hold, combined with the obvious need for him to try and
&gt; concentrate on the job at hand - feeding a large and hungry croc. He could
&gt; have exposed the little tacker at more of a distance or waited until he
was
&gt; a little older. What is a one month old going to remember about this

I would say that since the baby suffered no harm, it was not child
abuse, but child endangerment.
It compares closely to the stunt Michael Jackson pulled a while back.

I think that this is not a double standard between the two, but
between the rich&amp;famous and more ordinary people. If an ordinary &quot;Joe
Lunchpail&quot; did something like this, CPS would snatch the kids away in
a heartbeat. But when you can afford megabuck lawyers, Social Services
avoids a possible protracted legal fight like the plague. THAT is the
double standard: it goes by the golden rule, he who has the gold makes
the rules.-Jitney

"/> Not necessarily--it's a double standard between the action and getting
caught. If this were in fact Joe Lunchpail feeding a croc with his own
child, no one would ever know, because there aren't constant cameras rolling
on non-celebrities. No harm, no foul.

I see this particular incident along the lines of driving your child
somewhere. Would you put your child in a car with an unlicensed,
inexperienced, 12-year-old driver? THAT'S child endangerment. However,
taking the necessary precautions of driving the child yourself (assuming you
have both a license and sufficient mental and physical capacities) among
other precautions, you significantly lower the risk to yourself and the
child. If ANYBODY were to hold Steve Irwin's child while feeding a captive,
conditioned croc, Steve Irwin is the best bet.

Steve is a celebrity that there was a public outcry.

The only way such a Joe Schmoe could be international news is if he were

&gt; While I wouldn't classify this as child abuse, it's most definitely child
&gt; endangerment. He may have thought he had the croc under &quot;complete control&quot;
&gt; but bringing a 1 month old baby into that kind of an environment is
&gt; completely inappropriate. It was just a pathetic publicity stunt, and it
&gt; could've cost him his son's life if things hadn't gone just so.

"/> Let's do Mini Spectrum Analysis.

Child abuse of course is &quot;A deliberate disregard of a child's PHYSICAL
well being. The striking of a child in a physical fashion as defined
by the LAW (hitting, beating, and such like). A deliberate disregard
of a child's EMOTIONAL well being; a.e. neglect in a malice and
forethought fashion&quot;.

Steve did not deliberately disregard and/or abuse his child. I have no
doubt that in the event of an unexpected event, the child will have
been rendered safe by Steve himself, even to the point of Steve's
giving his life if necessary. Let us never forget the Brady Bunch or
Brady Grid credo: A Brady (a human) always keeps a promise. Amen?
Amen.

The raising up; yea the bringing up of a baby is an assured promise
and responsibility that the PARENTS will bring said child up
appropriately according to the laws of the land. No abuse and no
endangerment. Steve Irwin breached THE PROMISE. Amen.

Unfortunately there was ENDANGERMENT. CHILD ENDANGERMENT. To the eyes
of the law the child is considered a ward of the parent/guardian or
the state until the age of 18. When a parent breaches that
accountability and that responsibility by &quot;Deliberately positioning
the child in a situation that reasonable people and knowledgeble
people know of to be dangerous, unsafe, and/or unhealthy when
&quot;SCIENTIFIC DATA SAYS THERE'S DANGER&quot;. then you have Child
Endangerment.

Reasonable people (even Steve &amp; his expertise in animals) know that
the typical behavior is NOT to expose the babies to wild animals that
are scientifically proven to commit harm (crocs have damaged people,
including Steve himself! Proven fact).

Not a lawyer and do not play one on TV; however this is the general
idea. You gotta take authority. You gotta be responsible. You gotta
barn tobacco; that's all there is to it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I have never thought Steve Irwin was the brightest bulb in the pack, and
&gt; this just proves it.

&gt; Typical poor judgement on the part of the parent. But not child abuse. And
&gt; leave it to the American media to spin it up out of control as soon as
&gt; there's a BAYYYBEEE involved. Pathetic. There are many &quot;wankers&quot; in this
&gt; situation...

"/> The media perpetuate this behavior by &quot;distorting', resorting to
&quot;double standards&quot;, by &quot;telling stories&quot; that are lies. To the expert
in wildlife, this is not a big deal. That's why Steve's reaction. But
I can scientifically prove that a one-month-old baby doesn't have the
cognitive dissonance to process this inputted data. In laymans terms,
the baby doesn't understand yet what's happening because he's still in
development. Dobson, James Dobson says that the myelin, which coats
the nerves in a human body, obviously does not manifest in a baby or
even a toddler (takes several years to develop). Amen. So Steve you
were WRONG!

But now how can we counsel Steve and his wife Terri? I would love to
hear how Terri justifies this. I wager she hasn't been a mother long
enough. Lets start w/some counseling. The court of public opinion. But
let us end this soon for there's more pressing issues at hand. I don't
want to see this man hurt by this. I like his show and of course want
to see the wildlife. But this shan't be tolerated and I must say Steve
you better get with it buddy bo. Science proves you should have known
better. Check it out. But then let us move on in a spirit of
forgiveness and love. For Steve:

IS NOT MICHAEL JACKSON!

Amen and:

That concludes Mini Analysis Spectrum.

Take a lesson my friend.

Really? Where is it written that exposure to a wild animal who eats
people is not dangerous?
And by the way, if you owned a dog, say a pit bull, that was proven to
be vicious and you exposed a child to that, you rightfully would and
SHOULD be brought up on charges if something happened to said child.
The other things you mentioned cannot compare to what Irwin did.

Look at the bear naturalists. Another guy convinced Bears are just
cuddly pets. He and his girlfriend got eaten for being stupid. Also
Roy got what he deserved. Tigers are wild animals, they are not pets,
and if some middle aged dork in a white tight spangly jumpsuit dragged
me up on a stage in hot white lights in Vegas I'd probably chew his head
off too.

Irwin was wrong, period. He should not be allowed to do it again.

Unfortunately, all those people who &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;aaah&quot; forget that very
fact. These are wild animals, they are not pets, and they do kill
people, period. You HAVE NO CONTROL CEPT WHAT THE ANIMAL GIVES YOU and
that can be revoked at any time. Look at the bear idiot who ended up
eaten and buried along with his girlfriend and caused some innocent
bears to be shot due to their foolishness. Look at Roy. Perfect example.

What Irwin did is stupid, foolish, and certainly child endangerment of
the highest kind. Too bad he's rich and famous, if it were you or me,
they'd have our kid already. His wife is even a bigger moron than he is
and in my opinion unfit. &quot;He dug it&quot;. Right. A month old baby. This
women doesn't have enough brain cells to mother.

responding to, is suggesting a zero risk life for children. They are
simply questioning the SOME risks as being pointless and MORE risk
than other common risks we take with our children...in the course of

There was NO need to hold the child while croc feeding, unlike having
to take the child to the beach with the rest of the family, or to the

"/> No one. The risk level is being assessed, not the preferrance in
location. But then they wouldn't be in a foster home if they were
alive. There are acceptable levels of risk in everyday life without
upping the anti to the levels Irwin did.

If you check into his background you will see is &quot;expertise&quot; does not

river crossings. An alligator (and crocs are just as powerful and
agreesive and clever) can lunge out of the resistance of the water,
completetly hidden, a good 8 to 10 feet (and I'm being conservative)

Irwin did not have exclusive babysitting chores at feeding time for

dangerous ol' highway, yes, that IS a reasonable risk to put the child
to because one must go out and do one's shopping for groceries.

"/>&quot;Scientific&quot; enough to point you back to the referances I cited where

He misjudged before. Claiming he knows crocs so can take that risk is
checked and mated by his and for that matter, others, histories as
well, vis a vis crocs and safety concerns.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Fact is: absolutely nobody got hurt and the croc had his dinner the same way

"/> Fact is that is no excuse for taking risks that needn't have been
taken. Would you defend another &quot;Irwin&quot; if it were cobras, hyenas,
rhinos? What is it about crocs that make them safer and more
predictable than these critters.

The Bear expert has been cited on this, as have Siegried and Roy and
their white tiger that was very well TRAINED, and yet blew out and
when out of control in an second or two.

So, the tiger got Roy and Murray or a cousin will get Irwin, his wife,
or one of his or both kids if he keeps pushing the envelope. I believe
Dan Sullivan was probaby right now that I look back at the stills.
Irwin was suddenly very frightened when he was walking the child to
the croc pond, as Murray appeared to be coming back for seconds.

I have rarely fallen in my like, being one of those extraordinarily
coordinated individuals. Well, I've fallen, but ended up either clear
over on my feet or not injuring myself because I knew how to fall.
..martial arts training and natural ability.

I forgot once, about 5 years ago, just how strong and 85 pound
labrador can be and late at night found myself, having just skinned a
tiny protrusion on the pavement just as the dog pulled forward on the
leash, down, half conscious, with the right side of my face neatly
abraided. And I'm not the first martial arts wonk that's screwed up.

And Irwin HAD a record of screwing up. And the scars to show for it.

I would NEVER try to carry a child and walk an 85 lb dog at the same
time because unlike Irwin, no matter how skilled I am with dogs, my
balance, and how careful, I WOULD be putting that child not just at
risk, but UNECCESSARY RISK.

Get the difference?

"/> What FACTS would those be, the ones I cited and YOU are ignoring?
Possibly, since this broke into two threads or maybe started that way,
you should check the other thread for my comments and citations.

Other croc experts, not showboaters, seem to be in some doubt as to
Irwins sanity. And even a profunctory runthrough on croc and alligator
feeding and predation behaviors would demonstrate that you do NOT
second guess a croc...as it will do what IT wants to do when IT wants
to do it. They are NOT trainable in the sense even a large cat is. And
you don't see lion trainers with infants while feeding the lions.

Check out the old NPR vids on alligator strikes on wildebeest in
Africa. They can lunge easily six to 80 feet so fast you can't follow
it with your eye.

They are ancient, one of the oldest still living, predators on the
planet. They didn't get that way by being slow and easily
domesticated.

Or continue on in your dreamworld of parents rights to put their
children unreasonably at risk, and dearie me don't interfere until the
kiddie already IS Gator Chow.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You have never made an error of judgement when
&gt;your children were involved

"/> Impossible. Of course I made errors, and being the smart fellow that I
am, along with millions upon millions of other smart parents, I made
sure that I keep a generous margin for error. I did not take them croc
feeding.

I did have one incident with a pasture full of young bulls and my
three year old daughter climbing a fence post to show off to here
daddy, but I had no choice but to have her in my care that day.

And I also had her complete confidence in me...since I am not nor was
a child abuser with so called &quot;discipline&quot; of corporal punishment. She
followed my directions to come down calmly and well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I tell both my successful and happy, as well as prosperous 35 to 43
&gt;&gt; year old children your opinion.

&gt;...and what did they say ?
&gt;Was it perhaps:
&gt;&quot;I'm glad no meddlesome hypocrite know-it-all do-gooders decided to
have us
&gt;taken into care, but we *would* now like you to stop interfering in
the way
&gt;we choose to raise our own children.&quot;

"/> No. They in fact had a great many adventures. Horses, ranch life,
Hawaii, the beaches and diving, mountain living with wood for heat and
gardens and livestock for food.

And they speak of their childhoods with considerable warmth. They had
tons of fun. And though I did have one incident with a friend and CPS,
and got her out of it with child intact, my kids never were out of my
care for the entire childhoods.

I don't mind if you or Irwin wants to have their kids live in more
adventuresome circumstances, but I do think croc feeding with a month
old baby in one's arms is pushing it just a bit.

Especially since it wasn't a requirement for croc feeding.

Not as far as I know.

&gt;&gt; Citing ridiculous opposite extremes your opponents don't support
&gt;&gt; either is NOT a legitimate form of argument.

&gt; Well I think it is:
&gt; It shows by contrast how rediculous the first extreme was.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Irwins, like any other parents are human and falible, but who really
&gt;&gt;&gt; believes that their children would have a better life on some state
&gt; financed
&gt;&gt;&gt; foster farm than they would with mommy and daddy ?
&gt;&gt; -----------------
&gt;&gt; If Irwin can't curb his stupid fucking attitude, it looks like the
&gt;&gt; foster home.

&gt; So you think that swearing and threatening are good ways to win an argument
&gt; ?

Crocodiles seem to inspire more awe and fascination in us
than most creatures. Combine their cold, reptilian features
and their ancient link with a world before the first human
footprint appeared (not to mention an occasional preference
for human flesh) and you have a creature that Hollywood
was always going to embrace. Others came before him but
none has ridden on the crocodile's back to greater fame or
fortune than Steve Irwin.

The self-styled &quot;Crocodile Hunter&quot; has created an
entertainment juggernaut centred around his ability to get up
close and personal with one of the most lethal animals on
Earth. Irwin has always argued that for those – like him –
who understand these animals, their behaviour is, to a
great degree, predictable. It is the unpredictable that seems
to have ambushed him.

When a worldwide outcry accompanied the release of TV
footage showing Irwin holding his infant son in one arm while
feeding a chicken carcass to a 4m saltwater croc called
Murray with the other, he brazened: &quot;I was in complete
control of the crocodile.&quot;

The images caused enough of a stink in Australia but in the
United States, where his caricatured Ocker image has
generated an enormous following, the reaction was dire.
His parental abilities were immediately compared with
those of Michael Jackson (who once dangled his infant son
over the balcony of a Berlin hotel), while The New York
Daily News carried a front-page photo of Irwin
accompanied by the headline: &quot;Steve Irwin – Australian
for stupid.&quot;

Yet the furore has obscured what many seasoned croc
hunters and handlers feel is the real issue. Crocodiles
and alligators are never predictable, they argue, and the
real danger of the Irwin approach is that it just encourages
imitators. There is ample evidence of the unpredictable.
In 1994, Graham Freeman, an experienced Queensland
croc handler, died after a crocodile turned on him and
crushed his skull. More recently, and within the confines
of Irwin's own Australia Zoo at Beerwah on Queensland's
Sunshine Coast, a crocodile with the somewhat quaint
name of Graham – notorious for having bitten Irwin in 1992
– attacked zoo manager Wes Mannion in 2001. Mannion,
who was hospitalised for 12 days, needed 150 stitches
and staples inserted into his thigh.

After having been turned on by a croc while he was using
a technique that most in the industry believed safe,
Broome crocodile farmer Malcolm Douglas is unequivocal:
&quot;They're unpredictable, simple as that.&quot;

As for the imitators, the members of Florida's Conservation
Commission have a vivid reminder of the perils of that
approach. Last May, an alligator strayed onto the verge of
a public road in Polk County and, even though a licensed
trapper was only minutes away, an onlooker took it upon
himself to deal with the danger. He was lucky; his injuries
could have been a lot worse than the large flap of skin that
was left hanging from his left arm.

The imitation phenomenon has become such a problem,
says one veteran croc handler, that there is now a
concerted push among elements of the American legal
profession to organise a class action on behalf of Irwin
fans who have been bitten by snakes, alligators and other
dangerous animals. This is in spite of the fact that Irwin's
programs carry warnings not to imitate his conduct.

Says crocodile hunter John Lever, the Queenslander
dispatched to Hong Kong in November to catch a rogue
croc: &quot;There is a fair amount of ill-feeling among the US
alligator research fraternity towards Irwin over his animal
containment practices, and the impact of his actions on
the young and the easily impressionable. The same thing
is happening in Australia. A child of one of my own
crocodile park staffers was bitten by a snake, while trying
to 'do a Steve'.&quot;

Irwin may have powerful supporters – Queensland Premier
Peter Beattie's government nominated him for Australian of
the Year, while PM John Howard once described him as
&quot;one of Australia's great conservation icons&quot; – but, as far
as the wildlife and conservation fraternity is concerned,
opinion is polarised.

Lever, who runs the Koorana Crocodile Farm near
Rockhampton, and other Queensland Wildlife Parks
Association members have a code of practice that states:
&quot;Over-dramatisation and sensationalism of crocodile
behaviour has a negative impact on community perceptions
of crocodiles and is not to be undertaken. Park visitors
should not be presented with examples of inappropriate
behaviour that may be copied by some people.&quot;

So what does Irwin think? Inquiries by The Bulletin to his
Beerwah zoo complex – which began life more modestly
as the Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park when it was
run by Irwin's parents Bob and Lyn – were directed to The
Best Picture Show Company, producers of The Crocodile
Hunter TV series. Irwin, reportedly, had beaten a retreat
to his central Queensland property near St George.

The company's principal, Irwin's friend and TV director
John Stainton, says Irwin is not fielding any unsolicited
media queries. &quot;It has been an absolute tragedy, a media
beat-up,&quot; Stainton says. &quot;Unfortunately, it came at a time
that was very light-on for news. It has been a feeding
frenzy, absolutely irresponsible.&quot;

Stainton dismisses claims that Irwin's antics are
responsible for injuries to fans or imitators. &quot;There are
a million people into alligators in Florida,&quot; he says.
&quot;They've been jumping on animals for centuries, long
before we came [on the scene].&quot;

While Stainton says he is not aware of any injuries to
fans or imitators in Australia, &quot;these things happen. We
can't stop that, just as we can't stop road accidents. We
can't be big brother to the world. TV generally is right
out there. MTV's Wild Boys walk through crocodile-
infested swamps on stilts. They wanted to do it at
Steve's park, and we wouldn't let them. We constantly
include messages saying: 'Do not try to do this at home.' &quot;

There's a lot at stake for both men but for Irwin, who was
given a python for his sixth birthday and was catching
crocodiles under his father's supervision by the age of
nine, it has been a particularly heady journey. By the time
he'd reached adulthood, Irwin was catching rogue crocs
for a living under contract to the state government. Then
his father suggested he take a video camera along and
things were destined never to be the same.

When Stainton – who happened to be shooting an ad at
Australia Zoo one day during the early 1990s – saw some
of Irwin's footage, he realised he had a unique TV animal
on his hands. US cable operator Discovery Channel bought
the show in 1996 and it rapidly brought Irwin a level of
popularity well beyond his wildest dreams.

In 2002, when Irwin was the most noteworthy newcomer
on BRW's list of highest-earning Australian entertainers,
Irwin and Stainton were listed as having estimated gross
earnings of $16.3m for the year, based on the show being
screened in 130 countries and on Irwin's advertising
endorsements.

No wonder Irwin was quick to apologise to the president
of Discovery Network, which through its Animal Planet
subsidiary carries Irwin's programs to 200 million
subscribers. So far the network is standing by their man,
as is car manufacturer Toyota, for whom Irwin endorses
four-wheel-drive vehicles. When you consider the
$175,000 Irwin was paid for one day's filming for the
federal government's &quot;Quarantine Matters&quot; ad campaign,
it's clear that this income stream is crucial not just to Irwin
and Stainton but also to the 200-plus employees of
Australia Zoo.

Such a successful business operation needs to watch
more than just the crocs. Accordingly, The Best Picture
Show Company, which owns &quot;The Crocodile Hunter&quot; name,
foreshadowed legal action against northern Australia
identity &quot;Crocodile Mick&quot; Pitman, in an attempt to prevent
Pitman's long-term use of the description &quot;crocodile hunter&quot;.

But Pitman, who trained under the late, renowned Weipa
croc hunter &quot;German Jack&quot; in the early 1970s, isn't budging,
claiming his use of the description predates any claim to
copyright or trademark and that because the name is
technically a generic term in common use, it is therefore
not able to be registered.

While confirming his company's approaches to &quot;Crocodile
Mick&quot; Pitman, Stainton claimed it was &quot;a very friendly,
standard letter&quot; and a process the company has to go
through up to 200 times a year with various operations.
&quot;I wouldn't know whether or not 'crocodile hunter' is a
generic term,&quot; Stainton says. &quot;We are not interested in
pursuing the matter.&quot;

But the real domestic heat in the Crocodile Hunter's camp
emanates from Irwin's long-running philosophical brawl on
conservation issues with the advocates of sustainable
crocodile farm production. &quot;I believe sustainable use is
the greatest propaganda in wildlife conservation at the
moment,&quot; Irwin said in a recent interview.

Irwin has used his web site to mount what he calls his
so-called &quot;Millennium Resolution&quot; attack on crocodile
farming and other forms of sustainable animal management
programs. He claims credible and powerful players are
&quot;using the camouflage of science to make money out of
animals. So, whenever they're killing our animals and
calling it sustainable use, I'll fight it.&quot;

Noted crocodile researcher and Darwin crocodile park
operator Dr Grahame Webb is among those described by ...

Why was this posted to newsgroups that have NOTHING
to do with child abuse issues?

Child Protective Services is a CROCODILE bigger,
meaner and nastier than any that IRWIN has dealt with.

Politicians have been feeding this CROCODILE for
a long time hoping they get eaten last.

CPS violates human rights, Civil Rights, laws,
regulations and obligations they made contractually
when they accepted the FEDERAL money here in the USA.

They have been found to be in NONCOMPLIANCE with
numerous regulations designed to safeguard
families against their abuses.

A large portion of the US population has absolutely
no clue as to the LOW standard of evidence used,
how repugnant the mindset of caseworkers is,
the level of legal immunity they enjoy which
encourages them to outright LIE in court, and worse.

The entire Juvenile Court system in ILLINOIS has been
declared to be UNCONSTITUTIONAL by two separate
Federal Judges. One issued &quot;consent decree&quot; orders
to ILLINOIS over ten years ago, and ILLINOIS
Child Protection ignored the requirements to
improve certain spelled out functions.
The more recent Federal Judge, Rebecca Pallmeyer,
on the Dupuy case, outright ruled the IL Child
Protection system to be UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

Child REMOVAL has been said to be treading on THE
most important LIBERTY INTEREST, yet it is handled by
courts allowing gossip, innuendo, falsehood,
collusion, conflict of interest, and so many infractions
of rules LARGE and small that it deserves the
moniker KANGAROO COURT.

No jury of peers, no right to cross examine
information used against parents, innumerable
violations of regulations, law and Constitution
are all justified by &quot;&quot;The Good of the Child&quot;&quot; (sic).

Caseworkers know full well thet their dirty little
racket gets misused by kids being manipulative,
neighbors with a grudge, controlling grandparents
and the like. They actually play those UP, rather
than seeing the obvious and ending the BS.

After all, more cases justifies more budget and more
Federal grant money.

If they would stop removing the vast majority of their
cases where there is no true IMMINENT DANGER, which
is supposed to be the requirement, then they could
easily concentrate on the few REAL cases and still
LAY OFF most of their caseworkers who just work
to fabricate more cases by NIT PICKING.

The CURE is worse than the DISEASE.

This sick corrupt system is replicated in every state
in the USA, and oddly, the exact same types of
recurring ABUSES OF FAMILIES BY CASEWORKERS
have appeared in MANY MANY other countries.

Doctor Professor Sir Roy Meadows is the guy who
MANUFACTURED the Munchhausens by Proxy diagnosis,
in England. His research &quot;&quot;expertise&quot;&quot;, testimony
and professional materials have been used worldwide,
with his hands on thousands of British cases.
His second &quot;&quot;expertise&quot;&quot; was regarding SIDS deaths.

He was responsible directly or indirectly for the
destruction of THOUSANDS of families, sending
parents to prison and kids removed from their
parents forever.

Ignorant caseworkers whose idea of training is to
watch some made for TV movie depicting Munchausens,
have pretended expertise on Munchausens throughout
the USA.

But AH! Sir Roy has been discovered to have
been a giant FRAUD!
He's about to lose his license to practice medicine.
He shredded his research.
He has been caught at lies.
200-300 women sent to prison may be released in UK.
5,000 kids may be reunited with their innocent parents.
Parliament has gotten involved.

Several people have been asking if there is a way
to REMOVE his knighthood, since it was for his
supposedly GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO CHILD SAFETY. (sic)

In the last few years in the USA, the press seems
to have shifted away from their biased coverage
in favor of Child Protection agencies.

Several huge public cases glaringly reveal that
CPS agencies have done WORSE than the parents
that they so stridently second guess.

If a parent were to overlook some of the things
that CPS caseworkers have overlooked, they
would be in JAIL for child endangerment, marked
for failure to protect or even child abuse or neglect.

But government workers VERY rarely get held
accountable like that.

The tide is turning slowly, as more and more
people are catching onto the RACKET for profit
known as &quot;&quot;Child Protective Services&quot;&quot;.

Child Protection has become a 41 BILLION dollar INDUSTRY.

The ends it serves have not been the children for years.

Much like Eisenhowers comments about the
Industrial-Military complex becoming a true danger
to this country, the CHILD PROTECTION INDUSTRY
has become a 41 BILLION dollar &quot;&quot;cartel&quot;&quot;.

The crocodile you all should be worrying about
is not the one that Steve Irwin handles, but
the hundreds of caseworkers in your county that
depend on LIES, deception, fertive imaginations
and selectively released information.

For every one of those HORROR stories where CPS
supposedly comes to the rescue (afterwards?)
there are a HUNDRED kids removed from their homes
for piddly stuff, trivia EXAGGERATED to be DANGEROUS.

CPS wants you to believe that most of their cases
are like the one horror story, when the bulk of
their cases are considerably less EXCITING.
(And considerably less justify interference!)

The Child Protection industry is full of people
with no qualms about playing God with families,
based on falsehood, lies and attitude judgements.
The WORST crime to them is if you hate caseworkers.
Fortunately they are so DUMB that they might
even tell your Judge as if that was a chargeable crime.

Child Protection is the ultimate SOCIALISM.
(Second guessing what parents do in their home?)
(Even when NO CRIME has been committed.)

We never voted SOCIALISM in did we?

Stop believing their media spin about child abuse.

Stop believing that CPS would not mess with people
who are innocent. This BS serves them.

More and more people are finding out that CPS
is a cure worse than any disease.

Every child removal proveably causes harm.

Foster Care is proven to be dangerous.

Unnecessary ones are child abuse done in the
name of preventing child abuse.

Clutter in a household is NOT Constitutionally
acceptable &quot;&quot;Imminent Danger&quot;&quot;, no matter how
many welfare to work caseworkers say it is.

Stop feeding the REAL crocodile, the
CHILD PROTECTION INDUSTRY.

If you want to study the REAL CROCODILES,
check this behavior out!

These &quot;grand inquisitors&quot; running our modern
day witch hunts scurry like rats and claim
their FIFTH AMENDMENT when they have been
caught red handed (re NJ starvation case!)
but if a parent get all CONSTITUTIONAL these
same caseworkers act like that is a mental illness.

Constitutionalists are all insane to socialist caseworkers.
(By the way, caseworkers are NOT licensed Social Workers,
and they use &quot;Social Worker II&quot; which is a legalized FRAUD.)
(The numerical part tips off the crual hoax.)

Agency workers refuse to testify in starvation case By Mitch Lipka
Philadelphia Inquirer Trenton Bureau

CAMDEN NEW JERSEY - All 11 child-welfare workers involved in the
Collingswood starvation case claimed their Fifth Amendment right and
refused to testify when called before a grand jury yesterday, their
attorneys said.

None of the workers - eight of whom were suspended pending termination
hearings - are considered targets in the criminal investigation, the
lawyers said. But they said the workers could still face criminal
charges.

A ninth suspended worker has cooperated with the Camden County
Prosecutor's Office.

The lawyers said they did not know why prosecutors had subpoenaed
their clients.

&quot;I'm not comfortable at all with the prospect of a dedicated group of
workers being subjected to a criminal investigation,&quot; said Alan Zegas,
who represents four of the workers.

Because none was granted immunity from prosecution, none made
statements that could be used in the state's case against Raymond and
Vanessa Jackson, who are accused of starving four adopted sons. The
Jacksons, who have denied the allegations, are the only people charged
in the case.

Athough the Prosecutor's Office would not comment on the grand jury
proceedings, spokesman Bill Shralow did say: &quot;We had interacted with
the attorneys for these folks, and we had hoped to avoid bringing this
matter before a grand jury. It turned out to not be possible in this
case.&quot;

Prosecutor Vincent P. Sarubbi said in a statement: &quot;It should be noted
that the DYFS caseworker with the most direct involvement in this
matter cooperated with our investigation.&quot;

The investigation into both the Jacksons and the workers from the
state Division of Youth and Family Services continues, Shralow said.

&quot;We haven't closed the book, that's for sure,&quot; he said.

Bruce Jackson, the eldest of the four brothers, who range in age from
9 to 19, was found scavenging for food in a neighbor's trash in
October. That led police to the Jackson home, where the others were
found.

The four weighed a combined 136 pounds. All have since had significant
weight gains and are in foster care, authorities said.

Because the Jacksons also had foster children, DYFS workers had
visited the Collingswood home numerous times. They did not raise a red
flag over the health of the four adopted brothers, state officials
said. Child-welfare workers are required by law to report abuse and
neglect.

Representatives of the Communications Workers of America, the union
that covers seven suspended DYFS workers (two others are managers),
said the proceedings yesterday cast a pall over child-welfare workers
statewide. The criminal probe, they said, puts all DYFS workers at
risk of investigation for doing their job as they have been trained to
do.

Union leaders said the problems in the case had more to do with the
overall failure of DYFS than any worker. A worker at a demonstration
outside Camden's City Hall yesterday said her colleagues were deeply
concerned about the implications of the case.

&quot;It's a tragedy that we could be held criminally liable for the work
we do on a daily basis,&quot; said Denise Greene, an intake worker in DYFS'
Camden district office.

A union lawyer, Steven Weissman, asserted that prosecutors did not
have enough evidence to bring charges, and that the state did not even
have a case to fire them.

He contended that Gwendolyn Harris' resignation last month as
commissioner of the state Department of Human Services and Colleen
Maguire's resignation last week as the deputy commissioner overseeing
DYFS could change the outcome. Harris and Maguire had called for
firing the nine workers.

DYFS spokesman Andy Williams said he could not comment on personnel
matters.

About 200 DYFS workers from throughout the state picketed outside
Camden City Hall, where the grand jury proceedings were conducted,
during the lunch hour. The workers said they were there to show
support for their colleagues and to protest.

&quot;It will be a cold day in hell before we let them do this to our
members,&quot; Paul Alexander, assistant to the president of CWA Local
1034, said on the frigid steps of City Hall. &quot;What's taking place
today is a total travesty.&quot;

The ultimate rarity, a PSYCHOLOGIST who disses CPS for abuses.
Most of them are what is called Whores of the court.

&gt; http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=17129Tuesday ,
&gt; July 6, 1999

&gt; When the state becomes parent
&gt; By Mollie Martin

&gt; Five-year-old Deborah Hasson was pulled out of her kindergarten class and
&gt; taken to the nurse's office. Her ears were bright red, and the child
&gt; constantly complained of an intense pain. The school, required by law to
&gt; report anything of this nature, called Child Protective Services in
&gt; Fromberg, Mont.

&gt; CPS immediately concluded that the child was being abused at home, and so
&gt; that same hour picked her up from school and arranged to place her into a
&gt; foster-care situation. Deborah's mother, Grace, was horrified upon hearing
&gt; this and immediately produced a doctor's report, which explained that
&gt; Deborah had an ear infection. CPS chose to ignore this information and
&gt; insisted that Deborah was being abused. That was the fall of 1992. The
&gt; incident launched a violent custody battle that lasted for two and a half
&gt; years.

&gt; In 1995, the very night Deborah came home, Grace, a single mother, was
&gt; awakened at 2 a.m. by a harsh rapping at the door. Through the window she
&gt; could see four police officers and a social worker. In a state of panic she
&gt; called her friend Betty for help.

&gt; When Betty arrived she found a hysterical Grace handcuffed downstairs with a
&gt; police officer, and the male social worker upstairs with the three frantic,
&gt; young girls. The social worker said nothing more than that he had received
&gt; an anonymous report of abuse. Grace was arrested and the children were put
&gt; into foster homes. It was to be another four and a half years of bitter
&gt; court battles before Grace would clear her name and regain custody of her
&gt; daughters.

&gt; Too outrageous to be true? According to Dr. Marc Einhorn, a forensic
&gt; psychologist in Atlanta, Ga., these types of cases are prevalent throughout
&gt; child protection agency suits across the country. Einhorn has been involved
&gt; in several hundred cases across five states.

&gt; Einhorn said that Child Protective Services started in 1974 with the best of
&gt; intentions. Back then the definition of child abuse was narrow --
&gt; consisting of what reasonable people thought of as abuse. Over time,
&gt; however, that definition has broadened to include anything and everything
&gt; you can imagine -- whatever the state deems appropriate.

&gt; Many states now have very broad definitions of abuse. For example Utah's is
&gt; simply &quot;actual or non-accidental harm.&quot; This leaves grounds for the removal
&gt; of children up to the discretion of the social worker.

&gt; Einhorn recalls a case he worked on involving a family in Salt Lake City.
&gt; The family had four handicapped children, one being severely autistic. The
&gt; parents decided to apply for Social Security benefits for the autistic
&gt; child, and had him examined as a part of the standard application process.
&gt; The child protection agency of Utah got wind of the application and removed
&gt; all four children from their home. The grounds? The parents were exploiting
&gt; the handicapped children for money.

&gt; Matthew Hilton, the family's attorney commented, &quot;It's not the happiest area
&gt; to deal with ... these are real fights, some are black and white, but most
&gt; are in the gray.&quot; The guidelines are very vague. Juvenile court has its
&gt; own set of rules and laws, which are very informal. A lot of &quot;protections&quot;
&gt; are put up around the children.

&gt;&quot;The problem with the system is that Child Protective Services has quotas to
&gt; fill,&quot; Einhorn said. &quot;If a certain number of children are not removed from
&gt; their homes each year, the agency will lose status and funding -- causing
&gt; people to lose their jobs.&quot; He said that this causes children to be removed
&gt; on the flimsiest of terms.

&gt; Suzanne Shell, author of &quot;Profane Justice&quot; and president of the Family
&gt; Advocacy Center, affirms the idea of a quota. Shell said for the agency to
&gt; receive the amount of money it does, each social worker must complete a
&gt; certain number of cases. Therefore, social workers are pushed to remove
&gt; children from their homes on very questionable grounds. For example, Shell
&gt; cited several instances where children are removed for &quot;safety reasons&quot; --
&gt; the house was not clean, or instances of &quot;neglect&quot; because there was not
&gt; enough food in the refrigerator. The
&gt; reports neglected to show that it was spring cleaning day or it was the end
&gt; of the month when the food supply was low.

&gt; In response to the question of a quota, Patricia Montoya, commissioner for
&gt; Children, Youth and Families in Washington, D.C., said that &quot;child
&gt; protective services are the responsibility of the state. Funding is
&gt; provided by the federal government ... but the system itself is designed and
&gt; operated by the states.&quot; She went on to say &quot;the quota is not the goal --
&gt; the goal of CPS is to protect the child, make sure they are safe, and help
&gt; provide intervention. That's what the laws that are in place are all
&gt; about.&quot;

&gt; Dianne Warner-Kearney, a Utah child protection specialist, says, &quot;A quota
&gt; for children to be removed from their parents into foster care is absurd.
&gt; In fact, if at a multidisciplinary staffing which occurs within 24 hours
&gt; after the child is removed from the parents, should it be determined at that
&gt; point that there were no legal grounds for removal, the child would be
&gt; returned immediately.&quot;

&gt; Einhorn recalled many social workers he worked with in the past who left CPS
&gt; in sheer disgust of the corruption of the system. According to the
&gt; caseworkers, executives would &quot;sit back and lick their chops&quot; while deciding
&gt; which family to harass next. One caseworker quit after working with the
&gt; agency for 12 years. He said 95 percent of the children should never have
&gt; been removed from their homes.

&gt; Many of these &quot;atrocities&quot; are done in the name of &quot;the best interests of
&gt; the child,&quot; a term abundant throughout several states' CPS websites.
&gt; Einhorn said that ironically the agencies are seriously disturbing and
&gt; frightening the very children whose interests they are trying to protect.

&gt; Shell is very skeptical of whether the state should be given the benefit of
&gt; the doubt when the child's well being is at stake. She says that social
&gt; workers would not be willing to do their job without pay or give their lives
&gt; for the children, whereas parents would -- &quot;So, who has the child's best
&gt; interests in mind?&quot;

&gt; According to the FAC web site, &quot;Children in foster care numbered more than
&gt; 520,000 in March 1998, up from 340,000 in 1988.&quot; Montoya accounts for the
&gt; increase in foster care as &quot;a combination of different things
&gt; ... an increase in child abuse and neglect due to the added stresses of the
&gt; changing world we're in -- with better reporting systems we've brought the
&gt; issue to a higher limelight: kids are often self-reporting if they are being
&gt; abused or neglected at home ... family and neighbors have also started
&gt; reporting. ...&quot;

&gt; Pamela and Wilbur Gaston, of Mount Angel, Ore., have been fighting the
&gt; courts for nearly four years in an effort to regain custody of their
&gt; daughter, Melissa. Melissa was taken at the age of five on the false report
&gt; that her 72-year-old father had inappropriately &quot;touched&quot; her. The Gastons,
&gt; who have meticulously documented evidence refuting the charges, are outraged
&gt; at the lack of due process in the justice system. At a hearing in May 1998,
&gt; the Gastons claim that the presiding judge stated twice on the record that
&gt;&quot;I will not allow you to make an offer
&gt; of proof because facts are not an issue.&quot; *(See link at end of article)

&gt; Einhorn commented that in CPS cases, the accused are most often guilty until
&gt; proven innocent. &quot;There is a serious accountability problem in the Child
&gt; Protective Services ... CPS answers to no one.&quot;

&gt; According to a statement by the office of Oregon Attorney General Hardy
&gt; Meyers, &quot;claims against defendant judges, district attorneys and assistant
&gt; attorney generals are barred by judicial and prosecutorial immunity ... this
&gt; immunity applies even when a judge is accused of acting maliciously and
&gt; corruptly.&quot;

&gt;&quot;Parents have no legal right to stand in the court for the protection of
&gt; their children when the children are being knowingly abused in state
&gt; custody, even though their parental rights have not been terminated,&quot;
&gt; Gaston claims.

&gt; Betty Asplin of Laurel, Mont., who was the eyewitness in the Hasson case,
&gt; counsels people in these types of situations. &quot;This is allowed to go on
&gt; because people don't know their rights, if they understood the law this
&gt; would be over, it wouldn't happen ... people see the law at their door and
&gt; they assume they have to abide by whatever the officer says -- but they
&gt; don't.&quot;

&gt;&quot;This is a child stealing business,&quot; Asplin told WorldNetDaily. &quot;They don't
&gt; keep families together, they pull them apart.&quot; © 1999

&gt; CPS violates human rights, Civil Rights, laws,
&gt; regulations and obligations they made contractually
&gt; when they accepted the FEDERAL money here in the USA.

&gt; They have been found to be in NONCOMPLIANCE with
&gt; numerous regulations designed to safeguard
&gt; families against their abuses.

&gt; A large portion of the US population has absolutely
&gt; no clue as to the LOW standard of evidence used,
&gt; how repugnant the mindset of caseworkers is,
&gt; the level of legal immunity they enjoy which
&gt; encourages them to outright LIE in court, and worse.

&gt; The entire Juvenile Court system in ILLINOIS has been
&gt; declared to be UNCONSTITUTIONAL by two separate
&gt; Federal Judges. One issued &quot;consent decree&quot; orders
&gt; to ILLINOIS over ten years ago, and ILLINOIS
&gt; Child Protection ignored the requirements to
&gt; improve certain spelled out functions.

"/> Hey, Greg, the juvenile court system is a different branch and is not
associated with CPS.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The more recent Federal Judge, Rebecca Pallmeyer,
&gt; on the Dupuy case, outright ruled the IL Child
&gt; Protection system to be UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

&gt; Child REMOVAL has been said to be treading on THE
&gt; most important LIBERTY INTEREST, yet it is handled by
&gt; courts allowing gossip, innuendo, falsehood,
&gt; collusion, conflict of interest, and so many infractions
&gt; of rules LARGE and small that it deserves the
&gt; moniker KANGAROO COURT.

&gt; No jury of peers, no right to cross examine
&gt; information used against parents, innumerable
&gt; violations of regulations, law and Constitution
&gt; are all justified by &quot;&quot;The Good of the Child&quot;&quot; (sic).

&gt; Caseworkers know full well thet their dirty little
&gt; racket gets misused by kids being manipulative,
&gt; neighbors with a grudge, controlling grandparents
&gt; and the like. They actually play those UP, rather
&gt; than seeing the obvious and ending the BS.

&gt; After all, more cases justifies more budget and more
&gt; Federal grant money.

&gt; If they would stop removing the vast majority of their
&gt; cases where there is no true IMMINENT DANGER, which
&gt; is supposed to be the requirement, then they could
&gt; easily concentrate on the few REAL cases and still
&gt; LAY OFF most of their caseworkers who just work
&gt; to fabricate more cases by NIT PICKING.

"/> Isn't being confronted by a crocodile &quot;imminent danger&quot;? There are those who
beleive it is. But then so is boating, swimming, hiking and camping ...
all of which have attached 'imminent dangers'. How about families who
have moved into wilderness areas where all those creepy crawly things exist.
Is CPS to also determine a way of life?

&gt; The CURE is worse than the DISEASE.

&gt; This sick corrupt system is replicated in every state

&gt; recurring ABUSES OF FAMILIES BY CASEWORKERS

&gt; Doctor Professor Sir Roy Meadows is the guy who

&gt; with his hands on thousands of British cases.
&gt; His second &quot;&quot;expertise&quot;&quot; was regarding SIDS deaths.

&gt; He was responsible directly or indirectly for the
&gt; destruction of THOUSANDS of families, sending
&gt; parents to prison and kids removed from their
&gt; parents forever.

&gt; Ignorant caseworkers whose idea of training is to
&gt; watch some made for TV movie depicting Munchausens,
&gt; have pretended expertise on Munchausens throughout
&gt; the USA.

&gt; But AH! Sir Roy has been discovered to have
&gt; been a giant FRAUD!
&gt; He's about to lose his license to practice medicine.
&gt; He shredded his research.
&gt; He has been caught at lies.
&gt; 200-300 women sent to prison may be released in UK.
&gt; 5,000 kids may be reunited with their innocent parents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has anyone seen the followup interview with him? i have, wish he was my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dad

&gt;&gt;&gt;Where did you see it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;-Rubystars

&gt;&gt;sky news earlier, quite good, he said he didnt want to upset people but he
&gt;&gt;wanted to make sure his kids were croc savvy in his words

&gt;At one month old, the baby is not going to be *croc savvy* though.

&gt;Here's a link to the interview. The guy is nuts. You cannot be
&gt;in complete control of a wild animal. Look at Roy of Sigfried and
&gt;Roy who has been in *complete control* of his tigers.

&gt;http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/0104/03crocodile.html

&gt;He also claimed the danger posed by the crocodile was exaggerated.

&gt;&quot;It's all about perceived danger; I was in complete control,&quot; said
&gt;Irwin, flanked by his father, his wife and his 5-year-old daughter,
&gt;Bindi. &quot;People say, 'Well, what if you had fallen?' But for that to
&gt;take place a meteorite would have had to come out of the sky and hit
&gt;Australia at 6.6 on the Richter scale like in Iran.&quot;

And for another time (wow) we are in complete agreement. This man is a
moron and an unfit parent.
I'm sick to death of people treating wild animals like they are cute
little pets. Roy found out they aren't, and so did the &quot;bear guy&quot; who
got himself and his girlfriend eaten and an innocent bear shot due to
his bullcrap about bears just being cute little cuddles.

&gt;-----------------
&gt;If Irwin can't curb his stupid fucking attitude, it looks like the

&gt;&gt;My bet is that when they grow up they will say &quot;thanks for the wonderful and
&gt;&gt;exciting childhood&quot; to their parents.

&gt;--------------
&gt;Or they'll hate your fucking guts for your chaotic irresponsibility
&gt;in which they never felt really safe enough to grow!

If a tiger is raised from a kitten? I'm sorry I disagree. The
Melacourte was saving Roy alright, saving him for &quot;dessert&quot;.

Wild animals can NEVER be totally domesticated. They are always
dangerous. That is a fact of life. Babies/crocs don't mix,
Tigers/idiots in white spangly jumpsuits don't mix, Bears/stupid people
don't mix.

They are NOT pets. They are wild animals, period.
