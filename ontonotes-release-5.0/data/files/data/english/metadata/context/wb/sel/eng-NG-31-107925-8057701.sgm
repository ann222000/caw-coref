1. after the green flag, I think it was in turn 2-3, the field bottlenecked
and got into each other (i.e. wrecks happened).  Robbie goes out the the
left side of the screen in 2nd place.

2. I counted like 7 seconds on my DVR (1001, 1002, 1003, etc...), then we
see a caution on the top of the TV Screen.  At this point Robbie Gordon
is in the lead coming into frame around a corner, you can clearly see the
YELLOW FLAG out.  I am guessing Robbie did also and let off the throttle
and thats at least part of the reason the 59 lifted Robbie and spun him
around.  The 59 did not appear to slow down while having robbie's rear
whels off the ground and drove on around causing Robbie Gordon to spin
out, I am again guessing retaliation for Robbie getting into the back of
the 59 before or during the bottleneck wreck in turn 3.

3. Robbie is STUCK sideways and can not back up and several cars go around
him.  Robbie gets going again and believes that as all the announcers keep
telling us &quot;THE FIELD IS FROZEN AT THE TIME OF THE YELLOW FLAG.&quot;  Then the
other rule I had heard is where the cars were at the pass of the last
scoring loop.

4. You can hear the announcers talk about where Robbie Gordon should be as
Robbie is up behind the pace car at this point AFTER PASSING under
caution, and Robbie is NOT the lucky dog here so he should not have passed
the field unless NASCAR told him to.

5. The other announcer says It looks like Robbie is 2nd but the thing
keeps flipping, and he mentions the scoring loop screen that says Robbie
was 1st or 2nd at the caution.

6. Nascar decides Robbie was passed by all those cars while he was
sideways after being spun after the caution came out.  So they tell Robbie
to go back behind the 33 car, which is like 16th or something.

7. MEANWHILE Jeff Burton in the Holiday Inn 25 car is in the pits with the
engine powered off, up on jack and a crewmen is under the front corner
beating out the front nose.  Another crewmen is beating the rear deck lid
down.  The announcers say that Jeff is listed in 16th place.  The camera
shows Jeff hitting the engine start switches and you hear him re-firing the
car. They did not show Jeff Burton leave the pits, but the race results
have Jeff Burton listed as finishing in 10th spot.   HUH? WTF??

8. the race resumes under green white checkered.  I did not see a black
flag thrown on my tv for Robbie Gordon, although the announcers say it did.

9. Like we didn't know Robbie Gordon was gonna retaliate on the 59.
Kevin Harvick punts his teammate and virtually the same time Robbie punts
the 59.  Robbie never stops and finishes the race.  Albeit under a black
flag.  So Robbie Gordon  is listed in like 16th place which is finishing
on the tail end of the lead lap or on 73 out of 75 laps finished.

10.  Kevin Harvick is listed as the race winner.   Kevin H.  does a victory
burnout as does Robbie Gordon.  and the local bush guy does one as well.

11. Robbie says in his interview that he should have been 1/2 at time of
caution, he finished all the laps of the race.  He believes he won the
race and plans to appeal, then Robbie walks away.

Now this is a first that you have to maintain pace speed even under
caution, I knew it (minimum pace speed) was for green flag racing but I
have NEVER heard of this for yellow flag racing.  I went to Nascar's own
web site and can not find a copy of Nascar's rule book.

A. How in the hell did Jeff burton go from 16th to finishing 10th, and
jeff was in the pits for along period of time before the green white
checkered.  At the least he should have been treated like Robbie and goto
the tail end of the longest lead lap line.  And with a tore up race car
gains 6 spots in 2 laps???  HUH?????

B. Robbie has a point that nascar has set precedence before and not that
long ago in the Cup series this year had a caution (maybe competition),
and left people come in the pits and come back out and not loose their
place in the field.  I think it was the 20 or the 8's team that was
unhappy as they lost their strategy or position because of that.  The 20
or the 8 had stayed out and would have been ahead of those cars that
pitted but Nascar came up with that boneheaded rule.  Mike Helton had to
come on the tube and explain it.

C. I do not agree with robbie's actions during the caution, or
continuing under black flag.  But Robbie has been known in the past to
:liven things up&quot; which he did today.

D. I would imagine as Robbie is on CUP probation for infractions of the
Pepsi 400 at Daytona, he is in worse trouble now after what the did at the
end of the race.

E.  Robbie had qualified for the race tomorrow, but that may be in
question after his actions today.

F. on a personal note Robbie Gordon, never stop being your self buddy, you
make life interesting for the rest of us.

G. Nascar this is for you guys.....

You seem to forget who needs who.   You Nascar NEED the Drivers.  without
them there would be no NASCAR.  So you Nascar need to look at your rule
book, and stick to it and not make judgment calls that piss off us
viewers, and more importantly the drivers.  Cause one day Nascar, the
drivers will revolt and boycott you.   Then where will Nascar be????

just me .02 cents worth.

There is no way that the TV broadcast will be able to put the caution
indicator on the TV screen at the same instant that NASCAR threw the
yellow. There will be lag time between when NASCAR throws the yellow
and when the network will indicate that yellow has been thrown on the
screen. How long this lag time is we have no way of knowing so what you
saw on your screen doesn't necessarily indicate when the yellow
actually came out.

Remember it takes time to communicate to the flag people that the race
is under caution and it takes the flag people some time to get the flag
out and start waiving it.  If you see the yellow flag already being
waived by the flag person then it is a good bet that the actual yellow
has already happened at least a couple of seconds before the flag
started waiving.

no, I understood it just fine... you seem to have gotten stuck on the
part where Robbie Gordon was no longer being scored.

Regardless of whether NASCAR made a mistake in it's placement of Robby
after the caution, he ignored the black flag putting himself out of the
race.  Kevin Harvick won.... it's that simple.

Don't the rules include four or five laps of black flag before scoring

There is no point in dealing with &quot;what ifs&quot; or &quot;what should have
beens&quot;. &quot;What is&quot; is that NASCAR told Robby that they were going to stop
scoring him if he did not pull into the pits, he did not, and they
stopped scoring him... making Kevin Harvick the first driver being
scored to cross the start/finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there, I fixed it for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know what race you were watching. But it was clear as day to see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the yellow flag waving
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in front of Robby and Marcos as Robby gets spun under caution. Marcos
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should be fined for spinning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a competitor under caution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I watched the race where Kevin Harvick was the first car being scored to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cross the start-finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So, In other words. The rest of the race was far to difficult for you to
&gt;&gt;&gt;comprehend?

&gt;&gt;no, I understood it just fine... you seem to have gotten stuck on the part
&gt;&gt;where Robbie Gordon was no longer being scored.

&gt;&gt;Regardless of whether NASCAR made a mistake in it's placement of Robby
&gt;&gt;after the caution, he ignored the black flag putting himself out of the
&gt;&gt;race.  Kevin Harvick won.... it's that simple.

&gt; well you have the SIMPLE part right.

I have it all right... deal with it.

You're right.  I forgot about the NASCAR rule that says they can change

Didn't apply in this case.  That rule applies when a car is being
black-flagged for inspection (e.g. because it's smoking and might
be dropping oil).  It doesn't apply (fairly obviously) when the
scoring card has already been pulled and your crew chief has been
so notified by the NASCAR official.

I need a check here... didn't the black flag come out before they stopped

As I understand it, they told him (told his crew chief) that he
would not be scored if he didn't take his proper place in line
before the green flag.  I don't recall noticing if they showed
him the black flag at all under the yellow.  You are probably
correct that the only flag they showed was the black/white.

Julia Nascar should follow their own rules though and that's why they
catch so much heat, much of it rightly deserved I might add, for being
inconsistent.  Robby to my knowledge was not shown the black flag
during the yellow.  The rules state that a driver has 3 laps to answer
a  black flag, regardless of why its displayed before scoring stops.
Had they flown the black flag under yellow, and wait a couple of laps
under yellow for him to answer the flag under the rules prior to the
race then thats the rules and you must abide by them.  Had Robby
answered the black flag, an appeal would have been moot.  Ignoring the
black flag is one thing.  That I respect.  Punting Ambrose I
understand, but it ended any chance he had at an appeal, but he also
kept the guy who punted him from winning as well.  Both Ambrose and
Robby had plenty of reason to be in the penalty box, like not lifting
when the caution was out.  Frankly Robby likely got spun because he
did lift with the yellow out and Ambrose without nearly as much
experience as Robby was still racing and didn't have the experience to
drive that hard and see the yellow at the same time.  Not intentional,
but certainly it could have been avoidable contact.  Robby had a point
to when he asked what is to stop the second place car from spinning
the leader every time the caution comes out.  You can't maintain a
pace when you are turning around backwards.  Now whether Robby was
first or second didn't matter to me.  That could go either way and I
would suspect no one would have argued much either way.  Yet when you
send him back to what was it 13th, he had a beef.

When they won't follow their own rules as they are written pre race,
then Nascar deserves every comparison to WWE that can come their way.
It ain't over yet I have a feeling.

Had they flown the black flag under yellow, and wait a couple of laps
under yellow for him to answer the flag under the rules prior to the
race then thats the rules and you must abide by them.  Had Robby
answered the black flag, an appeal would have been moot.  Ignoring the
black flag is one thing.  That I respect.  Punting Ambrose I
understand, but it ended any chance he had at an appeal, but he also
kept the guy who punted him from winning as well.  Both Ambrose and
Robby had plenty of reason to be in the penalty box, like not lifting
when the caution was out.  Frankly Robby likely got spun because he
did lift with the yellow out and Ambrose without nearly as much
experience as Robby was still racing and didn't have the experience to
drive that hard and see the yellow at the same time.  Not intentional,
but certainly it could have been avoidable contact.  Robby had a point
to when he asked what is to stop the second place car from spinning
the leader every time the caution comes out.  You can't maintain a
pace when you are turning around backwards.  Now whether Robby was
first or second didn't matter to me.  That could go either way and I
would suspect no one would have argued much either way.  Yet when you
send him back to what was it 13th, he had a beef.

When they won't follow their own rules as they are written pre race,
then Nascar deserves every comparison to WWE that can come their way.
It ain't over yet I have a feeling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there, I fixed it for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know what race you were watching. But it was clear as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day to see the yellow flag waving
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of Robby and Marcos as Robby gets spun under caution.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marcos should be fined for spinning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a competitor under caution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I watched the race where Kevin Harvick was the first car being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scored to cross the start-finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, In other words. The rest of the race was far to difficult for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you to comprehend?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no, I understood it just fine... you seem to have gotten stuck on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the part where Robbie Gordon was no longer being scored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regardless of whether NASCAR made a mistake in it's placement of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Robby after the caution, he ignored the black flag putting himself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out of the race.  Kevin Harvick won.... it's that simple.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't the rules include four or five laps of black flag before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scoring stops?  With only two laps left, Gordon was well under that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; number.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no point in dealing with &quot;what ifs&quot; or &quot;what should have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beens&quot;. &quot;What is&quot; is that NASCAR told Robby that they were going to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stop scoring him if he did not pull into the pits, he did not, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they stopped scoring him... making Kevin Harvick the first driver
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being scored to cross the start/finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're right.  I forgot about the NASCAR rule that says they can
&gt;&gt;&gt; change the rules anytime they want.  Rules don't matter; they just
&gt;&gt;&gt; get in the way.  So the four lap black flag rule doesn't matter.

&gt;&gt; No it doesn't matter in this case (as McCoy explained to you)...  but
&gt;&gt; why let the facts stand in the way of your ranting?

&gt; Yeah, you're right.  There's no sense in having rules if the officials
&gt; aren't going to follow them anyway.
">

damn, you're dense... YOU are the one that has that rule wrong, not
NASCAR.  Again, see McCoy's post(s).  He explains it clearly enough that
even you should be able to understand it.

Sure they do.  Whether he was told by radio or not, he has 3 laps
according to rule to answer the flag.  The rule didn't say just in
case of a smoker.  It said 3 laps before they would stop scoring.  It
made no mention of radio communication. That gives teams time to make
their point.  Many is the time a rule infraction has been argued in
those 3 laps.  IF that was the rule prior to the race, which it has
been for many years, you don't just change it because Robby was smart
enough to know the rule.  IF it were changed prior to the race, then
Id be interested to know when it was changed.  It would be very
typical and very wrong of Nascar to have changed it during that race.
The rule was made before the GWC though and frankly its one of those
things Nascar probably didn't think about.

Stopping to score him is something he could challenge later if the
laps had been completed.  Going to 13th makes it all moot.  It was a
race in which he was not running for points so what good does
finishing tenth do?  The only thing I might have done different than
Robby, and frankly its probably what got him suspended from the Cup
race is punting Ambrose.  Make a clean pass, cross the line first,
then argue later.  NO I don't think that Nascar can do anything it
wants, just because its their game.  They have a legal and moral
obligation to treat everyone fairly within the guidelines set up prior
to the event.  Just because Nascar has always gotten away with it
doesn't mean its either legal or right.  Nascar history is full of
things that wouldn't stand a legal test today.

Sad thing is Robby's team is on its last legs anyway.  They are doing
everything they can to force 4 car teams to keep the old boy network
down to just a few so they don't have to deal with the owner driver.
They are succeeding too and its Nascars loss.

BTW How is Casey?  Made any commercial for him yet???

NASCAR has written rules that they choose to use as a fallback when its
convenient.  Rationalizing their actions in this case doesn't change
their rules.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there, I fixed it for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know what race you were watching. But it was clear as day
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see the yellow flag waving
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of Robby and Marcos as Robby gets spun under caution.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marcos should be fined for spinning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a competitor under caution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I watched the race where Kevin Harvick was the first car being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scored to cross the start-finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, In other words. The rest of the race was far to difficult for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to comprehend?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no, I understood it just fine... you seem to have gotten stuck on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part where Robbie Gordon was no longer being scored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regardless of whether NASCAR made a mistake in it's placement of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Robby
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after the caution, he ignored the black flag putting himself out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the race.  Kevin Harvick won.... it's that simple.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't the rules include four or five laps of black flag before scoring
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stops?  With only two laps left, Gordon was well under that number.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no point in dealing with &quot;what ifs&quot; or &quot;what should have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beens&quot;. &quot;What is&quot; is that NASCAR told Robby that they were going to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scoring him if he did not pull into the pits, he did not, and they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stopped scoring him... making Kevin Harvick the first driver being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scored to cross the start/finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Julia Nascar should follow their own rules though and that's why they
&gt;&gt;&gt; catch so much heat, much of it rightly deserved I might add, for being
&gt;&gt;&gt; inconsistent.  Robby to my knowledge was not shown the black flag
&gt;&gt;&gt; during the yellow.  The rules state that a driver has 3 laps to answer
&gt;&gt;&gt; a  black flag, regardless of why its displayed before scoring stops.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Had they flown the black flag under yellow, and wait a couple of laps
&gt;&gt;&gt; under yellow for him to answer the flag under the rules prior to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; race then thats the rules and you must abide by them.  Had Robby
&gt;&gt;&gt; answered the black flag, an appeal would have been moot.  Ignoring the
&gt;&gt;&gt; black flag is one thing.  That I respect.  Punting Ambrose I
&gt;&gt;&gt; understand, but it ended any chance he had at an appeal, but he also
&gt;&gt;&gt; kept the guy who punted him from winning as well.  Both Ambrose and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Robby had plenty of reason to be in the penalty box, like not lifting
&gt;&gt;&gt; when the caution was out.  Frankly Robby likely got spun because he
&gt;&gt;&gt; did lift with the yellow out and Ambrose without nearly as much
&gt;&gt;&gt; experience as Robby was still racing and didn't have the experience to
&gt;&gt;&gt; drive that hard and see the yellow at the same time.  Not intentional,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but certainly it could have been avoidable contact.  Robby had a point
&gt;&gt;&gt; to when he asked what is to stop the second place car from spinning
&gt;&gt;&gt; the leader every time the caution comes out.  You can't maintain a
&gt;&gt;&gt; pace when you are turning around backwards.  Now whether Robby was
&gt;&gt;&gt; first or second didn't matter to me.  That could go either way and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; would suspect no one would have argued much either way.  Yet when you

You *are* dense.  Again, the black flag rule does not apply if NASCAR
percieves an immediate danger on the track, which they did.

No, they don't.  They showed the black flag to reiterate their point.
When NASCAR percieves an immediate danger or threat on the track they
are entitled to do whatever they deem necessary to correct the
situation, and they did just that.

Whether he was told by radio or not, he has 3 laps

&gt; according to rule to answer the flag.  The rule didn't say just in
&gt; case of a smoker.  It said 3 laps before they would stop scoring.  It
&gt; made no mention of radio communication. That gives teams time to make
&gt; their point.  Many is the time a rule infraction has been argued in
&gt; those 3 laps.  IF that was the rule prior to the race, which it has
&gt; been for many years, you don't just change it because Robby was smart
&gt; enough to know the rule.  IF it were changed prior to the race, then
&gt; Id be interested to know when it was changed.  It would be very
&gt; typical and very wrong of Nascar to have changed it during that race.
&gt; The rule was made before the GWC though and frankly its one of those
&gt; things Nascar probably didn't think about.

&gt; Stopping to score him is something he could challenge later if the
&gt; laps had been completed.  Going to 13th makes it all moot.  It was a
&gt; race in which he was not running for points so what good does
&gt; finishing tenth do?  The only thing I might have done different than
&gt; Robby, and frankly its probably what got him suspended from the Cup
&gt; race is punting Ambrose.  Make a clean pass, cross the line first,
&gt; then argue later.  NO I don't think that Nascar can do anything it
&gt; wants, just because its their game.  They have a legal and moral
&gt; obligation to treat everyone fairly within the guidelines set up prior
&gt; to the event.  Just because Nascar has always gotten away with it
&gt; doesn't mean its either legal or right.  Nascar history is full of
&gt; things that wouldn't stand a legal test today.

&gt; Sad thing is Robby's team is on its last legs anyway.  They are doing
&gt; everything they can to force 4 car teams to keep the old boy network
&gt; down to just a few so they don't have to deal with the owner driver.
&gt; They are succeeding too and its Nascars loss.

&gt; BTW How is Casey?  Made any commercial for him yet???

&quot;Immediate danger&quot;?  Don't make me laugh.  What immediate danger?

Was &quot;Robby Gordon winning a race&quot; immediate danger?  There was no danger
except that Ambrose wsa still on the track.

Black flag someone?  Yeah, Ambrose.

Gordon was just plain screwed by NASCAR.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stops?  With only two laps left, Gordon was well under that number.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no point in dealing with &quot;what ifs&quot; or &quot;what should have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beens&quot;. &quot;What is&quot; is that NASCAR told Robby that they were going
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to stop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scoring him if he did not pull into the pits, he did not, and they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stopped scoring him... making Kevin Harvick the first driver being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scored to cross the start/finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julia Nascar should follow their own rules though and that's why they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; catch so much heat, much of it rightly deserved I might add, for being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inconsistent.  Robby to my knowledge was not shown the black flag
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during the yellow.  The rules state that a driver has 3 laps to answer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a  black flag, regardless of why its displayed before scoring stops.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Had they flown the black flag under yellow, and wait a couple of laps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under yellow for him to answer the flag under the rules prior to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; race then thats the rules and you must abide by them.  Had Robby
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answered the black flag, an appeal would have been moot.  Ignoring the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; black flag is one thing.  That I respect.  Punting Ambrose I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand, but it ended any chance he had at an appeal, but he also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kept the guy who punted him from winning as well.  Both Ambrose and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Robby had plenty of reason to be in the penalty box, like not lifting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when the caution was out.  Frankly Robby likely got spun because he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did lift with the yellow out and Ambrose without nearly as much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experience as Robby was still racing and didn't have the experience to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drive that hard and see the yellow at the same time.  Not intentional,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but certainly it could have been avoidable contact.  Robby had a point
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to when he asked what is to stop the second place car from spinning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the leader every time the caution comes out.  You can't maintain a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pace when you are turning around backwards.  Now whether Robby was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first or second didn't matter to me.  That could go either way and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would suspect no one would have argued much either way.  Yet when you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; send him back to what was it 13th, he had a beef.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When they won't follow their own rules as they are written pre race,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then Nascar deserves every comparison to WWE that can come their way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It ain't over yet I have a feeling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Under these circumstances NASCAR was under no obligation to even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show him the black flag.  NASCAR communicated to Robby over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio that he needed to come into the pits.  He acknowledged their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; request but decided to ignore it.  He was also aware of that if he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't come in that they would stop scoring him.  He chose that path
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; along with the consequences that come along with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And you call ME dense?  He has several laps to honor the black flag.
&gt;&gt;&gt; NASCAR gave him zero.

&gt;&gt; You *are* dense.  Again, the black flag rule does not apply if NASCAR
&gt;&gt; percieves an immediate danger on the track, which they did.

&gt; Again, NASCAR isn't following their own black flag rules.

&gt; What &quot;immediate danger&quot;?
">

you can't possibly be that moronic.... well, yeah, you are..... they saw
Robby's extreme defiance and rage as an immediate danger to other
drivers on the track (whether or not you agree is completely irrelevant)
Under those circumstances they have *always* reserved the right to take
whatever steps necessary to resolve the issue immediately.

BTW ~ Go ahead and quote that &quot;black flag rule&quot; that you are so sure
that they are violating... unless you can do that, you're just talking
out your ass ~ AGAIN.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there, I fixed it for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know what race you were watching. But it was clear as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see the yellow flag waving
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of Robby and Marcos as Robby gets spun under caution.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marcos should be fined for spinning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a competitor under caution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I watched the race where Kevin Harvick was the first car being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scored to cross the start-finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, In other words. The rest of the race was far to difficult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to comprehend?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no, I understood it just fine... you seem to have gotten stuck
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part where Robbie Gordon was no longer being scored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regardless of whether NASCAR made a mistake in it's placement of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Robby
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after the caution, he ignored the black flag putting himself out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the race.  Kevin Harvick won.... it's that simple.

Exactly!  According to some folks as soon as RG takes to the track it's
an immediate danger...and the black flag should be presented.

No one can Julia because Nascar will not publish the rules so ordinary
fans can read them for themselves. That reserved right also gives them
the right to make up the rules as they go along.  That only creates a
level of distrust in that what rules are they trying to hide. Trust me
there have been plenty of drivers out there far hotter than Robby and
never got a black flag.  Drivers have done far worse than Robby ever
did and never got the black flag.  I especially in some well known car
numbers where punting someone for the win was no issue what so ever.
Who ever was in the way was just in the wall usually finishing well
back.  The only immediate danger was there was a danger of Nascar
being embarrassed because they didn't treat Robby fairly.

Had they punished them both for not lifting when the yellow came out,
then fine. Open wheelers have a long history of lifting when the
yellow flies and for the most part they do it right away.  Nascar
doesn't and as such until someone is sent to the back for not lifting,
they are going to keep racing.   Ambrose was going to get away with a
win, that is till Robby fixed it.  Anyone see any irony in the fact
that wasn't it Harvick punting someone that brought the yellow out in
the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stopped scoring him... making Kevin Harvick the first driver being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scored to cross the start/finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julia Nascar should follow their own rules though and that's why they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; catch so much heat, much of it rightly deserved I might add, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inconsistent.  Robby to my knowledge was not shown the black flag
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during the yellow.  The rules state that a driver has 3 laps to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a  black flag, regardless of why its displayed before scoring stops.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Had they flown the black flag under yellow, and wait a couple of laps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under yellow for him to answer the flag under the rules prior to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; race then thats the rules and you must abide by them.  Had Robby
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answered the black flag, an appeal would have been moot.  Ignoring
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; black flag is one thing.  That I respect.  Punting Ambrose I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand, but it ended any chance he had at an appeal, but he also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kept the guy who punted him from winning as well.  Both Ambrose and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Robby had plenty of reason to be in the penalty box, like not lifting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when the caution was out.  Frankly Robby likely got spun because he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did lift with the yellow out and Ambrose without nearly as much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experience as Robby was still racing and didn't have the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experience to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drive that hard and see the yellow at the same time.  Not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intentional,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but certainly it could have been avoidable contact.  Robby had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to when he asked what is to stop the second place car from spinning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the leader every time the caution comes out.  You can't maintain a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pace when you are turning around backwards.  Now whether Robby was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first or second didn't matter to me.  That could go either way and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would suspect no one would have argued much either way.  Yet when you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; send him back to what was it 13th, he had a beef.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When they won't follow their own rules as they are written pre race,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then Nascar deserves every comparison to WWE that can come their way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It ain't over yet I have a feeling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Under these circumstances NASCAR was under no obligation to even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show him the black flag.  NASCAR communicated to Robby over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio that he needed to come into the pits.  He acknowledged their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; request but decided to ignore it.  He was also aware of that if he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't come in that they would stop scoring him.  He chose that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; path along with the consequences that come along with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And you call ME dense?  He has several laps to honor the black flag.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NASCAR gave him zero.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You *are* dense.  Again, the black flag rule does not apply if NASCAR
&gt;&gt;&gt; percieves an immediate danger on the track, which they did.

&gt;&gt; Again, NASCAR isn't following their own black flag rules.

&gt;&gt; What &quot;immediate danger&quot;?

&gt; Exactly!  According to some folks as soon as RG takes to the track it's
&gt; an immediate danger...and the black flag should be presented.

What &quot;immediate danger&quot;?  RG just got punted.  Wouldn't Ambrose be the
immediate danger?  Why was Gordon black flagged for getting spun out of
the lead?  if it were Gordon that spun Ambrose out of the lead, NASCAR
MIGHT have a slight reason for calling him in.  But not Gordon.

The only immediate danger seems to be the possibility of raising your IQ
above 70.  You seem to have turned into a complete imbecile, maybe
blinded by your personal haterd for RG?  Maybe too much NASCAR Kool-Aid?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there, I fixed it for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know what race you were watching. But it was clear as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;day
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to see the yellow flag waving
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in front of Robby and Marcos as Robby gets spun under caution.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marcos should be fined for spinning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a competitor under caution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I watched the race where Kevin Harvick was the first car being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scored to cross the start-finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, In other words. The rest of the race was far to difficult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to comprehend?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no, I understood it just fine... you seem to have gotten stuck
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;part where Robbie Gordon was no longer being scored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Regardless of whether NASCAR made a mistake in it's placement of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Robby
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;after the caution, he ignored the black flag putting himself out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the race.  Kevin Harvick won.... it's that simple.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't the rules include four or five laps of black flag before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scoring
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stops?  With only two laps left, Gordon was well under that number.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no point in dealing with &quot;what ifs&quot; or &quot;what should have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beens&quot;. &quot;What is&quot; is that NASCAR told Robby that they were going
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to stop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scoring him if he did not pull into the pits, he did not, and they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stopped scoring him... making Kevin Harvick the first driver being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scored to cross the start/finish line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Julia Nascar should follow their own rules though and that's why they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;catch so much heat, much of it rightly deserved I might add, for being

&gt; No one can Julia because Nascar will not publish the rules so ordinary
&gt; fans can read them for themselves. That reserved right also gives them
&gt; the right to make up the rules as they go along.  That only creates a
&gt; level of distrust in that what rules are they trying to hide.
">

Every team and driver has them, and Robby was carrying another copy of
them when he left the trailer on Saturday... and after reviewing them he
admitted that he did things wrong according to the rules.  In fact, I
have never seen a driver or team that was able to point to a rule and
specifically show how NASCAR has contradicted them.

Trust me

I submit direct posts to point out the absolute intelligence and logic
of all NASCAR rules, regulations and enforcements.

I'm NEVER CYNICAL.  AND I NEVER LOSE MY SENSE OF HUMOR.  Its always
entertaining to read the posts of some of the most intelligent people in
the world posting on this newsgroup.  If you doubt their intelligence
they will both remind you how blindingly smart they are and let others
know their position in the pecking order.

My tongue remains firmly planted in my cheek.  Where it belongs when
posting to this group.

Its the only logical approach.  (TFPIC)

What part of it being *NASCAR's* call do you not understand?!?!  It's
not your call, it's not my call and IT'S NOT ROBBY'S call either.  The
determination on whether a driver is acting in a way that could be
construed as dangerous belongs solely to NASCAR.

This isn't about Robby, personally.  This is about whether the
appropriate consequences were given to a driver who failed to comply
with a NASCAR directive. I believe that they were.  He was warned about
what the consequences would be yet he chose to ignore the directive
anyway, so NASCAR properly followed through with the consequences.  I'm
not going to give him a pass simply because I like him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can't possibly be that moronic.... well, yeah, you are.....
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they saw Robby's extreme defiance and rage as an immediate danger
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to other drivers on the track (whether or not you agree is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completely irrelevant) Under those circumstances they have *always*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reserved the right to take whatever steps necessary to resolve the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue immediately.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW ~ Go ahead and quote that &quot;black flag rule&quot; that you are so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure that they are violating... unless you can do that, you're just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talking out your ass ~ AGAIN.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What &quot;immediate danger&quot;?  RG just got punted.  Wouldn't Ambrose be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the immediate danger?  Why was Gordon black flagged for getting spun
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out of the lead?  if it were Gordon that spun Ambrose out of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lead, NASCAR MIGHT have a slight reason for calling him in.  But not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gordon.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As I said, it is not for you to determine whether Robby was a danger,
&gt;&gt;&gt; it was up to NASCAR and they felt that he was.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's really dangerous.

&gt;&gt; http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/7099392?CMP=OTC-K9B140813162&amp;AT...;

&gt; What part of it being *NASCAR's* call do you not understand?!?!  It's
&gt; not your call, it's not my call and IT'S NOT ROBBY'S call either.  The
&gt; determination on whether a driver is acting in a way that could be
&gt; construed as dangerous belongs solely to NASCAR.

Just what I said.  NASCAR makes up the rules as they go along.

Kinda takes you a while to figure out things, eh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only immediate danger seems to be the possibility of raising

&gt;&gt;&gt; well, that theory is shot to hell because I don't hate Robby, in fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; I really like him.  I had quite a long conversation with him at his
&gt;&gt;&gt; trailer a few years back in Dover after the place cleared out
&gt;&gt;&gt; following the Busch race.  He's a real decent guy.

&gt;&gt; Wow, how do you treat your enemies?  CIBFH.

&gt; This isn't about Robby, personally.  This is about whether the
&gt; appropriate consequences were given to a driver who failed to comply
&gt; with a NASCAR directive. I believe that they were.  He was warned about
&gt; what the consequences would be yet he chose to ignore the directive
&gt; anyway, so NASCAR properly followed through with the consequences.  I'm
&gt; not going to give him a pass simply because I like him.

Doesn't matter if you like him or not.  Ambrose deserved to be taken off
the track.  Gordon won the race.  NASCAR took it away.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there, I fixed it for you.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know what race you were watching. But it was clear as
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;day
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to see the yellow flag waving
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in front of Robby and Marcos as Robby gets spun under caution.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marcos should be fined for spinning
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a competitor under caution.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I watched the race where Kevin Harvick was the first car being
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scored to cross the start-finish line.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, In other words. The rest of the race was far to difficult
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for you
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to comprehend?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no, I understood it just fine... you seem to have gotten stuck
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;part where Robbie Gordon was no longer being scored.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Regardless of whether NASCAR made a mistake in it's placement of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Robby
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;after the caution, he ignored the black flag putting himself out of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the race.  Kevin Harvick won.... it's that simple.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't the rules include four or five laps of black flag before
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scoring
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stops?  With only two laps left, Gordon was well under that number.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no point in dealing with &quot;what ifs&quot; or &quot;what should have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beens&quot;. &quot;What is&quot; is that NASCAR told Robby that they were going
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to stop
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scoring him if he did not pull into the pits, he did not, and they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stopped scoring him... making Kevin Harvick the first driver being
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scored to cross the start/finish line.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Julia Nascar should follow their own rules though and that's why they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;catch so much heat, much of it rightly deserved I might add, for being
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inconsistent.  Robby to my knowledge was not shown the black flag
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;during the yellow.  The rules state that a driver has 3 laps to answer
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a  black flag, regardless of why its displayed before scoring stops.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Had they flown the black flag under yellow, and wait a couple of laps
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;under yellow for him to answer the flag under the rules prior to the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;race then thats the rules and you must abide by them.  Had Robby
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;answered the black flag, an appeal would have been moot.  Ignoring the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;black flag is one thing.  That I respect.  Punting Ambrose I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;understand, but it ended any chance he had at an appeal, but he also
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;kept the guy who punted him from winning as well.  Both Ambrose and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Robby had plenty of reason to be in the penalty box, like not lifting
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;when the caution was out.  Frankly Robby likely got spun because he
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;did lift with the yellow out and Ambrose without nearly as much
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;experience as Robby was still racing and didn't have the experience to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;drive that hard and see the yellow at the same time.  Not intentional,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but certainly it could have been avoidable contact.  Robby had a point
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to when he asked what is to stop the second place car from spinning
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the leader every time the caution comes out.  You can't maintain a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pace when you are turning around backwards.  Now whether Robby was
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;first or second didn't matter to me.  That could go either way and I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would suspect no one would have argued much either way.  Yet when you
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;send him back to what was it 13th, he had a beef.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When they won't follow their own rules as they are written pre race,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;then Nascar deserves every comparison to WWE that can come their way.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It ain't over yet I have a feeling.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Under these circumstances NASCAR was under no obligation to even
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;show him the black flag.  NASCAR communicated to Robby over the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;radio that he needed to come into the pits.  He acknowledged their
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;request but decided to ignore it.  He was also aware of that if he
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't come in that they would stop scoring him.  He chose that path
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;along with the consequences that come along with it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And you call ME dense?  He has several laps to honor the black flag.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NASCAR gave him zero.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You *are* dense.  Again, the black flag rule does not apply if NASCAR
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;percieves an immediate danger on the track, which they did.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Again, NASCAR isn't following their own black flag rules.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What &quot;immediate danger&quot;?

&gt; &gt;&gt;you can't possibly be that moronic.... well, yeah, you are..... they saw
&gt; &gt;&gt;Robby's extreme defiance and rage as an immediate danger to other
&gt; &gt;&gt;drivers on the track (whether or not you agree is completely irrelevant)
&gt; &gt;&gt;Under those circumstances they have *always* reserved the right to take
&gt; &gt;&gt;whatever steps necessary to resolve the issue immediately.

&gt; &gt;&gt;BTW ~ Go ahead and quote that &quot;black flag rule&quot; that you are so sure
&gt; &gt;&gt;that they are violating... unless you can do that, you're just talking
&gt; &gt;&gt;out your ass ~ AGAIN.

&gt; &gt; No one can Julia because Nascar will not publish the rules so ordinary
&gt; &gt; fans can read them for themselves. That reserved right also gives them
&gt; &gt; the right to make up the rules as they go along.  That only creates a
&gt; &gt; level of distrust in that what rules are they trying to hide.

&gt; Every team and driver has them, and Robby was carrying another copy of
&gt; them when he left the trailer on Saturday... and after reviewing them he
&gt; admitted that he did things wrong according to the rules.  In fact, I
&gt; have never seen a driver or team that was able to point to a rule and
&gt; specifically show how NASCAR has contradicted them.

&gt; Trust me

&gt; &gt; there have been plenty of drivers out there far hotter than Robby and
&gt; &gt; never got a black flag.  Drivers have done far worse than Robby ever
&gt; &gt; did and never got the black flag.

&gt; and there have been plenty of drivers that have done far less and were
&gt; asked to come to pit road and they complied without question... and
&gt; there have been those that were parked without ever having to be shown
&gt; the black flag.  In this case, the black flag was a courtesey not a
&gt; requirement.
">

Yes but it doesn't mean they were fairly treated.  It could just as
easily mean they were more afraid of Nascar than they were of speaking
out for what they felt was rightly theirs.  The Nascar template speech
is no idle threat.  Its been done before.  Remember the Talladega
strike?  They were threatened with a lifetime ban.  Yet after the race
a few were reinstated.  Hmm I suspect they figured that could use them
to make some money.  IIRC someone that is now known more often than
not as the King and used to drive a 43 car, was banned.  After a short
time they figured the cash was worth letting him back in.  One of the
Flock brothers never got to race again, something today that would
stand even a hint of a court test.  Stewart got the same threat
earlier this year with his WWE comparison.

Yes drivers get the copies, but Nascar is noted for EIRI which I
strongly suspect is what they used to get Robby. If they follow the
rules so closely, why don't they let me and you and anyone else
interested read them for themselves?   I wonder if it was Robin
Pemberton that made the decisions with regards to Robby.  Hmm one of
the biggest cheaters in the history of Nascar trying to uphold the
intergity of the sport.  Robby shouldn't have punted Ambrose, but he
should have also had the right to contest the race results and give
his full side of the story.  Then when emotions have calmed a fair and
just decision could have been reached by someone independent of
Nascar.    It would provide something that Nascar currently doesn't
have, and thats an appearance of fairness.  Even if it was totally on
the up and up, the way it is handled now gives the appearance of
manipulation.

BTW I was in the pits at a CART race years back.  Robby was nothing
but a nice guy off track.  Lots of people hanging around, many of them
ladies that could start a camp fire by just walking by.  The guy was a
babe magnet.
