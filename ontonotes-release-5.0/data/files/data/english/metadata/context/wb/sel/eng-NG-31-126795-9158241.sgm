RTI Activist seriously beaten up by Govt. Official at Konark of Puri
district.

Dear friends

Mr. N.A. Sah Ansari, an RTI Activist working in Puri district of Oissa was
seriously beaten up by Mr. Ajay Kumar Seth, VAW, GOP Block of  Puri district

While Mr. Ansari was on his way back from  Ansara village of Gop Block to
Konark, he was forcibly halted  by Mr. Mr. Ajaya Seth on the middle of the
road.  Without telling anything, he started rebuking him  with slang
language  that &quot; If I am fined  by Information Commission, I will murder
you.&quot; He also went on abusing Mr. Ansari &quot; You bloody Muslim, I will drive
you from this village&quot; so on.  During that time, he strangulated and put him
on the floor. He also thrashed and kicked him out of the place. In the
meantime, Mr. Ansari has filed  an FIR in Konark local Police station. But
it is a matter of regret that  the  Police has not taken any step in this
regard.

As I know, Mr. Ansari is one of the leading activists of the state involved
in spearheading campaign for effective implementation of  RTI Act in Orissa.
He has been instrumental in educating the people to  check corruption and
maintaining transparency in Govt. work in Gop Block of Puri district.. His
activism has invited the wrath of the unscrupulous contractor and Govt.
official in the area. . His constant endeavor has resulted in checking
corruption and State Information Commission imposing fine up to Rs 25,000/-
to a Govt. Official in that area.

So,  I do request all of you to  write a letter to the Collector and SP of
Puri to take  legal action against the culprit.

Thanking you
Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs:

Happy Dussehara to all!!!

It is indeed a matter of shame. However, before making any comments it would
be pertinent to confirm that the accused is a PIO. If that be the case and
no action has been taken on the FIR a formal notice must be sent to the SP
or otherwise a complaint case may be filed with the concerned magistrate.

Could we have more factual information on the whole episode.

Best regards,

Sreejit Mohanty
