It's time for all Americans to join anti-war movement

Two more years. Will we make it? Two years from today, on Jan. 20, 2009, the
"long national nightmare" of the Bush administration finally will come to an
end - and not a moment too soon. It's going to be a long and harrowing ride
for this nation and the world for the next 731 days as the Bush/Cheney White
House junta proves the adage that rats are at their most dangerous when
cornered. One can only hope that impeachment will cut short the folly,
failure and fascist trends of Bush and his corporate, cutthroat crew, but
already the moderate, mainstream milquetoast quislings of the dithering
Democratic Party have declared impeachment "off the table."

For many millions of Americans, impeachment of this corrupt and criminal
president and vice president should be on the agenda, not off the table. In
a full-page advertisement in the Jan. 12 edition of The New York Times, an
organization called Vote to Impeach outlined its case. "The illegal war of
aggression Bush launched against Iraq has killed hundreds of thousands of
Iraqis, and killed or wounded tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers," says the
ad headlined "Impeach Now!"

The ad lambastes the Bush administration for setting up a "worldwide network
of secret prisons, where torture has become the norm" and for assuming the
Orwellian powers to "wiretap, open the mail of, search and indefinitely
detain any American." It urges Americans to "take a stand" for impeachment
and to come to Washington on March 17 for an anti-war march on the Pentagon
to coincide with the upcoming fourth anniversary of the start of America's
ill-fated and imperialistic invasion of Iraq. The impeachment drive is
backed by former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who is vilified by Bush's
bootlickers but who would be a far better attorney general than the one who
"serves" today.

For more information on the much-needed drive to oust Bush and his boardroom
buddies, go to the Web site, www.impeachbush.org [1].

Impeachment of Bush is desirable but unlikely, "a consummation devoutly to
be wished," as Shakespeare put it. Still, something must be done to muzzle
Bush's dogs of war and put the corporate curs of his administration on a
short leash for the next two years.

If the Democrats won't do it, the dissidents will.

The anti-war movement hit the streets of this nation as soon as Bush
announced his so-called "surge" plan to escalate his Iraq war by sending in
more cannon-fodder troops.

Thousands of Americans are expected to demonstrate against the war next
weekend in Washington, and right here in the Classic City, peace activists
will gather at the University of Georgia Arch at noon Sunday to show that
people here in Georgia are taking a stand against the Iraq war.

Even some Republicans are aghast at Bush's preposterous "plan" to sacrifice
more young troops on the altar of his egotism in Iraq. Chuck Hagel - a
Nebraska senator, Vietnam War veteran and possible GOP presidential
candidate - was quite correct when he said Bush's recent speech to the
nation on the troop-surge scam "represents the most dangerous foreign-policy
blunder in this country since Vietnam, if it's carried out. I will resist
it."

It's way past time for all Americans to resist the warmongering "plans" of
the Bush cadre. Before Bush's Iraq invasion even started, thousands of
Americans, including me, marched on Washington under the rallying cry to
"stop the next war before it starts." If only Bush and his apologists had
listened, the lives of thousands of Americans and Iraqis would have been
spared.

With two years left in the Bush administration, and with the possibility of
a war with Iran waiting in the wings, it is time for a resurgent anti-war
movement that will refuse and resist the militaristic machinations of the
White House and Pentagon. As historian Howard Zinn has said, "Citizens of
war-making nations will no longer tolerate the deaths of their offspring and
the theft of their national wealth."
