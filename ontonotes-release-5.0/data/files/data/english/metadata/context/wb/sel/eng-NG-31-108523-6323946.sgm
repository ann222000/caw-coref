Where is the Universe expanding to?

Astrophysicist Alexander Kashlinsky of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center tackles this question.
The evolution of the universe is described by the physics of general relativity, which was discovered by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century. When compared to Newtonian physics, this theory provides a radically different framework for the physical description of the gravitational force.

In the Newtonian interpretation (where celestial bodies move according to the laws of Newton), space and time are absolute, with time no more than a parameter in the equations of motion. Meanwhile, gravity plays the role of a mysterious force of attraction between massive bodies.
The physics of general relativity is conceptually distinct--even if its equations of motion can be reduced to Newtonian equations in many practical cases, such as with respect to the motion of the moon, or, as we will see shortly, the overall evolution of the universe.

In general relativity, space and time are merged into one four-dimensional grid, whose properties are uniquely specified (via gravity) by the bodies inhabiting them. Gravity curves the spacetime grid, so general relativity thus describes gravitational interactions as manifestations of the spacetime curvature. Objects "fall under gravity" from less curved parts of spacetime to more curved parts of the spacetime. (When spacetime becomes infinitely curved, as in the case of black holes, the gravitational force is so strong that spacetime closes on itself, creating what is called a singularity in the fabric of the underlying spacetime continuum. Nothing can escape such objects.)

According to Einstein's general relativity equations, the spacetime containing matter cannot remain stationary and must either expand or contract. Galaxies and other sources, then, are not strictly expanding away from each other but rather are attached to the fixed grid on the expanding fabric of spacetime. Thus, the galaxies give us the impression of moving away from each other. Imagine the surface of a balloon, on which you put dots. Then start inflating the balloon. The distances between the dots will increase, so if you live in one of these dots, you will interpret this as the dots--which represent galaxies in this example--moving away from each other. In reality, of course, they remain in the same positions, with respect to latitudes and longitudes on the balloon, and it is the fabric of the balloon that is actually expanding.

In Newtonian physics, one can construct a mathematical analogy to the expansion of the universe by defining a system that is expanding or contracting under its own gravity, such as a galaxy made of stars or the solar system. In this framework, however, this expansion is not linked to stretching the fabric of any spacetime. Instead, space is some abstract absolute and fixed entity that all objects move through without affecting it. Thus one can ask not only "Where is the universe expanding to?" in the Newtonian framework, but also "What happened before the initial push?"
In the framework of general relativity, however, both of these questions become meaningless. Asking the question, "Where is the universe expanding to?" implies some other coordinate grid outside spacetime. But since spacetime is linked to matter, there is no outside to the surface of the balloon. Rather, it is all the spacetime that is available.

Comment:
Viewed from Earth, the further away the object, the faster it is pulled along by expanding space time.  If we reverse time, then the further back in time we go the closer objects are (to Earth or the area in space where Earth would later be) and the slower their speed.  If you go back far enough the motion of the objects through space is greater than the expansion rate of the space in their area.  Thus if we go back in time we do not see objects crashing in at ever greater speed as the Gamow Big Bang model envisaged, but we see objects slowing down ever more.

How can this be?  Doesn't the big bang postulate that matter is flung out at high velocity and then slows down?  But the expansion rate is accelerating into the future, not decelerating as the Big Bang postulates.  If we go back far enough into the past there is no expansion and objects merely move toward or away from each other as the case may be (no overall motion in any direction).

Why is the failure of this most basic part of Big Bang cosmology never mentioned?  Moving toward the hypothetical beginning, at what point did the decelerating expansion cease and the postulated acceleration begin (that must have occurred well after the period of rapid inflation), and what evidence, if any, is there for this turn around in observed expansion??

Local kinetic motion does not change.  That's the point.  Andromeda is
heading toward us because of local motion.  When the universe (in the past)
was much smaller, the expansion rate was far less and local kinetic energy
would dominate it the apparent motion of a distant galaxy would be given by
its local kinetic motion and not by its distance alone.  So the said galaxy
might be moving toward us, like andromeda (blue shifted), or away from us.
The apparent motion caused by the expansion of the universe would be only
small.

One can not extrapolate from the expansion of the universe today back to a
Big Bang, as Gamow did.

There was a compact region of space and then it expanded.  All current Big B

just a very small point in a larger superverse.  If you are working from a

So our universe was a tiny speck in the superverse at the time of the big

The rate of acceneration is increasing.  That means that it must have been
slower in the past ie as we look back into the past the rate is slowing
(decelerating).

Just because the observational facts don't fit with current models does not
mean that they should be discounted.

If the expansion rate is faster now it must have been slower in the past.
The less space between objects the slower the recession rate.

Recent findings have found that the CMBR is sourced locally.  There is no

It's aether time!  Like we needed another article for people like Paul
Stowe to quote to claim general relativity is an "aether theory."

General relativity reduces to special relativity at short distances
and times.  There can be no background grid relative to which objects
are moving or fixed unless you allow any observer to define the grid
so that he is fixed relative to it.  General relativity goes far
beyond this requirement, allowing people vast freedom in what
coordinate systems they may choose.

Of course, for doing calculations in cosmology, choosing coordinates
relative to which none of the galaxies are moving very fast is
advantageous.  But there's no requirement that anyone do so.

If you take a bunch of expanding groups of galaxies, each modeled by
Newtonian mechanics, and sew them together at the edges, you get a not
bad mental model of the expanding universe -- one that may be
preferable to this grid nonsense if your goal is understanding what's
going on.  (If your goal is calculating things, the grid model might
be better.)  To improve the model, throw in some "dark energy" for an
antigravitational effect, add special relativistic corrections, and
let the size of the pieces being sewn together approach zero.

Notice that galaxies in different pieces will appear to accelerate
relative to each other, but we have not postulated any force between
them.

Of course, the best model is full-fledged general relativity, but I
find it difficult to visualize curved spacetime without either
breaking it up into pieces of flat spacetime or embedding it in a
higher dimension.

By the way, the latter technique is another good way to picture the
expanding universe, because due to the symmetry of the problem you
only need one extra dimension.  It's similar to the balloon analogy,
except it removes the atoms of the balloon relative to which something
can be fixed, which is a misleading part of the balloon analogy.
Unfortunately, the extra dimension technique doesn't work well for the
flat space geometry supported by observations.  (If anyone knows a way
to get it to work, let me know!)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The concluding paragraph is not that bad, except of course for the

The Universe is not expanding.

Galaxies are accelerating toward their headings like trains on their
tracks.

There is a simple explanation: gravity compresses galaxies. Spiral
Galaxies rotate, but also tighten from gravity over time. This
tightening
gives galaxies a compaction of energy. Like a figure skater spinning
and pulling in her arm, galaxies gain rotating speed and with it
acceleration toward their tracks. The result is that the Universe
is inflating, expanding in all directions. I believe elliptic non-
rotating
galaxies are a result of spiral galaxy collisions.

&gt; &gt; If we reverse time, then the further back in time we go the

&gt; &gt; If you go back far enough the motion of the objects

&gt; &gt; the Gamow Big Bang model envisaged, but we see
&gt; &gt; objects slowing down ever more.

&gt; No reason that their &quot;local kinetic motion&quot; need change at all.

&gt; &gt; How can this be?  Doesn't the big bang postulate that
&gt; &gt; matter is flung out at high velocity and then slows down?

&gt; No.  &quot;Big Bang&quot; is a misnomer.  There was no central explosion.

&gt; &gt; But the expansion rate is accelerating into the future,
&gt; &gt; not decelerating as the Big Bang postulates.

&gt; The rate of acceleration has been many different values since the
&gt; Big Bang.  Since &quot;the pull of gravity&quot; is proposed to slow down
&gt; expansion, and gravity in GR is no sort of force to pull
&gt; anything, then there is nothing that requires deceleration of
&gt; expansion... or to prevent deceleration of expansion.

&gt; &gt; If we go back far enough into the past there is no
&gt; &gt; expansion

&gt; Expansion is present at every age visible right back to the CMBR.
&gt; The rate of acceleration of expansion was variable.

&gt; Because it is your personal misunderstanding.

&gt; &gt; Moving toward the hypothetical beginning, at what

&gt; *Where is the Universe expanding to?*

&gt; *Astrophysicist Alexander Kashlinsky of the NASA Goddard Space Flight
&gt; Center tackles this question.*

&gt; The evolution of the universe is described by the physics of general
&gt; relativity, which was discovered by Albert Einstein in the early 20th
&gt; century. When compared to Newtonian physics, this theory provides a
&gt; radically different framework for the physical description of the
&gt; gravitational force.

&gt; In the Newtonian interpretation (where celestial bodies move according
&gt; to the laws of Newton), space and time are absolute, with time no more
&gt; than a parameter in the equations of motion. Meanwhile, gravity plays
&gt; the role of a mysterious force of attraction between massive bodies.

&gt; The physics of general relativity is conceptually distinct--even if its
&gt; equations of motion can be reduced to Newtonian equations in many
&gt; practical cases, such as with respect to the motion of the moon, or, as
&gt; we will see shortly, the overall evolution of the universe.

&gt; In general relativity, space and time are merged into one
&gt; four-dimensional grid, whose properties are uniquely specified (via
&gt; gravity) by the bodies inhabiting them. Gravity curves the spacetime
&gt; grid, so general relativity thus describes gravitational interactions as
&gt; manifestations of the spacetime curvature. Objects &quot;fall under gravity&quot;
&gt; from less curved parts of spacetime to more curved parts of the
&gt; spacetime. (When spacetime becomes infinitely curved, as in the case of
&gt; black holes, the gravitational force is so strong that spacetime closes
&gt; on itself, creating what is called a singularity in the fabric of the
&gt; underlying spacetime continuum. Nothing can escape such objects.)

&gt; According to Einstein's general relativity equations, the spacetime
&gt; containing matter cannot remain stationary and must either expand or
&gt; contract. Galaxies and other sources, then, are not strictly expanding
&gt; away from each other but rather are attached to the fixed grid on the
&gt; expanding fabric of spacetime. Thus, the galaxies give us the impression
&gt; of moving away from each other. Imagine the surface of a balloon, on
&gt; which you put dots. Then start inflating the balloon. The distances
&gt; between the dots will increase, so if you live in one of these dots, you
&gt; will interpret this as the dots--which represent galaxies in this
&gt; example--moving away from each other. In reality, of course, they remain
&gt; in the same positions, with respect to latitudes and longitudes on the
&gt; balloon, and it is the fabric of the balloon that is actually expanding.

&gt; In Newtonian physics, one can construct a mathematical analogy to the
&gt; expansion of the universe by defining a system that is expanding or
&gt; contracting under its own gravity, such as a galaxy made of stars or the
&gt; solar system. In this framework, however, this expansion is not linked
&gt; to stretching the fabric of any spacetime. Instead, space is some
&gt; abstract absolute and fixed entity that all objects move through without
&gt; affecting it. Thus one can ask not only &quot;Where is the universe expanding
&gt; to?&quot; in the Newtonian framework, but also &quot;What happened before the
&gt; initial push?&quot;

&gt; In the framework of general relativity, however, both of these questions
&gt; become meaningless. Asking the question, &quot;Where is the universe
&gt; expanding to?&quot; implies some other coordinate grid outside spacetime. But
&gt; since spacetime is linked to matter, there is no outside to the surface
&gt; of the balloon. Rather, it is all the spacetime that is available.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the Gamow Big Bang model envisaged, but we see
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; objects slowing down ever more.
&gt; &gt;&gt; No reason that their &quot;local kinetic motion&quot; need change at all.

&gt; &gt; Local kinetic motion does not change.  That's the point.  Andromeda is
&gt; &gt; heading toward us because of local motion.  When the universe (in the
past)
&gt; &gt; was much smaller, the expansion rate was far less and local kinetic
energy
&gt; &gt; would dominate it the apparent motion of a distant galaxy would be given
by
&gt; &gt; its local kinetic motion and not by its distance alone.  So the said
galaxy
&gt; &gt; might be moving toward us, like andromeda (blue shifted), or away from
us.
&gt; &gt; The apparent motion caused by the expansion of the universe would be
only
&gt; &gt; small.

&gt; &gt; One can not extrapolate from the expansion of the universe today back to
a
&gt; &gt; Big Bang, as Gamow did.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; How can this be?  Doesn't the big bang postulate that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; matter is flung out at high velocity and then slows down?
&gt; &gt;&gt; No.  &quot;Big Bang&quot; is a misnomer.  There was no central explosion.

&gt; &gt; There was a compact region of space and then it expanded.  All current
Big B
&gt; &gt; ang (inflation) models include multiple universes, so that our universe
is
&gt; &gt; just a very small point in a larger superverse.  If you are working from
a
&gt; &gt; non-superverse model (pre-inflation) then let me know so that we can
sing
&gt; &gt; from the same song sheet, at least in this respect.

&gt; &gt; So our universe was a tiny speck in the superverse at the time of the
big
&gt; &gt; bang - viewed from outside, it was a speck.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But the expansion rate is accelerating into the future,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not decelerating as the Big Bang postulates.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The rate of acceleration has been many different values since the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Big Bang.  Since &quot;the pull of gravity&quot; is proposed to slow down
&gt; &gt;&gt; expansion, and gravity in GR is no sort of force to pull
&gt; &gt;&gt; anything, then there is nothing that requires deceleration of
&gt; &gt;&gt; expansion... or to prevent deceleration of expansion.

&gt; &gt; The rate of acceneration is increasing.  That means that it must have
been
&gt; &gt; slower in the past ie as we look back into the past the rate is slowing
&gt; &gt; (decelerating).

&gt; &gt; Just because the observational facts don't fit with current models does
not
&gt; &gt; mean that they should be discounted.

&gt; &gt; If the expansion rate is faster now it must have been slower in the
past.
&gt; &gt; The less space between objects the slower the recession rate.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If we go back far enough into the past there is no
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; expansion
&gt; &gt;&gt; Expansion is present at every age visible right back to the CMBR.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The rate of acceleration of expansion was variable.

&gt; &gt; Recent findings have found that the CMBR is sourced locally.  There is
no
&gt; &gt; lensing effect and the shadow effect is less than 25% of what was
expected
&gt; &gt; ie up to 75% of the CMBR observed came from sources between the object
and
&gt; &gt; observer (where only a small shadow effect was observed).

&gt; &gt; I've posted the news several times - don't like to read data that
disagrees
&gt; &gt; with your preconceptions?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and objects merely move toward or away from each
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; other as the case may be (no overall motion in any
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; direction).
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Why is the failure of this most basic part of Big
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Bang cosmology never mentioned?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Because it is your personal misunderstanding.

&gt; &gt; Lack of faith more like it.  Perhaps on my bended knees before COBE I'll
see
&gt; &gt; the (fossil) light?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Moving toward the hypothetical beginning, at what
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; point did the decelerating expansion cease and the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; postulated acceleration begin (that must have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; occurred well after the period of rapid inflation), and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; what evidence, if any, is there for this turn around
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in observed expansion??
&gt; &gt;&gt; None, since there was no turnaround in anything visible.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Start here, and work your way through:
&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_01.htm
&gt; &gt;&gt; ... you should enjoy part 4.

&gt; &gt; Thanks David,
&gt; &gt; but part 4 is definitely out of date.  They rabbit on about the CMBR,
which
&gt; &gt; the current evidence shows did not come from the big bang but is
actually
&gt; &gt; sourced locally (in time and/or space).

&gt; &gt; *Where is the Universe expanding to?*

&gt; &gt; *Astrophysicist Alexander Kashlinsky of the NASA Goddard Space Flight
&gt; &gt; Center tackles this question.*

&gt; &gt; The evolution of the universe is described by the physics of general
&gt; &gt; relativity, which was discovered by Albert Einstein in the early 20th
&gt; &gt; century. When compared to Newtonian physics, this theory provides a
&gt; &gt; radically different framework for the physical description of the
&gt; &gt; gravitational force.

&gt; &gt; In the Newtonian interpretation (where celestial bodies move according
&gt; &gt; to the laws of Newton), space and time are absolute, with time no more
&gt; &gt; than a parameter in the equations of motion. Meanwhile, gravity plays
&gt; &gt; the role of a mysterious force of attraction between massive bodies.

&gt; &gt; The physics of general relativity is conceptually distinct--even if its
&gt; &gt; equations of motion can be reduced to Newtonian equations in many
&gt; &gt; practical cases, such as with respect to the motion of the moon, or, as
&gt; &gt; we will see shortly, the overall evolution of the universe.

&gt; &gt; In general relativity, space and time are merged into one
&gt; &gt; four-dimensional grid, whose properties are uniquely specified (via
&gt; &gt; gravity) by the bodies inhabiting them. Gravity curves the spacetime
&gt; &gt; grid, so general relativity thus describes gravitational interactions as
&gt; &gt; manifestations of the spacetime curvature. Objects &quot;fall under gravity&quot;
&gt; &gt; from less curved parts of spacetime to more curved parts of the
&gt; &gt; spacetime. (When spacetime becomes infinitely curved, as in the case of
&gt; &gt; black holes, the gravitational force is so strong that spacetime closes
&gt; &gt; on itself, creating what is called a singularity in the fabric of the
&gt; &gt; underlying spacetime continuum. Nothing can escape such objects.)

&gt; &gt; According to Einstein's general relativity equations, the spacetime
&gt; &gt; containing matter cannot remain stationary and must either expand or
&gt; &gt; contract. Galaxies and other sources, then, are not strictly expanding
&gt; &gt; away from each other but rather are attached to the fixed grid on the
&gt; &gt; expanding fabric of spacetime. Thus, the galaxies give us the impression
&gt; &gt; of moving away from each other. Imagine the surface of a balloon, on
&gt; &gt; which you put dots. Then start inflating the balloon. The distances
&gt; &gt; between the dots will increase, so if you live in one of these dots, you
&gt; &gt; will interpret this as the dots--which represent galaxies in this
&gt; &gt; example--moving away from each other. In reality, of course, they remain
&gt; &gt; in the same positions, with respect to latitudes and longitudes on the
&gt; &gt; balloon, and it is the fabric of the balloon that is actually expanding.

&gt; &gt; In Newtonian physics, one can construct a mathematical analogy to the
&gt; &gt; expansion of the universe by defining a system that is expanding or
&gt; &gt; contracting under its own gravity, such as a galaxy made of stars or the
&gt; &gt; solar system. In this framework, however, this expansion is not linked
&gt; &gt; to stretching the fabric of any spacetime. Instead, space is some
&gt; &gt; abstract absolute and fixed entity that all objects move through without
&gt; &gt; affecting it. Thus one can ask not only &quot;Where is the universe expanding
&gt; &gt; to?&quot; in the Newtonian framework, but also &quot;What happened before the
&gt; &gt; initial push?&quot;

&gt; &gt; In the framework of general relativity, however, both of these questions
&gt; &gt; become meaningless. Asking the question, &quot;Where is the universe
&gt; &gt; expanding to?&quot; implies some other coordinate grid outside spacetime. But
&gt; &gt; since spacetime is linked to matter, there is no outside to the surface
&gt; &gt; of the balloon. Rather, it is all the spacetime that is available.

&gt; &gt; *Comment:*
&gt; &gt; Viewed from Earth, the further away the object, the faster it is pulled

&gt; &gt; where Earth would later be) and the slower their speed.  If you go back
&gt; &gt; far enough the motion of the objects through space is greater than the
&gt; &gt; expansion rate of the space in their area.  Thus if we go back in time
&gt; &gt; we do not see objects crashing in at ever greater speed as the Gamow Big

WAMP is irrelevant to the Big Bang as the CMBR has failed *two* critical
tests that remotely sourced radiation should have passed:-
1) there is no lensing effect in the CMBR;
2) the CMBR failed the shadow effect.

Together, this evidence conclusively proves that CMBR is sourced locally (in
space and/or time).

There are no galaxy clusters heading toward each other?  It is my

clusters as well.

&gt; OK.

&gt; &gt; One can not extrapolate from the expansion of the

&gt; I don't see that &quot;time reversal&quot; is impossible though, if Gamow
&gt; may or may not be strained by what you are &quot;seeing&quot;.
">

If you were to just turn the clock back and not the motion of galaxies would
you conclude, from that alone, that a big bang event must have occurred if
you turn the clock back far enough?  As I see it, the expansion of space
slows as galaxies get closer to each other until the galaxies inertial
motion is greater than the expansion.

For instance, if two galaxies are now 10 billion light years apart then from
either galaxy observers will see the light coming from the other as very red
shifted, indicating a great recession speed.  But the inertial motion of
each galaxy may be toward a common point between them.  If we reverse time
then their inertial motion is reverse - the are moving away fractionally.
But the redshift is still there, but less for each billion years into the
past until, at say a few thousand light years apart, their inertial motion
is sufficient that observers on either planet would see the light coming
from the other as blue shifted ie (in forward moving/normal temporal
orientation at this early period) they are moving toward each other
inertially, but away from each other very slightly because of the expanding
space.

It seems to me that cosmologists are putting all their evidential eggs in
the CMBR basket.  So why doesn't anyone try to account for the anomalous
findings that indicate that the CMBR is sourced locally?

&gt;
&gt; This newsgroup is an open forum devoted to the discussion of scientific

&gt;
&gt; The contributors to this newsgroup constitute a diverse group of laypeople,
&gt; high school students, college students, graduate students, engineers and
&gt; other professionals, as well as physicists, astronomers, computer
&gt; scientists and mathematicians.  All are united by an interest in physics,
&gt; and all are welcome to contribute postings here.
&gt;
&gt; This newsgroup is unmoderated, which means that anyone can post anything

&gt; For this reason, it is important that everyone who participates in the
&gt; group should be familiar with and adhere voluntarily to the posting
&gt; guidelines suggested in the next section.
&gt;
&gt; ======================== Posting Guidelines ==========================
&gt;
&gt; We welcome contributions from newcomers, including questions at all levels
&gt; of expertise.  However, we do ask that "newbies" always check the FAQ (see
&gt; the next section) -before- posting any questions, because experience has
&gt; shown that chances are very good that a very similar question is answered
&gt; there. (The word FAQ is, after all, an acronym for "Frequently Asked
&gt; Questions".)
&gt;
&gt; "Wild and crazy ideas" are also acceptable, but please be sure to check the
&gt; FAQ before posting to avoid the embarrasment of posting something based on
&gt; a Very Common Misconception.
&gt;
&gt; Topics which are rarely if ever appropriate in this newsgroup include:
&gt;
&gt;   * general discussions of the scientific method (try sci.misc),
&gt;   * theological discussions (try talk.origins),
&gt;   * "scientific creationism" (try talk.origins).
&gt;
&gt; A common sense rule for deciding whether a possible topic is likely to be
&gt; considered acceptable here is to remember that the name of this newsgroup
&gt; is sci[ence].physics.  If it's not about science, it doesn't belong here.
&gt; If it is about science but has little to do with physics, it doesn't belong
&gt; here.
&gt;
&gt; If you are replying to another post, please be sure to cut out all
&gt; irrelevant text, and to make every effort to ensure that it is clear who
&gt; said what.  It may be advisable to lurk here for a while to see how
&gt; experienced posters accomplish this.  You may also wish to post through
&gt; Google at
&gt;
&gt; http://groups.google.com
&gt;
&gt; if you don't want your posting to be archived by Google.
&gt;
&gt; Cross-posting from sci.physics to other science newsgroups is, in general,
&gt; strongly discouraged.  If you respond to a message which is cross-posted to
&gt; irrelevant groups, please remove the other groups from the Newsgroup line
&gt; in the header of your response, or use the Followup line in the header to
&gt; direct further followups to just one or two groups.  Cross-posting is
&gt; -sometimes- acceptable if it is limited to at most two or three other
&gt; newsgroups, in each of which the topic is clearly acceptable and is not
&gt; considered overly speculative.
&gt;
&gt; Please note that the most effective posts are concise, clearly expressed,
&gt; and focus on a very specific point.  It is always a good idea to re-read
&gt; what you have written (and to employ a spell-checker!) -before- posting
&gt; your message.  It is also wise to make sure that your subject line
&gt; concisely and accurately describes the content of the message.  Checking to
&gt; see that your margins line up can also help to make your post much more
&gt; readable.  Please do not quote previous messages more than one deep, since
&gt; beyond that it becomes very difficult to see who said what, as well as
&gt; wasting storage space and internet band width.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, it is important to always bear in mind that some behavior is
&gt; decidedly -unwelcome- at any time in this newsgroup, including:
&gt;
&gt;   * spamming of any kind,
&gt;   * cross-posting to large numbers of unrelated newsgroups,
&gt;   * posting on wildly irrelevant topics,
&gt;   * repeated postings of identical messages,

&gt;&gt;&gt; *Where is the Universe expanding to?*

&gt;&gt;&gt; *Astrophysicist Alexander Kashlinsky of the NASA Goddard Space Flight
&gt;&gt;&gt; Center tackles this question.*

&gt;&gt;&gt; The evolution of the universe is described by the physics of general
&gt;&gt;&gt; relativity, which was discovered by Albert Einstein in the early 20th
&gt;&gt;&gt; century. When compared to Newtonian physics, this theory provides a
&gt;&gt;&gt; radically different framework for the physical description of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; gravitational force.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Newtonian interpretation (where celestial bodies move according
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the laws of Newton), space and time are absolute, with time no more
&gt;&gt;&gt; than a parameter in the equations of motion. Meanwhile, gravity plays
&gt;&gt;&gt; the role of a mysterious force of attraction between massive bodies.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The physics of general relativity is conceptually distinct--even if its
&gt;&gt;&gt; equations of motion can be reduced to Newtonian equations in many
&gt;&gt;&gt; practical cases, such as with respect to the motion of the moon, or, as
&gt;&gt;&gt; we will see shortly, the overall evolution of the universe.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In general relativity, space and time are merged into one
&gt;&gt;&gt; four-dimensional grid, whose properties are uniquely specified (via
&gt;&gt;&gt; gravity) by the bodies inhabiting them. Gravity curves the spacetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; grid, so general relativity thus describes gravitational interactions as
&gt;&gt;&gt; manifestations of the spacetime curvature. Objects &quot;fall under gravity&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from less curved parts of spacetime to more curved parts of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; spacetime. (When spacetime becomes infinitely curved, as in the case of
&gt;&gt;&gt; black holes, the gravitational force is so strong that spacetime closes
&gt;&gt;&gt; on itself, creating what is called a singularity in the fabric of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; underlying spacetime continuum. Nothing can escape such objects.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; According to Einstein's general relativity equations, the spacetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; containing matter cannot remain stationary and must either expand or
&gt;&gt;&gt; contract. Galaxies and other sources, then, are not strictly expanding
&gt;&gt;&gt; away from each other but rather are attached to the fixed grid on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; expanding fabric of spacetime. Thus, the galaxies give us the impression
&gt;&gt;&gt; of moving away from each other. Imagine the surface of a balloon, on
&gt;&gt;&gt; which you put dots. Then start inflating the balloon. The distances
&gt;&gt;&gt; between the dots will increase, so if you live in one of these dots, you
&gt;&gt;&gt; will interpret this as the dots--which represent galaxies in this
&gt;&gt;&gt; example--moving away from each other. In reality, of course, they remain
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the same positions, with respect to latitudes and longitudes on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; balloon, and it is the fabric of the balloon that is actually expanding.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In Newtonian physics, one can construct a mathematical analogy to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; expansion of the universe by defining a system that is expanding or
&gt;&gt;&gt; contracting under its own gravity, such as a galaxy made of stars or the
&gt;&gt;&gt; solar system. In this framework, however, this expansion is not linked
&gt;&gt;&gt; to stretching the fabric of any spacetime. Instead, space is some
&gt;&gt;&gt; abstract absolute and fixed entity that all objects move through without
&gt;&gt;&gt; affecting it. Thus one can ask not only &quot;Where is the universe expanding
&gt;&gt;&gt; to?&quot; in the Newtonian framework, but also &quot;What happened before the
&gt;&gt;&gt; initial push?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the framework of general relativity, however, both of these questions
&gt;&gt;&gt; become meaningless. Asking the question, &quot;Where is the universe
&gt;&gt;&gt; expanding to?&quot; implies some other coordinate grid outside spacetime. But
&gt;&gt;&gt; since spacetime is linked to matter, there is no outside to the surface
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the balloon. Rather, it is all the spacetime that is available.

&gt;&gt;&gt; *Comment:*
&gt;&gt;&gt; Viewed from Earth, the further away the object, the faster it is pulled
&gt;&gt;&gt; along by expanding space time.  If we reverse time, then the further
&gt;&gt;&gt; back in time we go the closer objects are (to Earth or the area in space
&gt;&gt;&gt; where Earth would later be) and the slower their speed.  If you go back
&gt;&gt;&gt; far enough the motion of the objects through space is greater than the
&gt;&gt;&gt; expansion rate of the space in their area.  Thus if we go back in time
&gt;&gt;&gt; we do not see objects crashing in at ever greater speed as the Gamow Big
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bang model envisaged, but we see objects slowing down ever more.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How can this be?  Doesn't the big bang postulate that matter is flung
&gt;&gt;&gt; out at high velocity and then slows down?  But the expansion rate is
&gt;&gt;&gt; accelerating into the future, not decelerating as the Big Bang
&gt;&gt;&gt; postulates.  If we go back far enough into the past there is no
&gt;&gt;&gt; expansion and objects merely move toward or away from each other as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; case may be (no overall motion in any direction).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is the failure of this most basic part of Big Bang cosmology never
&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned?  Moving toward the hypothetical beginning, at what point did
&gt;&gt;&gt; the decelerating expansion cease and the postulated acceleration begin
&gt;&gt;&gt; (that must have occurred well after the period of rapid inflation), and
&gt;&gt;&gt; what evidence, if any, is there for this turn around in observed
&gt; expansion??

Neither of the above is google (usenet) publication - they are opinion
pieces.  The official line you posted blow says, and I quote:-
"This newsgroup is unmoderated, which means that anyone can post anything

I comply 100% with the above!!!

Another quote:
"Wild and crazy ideas" are also acceptable.."
Well, that covers the Big Bang theory.  String theory is a bit too crazy
even for the above, isn't it?  After all, string theories have failed every
test ever set for them.  But they spring up again, like weeds :)

Don didn't mention anything about plain text, though I agree that
discussions like this one should be plain test - only news messages should
be MIME encoded so that they can contain special charactors eg math symbols,
images related to the topic, formatted text and so on.  Plus it is easier to
just drag an HTML straight into as News message - plain text conversion is
slow and tedious (unless you want a spegatti of unreadable unformatted
text).  URL only is generally ignored, espeically by those who only have one
monitor as clicking on the URL may lose their place - much easier to just
read the message right in front.  On the web pages (via URL) one has to
negotiate numerous side bars, headers with little picture, popups, and text
spread over several pages (eg Scientific American).  I consolidate to a
single page with pictures, usually the larger picture if one ios avialable -
vastly superior to either plain text or the orginal URL.

I note that Sam Wormley quoted this same message in 2001.  In fact I can
only find the Same Wormley reposts for some reason.
Speaking of neticate, wouldn't it be bad manners to post something original

================ Welcome! to sci.physics ==================

This newsgroup is an open forum devoted to the discussion of scientific
issues involving general physics.

The contributors to this newsgroup constitute a diverse group of laypeople,
high school students, college students, graduate students, engineers and
other professionals, as well as physicists, astronomers, computer
scientists and mathematicians.  All are united by an interest in physics,
and all are welcome to contribute postings here.

This newsgroup is unmoderated, which means that anyone can post anything
here: there is no censorship of any kind, and no-one "runs" this group.
For this reason, it is important that everyone who participates in the
group should be familiar with and adhere voluntarily to the posting
guidelines suggested in the next section.

======================== Posting Guidelines ==========================

We welcome contributions from newcomers, including questions at all levels
of expertise.  However, we do ask that "newbies" always check the FAQ (see
the next section) -before- posting any questions, because experience has
shown that chances are very good that a very similar question is answered
there. (The word FAQ is, after all, an acronym for "Frequently Asked
Questions".)

"Wild and crazy ideas" are also acceptable, but please be sure to check the
FAQ before posting to avoid the embarrasment of posting something based on
a Very Common Misconception.

Topics which are rarely if ever appropriate in this newsgroup include:

* general discussions of the scientific method (try sci.misc),
* theological discussions (try talk.origins),
* "scientific creationism" (try talk.origins).

A common sense rule for deciding whether a possible topic is likely to be
considered acceptable here is to remember that the name of this newsgroup
is sci[ence].physics.  If it's not about science, it doesn't belong here.
If it is about science but has little to do with physics, it doesn't belong
here.

If you are replying to another post, please be sure to cut out all
irrelevant text, and to make every effort to ensure that it is clear who
said what.  It may be advisable to lurk here for a while to see how
experienced posters accomplish this.  You may also wish to post through
Google at

http://groups.google.com

if you don't want your posting to be archived by Google.

Cross-posting from sci.physics to other science newsgroups is, in general,
strongly discouraged.  If you respond to a message which is cross-posted to
irrelevant groups, please remove the other groups from the Newsgroup line
in the header of your response, or use the Followup line in the header to
direct further followups to just one or two groups.  Cross-posting is
-sometimes- acceptable if it is limited to at most two or three other
newsgroups, in each of which the topic is clearly acceptable and is not
considered overly speculative.

Please note that the most effective posts are concise, clearly expressed,
and focus on a very specific point.  It is always a good idea to re-read
what you have written (and to employ a spell-checker!) -before- posting
your message.  It is also wise to make sure that your subject line
concisely and accurately describes the content of the message.  Checking to
see that your margins line up can also help to make your post much more
readable.  Please do not quote previous messages more than one deep, since
beyond that it becomes very difficult to see who said what, as well as
wasting storage space and internet band width.

Finally, it is important to always bear in mind that some behavior is
decidedly -unwelcome- at any time in this newsgroup, including:

* spamming of any kind,
* cross-posting to large numbers of unrelated newsgroups,
* posting on wildly irrelevant topics,
* repeated postings of identical messages,
* abusive flaming.

Bottom line: if you wouldn't say it in front of your mother or your boss,
please don't say it here.

You're out of date. The earlier observations were made using the less
accurate COBE data.  Using the far more accurate WMAP data the effect is
only 25% of that expected (indicating that most of the CMBR is sourced
between the cluster and the observer, obviously - obvious to anyone viewing
the data objectively, that is...).  The shadow effect only appears for some
objects.

Why do you grasp on to the older, less accurate data and throw out the later
definitive data.

What was the name of this thread where the data was rigorously discussed (I
may have missed it).

And what about the complete failure of the lensing effect??  How do you
brush that off??

Did you read the article and papers?

I've looked through a few of these, and with so much else about the big
bang, they are trying to explain an assumption.  It is assumed that there is
a lensing effect in the CMBR.

When the assumption was tested it failed.

try
http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=%22measured+...

Your search - "measured lensing effect" CMB - did not match any documents.

Curious - no-one has measured it!!!

I go a few hits for "measure the lensing effect" but none were of measuring
the CMBR (or CMB)

I can also find a few papers directly related to attempts to measure the
lensing effect, but they are all old (pre-WMAP).

Ahhh, here is one that is up to date:
"Just over a year ago Lieu and Dr. Jonathan Mittaz, a UAH research
associate, published results of a study using WMAP data to look for evidence
of "lensing" effects which should have been seen (but weren't) if the
microwave background was a Big Bang remnant."

http://www.uah.edu/News/newsread.php?newsID=480

Or better, what about the orginal paper:-
On the absence of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background

Richard Lieu1 &amp; Jonathan P.D. Mittaz1
Department of Physics, University of Alabama at Huntsville, Huntsville, AL
35899

The magnification of distant sources by mass clumps at lower (z ? 1)
redshifts is calculated analytically. The clumps are initially assumed to be
galaxy group isothermal spheres with properties inferred from an extensive
survey. The average effect, which includes strong lensing, is exactly
counteracted by the beam divergence in between clumps (more precisely, the
average reciprocal magnification cancels the inverse Dyer-Roeder
demagnification). This conclusion is independent of the matter density
function within each clump, and remains valid for arbitrary values of m and
_. When tested against the cosmic microwave background data, a rather large
lensing induced dispersion in the angular size of the primary acoustic peaks
of the TT power spectrum is inconsistent with WMAP observations. The
situation is unchanged by the use of NFW profiles for the density
distribution of groups, which led in fact to slightly larger fluctuations.
Finally, our formulae are applied to an ensemble of NFW mass clumps or
isothermal spheres having the parameters of galaxy clusters. The acoustic
peak size dispersion remains unobservably large, and is also excluded by
WMAP. For galaxy groups, two possible ways of reconciling with the data are
proposed, both exploiting maximally the uncertainties in our knowledge of
group properties. The same escape routes are not available in the case of
clusters, however, because their properties are well understood. Here we
have a more robust conclusion: neither the NFW profile nor isothermal sphere
profiles are an accurate description of clusters, or important elements of
physics responsible for shaping zero curvature space are missing from the
standard cosmological model. When all the effects are accrued, it is
difficult to understand how WMAP could reveal no evidence whatsoever of
lensing by groups and clusters.

Those are two of the papers to which the article refers and to which Leiu

"Dear Robert,

What you said isn't entirely true.  There was quite a bit of
press coverage at the time, including the UK Guardian and USA Today
as I recall.  I have to give a lot of credit to those responsible
for establishing the standard cosmological model.  They are no
fools, and bringing down this model is no easy task.  I've been
trying very hard to test the model in many and various ways, with
some success, but a lot of `false alarms'.  Not sure why I am now
viewed as such a stiff opponent, to the point that people are
likening me to a Copernicus or Galileo.  For a start, I will never
be such a towering giant as they are.

Next month I am chairing a major conference in London, to debate
the `status of the status-quo'."

I asked him why nothing was being said - he said that was wrong, that there
had been discussion as you can see above.

Good source - thanks.

One interesting paper on the Lensing:-
Cross-correlation of CMB with large-scale structure: weak gravitational
lensing
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0406004

Here is the discussion (Part VII)

In this paper, we have carried out an initial search

for weak lensing of the CMB by performing a lensing

reconstruction from the WMAP data and correlating the

resulting lensing field map with the SDSS LRG map. We

do not have a detection, however our result bg = 1.81 ± 1.92 (1_) is
consistent with the bias bg ? 1.8 obtained

from the LRG clustering autopower [60].

The main purpose of this analysis was to identify any

systematics that contaminate the galaxy-convergence

correlation at the level of the current CMB data. The

good news is that our result for the bias is reasonable,

suggesting that such systematics are at most of

the order of the statistical errors. We have also found

that the Galactic foregrounds are a negligible contaminant

to the lensing signal (again, at the level of the

present data). The bad news primarily concerns extragalactic

foregrounds: a significant amount of solid angle

- 21% of Kp05?S10 - was lost due to point source

cuts that are necessary to avoid spurious power (at least

in Q band), and we have no assurance that significant

point source or tSZ contamination of the lensing signal

does not lie just below the threshold of detectability.

The extragalactic foreground analyses of Sec. VID1

based on the frequency dependence of the signal and

the galaxy-temperature correlations yielded only a weak

constraint on the synchrotron point source contamination,

_b(PS)

g (T T ) = 0.73 ± 1.18, and essentially no useful

constraint can be derived for tSZ using the first-year

WMAP data. Our constraints based on CgT

l for the point

sources are more stringent, _b(PS)

g = ?0.14 ± 0.51, but

these assume Poissonianity of the sources, which must

break down at some level. The point source and tSZ

issues will become even more important as future experiments

probe lensing of the CMB using higher-l primary

modes, where point source and tSZ anisotropies

contribute a greater fraction of the total power in the

CMB, and precision cosmology with lensing of the CMB

will require a means of constraining these contaminants

in order to produce reliable results. Because in the real

universe the extragalactic foregrounds will not be exactly

Poisson-distributed, the frequency (in)dependence of the

lensing signal will in principle provide the most robust

constraints on the contamination. In this paper, we were

unable to obtain useful constraints this way because of

the limited range of frequencies on WMAP (all in the

Rayleigh-Jeans regime where the tSZ signal has the same

frequency dependence as CMB) and the low statistical

signal-to-noise. Both of these problems should be alleviated

with high-resolution data sets covering many frequencies,

e.g. as expected from the Planck satellite [111].

All the symbols are lost because I have complied with the plain text
constraint (for now, while the issue is being discussed).

Basically, they didn't find any lensing effect using WMAP data, they put
forward possible explanations for the failure to detect it, and they, as I
do, look forward to Planck.

Come on, admit it - what's the fun in watching Planck go up if there is only
one pony in the race??  When COBE went up Smoot was hoping to 'save the big
bang theory' as he put it in his book.

Earlier messages on this issue fell on deaf ears - I had to up the ante.
Any more silence and I would have had to start claiming that the Big Bang
was disproved etc etc.  Thankfully, by shaking the tree hard enough and long
enough, a few friends have fallen out and are prepared to discuss the issue.

Now, there, - it wasn't anywhere nearly as bad I was making out, was it?
All you guys had to do was to *consider* the data and observation rather
than avoiding it (at least here on this forum).

Although the curvature of spacetime is invariant, the description of

&gt; &gt; &quot;Dear Robert,

&gt; &gt; What you said isn't entirely true.  There was quite a bit of
&gt; &gt; press coverage at the time, including the UK Guardian and USA
&gt; &gt; Today as I recall.  I have to give a lot of credit to those
&gt; &gt; responsible for establishing the standard cosmological model.
&gt; &gt; They are no fools, and bringing down this model is no easy task.
&gt; &gt; I've been trying very hard to test the model in many and various
&gt; &gt; ways, with some success, but a lot of `false alarms'.  Not sure
&gt; &gt; why I am now viewed as such a stiff opponent, to the point that
&gt; &gt; people are likening me to a Copernicus or Galileo.  For a start,
&gt; &gt; I will never be such a towering giant as they are.

&gt; &gt; Next month I am chairing a major conference in London, to debate
&gt; &gt; the `status of the status-quo'.&quot;

&gt; &gt; I asked him why nothing was being said - he said that was wrong,
&gt; &gt; that there had been discussion as you can see above.

&gt; &gt; The other paper is (no lensing) is found here:-
&gt; &gt; On the absence of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave
&gt; &gt; background

&gt; &gt; Richard Lieu &amp; Jonathan P.D. Mittaz

&gt; &gt; Huntsville, AL
&gt; &gt; 35899

&gt; &gt; http://eprintweb.org/S/authors/All/mi/Mittaz/6

&gt; Richard Lieu is a responsible critic of his own work, and admits
&gt; to having encountered many &quot;false alarms&quot;.

&gt; Lieu DOES NOT CLAIM that his results prove that the CMBR is
&gt; sourced locally. Stop putting words into his mouth, and keep your
&gt; insults to yourself.

&gt; Jerry
">

RKS:
Lieu can not make such grand claims and still get funding and tenure in the
USA, he has to be very cautious.  I found another recent paper that also
found no lensing:
Cross-correlation of CMB with large-scale structure: weak gravitational
lensing
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0406004

But I am also mystified here - what insult are you talking about?  Are you
suggesting that attacking the Big Bang theory because it is a weak theory
but the only one we have is some kind of insult?  Are you suggesting that
those who don't agree with the status quo are 'insulting the big bang'??

Well, in my opinion the Big Bang is just a theory, actually a model, that
someone dreamt up.  It fitted some of the data and then seemed to be
confirmed with a prediction, the CMBR.  But that model was ditched because
it didn't work - it failed to explain some of the basics.  Of course no-one
said this too loudly in public until a newer model came along - inflation.
The 'beauty' of this version is that it gave quantum physics a front row
seat at the party.

Well, versions of inflation crash and burn at regular intervals.  The
current model is the lambda CDM.  It is squeaky clean, as far as
cosmological models can be squeaky clean.  But when the better model happens
along then we can admit all the failures of the old model.

I'm breaking the secret cosmologist's code - I'm revealing the weaknesses of
the current model before a replacement is ready to take over.  But then I'm
obviously not a cosmologist...

So, you say that I am 'insulting'?  Curious.

I had to beat the bushes pretty hard just to flush out a few supports of the
status quo.  Now they are out I'm happy - it really livens up the Planck
satellite project when there is a two way bet.  Yes, WMAP can't supply the
data to settle this issue but Planck can.

Hey, don't you remember how much fun COBE was when the ripples were in
question??  So what is Planck going to do - paint an even prettier picture
of 'the face of God' (as Smoot once put it, more or less).

As it stands, this could go either way.  There are some alternative
explanations for lack of the shadow effect, the failure of the lensing
effect is a little more tentative.  Let's place our bets and see who wins
when Planck has a decent look at the radiation.

I thought/think my comments to Sam were/are fair.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you go back far enough the motion of the objects
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; through space is greater than the expansion rate of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; space in their area.  Thus if we go back in time we do
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not see objects crashing in at ever greater speed as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the Gamow Big Bang model envisaged, but we see
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; objects slowing down ever more.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No reason that their &quot;local kinetic motion&quot; need
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; change at all.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Local kinetic motion does not change.  That's the
&gt;&gt; &gt; point.  Andromeda is heading toward us because
&gt;&gt; &gt; of local motion.  When the universe (in the past) was
&gt;&gt; &gt; much smaller, the expansion rate was far less and
&gt;&gt; &gt; local kinetic energy would dominate it the apparent
&gt;&gt; &gt; motion of a distant galaxy would be given by
&gt;&gt; &gt; its local kinetic motion and not by its distance alone.

&gt;&gt; OK.  But in the far past, Andromeda may not have
&gt;&gt; been part of our (today's) local group.

&gt; There are no galaxy clusters heading toward each other?
&gt;  It is my understanding that galaxy collisions are
&gt; common - surely this occurs with clusters as well.
">

I don't think we could say today if two clusters were
"intertwined", that they were actually two different clusters,
destined for separate places.  I think we'd just see large
differential velocities.  But I would guess that unless expansion
stopped, if we can resolve them into clusters now, they will
never "mechanically" interact in the future.

&gt;&gt; &gt; One can not extrapolate from the expansion of the

&gt;&gt; if Gamow may or may not be strained by what you
&gt;&gt; are &quot;seeing&quot;.

&gt; If you were to just turn the clock back and not the
&gt; motion of galaxies would you conclude, from that
&gt; alone, that a big bang event must have occurred if
&gt; you turn the clock back far enough?  As I see it, the

&gt; common point between them.  If we reverse time

Would be interested to know, independent of current discussions.

I am owner moderator of two of the larger science and medicine Yahoo!
discussion groups (Evolutionary Psychology - 3,500 members; Psychiatry
research - 1,200 members) and moderator of a further two ('Mind and Brain'
560 members and 'Cognitive Neuroscience' 715 members).  Was a moderator of a
Yahoo! physics group but Yahoo! does not seem to attract members from the
physics community - they've been here for too long already :)  By
comparison, Sci.physics has 2,800 members, sci.physics.relativity has 1,060
and sci.astro has 880 (rounded off figures from when I last looked).

Note that the news messages I post here are just the ones I stumble across

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One can not extrapolate from the expansion of the

We own USENET to the same extent that we own the internet and the world

There is a discussion of the Hubble distance and

&gt; &gt; No. As you go back in time the Hubble constant
&gt; &gt; increases so their speed actually increases.

&gt; But as the distance between objects decreases their speed decreases - half

Yes.

Look at the slope of the black lines in this diagram:

http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_03.htm#mstd

If you drop a vertical line to the side of the centre,
the slopes are greater in the past.

Acceleration added to that diagram would make it
look like an upside-down bell with the curves
starting to open out towards the top.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But the expansion

&gt; &gt; &gt; the Big Bang postulates.

&gt; &gt; It slowed down for about 6 billion years as expected but
&gt; &gt; then seems to have gradually switched to accelerating.

&gt; Where can I find a run down on speed of expansion with time? (as measured).

The only way we have to measure speed directly is the
red shift. Relating that to luminosity gives the
relationship.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; ... and what evidence, if any, is there
&gt; &gt; &gt; for this turn around in observed expansion??

&gt; &gt; The redshift versus luminosity chart for Type Ia supernovae.

&gt; I was aware that the type Ia was used to determine the accelerating
&gt; expansion, but what of the slowing down for 6 billion years - type Ia as
&gt; well?  Who did this work and when?

It's all one really, the model parameters are adjusted to
fit the observations and that's what comes out. I saw the
6 billion year figure on one of the web sites and it stuck
in my mind as it was intriguing that it is close to half
the present age.

Perlmutter has dne much of the work in this area so
this site should be a good start:

I don't have any paper references to hand and I have to rush

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The physics of general relativity is conceptually distinct--even if its equations of motion can be &gt;reduced to Newtonian equations in many practical cases, such as with respect to the motion of &gt;the moon, or, as we will see shortly, the overall evolution of the universe.
&gt;properties are uniquely specified (via gravity) by the bodies inhabiting them. Gravity curves the &gt;spacetime grid, so general relativity thus describes gravitational interactions as manifestations of &gt;the spacetime curvature. Objects &quot;fall under gravity&quot; from less curved parts of spacetime to &gt;more curved parts of the spacetime. (When spacetime becomes infinitely curved, as in the case &gt;of black holes, the gravitational force is so strong that spacetime closes on itself, creating what &gt;is called a singularity in the fabric of the underlying spacetime continuum. Nothing can escape &gt;such objects.)
&gt;According to Einstein's general relativity equations, the spacetime containing matter cannot &gt;remain stationary and must either expand or contract. Galaxies and other sources, then, are not &gt;strictly expanding away from each other but rather are attached to the fixed grid on the &gt;expanding fabric of spacetime. Thus, the galaxies give us the impression of moving away from &gt;each other. Imagine the surface of a balloon, on which you put dots. Then start inflating the &gt;balloon. The distances between the dots will increase, so if you live in one of these dots, you &gt;will interpret this as the dots--which represent galaxies in this example--moving away from each &gt;other. In reality, of course, they remain in the same positions, with respect to latitudes and &gt;longitudes on the balloon, and it is the fabric of the balloon that is actually expanding.
">

This picture of the universe is convoluted and unphysical. It requires that the abstract entity of "spacetime" to have material physical properties such that it is able to carry the galaxies along as it expands.

A much better interpretation is that the galaxies are expanding into pre-existing stationary, structured and elastic space filling medium called the E-Matrix from the point of BB. This interpretation gives rise to a new theory of gravity called DTG and a new theory of relativity called IRT. DTG and IRT are described in the paper "Unification of Physics" in the following website:
