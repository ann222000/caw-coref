Great job, Accorsi. No special teams, no DBs, no defensive line.

The special teams and defensive backs have only been a problem for...
what, 6 years?

Um, yeah.   Regardless of whether or not EA sucked as a GM, he's kinda
not the GM anymore.

But most of these players are EA's. EA's suckage still reeks even
after he left the team. It will take a couple of more seasons to clear
out EA's deadwood with quality players.

They look worse on defense without Ernie. Your argument holds no

EA got most of the starters. He took Webster way too early, overpayed
for Madison. But since you are an EA fangirl, no reasonable
explaination will hold water to you.

Hey Ernie. They are your players. You got them. Reece is trying hard
to get rid of all of your deadwood. And unlike you, Reese first draft
has looked better than any of yours did.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not the GM anymore.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But most of these players are EA's. EA's suckage still reeks even
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after he left the team. It will take a couple of more seasons to clear
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out EA's deadwood with quality players.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They look worse on defense without Ernie. Your argument holds no
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EA got most of the starters. He took Webster way too early, overpayed
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for Madison. But since you are an EA fangirl, no reasonable
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explaination will hold water to you

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He retired. They got worse. Get it, Mary?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hey Ernie. They are your players. You got them. Reece is trying hard
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to get rid of all of your deadwood. And unlike you, Reese first draft
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; has looked better than any of yours did.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; When they win a Super Bowl with Reece and Reese, I'll be the first to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; offer congrats to you on your insight.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Where was your Super Bowl win, Ernie? 3 teams, 3 decades and you had
&gt; &gt; &gt;none.

&gt; &gt; Weren't you saying the same things about the Mannings at about this
&gt; &gt; time last year?

&gt; LOL.

Hey Ernie. You don't get credit if the Giants win the Super Bowl
somewhere down the road. You are not with the team anymore (Thank
God!).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great job, Accorsi. No special teams, no DBs, no defensive line.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Um, yeah.   Regardless of whether or not EA sucked as a GM, he's kinda

Exactly. It's Ernie's fault if they don't win a Super Bowl, but he
gets no credit if they win one.
