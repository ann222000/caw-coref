Al though we have lost Merlin, he will always be Magic Rabbits' logo,
and will always remain in our hearts. He wanted to be heard leader, but
could never dominate The Jump.

Go here to see Merlin gazing into the Mirror of Erised;

You have misinterpreted her post, she meant that her bun wants dinner. My
Liza would say I love you mom and please keep Jodie from eating all of my
food. Jodie would say, what else is there to eat? and why won\'t Liza play
with me, I am so cute! Carla Liza and Jodie.

Flippity fell in love with his reflection. Kept licking it, then peering
behind the mirror, trying to figure out where the other rabbit went. He
would lay next to the mirror, licking his reflection over and over and over.

This was pre-bonding days.

If Eugene looked into a mirror, he would probably say, &quot;Mommy is
right, I AM the most handsome little bunny in the world!  I think she
loves me a lot, because each morning and night I stretch out and she
gives me the most wonderful &quot;bunny&quot; massages, in fact, I quiver and
tooth purr and even sometimes make this little &quot;squeaky&quot; sound.  This
is the life, good food and lots of loving.&quot;

Cocoa spoke to me in a dream once, but other than that...one day, he looked
at me when I got annoyed with him about something, and I'm sure he said &quot; Oh
mom, chill out, don't you trust me?&quot; :)
