Goan Dishes (Dishes From Goa)
------------------------------
The intermingling of Arabian, Portuguese and native cultures is reflected in
the cuisine of Goa, which is a unique blend of richness and simplicity- the
constantly recurring notes being struck by the fish and the coconut. Goa is
also unique in the sense that this mixture of East and West co-exists in a
friendly and peaceful lifestyle. The best of both worlds has been absorbed
and knit into a culture very distinctly different from that of any other
part of India. This is well reflected in its cuisine.

In the villages, food is generally cooked on wood fires in clay pots.
Homesick Goans the world over dream and reminiscence about the simple life
and food of their childhood days, trying to re-create the smoky flavor of
the mid-day curry and the glass of fresh toddy. Even today, most homes in
Goan villages have preserved the tradition of wood fires and clay pots.

The requisites for authentic Goan cooking are certain ingredients peculiar
to it. Hardly any Goan dish is complete without coconut as one of the main
flavoring agents. Fresh coconut, in one form or the other, is added or
grated, ground fine into a paste or in the form of a milk, extracted from
the flesh of the fresh coconut. These ripe coconuts are available in every
open market in Goa and often in grocery stores too.

For most Goan fish and meat dishes, red, dried chilies / peppers are used.
The Goan native chili / pepper is large and pungent. It gives red colour to
the cooking without the fierce pungency of the normal Indian chili / pepper.
Since the Goan chili / pepper is not always easy to obtain, the Kashmiri
chili / pepper is used instead. It has the same qualities as the Goan red,
dried chili / pepper. This red dried chilies / peppers form the major
ingredient for the ground spices in most fish and meat dishes.

Now Let's Start With The Recipes..... .....

This popular Goan curry is traditionally made with pork meat and various
other organs like the liver, intestines, heart and tongue. Traditional

refrigerate - it tastes even better with time!

2 large onions chopped fine
15 cloves of garlic made into a paste
Thumb-sized piece of ginger made into a paste
Golf ball-sized lump of tamarind soaked in 1/4 cup of hot water

Grind the whole spices (dry red chillies, cumin and coriander seeds,
cinnamon, cloves and peppercorns) in the vinegar and keep aside.

Bebinca
(rich layered pudding)

Ingredients:
1 kg castor sugar
3 cups of coconut milk (extract of 2 coconuts)
20 egg yolks
100 gm flour
1/2 tsp grated nutmeg
2 tsp cardamom essence
1 cup clarified butter (ghee)

Method:
Mix the castor sugar with the coconut milk till dissolved. Beat the egg
yolks till creamy and add to the coconut milk and mix the flour in it
thoroughly, without any lumps. Add this to the mixture of coconut milk,
sugar and eggs, along with the nutmeg and cardamom.

Take a deep pan, about 6 inch in diameter and put a tablespoon of clarified
butter in it. Put it under a grill (medium heat). Take it out of the grill
and pour enough batter in the pan to cover the bottom about ½ inch in
thickness. Put under the grill for about 2 minutes and let it cook till it
is a deep brown in color. Remove from grill, put a dessert spoonful of
clarified butter over the cooked layer, following it with enough batter to
cover the first layer, about ¼ inch thick.

Repeat this process till all the batter and clarified butter has been used
up in the same way. The batter must always be in the same proportion. The
last layer has to be the clarified butter. When cool, turn out onto a dish,
keeping the first layer face down. Decorate the last layer with a few
slivers of toasted almonds if desired. To serve, cut into slices.

Puranpoli

This is a very popular dessert created during the Hindu festival of Holi.
Holi is the last day of the Hindu calendar. On the eve of this festival a
huge wood pyre is made and set afire. Discarded or unwanted materials like
dead wood of trees, broken pieces of furniture etc. are also put in the
fire. This symbolises the destruction of one's ill feelings and/or
animosities towards others. The next day the Holi Festival is celebrated by
playing with colours in the morning with friends and neighbours getting
together. In the evening visits are made to friends and relatives when
sweets are offered and good wishes extended to one another.

Ingredients:
1/2 kg lentils (dhal)
1/2 kg. Cane sugar (jaggery)
1/2 k.g white flour (maida)
100 ml. oil
1 teaspoon cardamon powder
1 teaspoon hydrogenated oil (ghee)

Method:
Wash gram dal and boil this with half tea sp.salt and water till it is very
soft. When it is slightly cold strain and add jaggery and grind to a fine
paste, If it is sticky put it on a low fire and dry up completely. This is
called puran.
Knead maida with half teaspoon salt with water.It should be neither very
hard or too soft.Add oil and knead it till oil is absorbed and now do equal
balls of puran and kneaded maida. Roll maida ball into a small puri.Fill it
with puran ball. MAKE it into a ball and roll to a poli.

Put on the pan and fry it dry turning both sides. Eat this melted with pure
ghee. It is delicious eaten hot and with a nice cup of tea.
