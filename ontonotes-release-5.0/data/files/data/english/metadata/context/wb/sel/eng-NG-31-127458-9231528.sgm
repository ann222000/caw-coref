Although I don't post on her as often as I usde to, I haven't noticed any
post from Martyn either. I didn't get round the shows last year so I haven't
had the chance to ask anyone.
Cheers, John

He stormed off in a huff ages ago, sommat to do with the 101FC club I
think, not sure if anyone in here was involved or not.  Sometimes he
pops his head up and says something.

Other than that he's fine, last time I emailed him (which was some
months ago now).

I don't think his absence from this NG has anything to do with the 101FC
club, although ICBW.  My understanding is that he has had some serious
health issues and is concentrating his energies into overcoming those.  He
does post here occasionally, but I haven't had much luck emailing him
off-group.  He hasn't been to any of the shows for a long time.

Dunno about the rest of youse, but I miss the guy and his dry, but wicked,
sensayuma.

you are correct. I'd also like to point out that i don't think anyone
anywhere could make Martyn go anywhere or do anything if he didn't want
to himself! ;)

Indeed. His absence from anywhere should be because he's spending his
time and energy getting better and relaxing by floating around various
canals and not sitting in front of the computer all day.

I should hope that will one day be back when he's all sorted and better.

Thanks lads, I wondered where he'd gone and I'm sorry to hear he's got
health problems. Hopefully I might actually get  to some of the shows next
year when I get Doom Trader back on the road.

I'm hoping to have the 110 on the road for Eastnor.  But it's by no means
certain.

From some emails I had a while ago, his last posts here and a website
or two he set up, I got the strong impression he'd gotten extremely
pissed off with the 101FC club and that was part of why he wandered
off, one of his last postings in here even threatened to some nameless
person who might be reading that he might reveal personal emails set
to him by them.  I inquired about his health as I too thought it had
been very bad but he said he was fine.

Chances are it's a combination of things, I know from personal
experience that once you stop posting to usenet for a while it can be
a few years before you get around to doing it again.
