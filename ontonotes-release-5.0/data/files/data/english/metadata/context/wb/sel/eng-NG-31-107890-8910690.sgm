I am volunteering to lecture an Introduction to Radio Restoration at our
local ham club K3MJW.  The first class will be an &quot;Elmer Night&quot; some 4th
Tuesday of a  month after Kutztown (likely October 23rd).  I intend to cover
the simple basic aspects of electronic restoration.  Like preliminary test,
where to find parts, resources (this newsgroup), tube testing and component
replacement techniques. Also how to use an isolation transformer!

Furthermore, I want to offer a follow-up lab where interested parties would
get hands on to restore a tube radio.  I figure some donor AA5 radios would
fit the situation. They are simple to check, replace resistors, capacitors
and align. I am donating the class development time/lecture, caps,
resistors, dial cord, lamps, loaner test gear as needed.  But, I need
restorable radios.

If you have some restorable old AA5 (four/five tube, cracked cases, bad
wood, ugly, table top, console or any beginner's chassis) with point to
point wiring (not a PC board) or any simple AM tube radio, that you want to
get rid of, bring it to Kutztown and drop it off Table 347.  Include a note
with your services you provide and I will &quot;plug&quot; you in the lecture.

Please understand - I really can't afford to purchase or pay the postage on
multiple units so your old cast offs would be appreciated. Once developed, I
would be willing to send you my Power Point presentation as payment.  That's
not to say I will not appreciate receiving mailed unit.  But I can not
reimburse shipping for numerous &quot;class&quot; units.

I would not expect people to spend money on shipping a cast off donor unit
so Kutztown seems to be an opportunity.

Thanks again,

What a good (and nice) idea!

Most of my junque has gone out on &quot;Free Monday&quot; trips, but I will see
what I can scrounge up for Kutztown. And there will be plenty of dross
at the afterwards auction. My recent porch-puppies would not be
appropriate for beginnners' classes or they would be likely
candidates.

You *do* have a metered variac for diagnosis? I seem to remember that
you found one somewhere?

Thanks Peter,

There will be some experienced &quot;Hands on&quot; Hams taking this class.  They
could handle a more complicated chassis (porch puppies??) if you need to
clean out some more.

I do have a Variac.  Not metered.  I was going to present the varriac and
teach the Dim Bulb method.  I intend to upgrade my varriac someday.

I am hoping some forlorn Saturday after noon units will show up. And find
some isolation transformers too.

I appreciate your help!

Please show the newbies the old-timers cheap method of a 60 watt or so light
bulb spliced in series on an extension cord that you plug the radio into. In
event of a short, the bulb lights normally and no damage is done. If radio
is OK, it plays or tries, and the bulb is dim. With a variac, there is no
current limit and things can smoke.

GROWL........mumblemumble.... RANT WARNING

I sat on my fingers when PP posted on the Dim Bulb tester. But this is
too much.

OK, a dim-bulb tester is vaguely and only just better than nothing.
But it is NOT a valid diagnostic tool for anything much other than
dead-shorts. Why? Because it is simply not sensitive enough and far to
prone to local voltage variations, even minute-to-minute voltage
variations that even those with calibrated eyeballs will not get
enough useful information other than - This chassis *MIGHT* be OK - or
- There is a short somewhere. If it is off by 10 watts, that 10 watts
could be awfully expensive when the magic smoke escapes....

A proper current meter will be sensitive within a couple of watts or
less, may be done more cheaply than a socket and switch arrangement
necessary for the Dim Bulb set-up (hey, doesn't everyone own (at least
a cheap) VOM?) and is infinitely more useful than a dim-bulb tester.
Attach this to a variac, and one might even have a useful tool.

I will bring such a little device to Kutztown based on a R/S parts
box, a single receptacle, a couple of test points, fuse, indicator
light... and put it side-by-side with my Heath IP-5220 for accuracy
comparison. Anyone can do it and get _REALLY_ useful information. I
will demonstrate that as well.

Paul: This device is neatly portable as well, such that your &quot;class&quot;
might make one as a sidebar to their lessons.

Thank you all for tolerating my rant.

No reflection on Don or Paul or their means-and-methods, really. Just
a pet peeve of mine.

Have you tried asking Charlotte at Waves? They are usually at K-Town
and may be able to strap you to the roof or some such. Otherwise:

HEY ALL YOUSE GUYS FROM NYC and Environs:  Kutztown is perhaps a 2
hour drive (110 miles from Times Square to Rennigners) through some
gorgeous countryside and mostly on fast roads adjacent to cheap gas
($2.55 today for regular and NJ is cheaper yet). Get out and join us.
If individuals can come from Michigan, Vermont and well-beyond, NYC
should be a piece of cake.

You should post directly looking for a ride.

Nyah Nyah Na Nyan Na!!

RANT WARNING:

Isolation transformers are critical for any workbench, and after good
hand-tools the first thing any radio person should get... perhaps even
before
said tools.

Variacs, on the other hand, are either very handy diagnostic tools or
worse-than-useless anchors fit only to let the magic smoke out of an
otherwise
salvageable radio. I am not really sure if there is an in-between
other than
their original function as light dimmers.

Without both current and voltage metering, they are worse-than-
useless. With
the proper metering, they can be very handy tools.

Myths: A variac will help reform caps (with specific reference to tube/
valve
radios).

Fact: Only on those vanishingly few radios with solid-state rectifiers
that
pass B+ current at any voltage, and only if done over more time than
one cares
to consider. Bench DC supplies are best for this typically futile
purpose in any case.

In the case of a tube rectifier, most of them do not start to pass DC
until the
filament voltage reaches between 65% and 75% of nameplate rating. If
the B+ on the
particular radio is say.... 350V, that means that the first voltage
the
caps-to-be-reformed would see would be something between 227V and
263V... not
exactly a soft-start.

Myth: A variac will allow one to apply voltage gently to a radio, so
as to
discover problems before they become fatal.

Fact: No, not at all. True, a variac does allow a radio to see the
minimum
amount of current to trigger its functions... an AA5 with bad filter
caps may
begin to hum at 80V rather than 120V, similarly with a transformer
radio. But
if the caps are not so bad as to show audible hum, the variac ceases
to be
useful. And a variac will *not* tell you whether a repaired radio is
OK or not.

However, if the proper meters are put on the Isovariac, then some
real
diagnosis can happen: An AA5 which should, by calculation draw say...
35 watts
or so (0.3A), and draws 42 watts is dissipating 7 watts of heat
somewhere...
perhaps the output transformer. And, unless one has calibrated
eyeballs, the
difference of 7 watts will not show up on a dim-bulb tester.

Comes down to a current meter with fine enough increments to give
meaningful
information. Such a tool is useful right down the line from initial
diagnosis
to testing the completed results.

End Rant. And it could have been much longer.

But Peter, you've already advocated heavily for the issue of &quot;proper
metering&quot;, so in essence you are admitting that variacs can indeed be &quot;handy
tools&quot;, yes? The fact is, that metering doesn't always have to be in the
path of the AC line. There are lots of other ways to meter voltage and
current in a radio, amplifier, etc while bringing things up slowly on a
variac. Also, when we get into the realm of solid state equipment, a variac
goes from being handy to being essential.

I think that is what I have been writing all along.

*WITH* proper metering (inboard or outboard, but at all times), they
can  be handy.

*WITHOUT* proper metering (inboard or outboard but at all times), they
are worse than useless except as light dimmers.

I would posit that putting the metering in the AC path is the most
accurate method and most directly informative method of metering total
current in a workpiece. Sure there are &quot;other&quot; ways, and even may be
required for some items under some conditions. But for the purposes of
this  hobby and for *GENERAL* diagnostic purposes, in-path voltage and
current metering are essential. Metering other locations would require
outboard stuff anyway *in addition* to metering the AC path.

I can say the same thing for virtually any piece of test equipment. There's
no point to any of it unless you can measure what is going on. Maybe I
misread, but I only think your &quot;myths&quot; are valid if you don't have proper
metering.

For example&quot;
&quot;Myth: A variac will allow one to apply voltage gently to a radio, so
as to
discover problems before they become fatal.

Fact: No, not at all. True, a variac does allow a radio to see the
minimum
amount of current to trigger its functions... an AA5 with bad filter
caps may
begin to hum at 80V rather than 120V, similarly with a transformer
radio. But
if the caps are not so bad as to show audible hum, the variac ceases
to be
useful. And a variac will *not* tell you whether a repaired radio is
OK or not.&quot;

I can't think of any single piece of test equipment that will tell you
whether a repaired radio is ok or not. But I can think of any number of
cases where bringing up a radio slowly on a variac could indeed save it from
a catastrophic failure. For instance, what if, in the course of a repair,
you accidentally cause a direct short across the secondary of the power
transformer, or some other catastrophic short in the B+ circuit? Yeah, you
could hope the fuse (if it has one) will blow, but just slightly bringing up
the variac and watching the current meter will show the problem instantly.

As for forming caps, it can indeed be done with a variac in a radio with a
tube rectifier and a variac. Takes a keen eye on the volt meter across the
cap and some judicious &quot;feathering&quot; of the knob, but it works. I agree
however that cap forming is a fairly useless exercise in most, but not all
cases.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I would posit that putting the metering in the AC path is the most
&gt; accurate method and most directly informative method of metering total
&gt; current in a workpiece. Sure there are &quot;other&quot; ways, and even may be
&gt; required for some items under some conditions. But for the purposes of
&gt; this  hobby and for *GENERAL* diagnostic purposes, in-path voltage and
&gt; current metering are essential. Metering other locations would require
&gt; outboard stuff anyway *in addition* to metering the AC path.
">

I don't have anything ultra precise on the line, but do have both a good
volt and current meter built into my variac that give me a plenty good
indication if something is terribly wrong. If that happens, I rely on
in-circuit measuring to find the source of the problem. I assume you would
do the same.

No Sh*t!!

Ships passing in the night. I heartily endorse properly metered
variacs. I happen to keep a Heath IP-5220 that has a very nice
metering system.

Like this: http://www.oaktreevintage.com/web_photos/test_gear/Heathkit_IP-5220_w...

What I decry and despise are unmetered variacs.

We are on the same page, but somehow discussing at cross-purposes.

As to the 5220, I have recently glommed another one, I am torn between
setting up a bench at the summer house, or giving it away as a prize
for one of my once-and-former Holiday Contests... I feel a little bit
piggy having two of such a nice and useful item.

You are pulling our collective and several legs? The 'least' range on
that beast is 0-200A, +/-2% (8A). Digital to boot.

I am more thinking of a 0 - 1A analog meter accurate +/- 1% and
calibrated in hundreths of an amp... or am I spoiled by my Heath?

&gt; I am volunteering to lecture an Introduction to Radio Restoration at our
&gt; local ham club K3MJW.  The first class will be an &quot;Elmer Night&quot; some 4th
&gt; Tuesday of a  month after Kutztown (likely October 23rd).  I intend to cover
&gt; the simple basic aspects of electronic restoration.  Like preliminary test,
&gt; where to find parts, resources (this newsgroup), tube testing and component
&gt; replacement techniques. Also how to use an isolation transformer!

&gt; Furthermore, I want to offer a follow-up lab where interested parties would
&gt; get hands on to restore a tube radio.  I figure some donor AA5 radios would
&gt; fit the situation. They are simple to check, replace resistors, capacitors
&gt; and align. I am donating the class development time/lecture, caps,
&gt; resistors, dial cord, lamps, loaner test gear as needed.  But, I need
&gt; restorable radios.

&gt; If you have some restorable old AA5 (four/five tube, cracked cases, bad
&gt; wood, ugly, table top, console or any beginner's chassis) with point to
&gt; point wiring (not a PC board) or any simple AM tube radio, that you want to
&gt; get rid of, bring it to Kutztown and drop it off Table 347.  Include a note
&gt; with your services you provide and I will &quot;plug&quot; you in the lecture.

&gt; Please understand - I really can't afford to purchase or pay the postage on
&gt; multiple units so your old cast offs would be appreciated. Once developed, I
&gt; would be willing to send you my Power Point presentation as payment.  That's
&gt; not to say I will not appreciate receiving mailed unit.  But I can not
&gt; reimburse shipping for numerous &quot;class&quot; units.

&gt; I would not expect people to spend money on shipping a cast off donor unit
&gt; so Kutztown seems to be an opportunity.

I have a nice old blow up of the Sams for a Philco B569 from 1955. Size

Harking back several of Peter's posts on this thread, I find that,
diagnostically, I use my HV DC power supply far more than my variac,
since it is far more informative of circuit condition than the variac
is for the very reasons that Peter mentions. The biggest plus with the
power supply is that you can bring the B+ up from zero and monitor the
current in mA WITH or WITHOUT the filaments lit, each of which gives a
lot of information on the health of the circuits!
I agree that an isolated well metered variac is an important tool that
I would not want to be without, but I would get a good, well metered
HV DC bench supply first, followed closely by the variac.

Just my $0.02 on the subject.

Sigh, Peter.  You have little comprehension of equipment
specifications, and zero imagination.

A 3.5 digit meter will give 100 mA resolution on the 200 A range.
Wind ten turns of wire around the clamp and it will multiply everything
* 10, giving you 10 ma resolution, or you can go whole hog and wind 100
turns and read to 1 mA.  Get fancy and use a switch to give * 1, * 10,
or * 100 ranges.

What is wrong with digital?  To complex for you?

What I generally use is an AC power meter made for testing
appliances. It works OK, but I prefer digital because of my failing
eyesight.  A condition that is quite common as you age.  It also
eliminates errors in reading the analog meter.

Your idea is useless above 120 watts, and the turn on surge could
blow out the meter.  Good luck actually getting +/- 1% on an analog
meter.
