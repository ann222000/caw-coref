I was going through my mother's old things and found a cross-stitch sampler
that my grandmother made when she was expecting my mother. It's nearly 70 years
old. When framed, she used a plain cardboard backing (no padding) and glue
around the back edges. The glue had disintegrated, but the entire piece is
yellowed with a couple of small rust stains. I'd like to clean it and re-frame
it. How do I clean it? Can I hand wash it? Will the colors in the floss run?
What about dry-cleaning? How can I remove the glue that is around the fabric
edges?

I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks!

Don't dry clean it! I'm assuming this is stitched with cotton on either
muslin or linen; if so, there should be no problem with washing it. It
may not be possible to remove all of the yellowing -- depending on when
the cardboard was made, there may have been a little or a lot of acid in
the paper, and it's partly the acid that discolors the fabric.

First, assemble the things you need and set up a work area. If you have a
sink with a sprayer, that works especially well -- I tend to use my
bathtub, since the shower head has a removable, adjustable sprayer. If
you have hard water, have some filtered/distilled water on hand for a
final rinse. (Minerals in water that end up in the fabric with
washing/rinsing decay over time, and cause little rust or acid spots --
rusty, or yellow/brown.) Get a mild detergent (I prefer Orvus; see the
previous thread about cleaning old textiles) -- since this is a valuable
family piece, I'd go ahead and spring the $3-4 for real quilt soap rather
than using dish detergent or shampoo. For the rust stains, find a rust
remover that is okay for fabrics -- like Wink, available at most grocery
stores. Have on hand at least two clean, thick terrycloth towels, too --
white or undyed towels are probably best, and a couple of Q-tips. It
would also help to have an iron.

Submerge the piece in a mild solution of the detergent and let it soak for
a few minutes. Don't let it fold in on itself; it's possible that the
threads may bleed a little, and you don't want those dyes redepositing on
the fabric. It's possible that the glue will soften; I wouldn't worry
about trying to get it all out while you're washing it -- let it soften a
little if it will, and scrape or peel it off separately. (Better yet --
you can wet it ahead of time, and try to get the big globs off before you
start washing. Your success depends on the type of glue -- you may end
up having to just leave it.)

Empty the basin and rinse the piece thoroughly with the sprayer. If the
dyes run, keep rinsing until they don't. If the spots you think are rust
haven't disappeared, put some Wink on a Q-tip and touch it to the rust
stains *while the fabric is still wet*. (Handle this stuff carefully --
in fact, you might want to wear rubber gloves and watch the ventilation --
it's pretty heavy-duty stuff.) If the stains are rust, they'll disappear
pretty quickly. Rinse the piece again, as thoroughly as possible (ending
up with the filtered/distilled water if you need it) then roll it up in
one of the towels without folding the needlework.

Let it sit while you heat up the iron. (A medium setting -- just into the
&quot;steam&quot; zone is good. Don't use steam, though.) Lay out another clean,
thick towel (I double mine) on the ironing surface, and lay the needlework
face down on it. Press the sampler dry from the back. Be patient, and
don't move the iron back and forth a lot -- just pick it up and set it
down. It will still look wrinkled even as the fabric starts drying, but
look better as it gets drier -- the stitching will dry last, of course,
and you can quit even before it gets completely dry. Lay it or hang it
(on a skirt hanger, for example) somewhere to finish drying on its own. If
you haven't been able to get all the glue out, you'll have to work around
it -- just don't spread it further if it melts. (You can iron on a rag to
get melted glue off the iron.)

The towels are important in the process -- for one thing, if the threads
run, a thirsty terry cloth towel is going to tend to wick the dyes away
from the fabric. (This works better with a linen fabric than with muslin,
but will help in both cases.) Also, when you press the needlework on top
of the towel, the stitches won't flatten -- you'll be surprised at how
freshly-stitched a piece can look when you're done.

If you're going to use the original frame, all you'll have to do is get
some acid-free foam core cut to size to mount the needlework on. (I
usually lace it -- i.e., wrap it around the foam core and make long
stitches in back from top to bottom and right to left that can be adjusted
-- but you can also pin it to the back of the foam core with small
non-rusting pins.) If the original frame has glass in it, consider using
something to hold a space between the needlework and the glass -- that
will cut down on damage in the future. Matting (use acid-free mat board)
will accomplish the same thing, if you're buying a new frame. The
stitches shouldn't touch the glass. If the frame doesn't have glass, you
can use a thin layer of cotton batting (look for &quot;heirloom&quot; look batting
at quilt shops) for padding between the foam core and the needlework. I
would recommend glass, though, for the sake of protection.

I think there are some web sites that might provide more information if
this isn't enough -- start under &quot;Needlework FAQs&quot; at this page:

Good luck!
