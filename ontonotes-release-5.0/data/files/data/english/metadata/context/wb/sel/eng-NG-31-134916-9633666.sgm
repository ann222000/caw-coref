The FO's comp is called TC Squadron Championship. But in the interest of improving activity, I'm sending
these tips to the whole wing. Red and Blue are no match for Green
anyway, so I have nothing to lose &lt;insert Muttley's laugh here&gt;

TIE-Free 259

I played this on Hard and it's quite... hard, even on Medium. I
passed this by pure luck, so I can only give you some tips. There's two
freighters and one corvette to protect. The freighters are headed for
their hyperspace point, while the corvette is there to protect the
freighters. You will lead a flight of 4 unshielded Tie
Interceptors and you will need your wingmen .
The enemy will initially consist of a flight of 4 Y-Wings and 6 or 8
R-41s. The Y-Wings will go straight for the freighters and the R-41s
will attack you and your flight. If the freighters get disabled, the
mission is over. I suggest you destroy at least one Y-Wing first (maybe
the number 1, so one of the others will attack you) and maybe then
destroy the R-41s. Try to coordinate with your wingmen, telling them to
attack something and ignore your targets. The R-41s come in two big
waves, so watch out!
Shortly after the first flights, you'll see the biggest threat of the
mission: an assault transport. This ATR will destroy the corvette unless you do something. But since you have no shields... yeah. This is
where you might need all your wingmen alive. Try to engage the ATR or
the Y-Wings after you obliterate the first flight of R-41s.
I say I got lucky because, at one point, there was only one Y-Wing
attacking a freighter with 80% shield, so I figured I had time to take
out the ATR and the R-41s before the freighter got disabled. Btw, the
Y-Wings will flee after the freighters leave, so try to take them all
out for secondary mission bonus.

XvT-Free 208

This one is really hard! It says &quot;4 Player Co-op compatible&quot;, but
that's BS!!! It's meant to be played by 4 players (that's why I
contacted you yesterday, Nightmare, and poked you today, Gist). But
after something like 10 tries, I managed to pass it alone on Medium.
You got two factories and two platforms to take out. Sounds easy?
Wrong! The two factories act like missile platforms that fire missiles
at anything that targets them! The proof that the mission is meant for
MP is that all the fighters you can choose will just fly around after
they take out the enemy fighters and won't help with the primary
targets. The only ppl that will engage the platforms is a flight of 4
missile boats. If the missile boats get destroyed, the mission is over.
And you must complete the mission in 10 minutes. Fun :P
When the mission starts, target Factory A and go for it. Fire all your
rockets in double fire mode when you have a lock. Then target Escort
Shuttle Protector, which will be aiming you a missile by this time. It
has no shields, so it's easy.
Then disable factory A immediately. Now, if you want to get a higher
score, but risk having a harder mission, try to take out the cargo
freighter and the transport that should be flying close to the
platforms. Btw, you'll be heavily engaged by some R-41s with missiles,
but ignore them because the other fighters will take care of them.
Remember to take flares, or one missile might make you spin and crash
on a platform.
Now you'll just have to be really good. Attack factory B until you
disable it, then move on to the platforms. Try to attack the platform
that's being attacked by the missile boats, if they're not busy with
the factories. Unless the boat's heavy rockets do a lot of hull damage
during the attack, just disable the platform and then move on to the
next one. Use the weapon cycle technique for better results and
attacking from below might be the best solution.
After all the factories and platforms are destroyed, take out the
remaining container, if you didn't destroy it earlier. Then just hyper
out, before the rebel fleet arrives.

Hopefuly, the other missions will be easier :(
