&quot;one of the hoariest of urban myths: That forcing higher fuel economy
standards on American car buyers is what's needed to encourage more
energy-efficient vehicles and make Detroit more competitive with its
import competitors.

&quot;That's wrong...&quot;

Oh really!!  Forcing higher mileage requirements may be the only way to
get the public to consider conservation.

Detroit is not competitive already, in many instances.  Economy is but one.

Only thing I see that will force higher fuel economy is for gas to get up to
around $10 a gallon. Most people have not even slowed down at $3.Over the
road trucks use alot more fuel than cars do and get alot less gas mileage. I
was told they get around 4mpg loaded! Maybe detroit could help them with gas
mileage too.

Most of us want higher fuel economy. If you build it, it will be sold.

Sure, lots of soccer moms ply the highways and byways of the country in
Suburbans and the like, but they would LIKE to have a Suburban that gets
better fuel economy. If they have to give up the Suburban to get the
economy, they'll pass on the economy. give them the form-factor of a
Suburban and better fuel economy, and they will beat the doors down at the
dealership to get one.

There is no &quot;forcing&quot; required. All you have to do is build the damn thing
and people will buy it. Maybe not everyone, but enough.

That article's right on target.

However, for things to _really_ change, somebody's got to come up with
batteries that can be fully recharged in a matter of minutes and can go
200 miles on a single charge.  The motors for hi-power all-electric cars
are here now - all that's needed is better battery technology.

Based on your figures, we could save a lot of fuel by putting seats in those
trailers and loading up a bunch of people all going to the same place.  All
we need is a good name for it and people will want to ride the new vehicle.

How about calling it the People Truck?  Or the People Hauler?  Or the
Omnibus?  Yeah, then it would be shortened and just called the Bus.

Think it would ever work?

Bingo!

If I have to choose between being cramped up in a subcompact Prius or Accord
or Volt vs. being able to not have my heat touch the roof of the truck in a
Suburban I'll take the Suburban/Silverado/Yukon/F150/Ram 2500...

...until they make a car/truck that gets the kind of mileage of a Prius but
is not a matchbox in size, then I'll keep driving the large cars.

I recently got my dad's '99 Sebring.  It is a fun subcompact car, but my
goodness it is small!   And it only gets about 5 MPG better on the highway
than my Avalanche.

I already knew that the current (NHW20) Prius was classified as a mid-size
but I had to look up the other 3.  The Accord and Sebring are both also
mid-size and I am not sure about the Volt but if you call mid-size cars
subcompacts then what do you consider a true subcompact like a Yaris or
Aveo?  It would seem that you would probably rank them right up there with a
key slot.  Along the same lines a full size would be a compact car to you.
Assuming all of this is true what would you consider to be a full size car?
Perhaps a stretch limo version of either a Crown Victoria or a Delta 88?  I
am just trying to understand your post better.

Why do we need a battery that recharges in minutes?  The question I usually
ask people who say this is imagine your gasoline car was on a completely
topped off full tank every time you get in it.  How often would you have to
stop at a gas station?  The answer would of course be only for the trips
longer than the range of the battery.  The problem with a ~10 minute
recharge is that it would require a dedicated 400 amp 3 phase 480 volt
service drop for each charger.  I can only imagine the kind of power lines
run to each charging station.  They would probably look similar to these:
http://danallen46.homeunix.org/West01MtHood.jpg

My solution would simply be a standardized battery pack that could be easily
swapped by a robot arm.  The larger the vehicle the more such packs the
vehicle would use so the Suburban-EV driver would still pay more than
someone in a smaller vehicle.

Put your numbers in, and you get similar results. Trucks can haul more
stuff in terms of tons of material hauled per mile per gallon of fuel
burned. You want to argue that trucks can haul a 500,000 lbs of stuff a
mile per gallon burned, go ahead. But the point is that when hauling
things, trucks are more efficient at hauling stuff than cars.

Railroads even more so.

What was a full sized car in 1949? in 1855? in 1965, 1975, 1985, 1995,
2005?  The size and definition keeps changing.

Go back to the '30s. There were full sise cars and luxury cars. The
full sise were comparable to what we have today, but taller (and
narrower).

What you are looking for is not a &quot;full sise&quot; but a &quot;luxury sise&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;one of the hoariest of urban myths: That forcing higher fuel
&gt;&gt;&gt; economy standards on American car buyers is what's needed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; encourage more energy-efficient vehicles and make Detroit more
&gt;&gt;&gt; competitive with its import competitors.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;That's wrong...&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fortune magazine article: http://301url.com/cmr

&gt;&gt; That article's right on target.

&gt;&gt; However, for things to _really_ change, somebody's got to come up
&gt;&gt; with batteries that can be fully recharged in a matter of minutes and
&gt;&gt; can go 200 miles on a single charge.  The motors for hi-power
&gt;&gt; all-electric cars are here now - all that's needed is better battery
&gt;&gt; technology.

&gt;&gt; Here's a taste:
&gt;&gt; http://www.teslamotors.com/
&gt;&gt; http://www.universalelectricvehicle.com/
&gt;&gt; http://www.zapworld.com/electric-vehicles/electric-cars/zap-x

&gt; Why do we need a battery that recharges in minutes?  The question I
&gt; usually ask people who say this is imagine your gasoline car was on a
&gt; completely topped off full tank every time you get in it.  How often
&gt; would you have to stop at a gas station?  The answer would of course
&gt; be only for the trips longer than the range of the battery.  The
&gt; problem with a ~10 minute recharge is that it would require a
&gt; dedicated 400 amp 3 phase 480 volt service drop for each charger.  I
&gt; can only imagine the kind of power lines run to each charging station.
&gt;  They would probably look similar to these:
&gt; http://danallen46.homeunix.org/West01MtHood.jpg

&gt; My solution would simply be a standardized battery pack that could be
&gt; easily swapped by a robot arm.  The larger the vehicle the more such
&gt; packs the vehicle would use so the Suburban-EV driver would still pay
&gt; more than someone in a smaller vehicle.
">

The reason you need a battery pack that recharges in minutes is simply
because the buying public is used to filling up in minutes.

Trying to get people to buy a new type of vehicle and asking them to
change their mindsets all in one fell swoop is a pretty tall order.
Tall enough, IMO, that they just won't go for it.

The reason why hybrids are selling now is becuase people don't have to
change anything in their habits.  They just buy, drive, and fill up like
they would in an &quot;ordinary&quot; vehicle.

The classification he cited for any particular model is not the point.
People that buy SUV are doing so because they perceive function and utility
that does not exist in other kinds of car. They have to weigh for
themselves, the cost to have the utility vs the savings to give it up. They
take the utility. If they could measure the utility of a Surburban that
delivers 15 mpg vs an Excursion that gives 20, then more Excursions would be
sold. As it stands today, the Excursion gives such poor numbers, Ford can
barely sell them. This only shows that people that buy large still compare
relative economy when they make their choice.

Not only do they consider fuel mileage, but they also consider stuff like
ergonomics -- placement of knobs and switches -- preceived quality -- fit
and finish -- comfort and style. Give all of this stuff in a package that
also delivers relative economy, and they will not be able to buiild them
fast enough. Deliver economy that is absent this stuff, and nobody will want
it. The real market is somewhere in the middle.

PS
I don't know nor care what the sales figures are for the Excursion and the
Suburban, I was only illustrating that people buy large and compare apples
to apples, where the apple basket is filled with the kinds of things that
they think is important to them.

Try living in Canada.  We send oil to the States to be refined into gas, and
then we end up paying a hell of a lot more for it then they do over there.
Our price is usually in the high 90 cents a liter.  You may be getting
screwed over by your prices (no offence intended), but so are we, just on a
different level.
As for people paying, I think you are mostly correct.  No matter how  high
the gas prices go, if people can afford to pay that price, they will.  If
not enough people can pay the high price, the gas companies will have to
lower it as they would loose too much money.  I agree with your earlier
statement.  We need to start using anti-matter.  An ounce of that stuff
would probably run our cars for years &lt;G&gt;

I hear ya on the railroad... 3 engines pulling 150-200 cars, which is

thing is, the rail is expensive too.. and you have to get it on the

&gt; Oh really!!  Forcing higher mileage requirements may be the only way to
&gt; get the public to consider conservation.

&gt; Detroit is not competitive already, in many instances.  Economy is but
&gt; one.
">

Not only that, forcing people to conserve will cause the cost of gas to
plummet.  At least that's what happened last time.  The alternative, huge
gasoline taxes, will drive the price sky-high.  You pick which one you want.

Anybody can say what they want, but you can't change history.  The last time
we did this, the price of oil fell until it was the lowest it had ever been.
A lot of people with strong opinions won't even bother to look at the result
from last time.  After that, people stropped driving cars and bought trucks
instead.  When enough people got their gas mileage down to 13 or 14, the
price went back up.

It's very simple, but the simple fact seem to elude a lot of Americans.

I've found that to be true on my own cars that have the instant readout for
mileage.  Repeated runs over the same piece of road at different speeds on
my way to work.

Problem is, you can't do it voluntarily by yourself.  It is downright
dangerous to drive at 55 while everyone else is doing 70 or above.  Nor can
I drive a car at 55 on the open road when both the car and highway are built
to sustain much higher speeds.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Fortune magazine article: http://301url.com/cmr

&gt; &gt;&gt; That article's right on target.

&gt; &gt;&gt; However, for things to _really_ change, somebody's got to come up
&gt; &gt;&gt; with batteries that can be fully recharged in a matter of minutes and
&gt; &gt;&gt; can go 200 miles on a single charge.  The motors for hi-power
&gt; &gt;&gt; all-electric cars are here now - all that's needed is better battery
&gt; &gt;&gt; technology.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's a taste:
&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.teslamotors.com/
&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.universalelectricvehicle.com/
&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.zapworld.com/electric-vehicles/electric-cars/zap-x

&gt; &gt; Why do we need a battery that recharges in minutes?  The question I
&gt; &gt; usually ask people who say this is imagine your gasoline car was on a
&gt; &gt; completely topped off full tank every time you get in it.  How often
&gt; &gt; would you have to stop at a gas station?  The answer would of course
&gt; &gt; be only for the trips longer than the range of the battery.  The
&gt; &gt; problem with a ~10 minute recharge is that it would require a
&gt; &gt; dedicated 400 amp 3 phase 480 volt service drop for each charger.  I
&gt; &gt; can only imagine the kind of power lines run to each charging station.
&gt; &gt;  They would probably look similar to these:
&gt; &gt; http://danallen46.homeunix.org/West01MtHood.jpg

&gt; &gt; My solution would simply be a standardized battery pack that could be
&gt; &gt; easily swapped by a robot arm.  The larger the vehicle the more such
&gt; &gt; packs the vehicle would use so the Suburban-EV driver would still pay
&gt; &gt; more than someone in a smaller vehicle.
">

That wouldn't work because battery packs degrade over time and the
big Surburban EV driver with 10 brand-new discharged battery packs
does not want to exchange his packs for 10, 4 year old charged battery
packs.  Batteries also self-discharge and the self-discharge rate over time
gets worse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The reason you need a battery pack that recharges in minutes is simply
&gt; because the buying public is used to filling up in minutes.
">

Your not understanding it I can see.  For starters there is such a thing.
It's called a Leyden Jar, AKA high-power capacitor.  The small
electric RC racers use these.

The problem is that if you have an electric car that can drive, for
example 5 hours continuiously, using 400 watts of power an hour
out of a battery pack, to recharge that in 1 hour means you have to
put in 2,000 watts of power in that hour.  If you want to shorten that
to 10 minutes, we are talking 12,000 watts of power in 10 minutes.
If you want to shorten that to 1 minute then that is 120,000 watts
of power in 1 minute to get the battery pack fully recharged.

Your electric stove probably dissapates about 200-300 watts of power
on a surface burner when the burner is turned on high.

&gt; The reason why hybrids are selling now is becuase people don't have to

&gt; they would in an &quot;ordinary&quot; vehicle.
">

There are a lot of people also clamoring for plug-in hybrids.  You need
to read up on the history of the General Motors EV1.  Espically read
testimonials - available many places online - from people who actually
leased one.

What is needed in battery technology is higher storage capacities
and cheaper prices.

NOT true of all vehicles.
I have driven vehicles that were more efficient at 70 than 55 (1975
Celica GT) It depends a lot on the gearing and the co-efficient of
drag.

My current TransSport seams to be best aroung 65 or so (115 - 120Kph).
Extra weight is a killer too. I leave the rear seats at home most of
the time as I don't need them. SHould leave the middle ones too and
half the crap I always carry with me.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If I have to choose between being cramped up in a subcompact Prius or

&gt; &gt;&gt; or Volt vs. being able to not have my heat touch the roof of the truck
in
&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; Suburban I'll take the Suburban/Silverado/Yukon/F150/Ram 2500...

&gt; &gt;&gt; ...until they make a car/truck that gets the kind of mileage of a Prius
&gt; &gt;&gt; but
&gt; &gt;&gt; is not a matchbox in size, then I'll keep driving the large cars.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I recently got my dad's '99 Sebring.  It is a fun subcompact car, but
my
&gt; &gt;&gt; goodness it is small!   And it only gets about 5 MPG better on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; highway
&gt; &gt;&gt; than my Avalanche.

&gt; &gt; I already knew that the current (NHW20) Prius was classified as a
mid-size
&gt; &gt; but I had to look up the other 3.  The Accord and Sebring are both also
&gt; &gt; mid-size and I am not sure about the Volt but if you call mid-size cars
&gt; &gt; subcompacts then what do you consider a true subcompact like a Yaris or
&gt; &gt; Aveo?  It would seem that you would probably rank them right up there
with
&gt; &gt; a key slot.  Along the same lines a full size would be a compact car to
&gt; &gt; you. Assuming all of this is true what would you consider to be a full
&gt; &gt; size car? Perhaps a stretch limo version of either a Crown Victoria or a
&gt; &gt; Delta 88?  I am just trying to understand your post better.

&gt; The classification he cited for any particular model is not the point.
&gt; People that buy SUV are doing so because they perceive function and
utility
&gt; that does not exist in other kinds of car. They have to weigh for
&gt; themselves, the cost to have the utility vs the savings to give it up.
They
&gt; take the utility. If they could measure the utility of a Surburban that
&gt; delivers 15 mpg vs an Excursion that gives 20, then more Excursions would
be
&gt; sold. As it stands today, the Excursion gives such poor numbers, Ford can
&gt; barely sell them. This only shows that people that buy large still compare
&gt; relative economy when they make their choice.

&gt; Not only do they consider fuel mileage, but they also consider stuff like
&gt; ergonomics -- placement of knobs and switches -- preceived quality -- fit
&gt; and finish -- comfort and style. Give all of this stuff in a package that
&gt; also delivers relative economy, and they will not be able to buiild them
&gt; fast enough. Deliver economy that is absent this stuff, and nobody will
want
&gt; it. The real market is somewhere in the middle.
">

Excellent observation but you are forgetting something - price.

I think the major factors people look at are:

size/utility/'functionality
price/how fast is the depreciation/how much will the lease be
mileage
ergonomics/styling
perceived life/warranty/how much will maintainence cost
quality/fit and finish

And not in that order.  All of these factors are interrelated.
And you can have a car score very poorly on some factors
but very well on others, and still sell well.

The problem with Detroit is Detroit mis-stepped in the 70s
by ignoring the relations of these facts.  People always talk
about how Detroit kept building big giant cars when everyone
wanted high mileage cars.  They forget that at the same time
that gas prices were rising and people were getting more
interested in better mileage, that a whole load of emissions
stuff was being shoved on to Detroit which was detuning
engines and loading them down with a lot of easy-to-break-down
systems.

If the US Government at the time had shown some leadership and
issued 5-7 year emissions deferrals in 1974 and Detroit had simply
kept building muscle cars, then people would have only briefly
flirted with the economy cars from Japan, and would have given
it up and kept buying Detroit Big Iron - as after the oil price
rising hysteria had died down, people would have given up the
fuel economy in favor of all of the other amenities of Detroit Big
Iron.

But instead what was happening is at the same time that the Japanese
were selling fuel efficient cars that were small and uncomfortable with
no amenities, Detroit Big Iron was getting slower, harder to fix, and
breaking down much faster.  Japanese fuel efficient stuff didn't have to
do the things to their 4 bangers that Detroit had to do to it's V-8's
to meet emissions - and the buying public rightly realized that they
could either drive around in a rattle trap tin can that was uncomfortable,
slow, but got great gas mileage and didn't break down as much, or
they could drive around in a luxury land yacht that was very comfortable,
but was ALSO slow, got terrible gas mileage, and broke down all of
the time.

In other words, the emissions regulations put Detroit Big Iron at a
disadvantage for at least a decade while Detroit redesigned engines,
transmissions, and everything else to meet them.

But, even that would have been survivable - but the problem was
that during this time the bean counters got control of all Detroit
automakers and started cutting corners.  Product quality fell and so
when Detroit finally could compete with the rattle cans from Japan
on the mileage basis, the quality sucked so bad that once more,
Detroit was -still- at a disadvantage.

Today, I think all the automakers have finally gotten back to the
basics of marketing cars, but there's been 2-3 decades of Detroit
missteps, and due to retirement liabilites of the Big Three, they
can no longer afford to undercut Japan to buy back all the lost
market share.   So it is going to be a long, hard battle for Detroit
since there's now an entrenched generation of Japanese car buyers,
and those people will never buy Domestic again.  It won't be
until their kids come of age and start buying cars, that the situation
will improve.

In many cars of Japanese origin I need the drivers seat all the way

For example I can't comfortably drive the Toyota Corolla, the steering

The cars I see in the UK, I travel their every few years, are

In NA a mid sized car needs at least a 2.7L V6 engine to sell.

However in both the UK and NA there seems to be a trend for some people
to go larger and some to go smaller, so the number of fuel efficient

Here in western Canada over 50% of vehicles are large truck based SUVs

And a bitch to back up to a loading dock...

&gt; Not only that, forcing people to conserve will cause the cost of gas to
&gt; plummet.  At least that's what happened last time.  The alternative, huge
&gt; gasoline taxes, will drive the price sky-high.  You pick which one you
&gt; want.
">

Must be my short term memory failing me, but I just can't recall any time
that the price of gas ever plummeted.  Regardless of conservation practices,
or any other influences intended to effect the market, the price has stayed
where it was.  It is a false logic that believes that conservation will have
any impact on the price of gas at all.

&gt; Anybody can say what they want, but you can't change history.  The last
&gt; time we did this, the price of oil fell until it was the lowest it had
&gt; ever been.
">

And when was the last time you did this?  What were those oil prices?  What
had they been before and after?  What did the price of gas drop (plummet...)
to after your conservation efforts?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A lot of people with strong opinions won't even bother to look at the
&gt; result from last time.  After that, people stropped driving cars and
&gt; bought trucks instead.  When enough people got their gas mileage down to
&gt; 13 or 14, the price went back up.
">

I must have missed that huge downswing in the price of fuel.  Damn - I hate
it when that happens.

Many of us find it easy to miss out on the events that never really occur.

&gt;&gt; slowing down to 55 will do the most to conserve fuel
&gt;&gt; i just read a study about mileage and cars,suv's  are at the most
&gt;&gt; efficient at 55mph regardless of what brand they are. between 30 mph and
&gt;&gt; 50 the cars consume more as well as over 60 to 90 mph seems 55 is the
&gt;&gt; sweet spot so it's no mistake that mileage is rated at that speed

&gt; I've found that to be true on my own cars that have the instant readout
&gt; for mileage.  Repeated runs over the same piece of road at different
&gt; speeds on my way to work.

&gt; Problem is, you can't do it voluntarily by yourself.  It is downright
&gt; dangerous to drive at 55 while everyone else is doing 70 or above.  Nor
&gt; can I drive a car at 55 on the open road when both the car and highway are
&gt; built to sustain much higher speeds.
">

I've found it to be true in real life measurements, but only in the
strictest definition of the word true.  In all of my vehicles, the age old
adages about easy starts, easy stops, etc. have certainly been born out, but
the difference in the fuel mileage between driving at 70 instead of 55, or
jumping on it a little bit instead of grandfathering it off the line, was
inconsequential.  In order to really impact mileage I find that I have to
put my foot into it completely, all the while - through the entire tank of
gas.  Not at all practical for most driving.  Otherwise, the difference in
mileage over a thankful is just not that significant.
