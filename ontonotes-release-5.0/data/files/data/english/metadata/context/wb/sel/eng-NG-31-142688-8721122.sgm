&quot;Weaker business conditions combined with a less favorable job market
continue to cast a cloud over consumers and heighten their sense of
uncertainty and concern,&quot; said Lynn Franco, director of The Conference
Board Consumer Research Center, in a statement.

&quot;Looking ahead, little economic improvement is expected, and with the
holiday season around the corner, this is not welcome news.&quot;

........................................................................... .......................

Tuesday's reports showing eroding consumer confidence and a further
weakening of housing do not bode well for retailers, who are already
bracing for a challenging holiday season.

Merchants have seen spending slow all year amid falling home prices
and higher gas and food bills.

Financial turmoil in August and escalating problems in the credit
market have made economists and retailers more nervous about the
prospects for a decent holiday shopping season.

Such anxiety is further heightened by a weakened outlook for September
sales.

Economy Sends Off Warning Flares

By PHILANA PATTERSON, AP Business Writer

New York (AP) --

Crumbling consumer confidence and slumping home sales could prove to
be a bad combination for retailers, and for the broader economy going
into the holiday shopping season, if the labor market contracts
further and chokes off spending, economic data showed Tuesday.

But markets took some heart from the warning signs, hoping that they
would goad the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates more.

Worries about jobs and the economy flared in September, driving a key
barometer of consumer sentiment to its lowest level in nearly two
years, a private research group said.

The bad news was compounded by a report from the National Association
of Realtors that sales of existing homes declined for a sixth straight
month in August, pushing activity to the lowest point in five years.
