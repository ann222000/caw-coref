I thought the whole point of giving Web merchants all that credit card
information (expiration date, the code number of the back, etc.) was so
they could get a purchase approved _before_ they processed it.
Apparently not.

For some as-yet unknown reason (perhaps the purchase of the Radiohead
album, which was denominated in pounds sterling), HSBC put a hold on my
credit card. (And I can't get it lifted until tomorrow, because only the
fraud unit can lift it and they don't work weekends. Grrrr!)

Yet purchases from Drugstore.com and Amazon went through and _produced
confirmations_, only to generate e-mail later saying there was a problem
with payment. Shouldn't they have rejected the transaction at the time I
made it?

Also, fuck HSBC for not notifying me of the hold. They send me e-mails
for every other fucking thing I or they do on the account. But a hold,
that they don't think is important enough to tell me about.

And I absolutely hate that all these kind of things happen on weekends,
so I have to wait until Monday to resolve them, while in the meantime my
blood pressure spikes.

Well, they *can* reject it before they process it.  Last week the Red Cross
website wouldn't accept my credit card donation, but didn't say why, just
said to contact the CC company.  Which also couldn't tell me why.  In fact,
the CC company didn't even seem to know that such a transaction was
attempted but denied.  Or wouldn't admit to knowing it.  Or something.

Look, there just aren't enough competent people to serve the
economy any more.

Last week I got an e-mail offer from Citi for a &quot;Line of Credit&quot;
card. Not a credit card, but a &quot;Line of Credit&quot; card. I applied
on-line. I got approved. I got a welcom e-mail. It said that
they'd be sending me the papers in ~10 days.

Next day I got _another_ welcome e-mail, with my name mis-spelled
(OK, I might have done it, I just don't know for sure). But there
was an 800 number to call in the message, so I did. There, they
know *nothing* about any  &quot;Line of Credit&quot; card.

I started thinking that I might have been &quot;phished&quot;, and said so.
Right away they transferred me to the fraud dept. There, we got
it straightened out, and got the spelling corrected, and the
_correct_ number for the &quot;Line of Credit&quot; card people.

So, on the one hand we have one hand not knowing what *it* is
doing, and on the other hand, well, I just don't know what the
other hand is doing. We'll see.

Ths point being, however ios that it's getting harder &amp; harder to
put together anything that will hold up.

Not if they didn't have some live way to run through approval. It could

Indeed.  There are a lot of cards in the sea.  I'm going to dump my
MBNA card fairly soon.  Just cuz I'm tired of the bimonthly
high-pressure sales call to try to sell me some optional coverage or
whatever.

You have the card so you can use the credit when you need to.  You
needed the credit.  It wasn't there.  So you have been carrying the
card around for no purpose.  Dump (I avoid using that other verb in
non-relationship contexts) them!

Estron mentioned, some time ago, that you're supposed to be able to
request *nothing* but a monthly bill. No unsolicited checks, like
fricking Discover likes to drop in my mail box. And laying off a card
for a while usually doubles their efforts to get business back.
*Discover example again.

I'm guessing that the hold is based on determining the exchange rate.
Pretty stupid in D.F.'s case, implemented the opening of business the
following business day. Who knows how many thousands percent the
British £ could bloat over a weekend. Or rather, the dollar.

Not as such. The negative aspect is that you will lose available credit,
which counts towards your used credit/available credit ratio.

So if you have a few cards and/or you cancel one that has a high credit
limit, your balances are going to be higher percentage of your total
credit limits.

That's another reason to have more than one card with higher credit
limits than you ever imagine using.

Though if the card has no annual fee, there's no need to cancel it. Just
don't use it. Or use it once or twice a year, so it won't be canceled as
inactive.

It's not completely free, I believe.  There is an administration

I spoke to the fraud unit (which must be in Hyderabad, but that's a
different rant).

It wasn't the Radiohead charge. They said it was a $90 charge that
triggered the hold, because it was higher than my average charge. Which
is a lie, because I've charged larger amounts on the card before without
a problem.

And the purchase was an online order from a friggin' _supermarket_. Do
many credit card thieves buy the week's groceries the first time they
use a stolen card? Especially when they have to give a real address to
actually _get_ the delivery?

The fraud unit also wouldn't tell me why I wasn't notified of the hold,
which occurred on the 18th. Which doesn't make sense, either, because
other purchases after the 18th went through and the goods delivered, no
problem.

So as soon as this card is paid off, I'm cutting it up and cancelling
the account.

Just guessing, but it might be a card that  begins accruing interest
from the moment of use, rather than after a grace period/bill not paid
in full.

Often a 2nd mortgage, home equity loan or line of credit is offered by
banks around here. The 2nd mortgage or home equity loan may be paid
out in a lump sum, or a book a book of checks made available so the
funds are only accessed only when desired, or a &quot;line of credit:&quot;
card, similar in looks to a Visa or MC is used to access funds.

Then again., this may be completely new and different.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Apparently not.

&gt; &gt;&gt; For some as-yet unknown reason (perhaps the purchase of the Radiohead

&gt; &gt;&gt; my credit card. (And I can't get it lifted until tomorrow, because
&gt; &gt;&gt; only the fraud unit can lift it and they don't work weekends. Grrrr!)

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yet purchases from Drugstore.com and Amazon went through and _produced
&gt; &gt;&gt; confirmations_, only to generate e-mail later saying there was a
&gt; &gt;&gt; problem with payment. Shouldn't they have rejected the transaction at
&gt; &gt;&gt; the time I made it?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, fuck HSBC for not notifying me of the hold. They send me e-mails
&gt; &gt;&gt; for every other fucking thing I or they do on the account. But a hold,
&gt; &gt;&gt; that they don't think is important enough to tell me about.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And I absolutely hate that all these kind of things happen on
&gt; &gt;&gt; weekends, so I have to wait until Monday to resolve them, while in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; meantime my blood pressure spikes.

&gt; &gt;The new Radiohead album that you can pay whatever you want for,
&gt; &gt;including zero? Just go back and get it for free. If you really want to
&gt; &gt;pay for one, you can always do it later.

&gt; It's not completely free, I believe.  There is an administration

My credit card was &quot;cloned&quot;, presumably implanting information from my
missing bill onto an otherwise-cancelled physical card.  There were
three spurious charges across an hour and a half.  Gas, supermarket,
and a movie.

The reason I think that they re-wrote my info onto the mag stripe of a
&quot;dead&quot; card was that the signature on the slip from the grocery was
readable, and was a name completely unlike mine -- presumably a name
matching the physical card.

So anyhow, the second thing that they bought with a stolen card was
groceries.  The third was a movie &quot;Like they're going to use a stolen
card then sit there for two hours?&quot;

There are a couple of brands of &quot;banks&quot; here that offer this.  At one
point I was considering a Manulife &quot;One&quot; mortgage.  It is supposed to
replace all of your bank accounts with a single line of credit based
on your mortgage.  You can split the account into up to ten
subaccounts and the statements track the interest and other charges
separately for each of the sub-accounts.  you can lock in an interest
rate on a portion of the debt in one of the subaccounts if you fear
rising interest rates.  I believe that they have a credit card
attached to it.

Charges immediately start accruing interest.  Payments, including
payroll payments, immediately reduce your mortgage interest.  If you
get paid on the 15th and make buy a plane ticket or something on the
22nd, then you've saved a week's interest on that money.  At debt
rates of interest, rather than savings rates.

Next question:  What do the US call &quot;Prime Rate&quot;?
I'm not sure what the US term is that corresponds to the Canadian
&quot;prime&quot; loan interest rate.  HELOCs like this typically charge &quot;prime&quot;
interest, which is currently 6.25% at my bank.  The big banks all set
their own prime rate, but usually match each other.  My own Heloc is
also at prime.  My separate mortgage, floating but inflexible, is at
prime minus 0.65%.  My non-HE LOC is prime plus 2.5%  My margin at one
broker would be prime, if I chose to use it.  My margin at my main
broker, should I bother to set it up, would be at prime plus 2%.

I suspect that Americans must not use the concept of a bank's &quot;prime
rate&quot; because of the terminology &quot;sub-prime&quot;.  In Canada, a
&quot;sub-prime&quot; mortgage is a good one, not a bad one.  Only the bad risks
pay more than prime.

My roommate got a letter in the mail today.  &quot;You have already been
approved&quot; for some card or other.

He is in &quot;orderly payment of debt&quot;.  Starting November 18th, his
various creditors get a pro-rata share of $50 a month.  His creditors
get a legislatively pre-set interest rate of 5%.

So how come he's been &quot;already approved&quot;?  He's been a bit twitchy

tiny pieces not long after he waved it at me.

Does &quot;You have already been approved&quot; have some wildly different

The loonie closed just under $1.05 US. Weird.

A lot of people here are pissed off that after accounting for currency
rates, Canadian prices are still 20 per cent or more higher than U.S.
prices for identical products. It turns out there are other factors
involved.

Here's a nice blooper from Agence France-Presse:

Most observers expect the Fed to cut its key lending rate by 25
percentage points, bringing it in line with Canada's rate of 4.50
percent.

Most borrowers get prime or prime+X as a rate for standard, fixed
mortgages. How close they get to prime get depends on the term, the

Subprime loans are made close to the prime rate, but to borrowers who

If you read the fine print, it will say something like you're approved

The big banks set the prime rate, basically all to the same thing, here,

Such rumours are interesting, and I've even vectored them
http://gossg.livejournal.com/147925.html , but they seldom come true.
I remember that one of the giant US banks (JP Morgan?) was supposedly
badly &quot;hedged&quot; to their gold holdings to the point that they would go
under or need a Federal bailout if gold ever succeeded in punching
through the $330 ceiling that it had bounced off of several times at
that point.  Eventually gold punched through that value and is now
closing in on triple that value and none of the big banks fell on
their face over metals exposure.

The rumours of an imminent Citi failure are comparable to those
rumours of the imminent death of [JP Morgan?] if gold ever broke
through $330.

&quot;Fool me once&quot; and all that.

Prices are always quoted before tax.  Provincial tax varies by
province, with none in my province.  Federal sales tax is 6%, down
from 7% and about to be cut to 5%.

So the 20% difference is not based on the SALES taxes.  Some Americans

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What's one of those, then?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just guessing, but it might be a card that  begins accruing interest
&gt;&gt;&gt;from the moment of use, rather than after a grace period/bill not paid
&gt;&gt;&gt;in full.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Often a 2nd mortgage, home equity loan or line of credit is offered by
&gt;&gt;&gt;banks around here. The 2nd mortgage or home equity loan may be paid
&gt;&gt;&gt;out in a lump sum, or a book a book of checks made available so the
&gt;&gt;&gt;funds are only accessed only when desired, or a &quot;line of credit:&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;card, similar in looks to a Visa or MC is used to access funds.

&gt;&gt;There are a couple of brands of &quot;banks&quot; here that offer this.  At one
&gt;&gt;point I was considering a Manulife &quot;One&quot; mortgage.  It is supposed to
&gt;&gt;replace all of your bank accounts with a single line of credit based
&gt;&gt;on your mortgage.  You can split the account into up to ten
&gt;&gt;subaccounts and the statements track the interest and other charges
&gt;&gt;separately for each of the sub-accounts.  you can lock in an interest
&gt;&gt;rate on a portion of the debt in one of the subaccounts if you fear
&gt;&gt;rising interest rates.  I believe that they have a credit card
&gt;&gt;attached to it.

&gt;Way too complicated for me to play with.

&gt;&gt;Charges immediately start accruing interest.  Payments, including
&gt;&gt;payroll payments, immediately reduce your mortgage interest.  If you
&gt;&gt;get paid on the 15th and make buy a plane ticket or something on the
&gt;&gt;22nd, then you've saved a week's interest on that money.  At debt
&gt;&gt;rates of interest, rather than savings rates.

&gt;Interesting idea, but who has the time to check all the ins and outs
&gt;to see if it is all really being credited properly
">

I'm still not seeing what &quot;line of credit&quot; means, let alone a &quot;line of
credit card&quot;.  For now, I'm assuming &quot;line of credit&quot; is some
marketing bullshit which just describes yet another way to get into
debt.

It's interesting, I find, that debt is often referred to as credit.

That's not what the oil companies say.  One of Alberta's biggest oil
companies promised not to invest a single dollar in Alberta next year
if the proposed resource royalty changes went ahead.  Several other
smaller companies made similar announcements.  The announcement on
whether to accept the recommendations was last week, with about 3/4 of
the proposed royalties to be charged.   According to the oil
companies, this will result in a depression in Alberta's oil business.

Not that I necessarily believe them.  EnCana is making a mess of
Calgary's downtown traffic for an entire year to build their 1.7
million square foot headquarters.  I can't see them going forward with
that project into a ghost town.  Since the Bow project hasn't been
cancelled, it shows that EnCana doesn't believe their own press
releases.

Anyhow, the announcement on royalties was made, then the loonie went
up another two cents.  So either nobody believes the oil companies or
something else is driving the loonie.

A line of credit, not unlike a credit card, as a fixed amount of
credit granted to you to use in any way you wish. You can draw on it
at any time for whatever use you wish, usually by writing a check.

A &quot;Home Equity&quot; line of credit is collateralized by equity in your

A &quot;line of credit&quot; is an agreement where you have access to a
pre-authorized instant loan.  If you suddenly need money, all you do
is draw on the line of credit.  Most credit cards are, indeed, such a
line of credit.

The poster above (Boron?) speculated that the advertised credit
referred to a &quot;Home Equity Line of Credit&quot;.  I agreed with her and
wrote about my experiences with HELOCs.  I have both a line of credit
that's based on my good record alone (prime plus 2.5%) and one that's
a second mortgage on my home (prime).  Both of mine are organized like
checking accounts.  I can get to both of mine from any Interac branded
ATM and almost any retailer in Canada.  On our Galveston visit, we
couldn't get to Interac from the cashier, but the ATM near the door
could get at my line of credit just like any other ATM card linked
account.  Some ATMs show the five-digit negative amount as a positive
balance, some as negative.

In double-entry accounting, every entry needs to have matching entries
in a &quot;debit&quot; account and a &quot;credit&quot; account.  Those of us with a
science background like to think of debit as &quot;positive&quot; and credit as
&quot;negative&quot; though I bet the finance geeks in the audience are
shuddering.  Just like physics, accounting has conservation rules, and
debits and credits must always sum to zero.

Until you mentioned that, I never noticed (or had forgotten noticing)
that &quot;Debt&quot; and &quot;Debit&quot; are obviously closely related.

Anyhow, from THE BANK'S point of view, your account is a debit, and
their debt.  Your credit card is money that's due to them.  The
context shift from bank to customer while keeping the name &quot;credit
card&quot; leads to some confusion.

Anyhow, I should start thinking of &quot;debit/credit&quot; instead of
&quot;positive/negative&quot;, and be careful not to diss finance geeks.  I
enter school the day after New Years, studying to become one.

The first thing to realize is that a strong currency isn't the answer

If the product is coming from the U.S., add some transportation costs.
Wages may be relatively higher in Canada in transportation, warehousing
and retailing, adding to cost. There may be a bit of duty hidden here
and there; free trade is far from absolute. And especially, a lot of
retailers, particularly the smaller ones, may be locked into longer-term
supply contracts and don't have the clout to force prices down, at least
not quickly.

The sense I get is that Canadian and U.S. prices will gradually creep
closer together, but it will take a long time. A lot of people imagined
it would happen all of a sudden, and that's not the case.

The rate reduction? Yes, it will. But as someone said upthread, the
agencies who do that kind of thing -- the Fed in this case -- tend to
signal their moves way early, allowing the market to adjust, and by the
time it actually happens, there is often barely a ripple.

Over time, though, it will push the U.S. dollar lower. It's falling
against the loonie now; no reason for it to stop with lower U.S.
interest rates.

&gt; companies, this will result in a depression in Alberta's oil business.

They would say that whether it is true or not. And it's not. They have
far too much invested in Alberta and they want the oil far too much to
walk out just because the price is going up a little bit. Did you notice
them walking out of the Middle East when OPEC was jacking up the prices
all those years?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not that I necessarily believe them.  EnCana is making a mess of
&gt; Calgary's downtown traffic for an entire year to build their 1.7
&gt; million square foot headquarters.  I can't see them going forward with
&gt; that project into a ghost town.  Since the Bow project hasn't been
&gt; cancelled, it shows that EnCana doesn't believe their own press
&gt; releases.

Since the last time Alberta set royalty levels, oil has become a much
scarcer and more valuable resource. You can't just let what is left be
pumped out at 1970s prices. Nobody else in the world does.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seventies.  There's a slightly higher point from the early sixties
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that's on the edge of breaking.)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The loonie closed just under $1.05 US. Weird.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A lot of people here are pissed off that after accounting for currency
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rates, Canadian prices are still 20 per cent or more higher than U.S.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; prices for identical products. It turns out there are other factors
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; involved.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Is that like the national and province sales tax of what is it 20%?

&gt; &gt; Prices are always quoted before tax.  Provincial tax varies by
&gt; &gt; province, with none in my province.  Federal sales tax is 6%, down
&gt; &gt; from 7% and about to be cut to 5%.

&gt; &gt; So the 20% difference is not based on the SALES taxes.  Some Americans
&gt; &gt; say that the higher prices are based on higher taxes all 'round built
&gt; &gt; into our economy.  That's a harder point to either make or disprove.

&gt; If the product is coming from the U.S., add some transportation costs.
&gt; Wages may be relatively higher in Canada in transportation, warehousing
&gt; and retailing, adding to cost. There may be a bit of duty hidden here
&gt; and there; free trade is far from absolute. And especially, a lot of
&gt; retailers, particularly the smaller ones, may be locked into longer-term
&gt; supply contracts and don't have the clout to force prices down, at least
&gt; not quickly.

&gt; The sense I get is that Canadian and U.S. prices will gradually creep
&gt; closer together, but it will take a long time. A lot of people imagined
&gt; it would happen all of a sudden, and that's not the case.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here's a nice blooper from Agence France-Presse:

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Most observers expect the Fed to cut its key lending rate by 25
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; percentage points, bringing it in line with Canada's rate of 4.50
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; percent.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Someone put in &quot;percentage&quot; and took out &quot;basis&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Don't you just love copyeditors who &quot;fix&quot; things that they know
&gt; &gt; nothing about?

&gt; Hey! I are a copy editor, and I fix things good, whether I know anything
&gt; about them or not.

&gt; &gt; &gt;It would seem like this would put more pressure on the US dollar.

&gt; The rate reduction? Yes, it will. But as someone said upthread, the
&gt; agencies who do that kind of thing -- the Fed in this case -- tend to
&gt; signal their moves way early, allowing the market to adjust, and by the
&gt; time it actually happens, there is often barely a ripple.

&gt; Over time, though, it will push the U.S. dollar lower. It's falling
&gt; against the loonie now; no reason for it to stop with lower U.S.
&gt; interest rates.

A sincere thanks from me for summing up every botched transaction that
has taken place between myself and

1. drive through fast food
2. convenience stores
3 Time Warner Cable

I can't remember the last time I botched up a purchase. I mean, I
never asked for a soft taco supreme when I meant to say beef burrito..

I have never unintentionally or intentionally underpaid anyone at a
convenience store..

And rest assured, if I did work at Time Warner Cable phone support,
I'd learn what a DHPC server was..

Now my soul (and my temper) have been put at ease. All I have to do is
repeat the mantra to myself..

Look, there just aren't enough competent people to serve the
economy any more.
Look, there just aren't enough competent people to serve the
economy any more.
Look, there just aren't enough competent people to serve the
economy any more.

And everything will be ok. It helps me come to terms with the whole
service industry as a whole.

&gt;So you are in Alberta?:
&gt;Does Alberta has a larger income tax or what? They must pay for their

Alberta has a fairly low population and sits on a pool of oil.  We're
Canada's Kuwait.  Even fools like Klein's government can't screw up
with that kind of income.  Of course, every Albertan is quick to tell
anyone else in Canada that they're rich because they're better
businessmen, rather than because they sit on a lake of money.

Part of that is true.  Most of Alberta's resources continue beyond the
border into Saskatchewan, where most if has been ignored because of
hostility between government and business.

&gt;The first thing to realize is that a strong currency isn't the answerp
&gt;any more than a weak one is. Context matters. If the US has a trade
&gt;deficit, and it does, it needs to be able to more cheaply export and
&gt;needs to stop importing so much. But have you noticed the price of stuff
&gt;going up? Nope. Not the stuff from China. How are they doing it?
">

Supposedly (according to a few rather dogmatic sites I read -- I'm not
equipped to contest it) China is maintaining their peg to a collapsing
dollar by mass printing of their own currency -- causing heavy
inflation within the country.  But such tactics are temporary, and
China's peg will have to break soon.
