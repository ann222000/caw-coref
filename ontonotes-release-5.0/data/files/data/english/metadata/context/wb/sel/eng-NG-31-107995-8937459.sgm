Best way to strip flaking paint on a trailer body and sheetmetal

Ive mated the &quot;utility body&quot; I swapped for, with the trailer I
scrounged up and am now at the point I need to do something about
painting, prior to wiring and bling.

The utility body..your typical Reading plumbers truck body, all bins
and whatnot, has badly peeling paint. While the base metal is
sound..it looks nasty.

What is the best way to strip off the old paint? My sandblaster buddy
is busy as hell and Ive been afraid that sandblasting may warp the
thin metal doors.  Hitting it with a cup brush for a half day in 105F
heat is also unattractive.....and is likely to put swirls in the sheet
metal doors.

Buy a couple gallons of paint stripper?

Sandblasters can dent the heck out of panels that aren't well-crowned (and
even some that are). As of five or ten years ago, a favorite trick with car
restorers was to use a sandblaster with crushed walnut-shell medium.

I vote for using a wire brush with a light touch, and don't try to strip
it, just knock off the loose stuff and then paint it with a brush. It won't
look great, but it'll last awhile.

Doesn't sound like much fun in the Central California heat, though.

You might try a pressure washer, if the paint is loose.  A buddy of mine had
a car that had been re-painted and the &quot;new&quot; paint job started to peel.  He
spent a few bucks and a couple hours at the local car wash and had it pretty
well back down to the original paint job...

I've done a whole car with stripper, one panel at a time.  It's messy,
it's nasty, it's FAST.  I started in with a sander on the hood.  A
half hour later I had an overheated sander, an overheated hand and an
empty box of sandpaper.  Oh, and about a 1 foot square down to
primer.  Tough stuff, that factory paint, no matter how nasty it
looked.  So went over to the body shop supply, picked up a quart of
aircraft finish stripper.  15 minutes after application, the paint had
bubbled off and just rinsed away.  You have to be ready with prep and
prime, things rust quick!  Sounded like frying bacon when it was doing
its stuff.  You might not be able to get the good stuff in CA, though,
what with CARB and all.  Just don't treat any more than you can prep
before stuff rusts up.  Protective gear strongly recommended and no
plastic soles unless you like sliding around in the remains of your
shoes.  I tried cheaper strippers from the hardware store, they didn't
even get the paint gummy.

That's one big advantage of the So Cal desert - things don't rust for

Never done it, but brake fluid is reported to strip paint.  Knowing
your scrounging bent, maybe you could get some gallons of used brake
fluid for free from a store like AutoZone that recycles it.

A gallon of used brake fluid from the brake shop will do the trick.
Then wash with lacquer thinner ($50 for 5 gallons) and paint.

The gnarly knotted type wire wheels 5-6&quot; dia on a 4&quot; angle grinder will
strip 1&quot; swaths at a time to bare metal with little effort and heat
generation. It goes quick. Forget the brush type cones or wheels. Eye,
ear, and breathing protection required. Finish to 80 grit, prime. Finish
to 220, paint.

Gunner, I have done this using paint stripper, the trick is to tape over any
gaps and edges, and use the stripper only on the big areas, keep it out of
the cracks and crevices, and at least half an inch back from any edge. If
the stripper goes into or around a door edge, it will triple your time to
clean it up and fix the paint in there. Use newspaper on the ground under
the edges of the body, then just roll it up, no mess. Do it in the shade,
the sun dries the stripper out too fast. Hose off the rest.

Once the paint is gone from the main panels, sand the remaining bits around
the edges using an orbital or DA sander, it will dissappear in no time. Run
the sander over the main panels, to give the new paint something to stick
to, P80 or 100 grit freecut paper. Give the insides a quick rub over with
fine scotchbrite, clean it off and it's ready for paint.

I had a friend who did this quite often, he could strip the paint off a car
in a couple of hours in a dinner suit, and not get dirty. OK, the dinner
suit is an exageration, but it was amazing to watch, I just gave you his
method.

regards,
John

That's the way I've done it using stripper.  More than likely the body
is galvanized and the correct primer wasn't used if it's flaking
badly.  I've even stripped entire bodies just with a single edge razor
blade/holder without stripper because the primer adhesion was so poor.

Thanks guys!  I think Ill use the stripper method, after the sun has

Any brand of stripper better than others, available from the big box

Zip-Strip works good.  There's also another called Clean-Strip and I
believe one or the other is available at HomeyD and Lowes.  Make sure
you put it on even and thick.  It's best to let it sit on as long as
possible without it drying up too much.  I always used a single edge
razor blade on a holder, but you have to develop a &quot;feel&quot; because
it'll tend to dig into the metal. It's also very important to
neutralize the surface after you have the paint off.  I just used
clean water, dried it, gave it a lacquer thinner wipe and primered.
If the body is galvanized make sure you use primer for it (I always
used Dupont Variprime) otherwise you might end up with poor adhesion
again.  G/L and enjoy!

Jasco at the Borgs.  Anything with Methylene Chloride (or was it MEK?
I forgot.) is the good stuff. It'll take off epoxies and
polyurethanes, too. It's $30/gallon, though.

Try brake fluid first, though. It's cheaper (if not free) from the
brake shop. Another way to stretch your stripper is to put a couple
layers of newsprint on top. It helps keep it from evaporating too
quickly.

&gt; Gunner, I have done this using paint stripper, the trick is to tape over any
&gt; gaps and edges, and use the stripper only on the big areas, keep it out of
&gt; the cracks and crevices, and at least half an inch back from any edge. If
&gt; the stripper goes into or around a door edge, it will triple your time to
&gt; clean it up and fix the paint in there. Use newspaper on the ground under
&gt; the edges of the body, then just roll it up, no mess. Do it in the shade,
&gt; the sun dries the stripper out too fast. Hose off the rest.

&gt; Once the paint is gone from the main panels, sand the remaining bits around
&gt; the edges using an orbital or DA sander, it will dissappear in no time. Run
&gt; the sander over the main panels, to give the new paint something to stick
&gt; to, P80 or 100 grit freecut paper. Give the insides a quick rub over with
&gt; fine scotchbrite, clean it off and it's ready for paint.

&gt; I had a friend who did this quite often, he could strip the paint off a car
&gt; in a couple of hours in a dinner suit, and not get dirty. OK, the dinner
&gt; suit is an exageration, but it was amazing to watch, I just gave you his

Apply the stripper and cover it with anything to slow
evaporation...newspaper, wax paper...even a old sheet....just don't
put it back on your bed...;&lt;).

Hot weather causes the stripper to evaporate far too quickly.

Also if you are goingt to spray paint, wait for it to cool down...I
have had many finishes ruined by painting when it was too hot...call
me impatient.

Actually if you apply stripper, cover with a sheet, cover with wax
paper, let it work, drink Mountain Dew, then move the stripper

I would NOT use brake fluid as a paint stripper or for anything
other than it's intended use in a brake system.

Chemical Paint Strippers can be neutralized (read the label) and
after being neutralized they stop stripping paint and don't harm the
environment too much.

But AFAIK you can't neutralize brake fluid, and it's still going to
give the folks at the regional sewer plant a headache when that slug
of contaminated sewage comes through.  And if you hose the effluent
into a storm drain you're going to cause a world of hurt to the
critters that live in that creek.

In large volume operations, methylene chloride is &quot;neutralized&quot; with
household chlorine bleach. I have no idea what the chemistry is. In small
applications, like a car, the stuff is so volatile that it's probably going
to evaporate before you can &quot;neutralize&quot; it. I've always used TSP to wash it
off, on the recommendation of a manufacturer of the stuff who I called about
it 30 years ago. Old info, and worth double-checking.

Brake fluid will not evaporate. If you have some that evaporates and you put
it in your car, you're going to crash. d8-)

It's non-volatile, toxic, and pernicious as hell. There are few worse things
you can throw in the trash or allow to get into a storm sewer. It's a bitch
to get the last bit of film from the stuff off of a surface. I would never
consider using it on anything I was going to paint.

Regarding methylene chloride, the big danger is that it causes the
generation of carbon monoxide in your blood, if you inhale a lot of it. It
can cause heart attacks. Use it outdoors and downwind.

Today's commercial strippers can consist of all kinds of weird chemicals.
Here's a pretty good rundown of strippers sold to consumers. It applies to
use on wood, but those are the strippers you're going to find on store
shelves, anyway:

Wuss. ;)  Quick cleanup: wipe dry, wash with soap and water, dry
again, and spray and wipe with cleaner.  Berryman's B-12 takes it off
quickly and easily, even from porous brake shoes. I've also used
naphtha and/or lacquer thinner (my most-used cleaner) after brake
jobs. On non-porous metal, it's a quick deal. Soap and water take 99%
of it off and the thinner takes the last 1% film. Not a prob.

B-12 contains toluene, methanol, heptanes, and acetone. Don't breathe
it deeply, either.

Thank you, Mr. Haney.  ;-)

Just because you're still stuck in the 18th century where &quot;Petticoat
Junction&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot; are considered non-fiction ;-P doesn't
mean that the chemicals are suddenly rendered harmless - you still
have to think about the repercussions of seemingly innocent actions.

If the brake fluid or stripper wastes go into a septic tank system
and leach field, it ends up in the ground water eventually - and that
ground water works it's way to a well and turns into drinking water in
a year or three of percolation...

That is, if the chemicals don't have to get pumped out with the rest
of the s*** when your septic tank bacteria die from the chemicals. (Or
they go on strike for better working conditions, same difference.)

Then the local Honey Dipper has to come by with the vacuum truck and
pump out the septic tank, and those chemicals will /still/ end up
dumped into a regional sewer plant for processing.

If the storm runoff water goes into an &quot;oil ditch&quot; instead of a
lined storm drain system, it either makes it to a river and out to the
sea, or it will stop and soak into the ground along the way - and
again it's in the ground water.  And all the wildlife that lives along
that ditch won't appreciate what you did to their drinking water.

the size of Delaware ...&lt;G&gt;. Along with every other liquid that is

I painted the body this evening, after the sun went down with Jaso
paint stripper.  Whatever it was...started coming off like fingerpaint
in the shower. Ill check it in the morning..fire up the pressure
washer and clean all the gunk off, and see what it looks like.

I use (and can reuse quite a few times) lacquer thinner for removing
paint from hinges and knobs in house repainting times. It works just
as well and nearly as quickly.

I hope you put newspapers under it and scrape the old paint and
stripper off onto that for a dump run rather than blasting it
everywhere, Gunner. 6&quot; wide mud paddles (putty knives) do well.

Do so before the sun's too high in the sky. If the methylene chloride all
evaporates, the paint  will re-set to some extent, but it will be even less
pretty than before. DAMHIKT :-(

I don't know about that.

I was watching a friend fill an ampoule with pyradine over a
windowsill, and a single drop of the pyradine spilled.  By the time that
my eyes had tracked down to the sill, it was already bare wood in the
center of a drop-sized circle.

But the stuff *stinks*.

An I haven't checked the MSDS on it, but I'll bet that it is
considered pretty bad. :-)

Enjoy,
DoN.

Did you have a chance to look for L6-20p/r, perchance?

Cool.  My big client is back from vacation (1 of 2) so I'll start on
Phase 2 of their projects on Wednesday.  And another client project
has tripled itself in the past weeks. I'll have enough to pay for a
new Tundra one of these days.

I had a blast (double entendre intentional) today at the machine gun
shoot. I tried on an M-16 for the first time and again played with an
AK-47. There is no more LF tire on the donated wrecking yard van now.
&lt;g&gt;  The binaries going boom were lots of fun, too. I like fireworks
you can feel in the pits of your molars.
