Ian:

Was thinking about this race last night, and realized that it is
HEAVILY swim weighted.  For 10 laps, it would be a 5 mile swim, 82
mile bike, and 30 mile run.  That's twice an ironman swim, with barely
2/3 an ironman bike.  And, for the leaders doing 20+ laps they are
swimming over 10 miles.  As an ultradistance triathlete, it's really
swim heavy compared to other races (Ultraman for example, is a 10K
swim, 272 mile bike, 52 mile run).

This weighting, plus the swim dark zone, is going to make it quite
difficult to do enough swims.  I'm figuring that unless we do 6-7
hours of swimming in the daytime hours Saturday then because there is
only a short time available for swimming Sunday one could end up
running out of time and needing to stop in the middle of the night
with run/bikes because they could not be matched with swims.

A good afternoon storm Saturday could wack the whole scheme off.

Any chance of shortening the swim &quot;lap&quot; to one lap, or a quarter mile
to bring it closer to standard proportions?

Looking forward to the race no matter what, and hoping to get in more
official laps than my &quot;1&quot; lap last year (since I crashed and could not
swim again...)

Just noticed an error in your calculation...it's actually 110 bike
miles in 10 laps with each bike lap being 11 miles, so that helps
bring it more in line with an Ironman. It is still a lot of swimming
during the day, just hope for a friendly dolphin to swim by you and
grab hold!

Leslie,

Thanks for pointing out the proportions of each sport in the race. In
an ideal world we would follow the exact proportions of standard
triathlons, take your pick, short course, sprint, international, Iron
Distance or multiples thereof.

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) course
logistics, permitting, terrain, traffic restrictions, sponsors,
advertisers, media, weather, safety, financial considerations and
individual preferences all influence the final course. As a race
organization we have the interesting job of balancing all these
factors and arriving at a course that is acceptable to the majority
of players.

A typical sprint course for mid pack athletes is approximately (in
time) 10% swim, 50% bike and 40% run. Iron distance multiples are
about 12%, 62%, 26%. We are approximately 12%, 50%, 38%, somewhere
between the two.

Regardless, every team is in the same pond, so to speak and this is
where strategy and understanding of the course, weather and your own
abilities comes into play. You seem to have a very good understanding
of these factors so I'm sure you'll do exceptionally well!

Cheers,

Ian

I see that the original distances are still on the web site, but I
believe they have been changed according to an e-mail I receved from
Ian.

The bike is now 9.5 miles.
The run is now 3.1 miles. I believe the run was only 2.8 miles because
they were going to factor in the swim to TA run.

All of this seems minor, but I think that the shorter the distances,
the more strategy may play a role in anyone's race. The TA times
themselves will be a huge factor. Just think of a two minute
transition during 4 full S-B-R laps. That is 11 transitions X 2
minutes = 2 minutes. That is almost another leg in time. And the
reality is that a consisent 2 mnute transition is probably not going
to happen.
But, like Ian says, we are all in he same pond.

It looks like the bike is now 8.9 miles from the latest map available
on the official site. So it now looks like Swim=0.5 Run=3.1 Bike=8.9

If this is true I need to do some recalculating as it will change the
strategy for my team a little.

Ian could you please clarify the exact distances for each event.

Thanks,

Hi Bill,

Exact distances are 0.5 mile swim, 0.17 mile run to/from swim, 8.9
mile bike, 3.1 mile run. We may shorten the run as mentioned earlier
which including the run to/from swim will make it close to 2.8 miles
with a slightly bigger up hill on the way out.

Unfortunately the course is subject to changes from the permitting
bodies. I heard from one race director that park rangers were trying
to change his course 10 minutes before the start of a duathlon
earlier this year. We will make any updates known as soon as they
happen, and a heads up if we see anything coming down the pike.

Thanks for the clarification Ian! I can't imagine someone trying to
change the course 10 minutes prior to a race, I'm sure you have your
hands full! Not that it matters, but I'm all for shortening the run,
I'm sure it would be appreciated by most of us once 2-3 AM rolls
around :)

Ian,

I'm curious about the surface of that 0.17 mile swim to TA trek.  Do
we need to cover our feet for the dash from water to TA or is the
surface (sand, concrete, rocks, whatever) forgiving enough that we
won't need to worry about it?

Thanks,

Ashley

Ashley,

The surface on the run to swim is a mixture of black top, grass, smooth
concrete and sand, and is 140 yards each direction. We will rake the sand,
sweep and cover the other surfaces with carpet where needed.

No need to be concerned about your feet!

Frankly:  I love the shortening of the bike and run segment.  As a
good swimmer, there is finially a long distance race where the
swimmers have an advantage.  Most other long races favor the strong
runner..  Yea!!!
