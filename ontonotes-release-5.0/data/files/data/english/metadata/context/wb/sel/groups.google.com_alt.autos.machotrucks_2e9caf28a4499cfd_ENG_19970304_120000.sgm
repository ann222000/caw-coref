NEW VERSION*

PLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE FROM START TO FINISH.

There is a naturally recurring law that exists in the universe - a law of
ABUNDANCE - that says each and everyone of us can have the things we
need and desire, WHEN we are ready for it. IF you can think of 'need'
and NOT 'greed'...YOU are READY!!

THIS WILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE YEAR FOR YOU... I SWEAR IT
WAS FOR ME!!

READ the WHOLE article. I suggest that you will feel just like I
do...GREAT!!

*This IS the newest updated version! *
PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO CHEAT THIS PROGRAM. THERE'S JUST NO NEED TO!
SIMPLY ADD ONE NAME - YOURS! - AND REPOST THE ARTICLE.

HONESTY AND FAIRNESS IS WHAT MAKES THIS PROGRAM WORK SO WELL
- IF YOU DON'T PARTICIPATE ON THIS BASIS...YOU WILL NOT GAIN IT'S
TRULY WONDERFUL RESULTS!!

FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS AND JOIN US IN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY!

The program has been REVISED and you will notice SIX names instead of
five. The reason for this is the 'flood' of five name programs and the
SIXTH
name will add $50,000 to $100,000. This is proven mathematically AND
in my bank account! I know it's hard to believe that this program works,
but IT DOES! Just be patient and follow the directions exactly. Print this

article NOW, so you have all the information to refer back to for your
version.

LET'S GO!

STEP 1
Invest your $6 by writing YOUR NAME and ADDRESS on SIX separate pieces
of paper (I used colored paper to help conceal the $1 bill) along with the

words: &quot;PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST: $1US DOLLAR
PROCESSING FEE IS ENCLOSED&quot;.

(In this way, you are not just sending a dollar to someone; you are paying
for a legitimate service.)

People have asked me if this is really legal. It is! You are using the
Internet
to advertise your business. What is that business? You are assembling a
mailing list of people who are interested in home based computer and online

businesses and methods of generating income at home. Remember - people
send you a small fee to be added to your list. This is NOT a chain letter
OR a pyramid scheme.. (your name is permanently dropped from this letter
after you are at number #1) Legalities have been checked. This is running
your own home-based computer business which is IS legal!

NOTE: DO keep a record of everyone who sends you money, AND their
request
to be added to your mailing list, pay your taxes, and keep an eye on the
postings
to make sure everyone is playing fairly. You know where your name should
be!

Fold a $1(US) bill inside each paper, (please do as everyone else does, and
not
use cheques or money orders) and mail them by &quot;snail&quot; mail to the
following
SIX addresses:

*NOTE* - PLEASE! REMEMBER TO USE CORRECT POSTAGE! - for all mail going
outside your own Country! (Names will be added from around the world!)

1. . Niklas Myren
Skansv.14
19145 Sollentuna
SWEDEN

2 Howard Kirkman
206 Meadow Wood Ct
Thomasville, NC.
USA 27360

3. Aaron Bodnar
Box 134
Mallaig, AB.
T0A 2K0
CANADA

4. M.A. LAZOSKY
P.O. BOX 30107
8602 Granville Street
Vancouver, B.C.
V6P 6S3
CANADA

5. David Chen
1451 W. KingEdward Avenue
Vancouver, B.C.
V6H 2A3
Canada

6. Mike Reid
2720 Wilbur Road
Martinsville, IN.
USA 46151

STEP 2

Now remove the top name from the list, and move the other names up.
This way #6 becomes #5 and so on. Put YOUR name in as the #6 on the list.

Just remember to SEND OUT YOUR six dollars! Playing fair and being HONEST
is the ONLY way this program can be successful for YOU and everyone else
involved. The person who 'thinks' they can cheat and not play fair always
ends
up gaining almost nothing! It's a sad way to learn a hard lesson! Don't
let that
be YOU! Playing fair and sending OUT your money will bring unbelievable
returns!

STEP 3

This is the theory for the FIVE person version:

You will earn $5 for every 250 postings with your name at #5. Not a large
sum of money...but wait. Each person that sent you a $1 bill now also
makes 250 postings with your name at #4. That equals about $50 to you.
Then, your 50 new agents each post to 250 newsgroups with you at #3.
That's about 12,500 postings which generates about $500 to you. Then, your
new 500 agents make 125,000 postings with you at #2, which earns you about
$10,000. Finally, your 500 agents post to 250 newsgroups, which translates
to about $50,000 before your name drops off the list.

The new SIX person version can add another $50,000 to $100,000.
This sounds like &quot;pie in the sky,&quot; but the numbers add up, and with over
40 million people on the NET, it works! TIP: For an even greater return,
post to MORE than 250 newsgroups initially; try for 300-350. (When your
name drops off a list, simply access another message from a newsgroup and
start the process over again.)

Post the new article to at least 250 newsgroups. remember, the more you
post, the more people see, and the more you get. There are at least 25,000
newsgroups at any one time.

This is about a $7.92 investment. Just think about how often we have all
wasted
much MORE on Lottery tickets! It takes about a week or so to start seeing
a return -
so be patient. The money should flow for about 3 months. At that point,
simply
add your name to a new list and start over.

You won't believe how GREAT it feels to finally be able to PAY OFF all
your DEBTS!!

AND even have enough to be able to 'share' the extra...in any way that
makes you

feel GOOD about yourself - maybe with those really close to you , or even
with someone

whom you may NOT know very well...but you can see, really &quot;needs&quot; some
help. BUT

don't forget to be good to YOURSELF too..because you've worked hard and
DESERVE it !!

GENERAL STEPS ON AUTOMATING THE PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF you have NETSCAPE 3.0 do EXACTLY the following:

1) Click on any newsgroup like normal, THEN click on 'TO NEWS', which is
on the far left when you're in the newsgroups page. This will bring up a
box to type a message in.

2) Leave the newsgroup box like it is, CHANGE the subject box to
something 'catchy' like, &quot;NEED CASH $$$ READ HERE $$$ or &quot;FAST CASH&quot;!!!

3) Tab once and you should be ready to type. Now, retype (only once)
THIS whole article WORD FOR WORD, except insert your name at #6, and
remove #1 off the list, plus any other small changes you think you need to
make. Keep almost all of it the SAME!

4) When you're done typing the WHOLE article, click on FILE in THIS BOX,
RIGHT ABOVE &quot;SEND&quot;, NOT WHERE IT SAYS NETSCAPE NEWS ON
THE FIRST BOX.

Click on SAVE AS when you're under FILE. Save your article as a text file
to your C: or A: drive. DO NOT SEND OR POST YOUR ARTICLE UNTIL
YOU HAVE DONE THIS! Once saved, move on to number 5 below.

***NOTE: If you DON'T want to type in the whole article by hand, AND you
know how to use a plain text editor (like Notepad), you can edit the file
ahead of time, then simply 'attach' it as shown in step 6.

5) If you still have all of your text, send or post to this newsgroup now
by just clicking send, which is right below FILE, and right above Cc:

6) Here's where you're going to post all 250!!. OK, click on any
newsgroup
then click on 'TO NEWS', again in the top left corner. Leave the
NEWSGROUPS BOX alone again, put a flashy subject title in the SUBJECT
BOX, hit TAB once - you're in the body of the message.

Click on ATTACHMENTS, which is below the SUBJECT BOX. You will get
another box to come up. Click on ATTACH FILE, then find YOUR file, that if
you did this right, you should see your file name in the attachments box,
and it will be shaded grey/green.

***REMEMBER: IF you don't want to type in the whole article, and you know

how to use a plain text editor, eg. (Notepad), you can edit the file
AHEAD
of time, save it, then simply 'attach' it.

IF YOU USE IE EXLORER, IT'S JUST AS EASY:

HOLDING DOWN THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON, highlight this article. Then
press the &quot;ctrl&quot; key and the &quot;c&quot; key at the same time to copy this article.

Then print this article for your records, to have the names of those you
will be sending $1(US) bills to.

2) Go to the news groups and press &quot;post an article&quot;. A window will
open. Type in your headline in the subject area and then click in the
large window below. Press &quot;ctrl&quot; and then &quot;v&quot; and the article will be
placed in the window.

If you want to edit the article, do so and then highlight and copy it
again. Now every time you post the article in a new newsgroup all you
have to repeat is &quot;ctrl&quot; and &quot;v&quot; and press post.

3) That's it. Each time you do this, all you have to do is type in a
different newsgroup, so that way it posts to 200 DIFFERENT newsgroups, or
more.

You see? Now you just have 249 to go!! (Don't worry, each one takes about
30 seconds, once you get used to it.)

REMEMBER - 250 IS THE MINIMUM! But the more you post, the more money
you will receive!

AND THAT'S IT!! REMEMBER FAIRNESS AND HONESTY WILL BRING SUCCESS!!

GOOD LUCK TO ALL!!!...AND LETS ENJOY SHARING THE WEALTH!!
