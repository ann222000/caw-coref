modified waxy maize food starch

I found a chocolate cake recipe that looked really good, but it called
for ClearJel.  Gosh! I wondered.  What's ClearJel?  Well here you go,
important facts about ClearJel.

----
ClearJel® is the registered trademark name for modified waxy maize food
starch.

ClearJel® is the only thickener the USDA recommends for use in
home-canning of fruit pie fillings.

The main advantage of this starch over cornstarch is that it has no
tendency to weep during storage.

Instant ClearJel® is freezer-stable, however, ClearJel® is not. Instant
ClearJel® is excellent for use in high quality pies to be frozen before
or after baking.

Since instant fillings are not cooked before baking, they should be used
soon after preparation. [N.b.: &quot;used&quot;, not &quot;eaten&quot;.]
---

I think I might leave the ClearJel out of this cake recipe.

It's absolutely first rate for making no-cook freezer jam.  It
thickens the fruit mixture and allows the use of much less sugar.
Similar in some uses to Sure-Jell, which is a pectin product. Pectin
is just the ground up insides of fruit peels.

I have never heard of it being used in a cake, though. Will you post
the recipe? Is it one that has some sort of thickened fruit topping?

Arrowroot would be a good substitute for clearjel for pie fillings. It
is what was traditionally used in the ancient days of my youth. For
the cake recipe cornflour would be fine.

You mix the fruit with sweetener &amp; thickener &amp; store it in the
freezer.

KA is pretty good on recipes. Their usual flaw is that they require a
boatload of their proprietary ingredients. But instead of the
Clearjel, this one says you can use cornstarch instead.

There are certainly some cake recipes with cornstarch in them (never
seen one before for Clearjel in the batter), but when I looked at the
picture and started to read the ingredients, I thought for a moment
the cornstarch was going to be in the filling.

You can call KA, IIRC, or at least you used to be able to. You could
call and ask for info.

I dunno, but after googling for it and looking at the resulting web

Until about six months ago my husband didn't get enough hours at his job

&gt;&gt; like to make stuff up about health insurance, feel free to chime in.

&gt;Until about six months ago my husband didn't get enough hours at his job
&gt;to get health insurance, so I bought ours.  $1200/quarter, fer cryin'
&gt;out loud, and that was with a $3K deductible.

We pay that much through The Hub's company and our deducible in only
$1000 less.

I don't can or preserve foods. Never have, so if I want to make jam, I
make freezer jam. Usually I use Sure Jell for it. The stuff can come
out of the freezer even more than a year later and defrosts with
excellent taste, look and texture.

I usually make strawberry or peach-mango. In some ways, I think the
fruit has a fresher taste than with cooked jams.  I play around with
the recipes and cut the sugar down or substitute Splenda. Sometimes
works, sometimes not.

I would rather never have  jam at all than eat imitation jam.

Making real jam is easy.  All you need is  good fruit and sugar and
possibly,  depending on the fruit, a little lemon juice. It also has
the advantage that it lasts indefinitely and requires no electricity
to store.

There must be, because alginates are used by the ice-cream industry. I
don't know of any source for home use, however.

I made a quick attempt yesterday at two regular supermarkets and three
gourmet delis/food shops. None of them had any Clear Jel or Sure Jell, but
two did have a &quot;whipped cream stabilizer&quot; based on modified starch. Maybe
that would work?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Agar-agar?

Agar, like regular starch and regular pectin (and gelatin for that matter,
although it's a different kind of polymer) needs to be heated in order to
work.

The no-cook powders are carbohydrate polymers modified in such a way that
they swell in liquids at room temperature, hence their use for jams and
jellies that do not require cooking and thus preserve the taste of fresh
fruit. Or chocolate truffles...

Kind of a shame, melting the paraffin was fun.  I s'pose you could melt
it and make candles.  We never died from paraffin-topped jam, but we
boiled the jars and lids and stored the jam in the fridge.  It never

&gt;There must be, because alginates are used by the ice-cream industry. I
&gt;don't know of any source for home use, however.

&gt;I made a quick attempt yesterday at two regular supermarkets and three
&gt;gourmet delis/food shops. None of them had any Clear Jel or Sure Jell, but
&gt;two did have a &quot;whipped cream stabilizer&quot; based on modified starch. Maybe
&gt;that would work?

It is the instant ClearJel you need. The regular needs cooking.

&gt;&gt; Agar-agar?

&gt;Agar, like regular starch and regular pectin (and gelatin for that matter,
&gt;although it's a different kind of polymer) needs to be heated in order to
&gt;work.

&gt;The no-cook powders are carbohydrate polymers modified in such a way that
&gt;they swell in liquids at room temperature, hence their use for jams and
&gt;jellies that do not require cooking and thus preserve the taste of fresh
&gt;fruit. Or chocolate truffles...

Try a candy making site. They may have something you can use instead..
The truffle recipe I think is best is from a woman who used to post on
rec.food.cooking, Kay Hartman.

Again, I do not do any sort of preserving, I am just a fly on the wall
over at rec.food.preserving. If you kept the jam in the fridge, I am
sure it was quite safe, and even likely so with the paraffin, but when
someone arrives at rfp and mentions paraffin, the newest food safety
rules are always advised.

If Anny Middon ever decides to grace us with her postings again, I am
sure she could offer far more wisdom than I  on the topic. I'm sure
this is a busy season for her.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Same idea, except it's based on alginate instead of starch or pectin.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No equivalents here in the US?

&gt;&gt;Agar-agar?

&gt;I've certainly used it in a few Petri dishes.

Did they serve those on the Dick Van Dyke Show?

Sorry, I was unaware of that. You have my sympathy.  I can see that
freezer jam would be a suitable substitute if you couldn't have the
real thing, although I personally would just go without under those
circumstances. Having to give up eating cheese and chocolate would be
what I would find really painful.

In properly made jam, the sugar is the preservative along with the
acid content of the food and if it is kept dry the worst thing that
will happen is that it dries out too much.

Mama taught me to make jam and we used to use cellophane jam covers
and elastic bands... then if the jar had a plastic lid that fit we
screwed it on over the top once the jar was cold. If not, it just had
the cover on it. No paraffin required... All the bottles went into a
cool dark cupboard and they lasted for YEARS! Occasionally one would
split but most of them were good until the jam dried out too much...
