Hamza Hendawi draws aside the strange curtain that had fallen over
election preparations in Iraq.

Ash-Sharq al-Awsat also reports on the issue, saying the the
registration of voters and parties will begin on November 1 and last
until December 15. Some 12 million voters will be eligible to take part
in elections for a 275-seat parliament.

Parties must register between Nov. 1 and Nov. 30, and must pay a
$5,000 registration fee. Their top officers may not be high-ranking
former Baathists. They must submit national party tickets with at least
12 candidates and at most 275. One-third must be women (last I knew it
was one fourth, but maybe Raja' al-Khuza'i has won a round recently).

Cole: The tickets are arranged so that every third name is a woman.
Seats will be apportioned according to the proportion of the vote the
party achieves. As I understand it, if 10% of Iraqis vote for the
al-Da`wa Party, it would get roughly 27 seats, so that the top 27
persons listed on its ticket would serve. 8 of them would be women. I
fear that this system penalizes independents and members of small local
parties, probably fatally. For this reason, parties are trying to form
larger coalitions, which have a better chance of garnering a significant
percentage of votes.

Hendawi reveals that Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani's plan of using the
old United Nations food rolls has been revised, but that there will be a
voter registration process that hopes to double-check the rolls. The
ration rolls had been criticized by US proconsul Paul Bremer, who
refused to allow elections to be held in May, 2004, as Sistani had
proposedl, on the grounds that voter registration could not be
accomplished in that time frame. In fact, Bremer and the Bush
administration were terrified that elections would bring radical Shiites
and Sunni fundamentalists to power.

The real reason elections were postponed was so that they would not
embarrass Bush by their results. As it is, the US election will be
decided before we can see the shape of the Iraqi parliament, which may
not be to Bush's liking. In the meantime, US military might has been
used in an attempt to break the power of the Sadr movement in the south,
as well as to break the grip of Sunni fundamentalists and ex-Baathists
on the north-central provinces. It remains to be see if military tactics
actually produced the desired result.

If elections had been held in May, 2004, they might have forestalled
a good deal of the violence we have seen since April 1.
