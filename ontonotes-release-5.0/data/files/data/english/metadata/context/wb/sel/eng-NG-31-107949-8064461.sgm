I have been cycling with toe clips since before some of you were
born ;-).  I am not what __you__ would consider to be a &quot;serious&quot;
cyclist.  But I do enjoy it when I can.

Now I am considering going clipless.  I have a lot of questions.  I
hope I don't start any &quot;wars&quot;.  I am looking for practical answers
based on experience.

BTW, I am interested in recessed cleats -- the so-called MTB style --
even though I do very little biking on trails -- almost none.  Also, I
have no concern about the weight of the cleat-pedal system.  I am not
good enough for it to make a difference.

1. Shimano v. Speedplay.  Speedplay makes a good case for &quot;free
float&quot;.  But is it really that critical?  Generally, I am inclined to
go with the overwhelming market leader, when there is one, for a
variety of reasons.  Can I really go wrong with Shimano?

2. Single-sided v. dual-sided pedals.  On the one hand, the rationale
behind DS pedals makes good sense to me:  easier to engage if you do
not have to worry about which side of the pedal you're on.  On the
other hand, I am used to SS insofar as pedals with toe clips are
&quot;single-sided&quot;; I am used to it, and I never need to look down.  On
the &quot;third&quot; hand, I am concerned about the time it takes to engage the
cleat already; DS might give me added confidence.  On the &quot;fourth&quot;
hand, I cannot image riding a narrow trail or similar situations
without having the option of not &quot;locking&quot; in.  It has happened to me
on rare occassion.

3. Single-directional v. multi-directional.  Initially, I thought MD
might be helpful in getting started with clipless.  But I do try to
lift in my stroke, especially on hills and starts.  I am worried about
disengaging too easily.  I know that the release can be tightened; but
I worry that that will make it hard while I'm learning.  I know I will
go to SD eventually.  Should I just start that way?  That is my
inclination.

4. How to learn?  Does everyone fall in the beginning?  Originally, I
thought I would cycle to the shop to get the clipless pedals
installed, do some practice {en/dis}gaging for a little at the shop,
then &quot;practice&quot; on my ride home.  Now I wonder if that's a bad idea.
I will be riding in traffic, with some stops on uphills.  FYI, I am a
slow learner, to some extent.  I fumble a lot in the beginning; then I
seem to have an epiphany and &quot;voila!&quot;, you'd think I'm an expert.

TIA for your thoughts.

SPD cleats and double-sided pedals are probably your best bet. Many

No, although claiming that seems to be a perverse badge of honour. If it
helps, I've never come off for this reason. But go around the block or a
parking lot a few times, practising clipping in and out, starting and
stopping, until it feels natural. Due to the recessed cleats, it's not hard
to pedal gently even if you're not clipped in properly.

Shimano pedals are cheap and work well for the vast majority of riders.
Unless you need more float or are a mountain biker who expects to ride
in mud, they're hard to argue with. Speedplay Frogs are great -- I use
them because I benefit from the float --  but they're also expensive.
So are replacement cleats, and I go through more of those than I did
with SPDs. Walkability can be an issue because the cleats are larger
and protrude slightly from some shoes.

On the other hand, I find entry and exit easier and the float makes it
very difficult to misalign the cleats.

I wouldn't say that everyone falls, but starting out in traffic is a
good way to make it happen. I'd practice in a parking lot or a grassy
area until clipping out is automatic and you can clip in fairly
consistently. It will take a little bit of practice. If you try to ride
in traffic before you're used to the new motions, you'll likely as not
try to pull out backwards like you're used to doing with toe clips.

I'm a slow learner, too. Long ago I used old-fashioned cleats and toe clips
and fell a lot learning them, usually because I'd forget to reach down to
loosen the strap till it was too late. Switched to SPDs about 10 years ago
and I don't think I've fallen a single time. AFAIC, the diff is that, unlike
old-school cleats, you can disengage at the last second from an upright
position. Once I switched, I was immediately happy with my decision.

Sounds like I'm in the same boat as you.  I use the Shimano
system on my road bike because it gives me the option of using
recessed-cleat shoes; above all, I use my bicycle for commuting.
Exercise a few mornings a week is only its secondary purpose,
and there I'm not exactly concerned about setting any land speed
records.

I can pretty much echo the comments of others who have
recommended SPD so far.  I don't have much experience with
Speedplay, outside of briefly having tried some at a bike shop,
but the SPD cleats seem much more appropriate for walking around
in.  However, you will probably still make at least a little bit
of a crunching noise as you walk down the sidewalk with SPD
cleats, even in the most recessed-cleat shoes you can find.

I went from toe-clips to single-directional, double-sided SPD
pedals (Shimano PD-M540).  I personally didn't have much trouble
with the fact that I had to twist my ankle outward to release
the cleat, as opposed to having the option of twisting it either
outward or inward; either way, it would have been a matter of
learning to twist my ankle instead of pulling my foot backwards.

On the other hand, I do enjoy double-sided pedals very much for
the ability to engage the cleat without looking down.  If you
adjust your pedals correctly you can disengage the cleats in a
heartbeat, so I wouldn't consider a single-sided pedal unless
you want half-platform, half-SPD pedals because you anticipate
riding without your cycling shoes on a regular basis.  (If
you're really concerned about not engaging the pedals, though,
keep in mind that by simply positioning your shoes slightly
further forward on the pedals you can prevent the cleats from
catching at all.)

I can't speak for everyone else, but I did fall.  But not on the
day I installed the new pedals, or even the day after that.  One
morning, almost a week later, I was riding between classes at
UF.  I saw a mother, a father, and a daughter pointing bemusedly
at a campus map in the father's hands: clearly a disoriented
family taking a tour of the University to decide whether to send
their daughter here for college.  So I thought I'd stop to offer
some directions.

Unfortunately, I wasn't yet a complete natural at my new
clipless pedal system.  I instinctively tried to pull my left
foot backwards as I came to a stop in front of the family, and
by the time I had realized my mistake I was completely out of
momentum.  I landed on my side right in front of the father, who
gave me a bewildered look as the three of them turned around and
started quickly walking in the other direction.

I bet that young lady wasn't expecting a complementary physics
demonstration when she came to UF for Preview...

Thanks for all the constructive feedback.  It confirmed my intuition.

One last question on the learning curve.  Realistically, how much
practice in a parking lot should it take?

(Assume I get the Shimano single-directional dual-sided pedals and
shoes with recessed cleats.)

I know that's a hard question to answer.  We all learning at different
rates.  I'm just trying to determine if it is realistic to ride to the
shop for installation and expect to ride home after &quot;some practice&quot;,
or if I should transport the bike using my car and practice over some
time (days?).  What did __you__ do?

You can probably ride them home from the bike shop unless you're
very concerned about traffic.  Just be sure to constantly keep the
fact that you're using a new kind of pedal system at the back of
your mind, and make sure you've completely freed your foot from the
pedals before you stop the bicycle until it all becomes second
nature to you.

For my part, I purchased my pedals, cleats, and shoes online, so I
installed them at home and practiced with them in my apartment's
parking lot for about ten minutes before I ventured out into
traffic.

if you've riden for such a long time without clipless pedals, I will
suggest that you continue to do so. you can seriously damage your
knees if they are not setup right, and at an older age your joints
might not be able to recover from even minimal damage. Another thing
is that you will fall wearing clipless pedals; again as you age your
bones become more brittle and a small fall could seriously impare the
quality of life you now enjoy. They were still using toe clips in the
tour in the 90s ( robert millar was one of the last I believe). there
is not much clipless could add to your cycling experience  and the
cost could be more than you bargained for.

Yes, that is one of my concerns.  That is why I would rely on a bike
shop to do the set-up.  Of course, if I am not confident of their
work, that will be another story altogether.  Nonetheless, I am indeed
concerned about possible knee problems.  I will be very vigilant and
sensitive about that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I wear my toe clips somewhat lose so that my foot can slip in and out
easily.  Because of that, I believe I am losing a lot of power,
especially on hills.  Of course, a large part of it could be technique
and just plain weak &quot;small quads&quot;.  But I &quot;need to&quot; try clipless to
see if they improve things, if only to rule that out.  For me, it is
not that big an investment.  I can always switch back to toe clips if
I have too many problems with clipless.  Perhaps another reason to go
with the common Shimano configuration:  I could probably find a
secondary market, if I decide to abandon them.  (But I really hope I
like them.)

Here's another vote for dual-sided Shimano SPDs. I first tried these
over 15 years ago after years of 'clips and straps' and two other
clipless systems and I still see no reason to change. Good stuff.

Good. Get some nice walkable shoes. Whatever brand fits you. I'm a
Lake and Diadora footed guy, you might have Shimano shapes at the ends
of your ankles. Who knows, try a lot of shoes. If you like slot
cleats, stick with 'em--NOS shoes show up all the time, and
traditional shoes with clips and straps are readily available.

Speedplay is good, though around here the recent trend of Speedplay on
the bike path is more fashion than anything else. Fat guys on carbon
bikes are scared to be seen in sensible shoes and spds.

Spd is good, it's cheap, and if you hate it--not too much money lost.
I like the Nashbar standard atb pedal, which is $30 right now, and
sold under various names such as the original, Wellgo, and also
Ritchey. It's fully compatible with Shimano cleats. It's cheap enough
so you can put it on all your bikes. Or get Shimano if that's what
your shop has--the basic spd pedal is time proven. BTW, don't get the
cheaper of the Nashbar branded pedals, it's incompatible with
everything else.

The float might feel weird at first, but you'll *probably* get used to

&quot;oldhickory&quot; &lt;&gt; Every one may not fall in the beginning but everyone falls
sometime.

The idea to ride around in the parking lot while practicing unclipping is a
good one, but let me add this: Try this maneuver when your foot is at the 6
O'clock position.  Rotate your heel away from the bike. Don't make your
first effort to unclip when you come to a stop.

&gt; I have been cycling with toe clips since before some of you were
&gt; born ;-).  I am not what __you__ would consider to be a &quot;serious&quot;
&gt; cyclist.  But I do enjoy it when I can.

&gt; Now I am considering going clipless.  I have a lot of questions.  I
&gt; hope I don't start any &quot;wars&quot;.  I am looking for practical answers
&gt; based on experience.

&gt; BTW, I am interested in recessed cleats -- the so-called MTB style --
&gt; even though I do very little biking on trails -- almost none.  Also, I
&gt; have no concern about the weight of the cleat-pedal system.  I am not
&gt; good enough for it to make a difference.

&gt; 1. Shimano v. Speedplay.  Speedplay makes a good case for &quot;free
&gt; float&quot;.  But is it really that critical?  Generally, I am inclined to
&gt; go with the overwhelming market leader, when there is one, for a
&gt; variety of reasons.  Can I really go wrong with Shimano?

&gt; 2. Single-sided v. dual-sided pedals.  On the one hand, the rationale
&gt; behind DS pedals makes good sense to me:  easier to engage if you do
&gt; not have to worry about which side of the pedal you're on.  On the
&gt; other hand, I am used to SS insofar as pedals with toe clips are
&gt; &quot;single-sided&quot;; I am used to it, and I never need to look down.  On
&gt; the &quot;third&quot; hand, I am concerned about the time it takes to engage the
&gt; cleat already; DS might give me added confidence.  On the &quot;fourth&quot;
&gt; hand, I cannot image riding a narrow trail or similar situations
&gt; without having the option of not &quot;locking&quot; in.  It has happened to me
&gt; on rare occassion.

&gt; 3. Single-directional v. multi-directional.  Initially, I thought MD
&gt; might be helpful in getting started with clipless.  But I do try to
&gt; lift in my stroke, especially on hills and starts.  I am worried about
&gt; disengaging too easily.  I know that the release can be tightened; but
&gt; I worry that that will make it hard while I'm learning.  I know I will
&gt; go to SD eventually.  Should I just start that way?  That is my
&gt; inclination.

&gt; 4. How to learn?  Does everyone fall in the beginning?  Originally, I
&gt; thought I would cycle to the shop to get the clipless pedals
&gt; installed, do some practice {en/dis}gaging for a little at the shop,
&gt; then &quot;practice&quot; on my ride home.  Now I wonder if that's a bad idea.
&gt; I will be riding in traffic, with some stops on uphills.  FYI, I am a
&gt; slow learner, to some extent.  I fumble a lot in the beginning; then I
&gt; seem to have an epiphany and &quot;voila!&quot;, you'd think I'm an expert.

&gt; TIA for your thoughts.
">

My two cents. Recessed cleats are very popular. SPD pedals are popular.
I don't have any experience with them. But they seem like they would be
okay for you and your riding. Another option that you might look at is
Crank Brother pedals. I just switched from look style cleats to them for
the recessed design. Much to say about them. They are nice. And gaining
popularity too.

Why take the chance?  You should practice until you feel confident, and then
practice a bit more.

I think the reason I fell is that I felt confident with the pedals, but
didn't yet realise that I didn't quite have the habit down yet and then got
distracted by something around me - my riding partner - which took my
attention off the fact that I was clipped in. Then, as my speed came near
zero...I thought I was free, but I wasn't and my feet were still on the
pedals. At the last minute - I found I was still attached somehow, but my
speed had gone to zero.  I was then on the ground.

Everytime I fell it was because I wasn't really free (even though I had
clipped out) but I was giving partial attention to something else. I put my
foot on the pedals and had re-engaged without realizing it.

I had spent time in the LBS on a trainer....practicing clipping
in/off...about an hour. Then, I got home and did several rides around the
neighborhood, observing the stop signs, etc. I was riding alone, too.
Everything was working fine.

Then, went out on my first road ride with a friend and as I rode up to where
we were to meet, with him standing there waiting, I said 'hi' and
conversation started.  Well, I ended up on the ground.  I repeated that
scene twice more on that ride.  After that, I had it down. There is
something about pain and learning....

YMMV.

I have had a lot more falls due to not being able to get my foot out of
clips and straps on time, while I can only recall falling once due to
having a foot clipped in while using SPD's (and that was from leaning
slightly to the clipped in side while sitting still).

&gt; Yes, that is one of my concerns.  That is why I would rely on a bike
&gt; shop to do the set-up.  Of course, if I am not confident of their
&gt; work, that will be another story altogether.  Nonetheless, I am indeed
&gt; concerned about possible knee problems.  I will be very vigilant and
&gt; sensitive about that.

&gt; &gt; there is not much clipless could add to your cycling experience

&gt; I wear my toe clips somewhat lose so that my foot can slip in and out
&gt; easily.  Because of that, I believe I am losing a lot of power,
&gt; especially on hills.  Of course, a large part of it could be technique
&gt; and just plain weak &quot;small quads&quot;.  But I &quot;need to&quot; try clipless to
&gt; see if they improve things, if only to rule that out.  For me, it is
&gt; not that big an investment.  I can always switch back to toe clips if
&gt; I have too many problems with clipless.  Perhaps another reason to go
&gt; with the common Shimano configuration:  I could probably find a
&gt; secondary market, if I decide to abandon them.  (But I really hope I
&gt; like them.)
">

well then, I will suggest ritchey mountain bike pedals;  I have used
them for the past 10 yrs plus; I like them because the large platform
means you don't have to clip in to pedal over ice- not that I expect
you to try that, but that is the reason why I use them- and you can
use them as regular pedals if your cleats aren't set up right and
still need to pedal more without having to clip in- also the double-
sided spd allows you to use regular mountain bike shoes so if you ever
have to walk, say, go into a convience shop you are not slipping and
sliding and clacking all over the floor. the spd design means your
cleats last a long time, and you have a bit of float and can ride with
them loose.so they are fairly easy to clip out of if you need too. the
simple design means no maintence. the v4 pro version is small, so
stick with the regular ritchey.
you should make a point of cliping out and making sure your foot is
free when rolling up to a stop. practice your trackstands.

Two of the sets of pedals were Shimano PD-M323s [1] that were dealer
installed upgrades at the time of purchase over the stock Wellgo
platform pedals. Neither set came with cleats. My trike and other two
bikes were purchased used. The only pedals I have ever bought that came
with cleats were the Shimano PD-M515s (NLA?) that I got for my Trek
6000, which came with SH-51 cleats.

[1] Now replaced by the PD-M324:

I encourage you do do exactly what your intuitiion tells you.  I'm in
almost exactly the same boat (age, &quot;seriousness&quot;, etc.) and use and
love MTB-style clipless pedals on my road bike.

In addition to SPD pedals, you should look at the Crank Brothers
pedals.  Similar recessed cleat.  The &quot;Candy&quot; and Eggbeater pedals are
two sided and have excellent reputation.

I have one sided SPD pedals on my road bike and two sided on my MTB.
I don't have any problem with the one sided pedals and think they look
better.  Other than looks, there's no reason not to go two sided
though.

Those are platform pedals that happen to have spd mechanisms. Can't

Before I installed my first set of clipless I rode for about a month and
got into a routine of always &quot;unclipping&quot; from my platforms. This became
second nature and when the clipless were installed the transition was

They gave me a $15 credit each time for the Wellgo platform pedals to
apply towards the PD-M323's, so I am not complaining.

I thought you were supposed to get a no additional charge set of cleats
when buying expensive cycling shoes (I have with ever with every Sidi
purchase).

I think DS are better as you have to sides to clip into. This helps
when clipping in with out having to look at the pedal.

Bear in mind t htat the technique of clipping into MTB style pedals is
different than flipping the toe tab on a clip and strap pedal and
slipping your foot into the pedal as it rotates upward. With the MTB
style clipless pedal entry is more like stepping down onto the pedal.
You may find you need a fair bit of practise before stepping down onto
the pedal becomes second nature.

&gt; 4. How to learn?  Does everyone fall in the beginning?  Originally, I
&gt; thought I would cycle to the shop to get the clipless pedals

&gt; I will be riding in traffic, with some stops on uphills.  FYI, I am a
&gt; slow learner, to some extent.  I fumble a lot in the beginning; then I
&gt; seem to have an epiphany and &quot;voila!&quot;, you'd think I'm an expert.

&gt; TIA for your thoughts.
">

For safety getting used to unfamiliar equipment I would strongly
recommend practicing clipping in and out on a grassy area like a
playing field. Any falls there are much less painful than falling onto
pavement. Practice unclipping with the pedal at various positions as
not all clipless pedals release easily in all positions of the clock.
For example a friend of mine has cliplrss pedals that are very hard to
get out of when the pedal is at 12 0'clock high. Finding your non-
release points is better on grass which cushions the impact if you
should fall over.

If you have a friend who will aid you have him/her unexpectadly throw
something like a rolled up towel in front of you as you ride on the
grass after familiarising yourself with clipping and uncliping. This
is to get you used to braking suddenly, like often happens in traffic,
and unclipping. Once again the grass is better to land on than
pavement. When I have seen people new to clipless pedals go down it is
usually because they had to stop unexpectedly and had not yet
developed a reflexive unclipping motion. Also, I have notice that some
people are decidedly one side preferable when unclipping. Be sure to
practice unclipping from both sides

Getting used to clipless pedals is not that hard. This is especially
true if you can practice with them in an area where you are not in
danger should you fall - an area like a grassy playing field is ideal.
This in itself will allow you to experiment with your new equipment
more than if you try to learn whilst riding on the pavement.

I hope these ideas and hints help you.

I rode my bike the 10 miles home from the shop with my first clipless
pedals after practicing a bit on a trainer at the shop.  It worked out
okay.  FWIW here's my suggestions:

- Set the pedals to release with minimum force.  If you find this
insecure you can tighten them later.

- For the first while, whenever you touch the brakes immediately unclip
one foot.  Clip it back in if you don't actually stop.  If you do
this conscienciously it'll keep you from forgetting to unclip until
it's too late (plus give you some extra practice getting in and out
of the pedals).

I eventually fell, like people say everyone does, but I went 6 weeks
before the fall and I only did it once.

My 14 year hiatus ended in Aug. 2000. I rode, as always, with
toe-clips on my two old bikes and built up a utility bike with
Power-Grips. The &quot;twist to release&quot; motion became ingrained quickly
so that I injured myself while riding another bike with toe clips.

I went clipless in late 2002. Eggbeaters were the first, and are
still the only, clipless pedal design that looks like it was done
right.

I now have Eggbeaters on three bikes that don't have flat pedals. I
use the Power-Grips too because they release the same as clipless
pedals. For purely aesthetic reasons he two old road bikes will
continue to have the &quot;period correct&quot; toe clips and straps on their
classic pedals. They require more attention while riding them with
tightened straps.

My biggest problem switching to clipless was overcoming the habit of
reaching down to loosen the toe strap when approaching a stop signal.

I too have fallen abruptly during a &quot;clipless moment&quot;. The first time
was on a group ride about 8 weeks after installing them.

Power Grips [1] are the best solution I have found for riding in
non-cycling shoes.

Even with the straps loosened, I have fallen when I have not been able
to get my foot out of a pedal with clips and straps on several occasions
(anything but shoes with smooth soles and uppers can catch on the pedal
or strap, trapping one's foot). This has never happened with SPD pedals,
other than the time I road a bike with Shimano cleats and supposedly SPD
compatible Wellgo pedals.

Toe clips and straps (pace Mr. Keats) should be considered historical
curiosities, and nothing more.

Matter of taste. I like multi-release. I use the same pedals on &amp; off

among bikes. Not really a big deal.

I very strongly recommend against &quot;pulling up&quot; whatever your pedal style
is. Nothing to be gained, much to be lost -- leave it to the pros who
get paid to risk their necks.

The danger of falling happens in the time window between when you stop
thinking about them all the time but still don't have fully trustworthy
reflexes -- these so-called &quot;clipless moments&quot; usually happen in the
first few days/weeks. Usually when you make a planned stop you
deliberately disengage early when learning, but sudden stops may take
you by surprise. Then there's the whole unclip right, topple left thing.

There is nothing wrong with SPD but they do have their detractors. The
cleats of the Speedplay Frogs are said to not be sufficiently recessed
for the best walkability. Others to consider are Eggbeater, Bebop, and

There are very few single-sided two-bolt pattern pedals available and

with the convenience of dual-sided (or four-sided Eggbeaters).

I think falling is just about inevitable. It won't likely happen on
your first few rides because you will be extra cautious but sooner or
later you will get complacent and you will come to a dead stop before
your mental &quot;command&quot; to release your foot arrives in time. This will
frequently result in you tipping over while still attached. Multi-
release SPDs will combat this to some extent. Most other pedal systems
don't let you pull out.

A lot of the learning to use clipless involves neurological changes to
reinforce the signaling from your brain to the foot. The body's
sensory and control connections are actually running with a 1 to 2-
second delay that is masked by the brain most of the time. You can
experience this for instance when you stub your toe and have to wait a
few seconds before feeling the pain. The same applies to motor
control. When I occasionally ride on platform pedals I always
involuntarily twist my foot off before stopping because the habit is
so ingrained and I don't clip out conciously anymore. A lot of new
clipless riders like to blame their pedals for not releasing them in
time to prevent a fall but usually it is just their inability to
command their foot to make the release in time even though they had a
concious impulse to release their foot.

I found when I started that I had a tendency to pull up while twisting,
which made the release action stiffer. You have a unlearn the habit
of lifting your foot as well as learning a new one.

&gt; I have been cycling with toe clips since before some of you were

&gt; Now I am considering going clipless.  I have a lot of questions.  I

I went thru a similar transition this spring. Here's what I did - I
got bike shoes (new) on eBay for like $25, and I got some used look
pedals for about $15 bucks, sprung for new cleats at the local bike
shop, $16. You might want to go cheap to see how it goes, then upgrade
next year?
Then I practiced riding on my indoor trainer until I got semi-used to
being clipless. My first clipless ride started  in an isolated parking
lot, and I didn't worry about speed or distance, just remaining
upright.
Key thing to remember is to keep moving and you can keep moving even
if both feet aren't fully clipped in. I haven't fallen yet.

I did it too but injured my leg so bad I couldn't walk unaided,
sitting hurt and standing required using my arms to push up. The only
comfortable position was on a bicycle.

To mount, I had to stand on the good leg, lay the bike down, lift the
bad leg over the top tube and pick up the bike. I also had to be
careful where I dabbed.

I'd recently begun riding most frequently with Power-Grips. I went
back to riding with clips and straps because I couldn't twist my leg
to release. It was pretty gimpy for about 3 months. I could still
feel the injury eighteen months later. Shortly after that I broke the
same leg over a curb riding, at speed, a bike with flat pedals.

I attribute that to a number of factors from piddle-poor FMUP design
to the semi-recumbent bike design that slammed me from behind instead
of permitting a spontaneous dismount off the back.

My experience suggest that tendon and ligament damage takes longer to
heal than a broken bone while egos are mended with a shrug.

I'm surprised no one put in a good word for the Time-ATAC MTB pedals.
Great clipless pedals, recessed cleat. It's what so many MTB pros use.
The basic design is mature as lately from year to year the
improvements/changes have been minor. A little pricier but they work
really well.

versions ago)

Funny you should mention that...  when this thread was young I put
in my vote for SPD; up until that point, it was the system I'd had
the most luck with on my daily commuter.

I did have one gripe with the SPDs, however -- even when set to a
pretty high tension, they would occasionally let go of my shoe
without much warning, at (as tends to be the case in such things)
just the wrong moment.  I'd read some good things about the ATACs as
opposed to SPD in this regard, so when someone advertised some
barely-used Time ATAC Aliums for cheap on my local Craigslist a few
days ago, I picked them up.  The difference is amazing.

The ATACs offer a wider release angle than my SPDs (with my cleats
you can set it to either 15 or 20 degrees).  But even more
importantly, the counter torque applied to your foot by the ATAC
cleat increases as you approach its release angle; it gives you
physical feedback before disengagement so you won't be caught by
surprise.

It takes a bit more effort (and therefore planning) to disengage the
ATACs than it did my old PD-M520s with SM-SH51 cleats, so I don't
necessarily recommend Time ATAC over Shimano SPD to this thread's
original poster -- or as a &quot;my first clipless pedal&quot; in general.
But Time ATAC is, as you say, a mature and effective design, even if
not as lightweight as Eggbeaters or as inexpensive as SPD.  I
absolutely recommend it for experienced clipless pedal users who
want high confidence in their feet's connection to the bike.

I ride one side platform, one side SPD on my grocery bike.  For my
commuter though I found a nice set of M636 pedals used and they've
really grown on me.  Basically they're double sided, large platform
shoes for BMX / Downhill stuff.  Even if you clip out, you're still
standing on a nice size pedal.
