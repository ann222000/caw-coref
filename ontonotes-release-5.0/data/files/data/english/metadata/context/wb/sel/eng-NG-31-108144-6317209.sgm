I have a few of these radios; I'm wanting to put together some battery
packs for them.  Does anyone have a good schematic for a DC-DC
converter to take 9vdc to 90vdc?
I'm also going to need to make up a 4-prong connector for the battery
packs; any ideas anyone?  Can the connectors be purchased?  Thanks a
lot

I did; didn't go so good.  I thought I'd try here, since bein' what
I'm proposing to make is a homebrew, so is somewhat relevant to the
forum.  Oh well, Guess I'll go hang out at the Yahoo groups for a
while; yahoo is my ISP anyway.

&gt; Why not 10 9V batteries in series?

I came across a couple of old original battery packs (full of defunct
carbon-zincs) that took the innards out of so that i can fill it with
D cells for the "A" voltage and 9v batteries for the "B" power.  You
can get the 9v battery connectors at Mouser for to cents apiece by the
hundred, and 5 cents for the pair if you buy just the connector snaps
and solder your own wires.  But I thought that it would be good to
have a battery pack that would take just one type of battery at a
minimum number.  6 "D" cells sounds interesting, and should give a
reasonable life.  I suppose I could use 10 9v battereis for the "B"
supply and two or three 9v in parallel for the "A" but that is still a
dozen or more batteries and the "A" supply won't last long.  Also a
person could use 60 + 6 "AA" cells . . . .
I know at least one person sells a dc/dc converter for Transoceanics
that takes 9 DC cells (+ 1 for the dial light) but they want 90 bucks
for it plus what ever the shipping charge is.

==========================================
A good  reason to build such a converter yourself....probably for
peanuts.  A 555 IC ,2 power transistors and a few passive components
Google is your friend.       After all this is THE homebrew NG.

Good Luck
