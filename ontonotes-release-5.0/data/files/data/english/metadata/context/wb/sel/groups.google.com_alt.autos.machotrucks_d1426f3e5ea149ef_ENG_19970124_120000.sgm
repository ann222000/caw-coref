kerosene is typically used as an additive to diesel in cold weather.
Kerosene also is cleaner and has a lower flash point.

A lower cetane number means that it will take a higher temperature

a higher cetane rating in the winter months. Many diesel suppliers
winterize their diesel in winter with additives. I would expect that the
additives raise the cetane number and help reduce the viscosity of the

I had a VW diesel years ago and I used to buy kerosene to cut the diesel
fuel in the winter so that the fuel would not &quot;wax&quot; out. Can also use
gasoline to cut diesel but it is not recommended. It never hurt my VW;
but I was judicious in its use.

Can't help you with No. 2 fuel oil in terms of cetane rating. My &quot;guess&quot;
is that a good quality No. 2 fuel oil is very similar to No. 2 diesel
and could be used on a limited basis with diesel. However, most No. 2
fuel oils are not as refined as diesel and are not formulated for
automotive use. Additionally, it is illegal to use non-road fuels in
highway applications since no highway taxes are paid on them.

Hope that helps you.

It is dangerous to mix gasoline into diesel, kerosene, fuel oils etc
because the vapour space above the liquid fuel in the tank becomes
explosive at normal ambient temperature. Normally, the vapour space in
a diesel tank is mostly air, and the mixture is too lean (not enough
fuel) to burn. Gasoline is the other way around. It is very volatile,
and the vapour space is mostly fuel vapour and is too rich to burn or
explode. These are the only two conditions under which it is safe to
handle either fuels. If you mix gasoline and diesel fuels together, the
vapour space becomes explosive, and any ignition source such as static,
wiring etc. could cause the tank to explode.

gasoline, naphtha, solvents etc should never be mixed with diesel fuels,
fuel oils, kerosene etc.

Works O.K. However, that is not the recommended way to &quot;thin&quot; diesel. Do
it only in an emergency. The preferable thing to do is either use
winterized diesel or add a few gallons of kerosene. I only had one
experience where diesel &quot;waxed&quot; out on me in a VW. That was an emergency
so gas was the appropriate thing to do.

"/> Given your ability to widely crosspost and to post similar
questions several times, I wasn't going to respond.
But considering some well-intentioned people have provided
misleading information about cetane number I'll provide some
information and references. Followups set to sci.energy.

The cetane number measures the ignition quality of a diesel fuel.

It is the % volume of cetane ( n-hexadecane, Cetane Number = 100 ) in
alpha methyl naphthalene ( Cetane Number = 0 ), that provides the specified
standard of 13 degrees ( crankshaft angle ) ignition delay at the identical
compression ratio to that of the fuel sample. These days, heptamethyl
nonane - with a Cetane Number of 15 - is used in place of alpha methyl
naphthalene because it is a more stable reference compound.

It is measured in special ASTM variable compression ratio test engine
that is closely controlled with regard to temperatures ( coolant 100C,
intake air 65.6C ), injection pressure ( 1500psi ), injection timing 13 degrees
BTDC, and speed (900rpm ). The compression ratio is adjusted until
combustion occurs at TDC ( the ignition delay is 13 degrees ). The test
is then repeated with reference fuels with five cetane numbers difference,
until two of them have comporession ratios that bracket tthe sample.
The cetane number is then determined by interpolation.

Now, if the fuel is pure hydrocarbons ( does not contain cetane number
improving agents like alkyl or amyl nitrates ) then the cetace number
can be predicted fairly well using some physical properties, such as
boiling point and aniline point.

It's obvious from the above that the higher the cetane number ( 100 = normal
alkane, 15 = iso-alkane ), then the lower the octane number ( 100 = iso-alkane,
0 = normal alkane ). This is because the desirable property of gasoline to
prevent knock is the ability to resist autoignition, whereas for diesel, the
desirable property is to autoignite. The octane number of normal alkanes
decreases as carbon chain length increases, whereas the cetane number
increases as the carbon chain length increases. Many other factors also
affect the cetane number, and around 0.5 volume % of cetane number
improvers will increase the cetane number by 10 units. Cetane number
improvers can be alkyl nitrates, primary amyl nitrates, nitrites, or peroxides.

In general, aromatics and alcohols have low cetane numbers ( that's why
people using methanol in diesels convert it to dimethyl ether ).

Typically engines are designed to use fuels with Cetane Numbers of 40-55,
because below 38 a more rapid increase in ignition delay. The significance of
the cetane number increases with the speed of the engine, and large, low
speed diesel engines often only specify viscosity, combustion and
contaminant levels, as Cetane Number requirement of the engine is met by
most distillate and residual fuels that have the appropriate propeties.
High speed diesel engines ( as in cars and trucks ) virtually all are designed
to accept fuels around 50 Cetane Numbers, with higher numbers being a
waste.

However, Cetane Number is only one important propety of diesel fuels, with
three of the others being also very important. Firstly, the viscosity is
important because many injection systems rely on the lubricity of the fuel for
lubrication. Secondly, the cold weather properties are important, remember that
normal alkanes are desirable, but the desirable diesel fraction alkanes
have melting points above 0C temperature, so special flow-enhancing
additives and changes to the hydrocarbon profiles occur seasonally.
That's why it's never a good idea to store diesel from summer for winter
use. Thirdly, diesel in many countries has a legal minimum flash point
( the minimum temperature it must attain to produce sufficient vapours
to ignite when a flame is applied. In all cases it's usually well above
ambient ( 60C+, kerosine is 37C+, whereas gasoline is typically below
-30C ), and anybody mixing a lowert flash point fraction with diesel will
usually void all insurance and warranties on the vehicle. The recent
increase in blending fuels has resulted in significantly more frequent
analyses of fuel tank contents from diesel vehicle fires.

From all of the above, you can see some common factors emerging,
larger normal alkanes are desirable, and they also burn with a less
smoky flame and have higher flash points than gasoline and kerosine,
making them also desirable for home heating fuels, however the relatively
expensive Cetane Index improvers have no value in heating fuels.

So heating oils are often a slightly different fraction, and may have
differing additives ( for cleaner combustion ) to fuels used for high
speed diesel engines. For low speed ( large, stationary and marine
engines ), they often use the cheapest residual fuel oil availble, as
do the larger heating boilers - so there is commonality of fuel as size
increases.

Details of the important, specified properties of various grades
( 1D, 2D, 4D ) of diesel fuel oils can be found in the Annual Book of
ASTM Standards. ASTM D975-93 &quot; Standard Specification for
Diesel Fuel Oils&quot;, as can the fuel oil specification for grades
1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in &quot; Standard Specification for Fuel Oils ASTM
D 396-92. Note that ASTN D975-93 actually defines the low temperature
requirements by dividing the USA into regions. It is possible for
a fuel to meet both specifications, but the diesel specification may have
additional requirements such as Cetane Number and Cloud Point
( temperature at which the fuel goes cloudy ), whereas the Fuel Oil
may have additional limits on the distillation properties, and viscosity at
100C. A fuel has to be tested for all the criteria in each specification
grade before it can be said to comply with the relevant grade in
each specification.

The interchanging and dilution of fuels is performed by
suppliers, taking into account the effect on all of the above, but
especially flash point, as that is closely regulated in many countries.
Adding kerosine and gasoline to diesel can have dramatic, adverse
effects on the flash point, with minimal gains in the flow properties
if the fuel already contains flow-improving additives. Regardless of
what other people may advise, check your insurance policies before
embarking on experimentation. These days, assessors for both vehicle
and insurance companies these days are far more aware of the
signs of the dilution of expensive diesel fuel by cheaper lowerr flash
fuels. Some countries, like NZ, avoid this by having diesel cheaper
than gasoline at the service station, and imposing taxes based on
distance travelled ( as measured by hubometers on vehicle wheels),
number and location of axles, axle loads, and gross vehicle weight,
as they more accurately indicate road damage potential.

effects on engine performance, the following are good sources.

answer exactly the above question.

He took a 4 inch length of 2x2 square stock and drilled a 1&quot; hole
about 3&quot; deep into one end. He intersected this hole with another
that was tapped for a spark plug. Various mixtures of gasoline and
diesel fuel were prepared and put inside. The open end was capped
with a rubber stopper, agitated (care was taken to not wet the spark
plug), let settled, and the spark plug was fired.

Boom? No. Even heating it and sparking it didn't do it.

Pure diesel resulted in a vapor space to lean to burn. Pure gasoline
resulted in a vapor space too rich to burn. A number of mixtures of
gasoline and diesel were tried and none went boom. I don't know if he
ever did any measurements of the fuel/air ratio in the vapor space,
but he came to the conclusion that even small amounts of gasoline in
the mixture volatilized and made the vapor space too rich.

Filling it with a stoichiometric oxy-acetylene mixture made a nice
boom, though. He even got pretty good at hitting the target he put
up across the lab.

&gt; opposite as the octane number for gasoline. Fuels that have a high
&gt; octane number (alcohols) have a low cetane number (heating oil).

&gt; I think kerosene has a low cetane number, I am not sure. I don't have a
&gt; reference manual handy. If you need exact numbers let me know and I
&gt; will dig out my handbook.

"/> 1 Feb 97

Both octane and cetain relate to a fuels ability to combust in an even
manner throughout the combustion chamber. The higher the number in
either cetane or octane (diesel or petrol) the better the fuel burns with
more MPG, better performance, etc. There are a number of additives out
which will safely boost cetane in diesel fuel without adversely raising
the temperature excessively in the combustion chamber. The latter must
be watched closely as diesel engines can tolerate just so much combustion
heat before damage takes place,

all current owners manuals are silent or warn against &quot;cutting&quot; diesel
fuel with gasoline. This is not a recommended practice and can be
dangerous.

&gt; Bob, you prolly know much more about alla this than I, but as I read yer
&gt; reply sum thots came to mind. I remember that my manual for my 7.3
&gt; liter
&gt; Ford says I can safely use up to (I think) 30% gasoline. Of course then
&gt; later it says don't use any additives.

&gt;&gt; because the vapour space above the liquid fuel in the tank becomes
&gt;&gt; explosive at normal ambient temperature. Normally, the vapour space
&gt;&gt; a diesel tank is mostly air, and the mixture is too lean (not enough

&gt; Now, why is this? Diesel is less volatile than gasoline, but if I
&gt; remember my chemistry correctly it too has a vapor pressure. The tank
&gt; is vented (in a way) so I would think the heavier vapor would displace
&gt; the air leaving only vapor in the tank.

&gt;&gt; fuel) to burn. Gasoline is the other way around. It is very volatile,
&gt;&gt; and the vapour space is mostly fuel vapour and is too rich to burn or
&gt;&gt; explode. These are the only two conditions under which it is safe to
&gt;&gt; handle either fuels. If you mix gasoline and diesel fuels together, the
&gt;&gt; vapour space becomes explosive, and any ignition source such as static,

&gt; Now, why would it become explosive? Perhaps you are right.. but vapor
&gt; pressures are
&gt; additive, they don't go away when mixed. If gasoline by itself can
&gt; displace the air
&gt; and oxygen in the tank then I would expect the mixture of gas &amp; diesel
&gt; would also.

&gt; A real concern I have here in Calif. is that the de-sulphered diesel
&gt; sold here now has
&gt; less lubricity.. and my Stanadine diesel injector pump is only
&gt; lubricated by the fuel
&gt; I put through it. Since the change in fuel I always ignore the owners
&gt; manual and add
&gt; the additive Stanadine markets and recommends, since they built the pump
&gt; in the first
&gt; place. Many other light-duty diesels use this pump also. I am afraid
&gt; mixing gasoline
&gt; would further jeopardize my pump.

You cannot safely mix 20% gasoline into diesel fuel, and in some
jurisdictions this would not be allowed.

"/> I can help you with that one!

THESE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ON THE ARKET SINCE THE EARLY 1900's SO HAVE
TRULY STOOD THE TEST OF TIME.

PRO-MA PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS ARE PART OF A VERY EXCITING PRODUCT RANGE. I
USED THESE AS A CONSUMER BUT BELIEVE IN THEM SO MUCH I NOW MARKET THEM!

PT5 PLUS PETROL TREATMENT Concentrated.
Saves money, energy, increase engine power, reduce fuel consumpton,
clean spark plugs, clean &amp; free sticky valves, clean engine while
driving, create film of lubricant, smooth engine operation prolong
engine life, improve combustion, control water &amp; condensation.
500ml bottles, 5 litre containers, 20/60/208 litre drums.

DT5 PLUS DIESEL TREATMENT. Concentrated.
Improve performance, reduce fuel consumption, clean injectors, reduce
water problems, control bacteria, prevent rust in fuel tanks, extend
fuel filter life, remove carbon buildup, prevent sludge in tank, reduce
downtime.
1 litre, 5 litre containers, 20/60/208 litre drums

Don't take my word for it...
READ EXTRACTS FROM THE TAFE REPORT.
AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CERTIFIED TEST.

PT5 PLUS (Petrol)
Specific Fuel Consumption. This is a more accurate measurement as it
takes into account the Horsepower generated. A lower Specific Fuel
Consumption indicates a more efficient engine. The least fuel economy
improvement we noted was 13%. This will vary widely according to fuel,
mechanical and operating conditions.

DT5 PLUS (Diesel)
Fuel economy improved more than 10% with a single dose of DT5 PLUS. The
reduction in exhaust smoke density was measured using a B.P. Hartridge
Smokemeter. This machine samples exhaust gas. In this case we were able
to obtain a 23% reduction in exhaust smoke density at 1800RPM.

MBL8 (Oil Additive) - Horsepower
The horsepower readings are the actual calculations. This reading is at
standard temperature and pressure. Note that the horsepower increased
3.5% when the MBL8 was added due to improved piston ring sealing, and a
reduction in friction.

These qualified, indisputable facts clearly show that the use of PT5,
DT5 PLUS and MBL8 can improve fuel consumption, lower exhaust emissions,
increase thermal efficiency, improve piston ring sealing, reduce
friction, increase horsepower and limit the load on our environment by
lowering carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions.

If anyone is interested further, contact me.
