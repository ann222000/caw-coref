Need tips on the proper way to accomplish tea staining - white cotton, no
stains. Just want a light ecru color.
One item does have embroidery/crochet work in pinks and greens: does this
mean I shouldn't even try to &quot;stain&quot; that one? Thanks in advance for advice
anyone can share. JC

Just curious why you want to stain your items but don't have advice on how to
do it.

It is simply a term I have heard, and believed it was an old technique which
could be used to provide an even stain to older linens. My original post was
polite and simply asked if anyone could provide advice on how to accomplish
this. FYI - I don't watch &quot;Martha&quot; or any others of her kind. Does anyone
have advice/tips or not?Again, Thanks in advance for your time - if you have
any helpful information. JC

Dear JC,
OK, OK!
Go to  www.dogpile.com  and enter &quot;tea stain linen&quot; without

Sorry, JC. I wasn't being rude. I was genuinely interested in the purpose of
staining fabrics.

I think it was the &quot;Martha&quot; comment that got under my skin. Maybe I'm just
overly sensitive today. Anyway, I'm over it and thanks to those who provided
a lot of good info. Hopefully we all learned something.
Ashley, I am particularly fond of your quote and use it quite often. Peace,

Jaycee, I did this as a teenager - rightly or wrongly - when I spilled
tea on a linen handkerchief. I knew the stain wouldn't come out
easily, so I just stuffed the entire hankie into the teacup. After
about a minute, I pulled it out and it was now entirely ecru.

The link that T/13 gave is very good - it's a really simple process
that's kind of fun. The only caveat is whether you want to dye
linens that may have some sort of value. It IS possible to remove
many old stains, including those irritating yellow ones.

If you soak it in water first, you can use stronger tea and
you won't get the creases. Don't do this with your tie-dye
unless you just want dye. q;)8-&lt;
