'It's worse at sea.' -- Anonymous.

Sir Francis Bacon, visionary of the settlement
of North America ('Of Plantations,' The New Atlantis),
and a founder, investor and officer of the Virginia
Company of London (Second Charter), is the only
Shakespeare authorship candidate to have produced
evidence to prove that he possessed expert knowledge
of seamanship equal to that of the author of The Tempest.

With the loss of two Virginia Company ships in 1609,
both a financial blow to the Company and a loss of sons
and friends of investors, Bacon was provided with motivation
to scientifically study the behavior of wind on sails.

Bacon built windmill sails in his laboratory to try to induce
the principles of effects of wind on various modifications of
sails (these experiments are briefly described in another
section of the History of the Winds).

In 'The Motion of the Wind on the Sails of Ships, Bacon
describes specific maneuvers of seamanship required to
control the sails in order to slow, turn and tack a ship under
various conditions of wind and drift.

Bacon's 'orders to the crew,' in Items 26 to 35 In 'The Motion
of Wind on the Sails of Ships,' envisage the Bos'n's five orders
in first act of The Tempest:

Take in the topsail
Bring her to try wi' th' main course
Lay her a-hold
Set her two courses; Off to sea again.
Lay her off.

While those orders look simple, the last four represent
a series of complex maneuvers.

In 'The Motions of Wind,' Bacon provides an example of a
full-rigged ship of 1100 tons, three masts, 112 feet long in
the keel and -there's a typo in the page--probably 24 feet
in the beam which was typical in a fast ship.

Bacon gives the dimensions of its yards and sails (Items 9 - 19).

Item 10. The topsail of the same mast was 50 feet deep,
84 feet wide at the base, and 42 at the top.

The oversize sails on three-masted ships were very fast
leeward and not impossible to turn windward-in a storm
the ship is steered mainly with the sails--but so heavy
they were difficult to haul up or take down which would
be a problem for the seamen in The Tempest. Later the
size of the sails on full-rigged ships were reduced.

In the first act of The Tempest, a lookout has spotted land,
the storm is driving the ship leeward toward the shore and
the Bos'n has very little time to slow the drift and turn
the ship windward out to sea, a very difficult maneuver
because square-sailed full-rigged ships required a lot of
'sea room' to turn. They weren't racing sloops that can
turn in a bathtub and sail straight into the wind.

Bacon knows the drill. In Item 34 Bacon writes that
the 'weight of the wind' or pressure is stronger at the
top of the ship and for this reason 'in heavy storms
they first lower the yards and furl the topsails.'

In Item 26 Bacon provides a scientific justification for
taking down the foremast topsail:

Item 26. Ships are better propelled by the motion
of the wind in the upper than in the lower tiers of
sails; because violent motion is most powerful
when furthest removed from the resistance; as is
shown in levers and the sails of windmills. But it
endangers the sinking or upsetting of the ship . . .

In a storm, the intense wind hitting the topsail not only
propels the ship forward but the buffeting of the topsail
('the violent motion that is most powerful when furthest
from the resistance'--that is, the hull) reduces the stability
of the ship, causing it to roll. (Neil Tanner, Godspeed).

In Item 26, Bacon adds that the topsails are principally
used at sea when there is little wind. Since the impending
disaster in The Tempest is the reverse-there is too much
wind--the topsails would be furled or the ropes cut from
the yards below allowing the sails to blow free in the wind
as those of the distressed ships-the one in the foreground
has already gone down-in Ludolf Backhuysen's 17th c.
marine landscape above.

The FAQ page for the Godspeed replica (the original
Godspeed carried the first Virginia Company colonists
to Jamestown) confirms Bacon's observation about the
effect of winds on the topsail.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

So, did bacon develop his work on seamanship sui generis? Did he in the
*laboratory* using 'windmill sails' invent various terms of language
that might be used by sailors? Did he in his workshop coin the phrase
'take in the topsail'?, 'lay her ahold' etc.?

Or did he gain his knowledge by observation or conversation with
sailors? - and having received their knowledge examined and refined it
with scientific analysis.

Anyone could have spoken to a sailor or learnt by observation. So your
argument fails. QED.

Bacon was in the habit of going into the working
class districts of London to interview tradesmen.
I've posted on it.

Bacon was also notorious for playing the
parts of the various characters using different class and
regional dialects and accents when he was telling stories. His friends
were enchanted. Bacon was an actor
(musician, singer). He spoke at least five languages.
As a ward of Burghley Bacon was raised with young earls
from shires all over England most of whom spoke local
dialects. He probably picked it up there.

So the dialects in the Shakespeare works would have been
no problem for Bacon.

Bacon was trained as a diplomat and spent some time
in the service of Walsingham.There's a letter from Bacon who was in
Italy to his cousin Sir Thomas Bodley in which he mentions that he will
be traveling to eight or ten countries including Denmark.

Bacon crossed the Channel
at least four times when he was at the Court of France.

I haven't gotten into the technical stuff yet. There are four more
orders but really, which is stronger evidence, interminable Strat
excuses and explanations or actual early 17th c. documents like The
Motion of the

&lt;&lt;The Susan Constant and the Godspeed made several roundtrip passages
from England to Jamestown. Their services, after leaving the charter of
the Virginia Company, is unknown. However, as they served as colliers
before, it may be presumed they returned to this duty. The Discovery was
purchased from the Muscovy Company and remained in Virginia waters after
her arrival in 1607. It is confirmed in records that this small vessel
sailed up many bays and rivers along the coast. It was from this vessel
that the area of Cape Cod was charted in 1609. It is believed these
charts, later obtained in England, assisted the Mayflower upon her
arrival in the Cape Cod area in 1620.&gt;&gt;

--------------------------------------------------------
Romeo and Juliet Act 1, Scene 3

Nurse: . . . well, Susan is with God;
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Susan Constant: May 26

Susanna Shakespeare Hall: (May 26, 1583 - July 11, 1649)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Captain John Smith (January 9, 1580 - June, 1631) was an English
adventurer &amp; soldier, and one of the founders of the Jamestown.
At his feet is a volume with the initials of [T]homas [H]ariot
who compiled a small dictionary of the Indian Language.

Smith himself holds a copy of his famous map of Virginia. The other
loyal friend and Patron is Sir Samuel Saltonstall, son of a Lord Mayor
of London. He it was who bore the costs of printing Smith's Sea Grammar.
Not only did he undertake this but he also held open house for Smith at
his home in Snow Hill, to the west of this Church. In this house a room
was reserved for Smith who had a trunk standing there, no doubt for his
personal books &amp; belongings. Sir Samuel's first cousin, Sir Richard
Saltonstall, founded the Massachusetts branch of the family which
continues to this day. The Tower of the Church stands behind his figure
and is shown as it was before restoration not long after Smith died.

Below these three figures is the trio of vessels which on a dark
December night in 1606, sailed down the Thames to arrive on
April 26th of the following year on the coast of Virginia.
Discovery 20 tons/Susan Constant 120 tons /Godspeed 40 tons.

The Heraldry at the top of the window also has its own story.
From left to right, we see the Monogram R.H.
standing for Robert Hunt, Vicar of Heathfield, Sussex and
Chaplain to the Expedition and the Colony. Next are the Arms of Thomas,
Lord De La Warr, eldest brother of Francis West and Lord Governor and
Captain General for South Virginia. Adjoining this are the Arms of
*Henry Carey* ,Earl of Dover, to whom Smith dedicated his True Travels,
Adventures and Observations of 1629. Then follow the Arms of William
Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, another Patron to whom Smith's book was
dedicated, and the Arms of Frances Howard, Duchess of Richmond and
Lennox, who financed Smith's General History and permitted him to
include an engraving of her Portrait. This line of tracery ends with
the letters B.G. standing for Bartholomew Gosnold the Pathfinder of New
England who was the prime mover of the Colony of Virginia. High at the
top of the Window are the letters S.H. separated by a Cross, standing
for St. Helen's, Willoughby by Alford in the County of Lincoln
where Captain John Smith was baptised on January 9th 1580.&quot;&gt;&gt;

In those days the practices of traditional trades such as sailing were
trade secrets, and even national secrets. For an aristocrat like Bacon
to know them would have been possible; for &quot;the Stratman,&quot; so the
argument goes, it would have been impossible. (An example: In
Columbus' time the contents of maps and sea charts were state secrets
and were vital to the economic and military competition among the
states of Western Europe. Distribution was on a strictly
&quot;need-to-know&quot; basis, and everybody who did know, also knew that, and
was bound to keep the secret confined to themselves.) These facts
don't really apply to this particular time and place, but they more or
less do -- Bacon was an aristocrat, and William Shakespeare wasn't, and
so the syllogism holds -- good enough to get the point across, and
everyone knows the rest.

If we can imagine that &quot;talking to sailors&quot; could have done it, of
course, though, there's really no problem. If we don't feel that's a
sufficient explanation, the Baconian argument tends to undermine the
obvious and therefore accepted account (the &quot;Stratfordian&quot; one),
without having put another and better account in its place. We may
therefore feel that a conspiracy to put one over on the people,
directed from basically on high, is the only possible explanation: thus
the argument of some Oxfordians.

Good, also select Portugese 'rutters' [look up] for you viewers. I am sure
they will learn nothing, since naval navigation provided the key to a newly
opened world. And this key was of massive commercial worth.

I suggest this is a context against which to review all exoteric material
and references in the period.

such as sailing were
trade secrets, and even national secrets.&quot;

That's generally accurate but there were two 'sciences,' seamanship and
navigation. The two were kept separate.

Pilots were the aristocrats of sailing and they did have 'trade
secrets' that were not written down. It took twenty years to become a
good pilot and the knowledge was passed from pilot to pilot, the best
pilots being Portugese.

Seamen knowledge and experience which was not particularly secret--this
profession was so dangerous and had such a high attrition rate any
seaman would have been safer in the front lines in Flanders--so they
passed around small manuscript notebooks which had navigational
information specific to different ports and coastlines. The purpose
may have been to prepare lookouts because the pilots would not share
their maps of reefs, bars and bad tides.
Pilots could be washed overboard like any common seaman so it made
sense that mariners know something of this craft.

You're also correct that navigational data was treated like state
secrets. One of the most devastating political secrets was the
existence of the hurricane season. The English didn't know about the
hurricane season even at the time of the Virginia Company. If it had,
it would not have sent the Third Supply from Plymouth in May.

The English figured it out the hard way and at least one of them later
gave tributes to the Caribs who could read the environment and know
when a hurricane was brewing. The record apparently indicates that the
Caribs never missed a hurricane which just goes to show you that
Bacon's observation of nature science is superior to German idealism.

Had Bacon not been so systematically bashed by Stratfordianism we might
not be ten years away from a runaway situation with global warming.
With anti-empirical science it's too easy to keep your head up your
ideological
ass.

This is why the authorship dispute is not about anything as trivial
as whether the actor could write his name.

Elizabeth

Yes again, for any first-person knowledge of these affairs, what you say is
true, even if we posit Bacon eg nipping across the chanel some 4 times as a
passenger/observer - but is it not impossible to acquire a more detailed and

Well - the more I read, and in respect of Elizabeths Weir's point, the less
I am convinced. England as not yet the first sea-faring nation, was still
relatively 'damp' - no part of English mainland is more than 70 miles from
the sea, and we might expect a certain amount of en-troped 'common'
knowledge to have reached even Stratford.

Yet the material that Elizabeth has quoted is not of an ordinary kind, it
does not confuse some dozens of possibly second-hand reported knowledge, it
is not verbose or figurative, but a more succinct version of what it was to
command a vessel.

Some authority is evident here.

I have not quite followed your later points to any understanding. But apart
from any determinations of /who/ may have learned such direct, pert, and
non-confused language, do we agree that it would seem to be beyond a normal
understanding of a citizen of a sea-faring nation at this time in history?

&gt; sufficient explanation, the Baconian argument tends to undermine the
&gt; obvious and therefore accepted account (the &quot;Stratfordian&quot; one),
&gt; without having put another and better account in its place. We may
&gt; therefore feel that a conspiracy to put one over on the people,
&gt; directed from basically on high, is the only possible explanation: thus
&gt; the argument of some Oxfordians.

Was 1622 less perilous than 1602? I think so, if even it was still

Bacon instigated (or came close to it) the modern practice of
publishing these kinds of things, and having them printed in such a way
that *anyone* could learn them. On the other hand (the argument
continues), Shakespeare was too early to have read Bacon. For it to
become known that ordinary townsmen like William Shakespeare of
Stratford-on-Avon could be privy to this kind of information would
upset, thus, the terribly-powerful Stratford Trust. Shakespeare is

The actor was only three years younger than Bacon but it has not been

Strats ought to start there.

Bacon's Sydney cousins and their uncle the Earl of Leicester, Bacon's

Someone, no doubt Leicester, gave Bacon an entire building next to
Gray's Inn and Bacon writes to Burghley threatening to become a 'seller

Bacon's appointment at Court.

Leicester was looking twenty years down the road to an invasion by

Yes and no. Bacon left emphatic instructions that The New Atlantis was
not to be printed so he wasn't advocating a governmental scientific
elite. Rawley admired The New Atlantis so much he defied Bacon's
instructions. I assume that Bacon envisioned a meritocracy since
that's effectively how the English system worked with gifted sizers
rising through the universities then to Court and official positions.

On the other hand, Bacon was the first in history to advocate for
universal education (The Advancement of Learning) but he warned against
issuing too many university degrees which, in fact, caused real social
problems in England as it shortly will in the US. The Tudors had this
grand plan to form a class of Protestant allies by drastically
increasing the university enrollment but it only resulted in the
takeover of the Church of England by Calvinist clerics.

Another brilliant Tudor idea that made the English Civil War
inevitable.

As Falconer states, it isn't just a list of orders.

The reason that naval officers like Lord Mulgreve,
Lord of the Admiralty were in awe of the 'science'
of that scene is that it represents one of the worst
crises in seamanship and everything was done by
the book (except the book was not yet printed).

The author, like Bacon, understood the rigging
of the square-sail ship and how it that rigging
would have to be handled not on the open seas when
the ship is sailing windward--I could write that--but
in an emergency when the wind would be driving hard
from three successive directions; leeward, on the beam
and windward. The boatswain has to virtually turn the
ship around and tack before the wind to avoid what
looks like certain death. That might be Sailing 101 in a
20-foot sloop but tall ships can't sail straight into the
wind.

Anyway, we're not accepting the 'he milked sailors
down at the docks' excuse anymore. I think that one
was Furnivall's. Maybe Fleay's.

It's not a question of masts and maps but charts and maps. Which was
in the rutter? Since charts are sort of shallow-water representations
of data like soundings and shoals and the pilot's maps were on a
sheepskin parchment with north designated by the former neck of the
sheep, I think the charts were probably in the rutter.

Actually it has been factually established. The folio says that william

necessarily, that he could write.

The wording of that sentence may not be the best,
but her expansion of her meaning (about maps and
sea-charts, in the rest of the paragraph) is entirely
correct and well-expressed. The ships of those
days were the equivalent of the aircraft, tanks and
submarines of the Cold War, and new technology
was kept as secret as possible for as long as
possible. Likewise, 'trade secrets' were all jealously
guarded (about where to trade or to fish, or the best
routes -- avoiding or using winds and currents).

People with knowledge that might possibly be
useful to others would not casually reveal it to
passing strangers, no matter how noble.

Chaucer actually wrote a book on science. This subject of scientific
knowledge was considered so volatile that fully one quarter of his
manuscript was enciphered. Chaucer also wrote a MSS on text encipherment.

Knowledge was a rare thing. Apart from any political appreciations anyone
may have had so as to repress their own work, since it would receive
official censure &amp;c, there was the additional motive that by making certain
information public it would become diluted, misrepresented and thereby
misapprehended in its application.

Bianca makes much the same point below.

The question then - if we agree that these naval references are more
esoteric than could be gleaned by casual study - is to examine what means of
access The Author would have needed to better inform himself.

&gt; If sailing was such a 'state secret', then what was sir francis bacon
&gt; doing publishing a work on it in 1622?

"/>

Or putting it in the opening scene of a play in 1610? :) *That's* a mistake
Bacon wouldn't have made. A &quot;Stratford hustler&quot; might, though.

(And, am I crazy, or isn't part of the argument that Bacon got this
information by wandering the streets interviewing tradesmen? As Mr. Frizer
observes, you can't have it both ways.)

Anyway, the &quot;state secret&quot; argument just doesn't hold. The kind of
information we're talking about in the plays just isn't the same as maps and
weather reports. (I may have missed something here, but we're still talking
about *two pages* of a play in which a ship is handled properly in a storm,
right?) It's not the kind of information you could conceivably keep secret.
The maneuvers would have been observed by thousands of sailors (who then
moved from ship to ship; &quot;I'd love to tell you how to save our lives, Cap'n,
but it's a state secret.&quot;) Even if the information was somehow closely
held, the maneuvers would have been rediscovered accidentally on ships which
were &quot;out of the loop&quot;. The information may have been expert, but it
couldn't have been much of a secret.

Going back to an earlier topic, one mistake that is commonly made here is
the failure to recognize aspects of the writing process in general, and the
process of developing a play in particular.

As has been observed before in this thread, even a novelist or poet, alone
in his garrett, may seek out information to improve the accuracy of his
writing. Having written, he may confer with an expert to review the
results.

In the theater, the latter half of this process is almost enforced by the
circumstances. For example, I was in a staged reading of a play which
involved the transmission of infection. The playwright had read up on
sterile technique, but this wasn't the aspect that really interested him; he
made some mistakes and didn't give us much to work with. So, in rehearsal,
a crew member who had spent some time in hospital work clued us in on actual
hospital practices. Mostly these just helped us behave properly on stage,
but a few of her observations ended up in the final script.

Shakespeare worked in a company of more than a dozen players, and many of
the productions would have required them to pick up handfuls of extras and
bit players. These guys would have brought a wealth of life experience
which would inevitably have found its way into the scripts, and not just
Shakespeare's. In this light, Shakespeare the company member was *better*
able than the starched aristocrats to have produced the supposedly expert
knowledge shown in the plays.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bacon was in the habit of going into the working
&gt;&gt;&gt;class districts of London to interview tradesmen.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I've posted on it.

&gt;&gt; In those days the practices of traditional trades such as sailing were
&gt;&gt; trade secrets, and even national secrets. For an aristocrat like Bacon
&gt;&gt; to know them would have been possible; for &quot;the Stratman,&quot; so the
&gt;&gt; argument goes, it would have been impossible. (An example: In
&gt;&gt; Columbus' time the contents of maps and sea charts were state secrets
&gt;&gt; and were vital to the economic and military competition among the
&gt;&gt; states of Western Europe. Distribution was on a strictly
&gt;&gt;&quot;need-to-know&quot; basis, and everybody who did know, also knew that, and
&gt;&gt; was bound to keep the secret confined to themselves.) These facts
&gt;&gt; don't really apply to this particular time and place, but they more or
&gt;&gt; less do -- Bacon was an aristocrat, and William Shakespeare wasn't, and
&gt;&gt; so the syllogism holds -- good enough to get the point across, and
&gt;&gt; everyone knows the rest.

&gt;&gt; If we can imagine that &quot;talking to sailors&quot; could have done it, of
&gt;&gt; course, though, there's really no problem. If we don't feel that's a
&gt;&gt; sufficient explanation, the Baconian argument tends to undermine the
&gt;&gt; obvious and therefore accepted account (the &quot;Stratfordian&quot; one),
&gt;&gt; without having put another and better account in its place. We may
&gt;&gt; therefore feel that a conspiracy to put one over on the people,
&gt;&gt; directed from basically on high, is the only possible explanation: thus
&gt;&gt; the argument of some Oxfordians.

Mr. Frizer is mistaken. You can have it both ways because the science

dialogue like 'bring her to try wi' th' main course' was gotten first
hand from one of Bacon's sea trips to France or Spain. Bacon was renown

Folger bought a large collection of annotated books and notebooks from

page from a notebook that was 'lost' in the British Museum until the
founder of the Baconian Society located it. There's apparently another
still lost in the British Museum. Apparently only what's 'lost' of
Bacon's manuscripts have a chance of survival.

There may be a few lines from The Tempest in the notebook but really
it's imporant for 112 notes for the R &amp; J which was written at the same

I have proof that the First Folio was a spoof written by a professional

which isn't a blinding insight since he was a parodist and satirist.

Jonson, not coincidently, was Bacon's 'literary assistant' when the
First Folio was edited (Archbishop Thomas Tenison).

Jonson starts his 'mock eulogy' with a trope on Ovid that indicates
that the author is still living ('Envy, the living, not the dead doth
bite'). The tropes don't stop there. Jonson repudiates the whole
'eulogy' in De Shakespeare No Strat. and Dominus Verulanus in
Discoveries. Strats won't touch this. I found an entire work on
Elizabethan dedicatory and commendatory verses and the author said that
she wasn't going to include the Shakespeare dedications because they
were 'too problematic.'

The burden of proof is not on the Baconians and Oxfordians to find
evidence of the actor's literacy because it's the Strats that make the
claim.

It is, however, the burden of Baconians and Oxfordians to puncture the
Strat evidence, such as it is, and frankly, the Oxfordians are not
holding up their end of the deal. Too much relying on 19th c. Baconian
analysis--all of it solid but not current--and too much romanticizing
Oxford. (I except Price who romanticizes her 'anonymous aristocrat' but

I'm not talking about precedence among individuals. Knowledge about
the practice of trades belonged to the trades at question; the law
supported this right; it was part of keeping the peace. Additionally,
the state possessed the right to control all knowledge it thought best
to keep within its own borders. This balance was increasingly
ruptured, and Francis Bacon is often considered an important catalyst
of that rupture. Publication of &quot;trade secrets&quot; might cause concern in
different ways, in different situations.

You are quite right, Frizer. There is no way to prove absolutely that
Jonson hated WS of Stratford; however, I find it hard to believe that
Sogliardo with his motto of &quot;Not Without Mustard,&quot; is not a parody of WS. It
is rather a vicious parody. The name itself is pretty nasty, as is the name
of Sogliardo's brother, Sordido. EMOH, which I had not read in some time but
read again over Christmas, was interesting enough for me to wonder whether
Jonson was either lying in the FF, or being deliberately ambiguous, or
speaking of someone else entirely. I believe that some or most traditional
scholars agree that Sogliardo is WS of Stratford, but would need to go check
some sources to tell you who they are. Greenblatt is one of them.

I would also be interested in anyone's take on the dialogue about
Sogliardo's monument in EMOH. Or at least, I'll be interested in it by
Tuesday, when I'm done with my galleys.

Bacon, raised by Calvinists, had a killer work
ethic. It was a sinne to waste a minute that could be turned to good
works. After he invented a shorthand, Bacon would walk the paths of
his water gardens with
two scribes following behind, scribbling notes. (Pencils had been
invented).

Bacon would usually pass out--he fainted once a
day--and would be carried back to the house to
sleep it off, always waking up with an insight.

I didn't say it was a mystery. We're chosing
between authorship candidates based on the
evidence. There are two reasons to believe that
the author had a high degree of expertise in
seamanship; 1) the experts say so and 2) the
Strats are afraid of it.

If the actor wrote the works there would be
thousands of articles on seamaship and on the
Strachey letter but there's dead silence. Kathman
was the first since Charles Mills Gayley to seriously
write about the Strachey letter and that was only
because Kathman knew the Strachey letter would
eliminate the Oxfordian claim to authorship.

I think Kathman is honest but Kathman wouldn't know
about the secrecy resolutions at the Virginia Company
published by a couple of historians in Virginia or
probably that Bacon was an officer at the Company

It's not the same. Bacon's cross-Channel trips are
documented. Strats have even--supported by exactly
zero evidence--tried to place the actor among a troupe
that toured Germany to give the actor some exposure
to sailing. That would do double duty because Strats
can't explain how he got a source for The Tempest
printed only in German, Jacob Ayers' Die Schone Sidea.

Bacon's grandfather and tutor, who fled to Strasburg
to avoid being burned at the stake by Mary, spoke
fluent German so it's possible, at least, that Bacon
picked up enough German to be able to read it.

I must add a few notes of qualification.

Even though a ship were square-rigged, it may also possess try-sails, This
are, as suggested by their name, triangular affairs, which are rigged in
addition to the square-rigged ones. They are also not rigged square to the
mast as are other sails, but at a significant [tri]angle to them.

Additionally, it would be true to say that for the channel, most ships were
square rigged, but in the Med this would be unusual even for vessels of the
same tonnage, and the form of vessel there would be of a lateen-type, a
massive triangular affair, not square rigged. These vessels rarely ventured
beyond the Gates of Hercules, except to perhaps hug the coast of Spain -
they were not weatherly in the Atlantic. Galleys could also achieve
significant tonnage, could be as large as 'a ship' and also be masted. These
vessels may weigh from 100 to 200 tons.

The word 'ship' is also a technical term in naval argot, and other vessels,
with however many masts, even if square rigged, have other discrete names [a
great quantity of them; sloops, snows, herring-bus &lt;g&gt;]. So: a caveat is
that most land-lubbers will refer to almost anything that floats and has a
mast as 'a ship', whereas a naval cove will use the technical name for the
vessel. A final devastating point is that 'a ship' is also named because of
the rank of its officer, and are described in a hierarchial rating system;
Frigate, 6th rate, eg. is the smallest possible 'ship'. :))

Finally, these vessels had very small in tonnage in Elizabethan times,
perhaps not even 200 hundred tons [what was the Mary Rose?], whether they
were ships, or lateen-rigged.

Spain laterly favored galleons, huge great things relatively, and these
could be from 500 to 1000 tons. The Royal Navy resisted building these huge
vessels, and concentrated on gaining superior quantites of smaller ones.

&gt; You are quite right, Frizer. There is no way to prove absolutely that
&gt; Jonson hated WS of Stratford; however, I find it hard to believe that
&gt; Sogliardo with his motto of &quot;Not Without Mustard,&quot; is not a parody of WS.

"/>

It

I think it would be fair to say that Jonson had a love-hate relationship
with Shakespeare (of Stratford *and* the writer; one person) - along with
the rest of the theater community. Haven't read EMOH since college, so I'm
talking from secondary sources here, but Sogliardo seems to be the result of
some particular nastiness during the theater wars and exaggerates some of
SOS's less pleasant characteristics. For the rest of his life, Jonson
couldn't write a line of praise for Shakespeare without including a
derogatory comment as well. But Shakespeare wasn't alone in this. It tells
us more about Jonson than Shakespeare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; is rather a vicious parody. The name itself is pretty nasty, as is the
name
&gt; of Sogliardo's brother, Sordido. EMOH, which I had not read in some time
but
&gt; read again over Christmas, was interesting enough for me to wonder whether
&gt; Jonson was either lying in the FF, or being deliberately ambiguous, or
&gt; speaking of someone else entirely. I believe that some or most traditional
&gt; scholars agree that Sogliardo is WS of Stratford, but would need to go
check
&gt; some sources to tell you who they are. Greenblatt is one of them.

&gt; I would also be interested in anyone's take on the dialogue about
&gt; Sogliardo's monument in EMOH. Or at least, I'll be interested in it by
&gt; Tuesday, when I'm done with my galleys.

&gt; Regards,
&gt; Lynne

&gt;&gt; SO much for that.

&gt;&gt; Try using your brain instead of your prejudices (your hatred of the
&gt;&gt; 'stratman' is cooking your brain).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Prof. Annabel
&gt;&gt;&gt; Patterson, Yale University, states that 'Jonson wrote on two levels'
&gt;&gt;&gt; which isn't a blinding insight since he was a parodist and satirist.

&gt;&gt; I see so when Jonson says of Bacon:

&gt;&gt;&quot;I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was only proper to
&gt;&gt; himself, in that he seemed to me ever, by his works, one of the greatest
&gt;&gt; men, and most worthy of admiration that has been in many Ages.&quot;

&gt;&gt; We must take this as a spoof? As a parody of what Jonson really thought
&gt;&gt; of Bacon. DO tell!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson, not coincidently, was Bacon's 'literary assistant' when the
&gt;&gt;&gt; First Folio was edited (Archbishop Thomas Tenison).

&gt;&gt; Except there is no evidence that Bacon or Jonson had anything to do with
&gt;&gt; editing the folio.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson starts his 'mock eulogy' with a trope on Ovid that indicates
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the author is still living ('Envy, the living, not the dead doth
&gt;&gt;&gt; bite').

&gt;&gt; THe author is still living. He lives by his works. The poem is actually
&gt;&gt; titled to the memory of the deceased which gives a clear indication of
&gt;&gt; the corporeal state of mr william shakespeare, poet.

&gt;&gt; The other authors in the preface to the folio also CLEARLY STATE THAT MR
&gt;&gt; WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD ON AVON, AUTHOR AND ACTOR IS DEAD.
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO EQUIVOCATION ON THE FACT.

&gt;&gt; The tropes don't stop there. Jonson repudiates the whole
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'eulogy' in De Shakespeare No Strat. and Dominus Verulanus in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Discoveries.

&gt;&gt; More fabrication- this time without even an attempt to supply evidence.

&gt;&gt; Strats won't touch this. I found an entire work on
&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabethan dedicatory and commendatory verses and the author said
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; she wasn't going to include the Shakespeare dedications because they
&gt;&gt;&gt; were 'too problematic.'

&gt;&gt; Probably because she has been infected by antistrat propaganda.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The burden of proof is not on the Baconians and Oxfordians to find
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence of the actor's literacy because it's the Strats that make the
&gt;&gt;&gt; claim.

&gt;&gt; No, the historical record factually and explicitly establishes the claim
&gt;&gt; of will shakespeare of stratford.

&gt;&gt; If the the baconians and oxfordians wish to challenge the historical
&gt;&gt; record it is for them to make the running.

&gt;&gt; Regards,

&gt;&gt; Frizer

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is, however, the burden of Baconians and Oxfordians to puncture
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Strat evidence, such as it is, and frankly, the Oxfordians are not
&gt;&gt;&gt; holding up their end of the deal. Too much relying on 19th c. Baconian
&gt;&gt;&gt; analysis--all of it solid but not current--and too much romanticizing
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford. (I except Price who romanticizes her 'anonymous aristocrat'
but
&gt;&gt;&gt; nevertheless is willing to spend time on the evidence).

&gt; If sailing was such a 'state secret', then what was sir francis bacon

"/>

Or putting it in the opening scene of a play in 1610? :) *That's* a mistake
Bacon wouldn't have made. A &quot;Stratford hustler&quot; might, though.

(And, am I crazy, or isn't part of the argument that Bacon got this
information by wandering the streets interviewing tradesmen? As Mr. Frizer
observes, you can't have it both ways.)

Anyway, the &quot;state secret&quot; argument just doesn't hold. The kind of
information we're talking about in the plays just isn't the same as maps and
weather reports. (I may have missed something here, but we're still talking
about *two pages* of a play in which a ship is handled properly in a storm,
right?) It's not the kind of information you could conceivably keep secret.
The maneuvers would have been observed by thousands of sailors (who then
moved from ship to ship; &quot;I'd love to tell you how to save our lives, Cap'n,
but it's a state secret.&quot;) Even if the information was somehow closely
held, the maneuvers would have been rediscovered accidentally on ships which
were &quot;out of the loop&quot;. The information may have been expert, but it
couldn't have been much of a secret.

Going back to an earlier topic, one mistake that is commonly made here is
the failure to recognize aspects of the writing process in general, and the
process of developing a play in particular.

As has been observed before in this thread, even a novelist or poet, alone
in his garrett, may seek out information to improve the accuracy of his
writing. Having written, he may confer with an expert to review the
results.

In the theater, the latter half of this process is almost enforced by the
circumstances. For example, I was in a staged reading of a play which
involved the transmission of infection. The playwright had read up on
sterile technique, but this wasn't the aspect that really interested him; he
made some mistakes and didn't give us much to work with. So, in rehearsal,
a crew member who had spent some time in hospital work clued us in on actual
hospital practices. Mostly these just helped us behave properly on stage,
but a few of her observations ended up in the final script.

Shakespeare worked in a company of more than a dozen players, and many of
the productions would have required them to pick up handfuls of extras and
bit players. These guys would have brought a wealth of life experience
which would inevitably have found its way into the scripts, and not just
Shakespeare's. In this light, Shakespeare the company member was *better*
able than the starched aristocrats to have produced the supposedly expert
knowledge shown in the plays.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bacon was in the habit of going into the working

&gt;&gt;&gt;I've posted on it.

&gt;&gt; In those days the practices of traditional trades such as sailing were
&gt;&gt; trade secrets, and even national secrets. For an aristocrat like Bacon
&gt;&gt; to know them would have been possible; for &quot;the Stratman,&quot; so the
&gt;&gt; argument goes, it would have been impossible. (An example: In
&gt;&gt; Columbus' time the contents of maps and sea charts were state secrets
&gt;&gt; and were vital to the economic and military competition among the
&gt;&gt; states of Western Europe. Distribution was on a strictly
&gt;&gt;&quot;need-to-know&quot; basis, and everybody who did know, also knew that, and
&gt;&gt; was bound to keep the secret confined to themselves.) These facts
&gt;&gt; don't really apply to this particular time and place, but they more or
&gt;&gt; less do -- Bacon was an aristocrat, and William Shakespeare wasn't, and
&gt;&gt; so the syllogism holds -- good enough to get the point across, and
&gt;&gt; everyone knows the rest.

&gt;&gt; If we can imagine that &quot;talking to sailors&quot; could have done it, of
&gt;&gt; course, though, there's really no problem. If we don't feel that's a
&gt;&gt; sufficient explanation, the Baconian argument tends to undermine the
&gt;&gt; obvious and therefore accepted account (the &quot;Stratfordian&quot; one),
&gt;&gt; without having put another and better account in its place. We may
&gt;&gt; therefore feel that a conspiracy to put one over on the people,
&gt;&gt; directed from basically on high, is the only possible explanation: thus
&gt;&gt; the argument of some Oxfordians.

Yes, but didn't the Chamberlain's men perform this play? Are we asked to
believe that WS of Stratford, apparently a very influential man if he was
playwright, actor, and sharer, was forced to witness or even take part in
something that parodied him so viciously? Something wrong here. Sogliardo's
character, imo, is not evidence of a love-hate relationship. It's evidence
of a hate-hate relationship. And the fact that WS of S had to endure it *in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for your claim that it is on record that Jonson hated the actor

&gt; well,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that like your claim that the folio is a spoof is also a fabrication

&gt; of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the historical record. There is no evidence of that fact.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are quite right, Frizer. There is no way to prove absolutely that
&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson hated WS of Stratford; however, I find it hard to believe that
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sogliardo with his motto of &quot;Not Without Mustard,&quot; is not a parody of

&gt; WS.

&gt;&gt;It

&gt;&gt;I think it would be fair to say that Jonson had a love-hate relationship
&gt;&gt;with Shakespeare (of Stratford *and* the writer; one person) - along with
&gt;&gt;the rest of the theater community. Haven't read EMOH since college, so

&gt; I'm

&gt;&gt;talking from secondary sources here, but Sogliardo seems to be the result

&gt; of

&gt;&gt;some particular nastiness during the theater wars and exaggerates some of
&gt;&gt;SOS's less pleasant characteristics. For the rest of his life, Jonson
&gt;&gt;couldn't write a line of praise for Shakespeare without including a
&gt;&gt;derogatory comment as well. But Shakespeare wasn't alone in this. It

&gt; tells

&gt;&gt;us more about Jonson than Shakespeare.

&gt; Yes, but didn't the Chamberlain's men perform this play? Are we asked to
&gt; believe that WS of Stratford, apparently a very influential man if he was
&gt; playwright, actor, and sharer, was forced to witness or even take part in
&gt; something that parodied him so viciously? Something wrong here. Sogliardo's
&gt; character, imo, is not evidence of a love-hate relationship. It's evidence
&gt; of a hate-hate relationship. And the fact that WS of S had to endure it *in
&gt; his own company* cuts across notions of his being so high profile.

Yes, and this precisely why i don't think it is a parody on shakespeare.

There are enough differences between shakes and sogliardo to concluide
that they are not an identity. One swallow does not a summer make.

&gt;&gt;&gt;is rather a vicious parody. The name itself is pretty nasty, as is the

&gt;&gt;name

&gt;&gt;&gt;of Sogliardo's brother, Sordido. EMOH, which I had not read in some time

&gt;&gt;but

&gt;&gt;&gt;read again over Christmas, was interesting enough for me to wonder

&gt; whether

&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson was either lying in the FF, or being deliberately ambiguous, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;speaking of someone else entirely. I believe that some or most

&gt; traditional

&gt;&gt;&gt;scholars agree that Sogliardo is WS of Stratford, but would need to go

&gt;&gt;check

&gt;&gt;&gt;some sources to tell you who they are. Greenblatt is one of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I would also be interested in anyone's take on the dialogue about
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sogliardo's monument in EMOH. Or at least, I'll be interested in it by
&gt;&gt;&gt;Tuesday, when I'm done with my galleys.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Regards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Lynne

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SO much for that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Try using your brain instead of your prejudices (your hatred of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'stratman' is cooking your brain).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prof. Annabel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Patterson, Yale University, states that 'Jonson wrote on two levels'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which isn't a blinding insight since he was a parodist and satirist.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I see so when Jonson says of Bacon:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was only proper to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;himself, in that he seemed to me ever, by his works, one of the

&gt; greatest

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;men, and most worthy of admiration that has been in many Ages.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We must take this as a spoof? As a parody of what Jonson really

&gt; thought

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of Bacon. DO tell!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson, not coincidently, was Bacon's 'literary assistant' when the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First Folio was edited (Archbishop Thomas Tenison).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Except there is no evidence that Bacon or Jonson had anything to do

&gt; with

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;editing the folio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson starts his 'mock eulogy' with a trope on Ovid that indicates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that the author is still living ('Envy, the living, not the dead

&gt; doth

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bite').

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;THe author is still living. He lives by his works. The poem is

&gt; actually

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;titled to the memory of the deceased which gives a clear indication of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the corporeal state of mr william shakespeare, poet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The other authors in the preface to the folio also CLEARLY STATE THAT

&gt; MR

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD ON AVON, AUTHOR AND ACTOR IS DEAD.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;THERE IS NO EQUIVOCATION ON THE FACT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The tropes don't stop there. Jonson repudiates the whole

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'eulogy' in De Shakespeare No Strat. and Dominus Verulanus in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Discoveries.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More fabrication- this time without even an attempt to supply

&gt; evidence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Strats won't touch this. I found an entire work on

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Elizabethan dedicatory and commendatory verses and the author said

&gt;&gt;that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;she wasn't going to include the Shakespeare dedications because they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;were 'too problematic.'

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably because she has been infected by antistrat propaganda.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The burden of proof is not on the Baconians and Oxfordians to find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evidence of the actor's literacy because it's the Strats that make

&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, the historical record factually and explicitly establishes the

&gt; claim

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of will shakespeare of stratford.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the the baconians and oxfordians wish to challenge the historical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;record it is for them to make the running.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Regards,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Frizer

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is, however, the burden of Baconians and Oxfordians to puncture

&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Strat evidence, such as it is, and frankly, the Oxfordians are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;holding up their end of the deal. Too much relying on 19th c.

You are out of step with at least some of the traditional scholars on this.
What major differences do you see, taking into account that parodies are
exaggerations? And you have to see an actual difference in WS of Stratford,
not just an absence of a quality that's in Sogliardo, as there's so much we
still don't know about WS.

Lynne, even if you assume Sogliardo is a Shakespeare parody, must you
assume Shakespeare was offended by it? Recall the reactions of Page and
Ford when they are told of Falstaff's intention towards their wives.
Page laughs it off.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for your claim that it is on record that Jonson hated the actor
&gt;&gt; well,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that like your claim that the folio is a spoof is also a
fabrication
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the historical record. There is no evidence of that fact.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are quite right, Frizer. There is no way to prove absolutely
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson hated WS of Stratford; however, I find it hard to believe
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sogliardo with his motto of &quot;Not Without Mustard,&quot; is not a parody
of
&gt;&gt; WS.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You act as if this were a widely-accepted proven fact. Would you care
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; list the correspondences between the character and William Shakespeare
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratford?

&gt;&gt; Um, this was Frizer's point (in the negative, at least), so I'm calling
&gt; him
&gt;&gt; on it.

&gt; No, it was you who said &quot;I find it hard to believe that Sogliardo with his
&gt; motto of 'Not Without Mustard,' is not a parody of WS.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I'll be glad to list correspondences I see when I've finished my
&gt;&gt; edits. Just remind me. Of course, a parody is often just an exaggeration
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; one really nasty characteristic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And as has been pointed out on more than one occasion, the motto &quot;Not
&gt;&gt;&gt; Without Mustard&quot; was used by Nashe in *Pierce Penilesse his
Supplication
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Diuell*, which was published in 1592, four years before the
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; coat of arms was awarded.

&gt;&gt; Interesting, Tom. Will check this out. But anyhow, in arguing with me,
you
&gt;&gt; realise that you are also arguing with Greenblatt, one of your own team,
&gt; who
&gt;&gt; has conceded that Sogliardo was a parody of WS of Stratford? Just
&gt; checking.

&gt; So what?

&gt; Am I to assume that you believe everything Paul Crowley believes simply
&gt; because he's &quot;one of your own team?&quot; Is this the best logic you're capable

Not a good argument unless you are trying to say that Page and Ford are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sogliardo with his motto of &quot;Not Without Mustard,&quot; is not a parody of

&gt;&gt;&gt;WS.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think it would be fair to say that Jonson had a love-hate relationship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with Shakespeare (of Stratford *and* the writer; one person) - along

&gt; with

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the rest of the theater community. Haven't read EMOH since college, so

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talking from secondary sources here, but Sogliardo seems to be the

&gt; result

&gt;&gt;&gt;of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;some particular nastiness during the theater wars and exaggerates some

&gt; of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SOS's less pleasant characteristics. For the rest of his life, Jonson
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;couldn't write a line of praise for Shakespeare without including a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;derogatory comment as well. But Shakespeare wasn't alone in this. It

&gt;&gt;&gt;tells

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;us more about Jonson than Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, but didn't the Chamberlain's men perform this play? Are we asked to
&gt;&gt;&gt;believe that WS of Stratford, apparently a very influential man if he

&gt; was

&gt;&gt;&gt;playwright, actor, and sharer, was forced to witness or even take part

&gt; in

&gt;&gt;&gt;something that parodied him so viciously? Something wrong here.

&gt; Sogliardo's

&gt;&gt;&gt;character, imo, is not evidence of a love-hate relationship. It's

&gt; evidence

&gt;&gt;&gt;of a hate-hate relationship. And the fact that WS of S had to endure it

&gt; *in

&gt;&gt;&gt;his own company* cuts across notions of his being so high profile.

&gt;&gt;Yes, and this precisely why i don't think it is a parody on shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;There are enough differences between shakes and sogliardo to concluide
&gt;&gt;that they are not an identity. One swallow does not a summer make.

&gt; You are out of step with at least some of the traditional scholars on this.
&gt; What major differences do you see, taking into account that parodies are
&gt; exaggerations? And you have to see an actual difference in WS of Stratford,
&gt; not just an absence of a quality that's in Sogliardo, as there's so much we
&gt; still don't know about WS.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Regards,

&gt;&gt;Frizer

&gt;&gt;&gt;Lynne, going back to the grindstone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is rather a vicious parody. The name itself is pretty nasty, as is the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;name

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of Sogliardo's brother, Sordido. EMOH, which I had not read in some

&gt; time

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;read again over Christmas, was interesting enough for me to wonder

&gt;&gt;&gt;whether

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson was either lying in the FF, or being deliberately ambiguous, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speaking of someone else entirely. I believe that some or most

&gt;&gt;&gt;traditional

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scholars agree that Sogliardo is WS of Stratford, but would need to go

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;check

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;some sources to tell you who they are. Greenblatt is one of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I would also be interested in anyone's take on the dialogue about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sogliardo's monument in EMOH. Or at least, I'll be interested in it by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tuesday, when I'm done with my galleys.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Regards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lynne

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SO much for that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Try using your brain instead of your prejudices (your hatred of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'stratman' is cooking your brain).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Prof. Annabel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Patterson, Yale University, states that 'Jonson wrote on two levels'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which isn't a blinding insight since he was a parodist and satirist.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I see so when Jonson says of Bacon:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was only proper to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;himself, in that he seemed to me ever, by his works, one of the

&gt;&gt;&gt;greatest

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;men, and most worthy of admiration that has been in many Ages.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We must take this as a spoof? As a parody of what Jonson really

&gt;&gt;&gt;thought

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of Bacon. DO tell!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson, not coincidently, was Bacon's 'literary assistant' when the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First Folio was edited (Archbishop Thomas Tenison).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Except there is no evidence that Bacon or Jonson had anything to do

&gt;&gt;&gt;with

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;editing the folio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson starts his 'mock eulogy' with a trope on Ovid that indicates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that the author is still living ('Envy, the living, not the dead

&gt;&gt;&gt;doth

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bite').

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;THe author is still living. He lives by his works. The poem is

&gt;&gt;&gt;actually

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;titled to the memory of the deceased which gives a clear indication of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the corporeal state of mr william shakespeare, poet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The other authors in the preface to the folio also CLEARLY STATE THAT

&gt;&gt;&gt;MR

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD ON AVON, AUTHOR AND ACTOR IS DEAD.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;THERE IS NO EQUIVOCATION ON THE FACT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The tropes don't stop there. Jonson repudiates the whole

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'eulogy' in De Shakespeare No Strat. and Dominus Verulanus in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Discoveries.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More fabrication- this time without even an attempt to supply

&gt;&gt;&gt;evidence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Strats won't touch this. I found an entire work on

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Elizabethan dedicatory and commendatory verses and the author said

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;she wasn't going to include the Shakespeare dedications because they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;were 'too problematic.'

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably because she has been infected by antistrat propaganda.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The burden of proof is not on the Baconians and Oxfordians to find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evidence of the actor's literacy because it's the Strats that make

&gt;&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, the historical record factually and explicitly establishes the

&gt;&gt;&gt;claim

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of will shakespeare of stratford.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the the baconians and oxfordians wish to challenge the historical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;record it is for them to make the running.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Regards,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Frizer

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is, however, the burden of Baconians and Oxfordians to puncture

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Strat evidence, such as it is, and frankly, the Oxfordians are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;holding up their end of the deal. Too much relying on 19th c.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Baconian

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;analysis--all of it solid but not current--and too much

&gt;&gt;&gt;romanticizing

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oxford. (I except Price who romanticizes her 'anonymous aristocrat'

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nevertheless is willing to spend time on the evidence).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cordially,

&gt; I wrote: &quot; . . . dialogue like 'bring her to try wi' th' main course'
&gt; was gotten first

&gt; Frizer wrote: &quot;Information open to anyone. Bacon wasn't the only

&gt; Opportunity is the third part of evidence and perhaps the actor had
&gt; evidence in the sense that his whereabouts were unknown for periods of
&gt; time but that isn't enough.

&gt; Only Bacon and Oxford have documented evidence that they did travel
&gt; across the Channel in boats. Presumably Marlowe does too but I don't
&gt; see an authorship case there.

&gt; Frizer wrote: &quot;If you bothered to check you'd find many similar
&gt; expressionsin the

&gt; I have checked Elizabethan books of proverbs, etc., and you're right.
&gt; However, there are some unique notes in the Promus. Even Abbott was
&gt; impressed and wrote an enthusiastic forward to Constance Mary Pott's
&gt; book on the Promus--after it was published Abbott must have been
&gt; muscled by other Strats because soon after he began his negative attack
&gt; on Bacon and Baconians.

"/>

Heres a thought for you... the northumberland manuscript actually shows
not that bacon wrote richard II and III but that he had them in his
possession and that they were amongst a group of manuscripts to be
copied for him by a scribe (another manuscript in the mix is, i recall,
one of nashes pamphlets).

So there is evidence (if we accept that the northumberland manuscript is
genuine), that bacon read, but did not write shakespeare. If there are
quotes that are unique to shakespeare in the promus (and i am not by any
means admitting that there are) then it can be explained by the fact
that Bacon actually read it and made notes of it for himself (I seem to
recall that quite a few of the notes in the promus were traceable to
other sources and not born, athenalike, sui generis from bacons head.)

&gt; In fact even Kathman was impressed.

&gt; The other question is 'compared to what?' Some evidence is better than

&gt; The actor may or may not have left the immortal 'by me' and the Folger
&gt; Geneva Bible--which I don't dispute to have belonged to Oxford--I do
&gt; dispute having been annotated by Oxford. I went through it with some
&gt; famous Puritan exegetes from the 17th century and the annotations
&gt; comprise a coherent Calvinist 'text.' No one has ever accused Oxford
&gt; of being a Calvinist.

&gt; The 'parallels' between Bacon's notebook and the Shakespeare works are
&gt; superior in every sense to the 'parallels' in the Folger Bible vis a

True. Or one mild characteristic raised to an absurb level by a nasty

of his personality - doesn't seem to be someone you'd want over to dinner
when he was in a bad mood.

It wouldn't surprise me if some of the participants in London's little

&gt; parodist who is on record for despising the actor. Prof. Annabel
&gt; Patterson, Yale University, states that 'Jonson wrote on two levels'

Since when does the opinion of *one person* constitute &quot;proof&quot;? It
was the opinion of Dick Cheney that U.S. forces would be welcomed as
liberators by the Iraqi populace -- if one person's opinion constitutes
&quot;proof&quot; in the Weird world, then I guess that Cheney's opinion proves
that U.S. troops are indeed welcome in Iraq, and that the supposed
insurgency is just a Stratfordian lie. But we have already seen on many
occasions that the hallucinations or fabrications of a single person --
Elizabeth Weird -- constitute &quot;proof&quot; in your addled alternative to
reality.

From Schoenbaum (page 229)
&quot; In his Poetaster Jonson sneers at common players who aspire to
heraldic distinctions-'They forget they are i' the statute, the
rascals; they are blazoned there, there they are tricked, they and
their pedigrees: they need no other heralds, iwis'-and some have
seen mockery of Shakespeare's motto in Every Man out of his
Humour, in which the rustic clown Sogliardo, fresh from having laid
out £30 for his arms, is mocked with the 'word', Not without mustard.
The parallel is suggestive, but Sogliardo is not an actor, and his coat-
armour, which flaunts a boar's head, is unlike Shakespeare's. If the
latter did choose 'Non sanz droict' as his motto, neither he nor his
descendants seem ever to have used it. No motto appears above the
arms displayed in relief on the Shakespeare monument in Stratford
church, nor was the phrase included on the gravestone of his
daughter Susanna.&quot;

From Charlton Ogburn (quoting Harrison and Rowse)
&quot;In a famous scene in Every Man Out of His Humor, Ben Jonson, G.B.
Harrison says, &quot;made an unkind cut at Shakespeare's (i.e,Shakspere's)
gentility.&quot; he had his character recognizable as Shakespere -
Sogliardo - complain of the &quot;Harrots&quot; - Heralds - That they speak i'
the strangest language, and give a man the hardest terms for his
money, that ever you knew.&quot; But, &quot;I can write myself Gentleman now,
here's my Patent, it cost me thirty pound by this breath.&quot; The knight
Puntarvolo asks what the crest is, and Sogliardo replies, &quot;Marry,
sir, it is your Boar without a head Rampant.&quot; At this, another
character interjects, &quot;Ramping to gentility.&quot;As A. L. Rowse puts it,
&quot;For motto he (Puntarvolo) suggests, 'Not without mustard,' and for
the crest 'a frying pan had had no fellow.' &quot;

Correspondences:
a) The Stratman and Sogliardo had just become 'gentlemen'
b) Both reluctantly paid a lot of money for it
c) Both had a very hard time from the heralds
d) Both were ignorant; Sogliardo calls them 'Harrots'
e) Both knew nothing about heraldry
f) Both were 'colourful' self-made men from the country
g) A 'Boar without a head Rampant' was entirely
appropriate to both -- since Oxford had a Boar Rampant
on his coat-of-arms, and neither the Stratman nor
Sogliardo had a head.
h) Both were liars and from the bogs (Sog-liar-do)
i) Neither were actors

More on the name,'Sogliardo':
A 'liard' was
&quot;A small coin formerly current in France, of the value of the fourth
part of a sou. Hence, typically, a coin of small value.&quot;

But the '-do' ending is probably little more than:
&quot; 2. An ignorant sonorous refashioning of ns. in -ade, a. Fr. -ade
fem. (= Sp. -ada, It. -ata) probably after the assumed analogy of
renegade = renegado; e.g. ambuscado, bastinado, bravado, barricado,
carbonado, camisado, crusado, grenado, gambado, palisado, panado,
scalado, stoccado, strappado, all of which in Sp. have (or would
have) -ada. So armado obs. var. of armada. &quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And as has been pointed out on more than one occasion, the motto &quot;Not
&gt; Without Mustard&quot; was used by Nashe in *Pierce Penilesse his Supplication to
&gt; the Diuell*, which was published in 1592, four years before the Shakespeare
&gt; coat of arms was awarded.

"/>

Nashe does NOT use the phrase as a motto.
He brings it in as a joke about a character who
swears never to eat fish again (if God will save
him from a storm) but afterwards claming that
he meant only not to eat it without mustard.

When Jonson used the phrase in his play about
Sogliardo, he _might_ have remembered it from
Nashe, or it _might_ have been somewhere buried
in his unconscious, but neither is of any relevance.
It's now a joke about Sogliardo and his application
for a Patent, specifically playing on the 'Non sanz
droict' in his motto.

Only an insane dope would seek to deny the
association. We know that you are a dope,
Reedy. Are you also insane?

I've seen Strats remark that, in any case, all the
facts about the Stratman's motto were hidden
deep in the records of the Herald's office. But
Jonson would have heard all about them from
William Camden (his guardian, and maybe his
father), who had been appointed Clarenceaux
King of Arms in 1597 -- over the heads of the
existing heralds, and to their intense fury --
almost solely (it is clear) for the purpose of
pushing through the Stratman's worthless
application (which had been rejected before).
See

Paul.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for your claim that it is on record that Jonson hated the

&gt;&gt;&gt; well,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that like your claim that the folio is a spoof is also a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are quite right, Frizer. There is no way to prove absolutely

&gt;&gt;&gt; Um, this was Frizer's point (in the negative, at least), so I'm
calling
&gt;&gt; him
&gt;&gt;&gt; on it.

&gt;&gt; No, it was you who said &quot;I find it hard to believe that Sogliardo with
his

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll be glad to list correspondences I see when I've finished my
&gt;&gt;&gt; edits. Just remind me. Of course, a parody is often just an
exaggeration
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; one really nasty characteristic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Interesting, Tom. Will check this out. But anyhow, in arguing with me,
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; realise that you are also arguing with Greenblatt, one of your own
team,
&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt; has conceded that Sogliardo was a parody of WS of Stratford? Just
&gt;&gt; checking.

&gt;&gt; So what?

&gt;&gt; Am I to assume that you believe everything Paul Crowley believes simply
&gt;&gt; because he's &quot;one of your own team?&quot; Is this the best logic you're

It's not in the least a diversion, Tom. I've just finished going through the
galleys of an 80,000 word novel. I went through the book three times besides
dealing with a horrendous situation here at home which I won't comment on.
I'm now working on acks and notes for the book. I have no choice as I have
to keep to production sched. The book is due out in March. I've told you
that when I'm finished I'll be glad to do some work on EMOH, although I'm
also waiting for Frizer to speak first, as it was he who made a claim with
regard to it. You should be breathing down his neck, not mine. You should
also know from the past that when I say I'll do something as time allows, I
shall. I did with regard to your essay. As I said, just remind me in a week
or so if you want me to do it because I have a memory like a sieve lately.

And by the way, &quot;Not Without Mustard&quot; is interesting. I looked at the ref to
it in PP when I had a spare minute yesterday. Three things:

1. As Paul notes, it's not a motto in PP.
2. I have no doubt that its appearance in EMOH is in part a reference to PP.
I think it appears elsewhere too, but have to check; however, words and
phrases also take on new weight and meanings over time, and I would suggest
that is the case here.
3. Interesting though &quot;Not Without Mustard&quot; is as a motto, I don't believe
it's what I'd pinpoint in deciding that Sogliardo is likely a parody of WS
of Stratford. I've even wondered whether Sogliardo and Sordido are a split
portrait--in other words whether they're both WS. I don't believe anyone has
ever suggested that before.

I'm still very interested in the &quot;monument&quot; dialogue in the play.

More later. Have to get back to work.

Paul,

I have noticed that the Stratford actor was the first actor to obtain a
coat of arms.

That was the source of the outrage. He didn't get it on his own--actors
were ranked somewhere below the lowest rank of day laborers. The
outrage that followed was due to the fact that the actor disrupted the
tradition.

A payment by an actor devalued every gentleman's coat of arms and we
have to put this in the context that it took place before the wholesale
sell-off of arms and titles by the Stuarts.

This was a unique event.

Jonson was jailed for the 'thirty pound knight' line and his play was
burned. Why would such a clearly moral statement against the
illegitimate award of arms be punished if the parties were not being
protected by Whitgift?

The Stratford actor held the only coat of arms given to an actor--I
think this is significant--until well into the era of the corrupt
Stuart Court where titles were for sale at every level. (Coke--'the
father of common law''--bought one earldom and several baronies).

Alleyn, the second actor, only obtained a coat of arms after 1613 and
other rich 'actors' who hustled up the same kind of wealth as had the
Henslowe, Alleyn (and the actor), mainly from prostitution (Lenz, Base
Trade:
Theatre As Prostitution, ELH 60.4 (1993) 833-855) followed after
Alleyn. Several 'actors' from Burbage's company eventually purchased
coats of arms.

Furthermore, there is no evidence that the coat of arms was awarded in
1596.
The application was made in 1596 but there's no record that it was
granted in that year. I think that's another 'Strat tradition' based
sheerly on the existence of the application.

The best reason to assume that no coat of arms was awarded in 1596 is
that John Shakespeare was turned down in his earlier application.

The humiliating process that followed--the herald went around the shire
posting
lists of 'those who are not gentlemen'--the rejectees--is the reason
that we can suspect that the actor got 'assistance ' from someone close
to Camden.

Someone--perhaps an Oxfordian?--should take a second look at the
request for the 'addition' of the Arden coat of arms.

For the actor to be a front to protect Essex--who was genuinely in
trouble for his alleged patronage of a work on Richard II thinly
disguised as a history of Henry IV--the actor would have to be 'a
gentleman' or possess a university MA.

Work defined class and commoners did not produce literary works.

It's indicative that his name on the title page of Richard II is
followed by 'amended and improved by' not 'written by.' The first
'written by William Shakespeare' doesn't appear on a quarto title page
until after 1600, after the actor was granted his arms and had 'retired
to Stratford.'

Lastly, modern experts in heraldry have combed the British records and
found no hereditary justification for the award of a coat of arms to
the actor or his father. Only the Ardens had geneological evidence.

So in 1596 the actor was not descended from a Shakespeare ancestor who
carried arms--the maternal or wife's side could be added but could not
be the basis of an award of arms. I was just looking at the Lucy
'luces' added to the arms of a relative of the would-be murder victim
in the peace warrant lodged against the actor. The luces--three white
fish--belonged to the wife who had a better claim to arms (Hotson,
Justice Shallow, 1933) but we do know that the addition of Arden
heraldry was turned down.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

Still, an anti-Stratfordian who understands but pretends not to is
surely preferable to an anti-Stratfordian who does not understand
anything but pretends to -- unless, of course, one's sole desideratum is
humor, since pretenses to understanding by those who do not are
generally so spectacularly unsuccessful as to afford truly sublime farce.

&gt; And by the way, &quot;Not Without Mustard&quot; is interesting. I looked at the ref to
&gt; it in PP when I had a spare minute yesterday. Three things:

&gt; 1. As Paul notes, it's not a motto in PP.
&gt; 2. I have no doubt that its appearance in EMOH is in part a reference to PP.

"/>

I can't see any need for a reference to a minor
passage in a minor work. I think PP merely
informs us of current jokes and 'table-talk'.
The phrase 'not without mustard' was known,
and perhaps well-known.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think it appears elsewhere too, but have to check; however, words and
&gt; phrases also take on new weight and meanings over time, and I would suggest
&gt; that is the case here.
&gt; 3. Interesting though &quot;Not Without Mustard&quot; is as a motto,

"/>

It may have been suggested by a pun on:

Churl's Cress / Churl's crest

Churl's Cress is a mustard-flavoured plant, and
was presumably a common dressing to go with
white fish. (The 'haberdine' mentioned in Pierce
Penilesse is a kind of cod.)

See OED under 'Churl'
7b. churl's, in plant names: as churl's cress, mustard, applied by Lyte
to a cruciferous plant, prob. Lepidium campestre; . . .
1578 Lyte Dodoens v. lxii. 628 The second kind [of Thlaspi] is
called . . . in high Douche Baurn senff or Baurn kress . . . that is
to say . . . Churles Cresse. Ibid., I thinke it best to call [thlaspi]
churles mustard.

'Non sanz droict' is also a play on words with
'droict' meaning &quot;a minute weight of silver&quot;.
The motto then reads:

&quot;Not without a minute quantity of silver&quot;

-- perfectly fitting our Stratman, and the
circumstances under which he both
attained his elevated rank and paid for
his coat-of-arms.

A 'droict' or 'droit' is (from OED):
&quot;A minute weight; the four hundred and eightieth part of a
grain troy, one twenty-fourth of a 'mite'. &quot;
(Belonging to a series used in exact computations of weight
of coins, before the introduction of decimals, the alternate
subdivisions by 20 and 24 carrying out those of ounces
and pennyweights. See Notes &amp; Queries 8th S.X. 255, 278, 338.)
1601 ['Weight of Silver Coins 43 Eliz. 1601' given in 'dwt., gr., Mites,
Droits, Perits, Blancs,' cited in J. Millan Coins, Weights, &amp; Meas. 1749.] 1

The Elizabethan literati clearly had some fun
in devising the Stratman's coat-of-arms and
motto, and later in continuing to pun on it.

Crowley,

Very nice and Jonson would have to
resort to 'not without coins' reference
because he got into some trouble with
the censors over the 'thirty pound knight'
line.

I mean, it made it sound like the king
was selling titles or something and we know
the king would never do that.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

Dr Webb and Dr Groves have fully commanded the entire spectrum of
presentation as might be expected from immature first time
passive/aggressive posters to usenet.

They do not depart from the most popular forms of abuse;-

-rhetorical speculations on the mental health of those proposing other
perspectives,
-drugs usage,

and, so it must seem as being evident from the behavior of certain classes
of person

-compulsive anal references.

In an immature subject, this is but the 'shock-jock' means to gain
attention, for want of other means to which they can only aspire, [a
representation of their own perspective to the content of any subject, eg].

In 'mature' subjects, this is a demonstration of some, er, settled

which raises a proper point of what is cited and what is inferred from
citations.

I do not dispute you, being you may notice, somewhat abstemious even, in my
own citations of Anglo Saxon and Anglo Norman, as well as of previous
tongues - yet you yourself speculated that I might not speak English as well
as a native speaker - so, whereforth any poignancy in your inquiry - should
it be otherwise than rhetorical fling?

It must be determined if what resides is any response to these addresses to
content is to the comfort level which ensues by the issue being raised.

Hence this deferral of direct address to content by other means; and I cite
here particularly a noted indulgence in personality speculation to who
speaks, the nature of the speaker, and disruptable specualtion upon
character and habit, rather than what is said, or to what /has/ been said
heretofore rather than to the merit of a specific issue, a point!

Will you not allow a place for examination, by trial if you will, of
sometimes hoary and received material?

You are a difficult subject with whom to correspond! You have evidently, in
my opinion, great, even very great critical faculties, and in some
dimensions certainly, are well read, as well if not better than any other.

This cannot be expanded as to your general intelligence upon all subjects
unless we posit you with such protean capabilities as we generally subscribe
to the Author himself!

Perhaps more importantly, we cannot accord you your true, [no irony here],
intelligence on these matters of discrimination, since it would not even be
desireable to do so, more being achieved by the fair-minded acknowledgement
in conversation bydifferring perspectives, in mutual regard.

You do yourself short, Sir, and I similarly deprecate the bonhomie of
cronies who would support some immediate repulse of other opinion, rather
than the better engagement of it to which, nolens volens our previous
interchanges, I do not suspect you to neglect in your best opinion, nor in
your heart.

It is my interest, shall we say, to engage these subjects by way of an
appreciaition of what roles people play in groups, and there is typically
two sacrifical subjects within any group;

a) the first is the 'barbarian outsider', who is sacrificed on the alter of
what is 'moral' - what is received knowledge and customary.

b) the second is of the leader, who is sacrificed to any care of his soul,
as long as he performs the social function as achieved in (a) above.

it occured to me to say that this is also a thema; as we see in Greek, of
Greek Tragedy and as is represented in MacBeth.

I apologise for these psychological intrusion - and they are! - into these
matters, and also for abbreviating unread the balance of this message since
I am immediately obliged elsewhere.
