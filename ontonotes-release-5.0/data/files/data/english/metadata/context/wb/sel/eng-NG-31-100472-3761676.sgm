I'm looking for a 4wd truck....debating between chevy and ford 1/2 ton,
used (about 2000), extended cab.

Because this is a ford group I was wondering why ford would be better
than chevy (hence probably starting "carwars").  They are about the same
price and the chevy group would probably rag on the fords if I were to
post a similar question there.

My usual mechanic seems to think that the rapair needs are about the
same except GM parts run a little bit less money.

As far as I can see, it's tweedledum and tweedledee when comparing.
Anyone care to tip the scales one direction or another?

The other possibility is dropping a new engine in an older truck.  The
prices seem to drop off quickly when getting into the 90's in age.
Although this may be an option if the body is excellent, it seems like
there is one heck of a lot of stuff that hangs off the engine that is
still likely to fail in short time.

Thanks in advance...just looking for a reason to go one way or the other.

Koz (who even dares to mention...toyota!)
