Congress Paving the Way for Tolls on Interstates
Legislation backed by the Bush administration would let states charge
drivers fees to fund new highways or to reduce rush-hour traffic.
By Richard Simon, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON - With traffic congestion growing worse - and state and
federal budgets as red as the brake lights from cars backed up on a Los
Angeles freeway - Congress is moving toward relaxing a decades-old
restriction on tolls on interstate highways.

The legislation, backed by the Bush administration, would give states
greater authority to impose tolls to reduce gridlock.

These charges could be levied to raise money for new highway
construction. Or motorists could be charged varying tolls during the
day, with higher tolls in effect during rush hours to nudge drivers
into making some of their trips during less busy times.

The toll provisions are part of a long-stalled $284-billion, six-year
transportation spending bill that is expected to clear the House today.
The Senate is expected to vote on its version of the bill within a few
months.

Last year, the legislation stalled amid complaints from the White House
that it was too costly. But now, the administration and congressional
GOP leaders appear to have settled on a price tag.

Although the House and Senate bills contain different provisions on
tolls, some easing of the rules against such charges on interstates
seems certain to emerge in the final version of the legislation.

The 46,730-mile interstate system has been largely free of tolls since
its birth in 1956, though a number of old turnpikes, mostly on the East
Coast, charge tolls.

Some experimental tolling also has been permitted, such as on a stretch
of Interstate 15 in San Diego County where drivers with no passengers
can buy their way into the carpool lanes. They pay tolls varying from
50 cents to $8, depending on the level of congestion in the lane at the
time.

Supporters of the toll provisions say they hope to see similar projects
on more highways if the federal rules are relaxed. The House bill, in
fact, would give states authority to open more carpool lanes to solo
motorists willing to pay a toll to speed past the traffic.

Among its other provisions, the House bill would establish three pilot
programs that would allow tolls to be levied to fund new interstate
construction. And it would authorize 25 so-called congestion-pricing
projects on existing highways. Under that program, motorists would be
charged the higher tolls during rush hours.

The Senate bill, which is still being drafted, is expected to go
further. It would allow states to impose tolls on newly built lanes. It
also would allow states to use congestion pricing, but not limit the
number of projects.

Not everyone is eager to see more tolls.

In California, Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach), who chairs
the Assembly Transportation Committee, said she would oppose any effort
to create more toll roads in California.

&quot;I have always held the view that public highways should be equally
accessible to everybody,&quot; she said. &quot;The answer to reducing highway
congestion should include a mix of more funding for highway
construction and mass-transit projects.&quot;

In Washington, opponents of tolls - including the American Trucking
Assns. and the American Automobile Assn. - have begun lobbying against
allowing charges on existing roads. They contend such tolls amount to
double taxation of motorists who already have paid gasoline taxes.

The trucking industry group also warns that tolls on existing highways
could drive truck traffic onto city streets, worsening traffic
congestion on those roads.

But in a sign of the growing political support for tolls, the House on
Wednesday rejected a measure that would have limited tolls to newly
constructed lanes and required the charges be lifted once the new lanes
were paid for. State highway officials were among those opposing any
effort to weaken the bill's toll provisions.

The push for tolls has gained legislative momentum because the federal
government and an increasing number of states are strapped for cash to
maintain highways, let alone improve them.

&quot;No tolls, no roads,&quot; Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) said.

The federal gasoline tax, the major source of funding for highways, has
not been raised in more than a decade, and Bush opposes any increase.
Additionally, federal officials are concerned that federal efforts to
encourage greater use of more fuel-efficient vehicles could reduce gas
tax revenue, making even less money available for highway projects.

States are finding transportation funds competing with other critical
needs.

In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed diverting $1.3
billion from transportation projects to help close the state's budget
gap.

Schwarzenegger has not taken a position on tolls on federal highways,
said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the state's Business,
Transportation and Housing Agency.

Federal Highway Administrator Mary E. Peters said public attitudes
about tolls had shifted, in part because of technological advances.
Now, vehicles can be equipped with electronic transmitters that allow
motorists to pay tolls without stopping.

&quot;People are saying, 'I don't mind paying the toll so much, but just
don't make me stop,' &quot; she said.

The focus on imposing tolls to help pay for improved roadways comes as
studies find traffic congestion growing. Between 1990 and 2001, the
percentage of freeway mileage that was congested grew from 49% to 60%,
according to the Texas Transportation Institute.

Robert Poole, director of transportation studies for the Reason
Foundation, a Santa Monica think tank, said there was a &quot;huge need to
rebuild portions of our freeways and interstates, but very little money
- and no political will to increase federal gas taxes. So the only way
to get where we need to go is with a new funding source: tolls.&quot;

If the federal rules on tolls are relaxed, tolls would still need to be
approved at the state level.

&quot;This is very, very politically dicey,&quot; Poole said.

Still, a number of states also are turning to tolls as a way to finance
new highway projects. Texas has embarked on a massive highway
construction program using tolls to fund new state highways. In
Connecticut and North Carolina, state legislation has been introduced
to impose tolls on highways at the state borders.

Free-market proponents frequently float the notion of toll roads when
California's state government is in financial trouble, but the state's
limited experience with the pay-as-you-go roads has been troubled.

In 1989, the Legislature authorized Caltrans to sign contracts with
private companies for four demonstration toll road projects, only one
of which is operating.

That case involves 10 miles of California 91 in Orange County, one of
the state's most congested stretches of highway, which since has been
bought by the Orange County Transportation Authority.

The largest toll road system in California is a 51-mile network
operated by the Transportation Corridor Agencies, a government entity
based in Irvine.

Highway bill

The Transportation Equity Act would provide $284 billion for projects
for fiscal years 2004 through 2009, up from $218 billion in the
previous six-year period. If enacted, here's where the money might go:

(In billions)

Highways $225.5
Transit $52.3
Safety $3.2
Truck safety $2.9

Note: The bill contains about $10 billion in &quot;earmarks&quot; for 3,700
specific projects requested by individual lawmakers.

The problem is income taxes aren't going to go anywhere. What's worse
about it is that an ever greater percentage of people don't pay
significant federal income taxes as it is. (roughly the top 50% of wage
earners pay 96% of the federal income taxes) Thusly they will vote to

find the label with the price breakdown. You may be
quite surprised at the real cost of the fuel, and how
much cost is added on in different taxes.

&gt;&gt; Congress Paving the Way for Tolls on Interstates
&gt;&gt; Legislation backed by the Bush administration would let states
charge
&gt;&gt; drivers fees to fund new highways or to reduce rush-hour traffic.
&gt;&gt; By Richard Simon, Times Staff Writer

&gt;&gt; WASHINGTON - With traffic congestion growing worse - and state and
&gt;&gt; federal budgets as red as the brake lights from cars backed up on a
Los
&gt;&gt; Angeles freeway - Congress is moving toward relaxing a decades-old
&gt;&gt; restriction on tolls on interstate highways.

&gt;&gt; The legislation, backed by the Bush administration, would give
states
&gt;&gt; greater authority to impose tolls to reduce gridlock.

&gt; Yep. Bush is doing exactly what Reagan did -- advertising federal
&gt; income tax cuts while increasing and making new taxes everywhere
&gt; else. I bet the American people fall for it -- again.

"/> it's privatization... next: they'll put a toll booth on your driveway,

&gt; An excellent idea. Congestion pricing will go a long way towards

&gt;&gt;In California, Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach), who
chairs
&gt;&gt;the Assembly Transportation Committee, said she would oppose any
effort
&gt;&gt;to create more toll roads in California.

&gt; I wish I lived in the 55th Assembly District so I could vote this
&gt; bimbo out of office next fall...

&gt;&gt;The trucking industry group also warns that tolls on existing
highways
&gt;&gt;could drive truck traffic onto city streets, worsening traffic
&gt;&gt;congestion on those roads.

&gt; That's an empty threat. Truckers are under ridiculously tight
&gt; deadlines; there's no way in hell they are going to slog their way
&gt; through city streets just to save a few bucks - they would lose too
&gt; much time.

"/> You're full of shit. Again. I was a OTR truck driver for 12 years.
With the exception of freight going into an automobile manufacturing
plant, scheduals are not &quot;ridiculously tight&quot; and it was common to NOT
run the toll roads to save money.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In reality, reduced congestion benefits Truckers. They will be glad

&gt; think I can recall seeing a truck or two there, as well...

"/> More BS. Running the Pa Pike from the Ohio line to the Delaware River
Bridge will cost you from $107 to $140. Class 9 will run you a whopping
$794. Check out the truck traffic on Rt.322, 422 and I-80. Many of
these trucks are going to destinations that could be run on the pike
but it's just too expensive. Sure there are trucks running the pike but
they are a fraction of what should/could be there.

Watching re-runs &quot;BJ And The Bear&quot; doesn't make YOU and trucker.

"/> It is a problem and not all trucks are under tight deadlines. There was
a huge increase in truck traffic (heavy during the day and a constant
stream all night)on a 2 lane road not far from me that parallels the
pike for about 30 miles and passes thru 5 towns. This wasn't because a
road was converted to a turnpike but mainly because of the rise in truck
operating costs. I can just imagine how many towns would be crushed if a
road were converted to a turnpike.

There were so many complaints that one of the towns enacted a truck ban.
But the ban may not stick. A town in northern NJ did the same thing
becuase there was a constant stream of trucks clogging up its main st
when avoiding the turnpike but there is current legal action there
because the truck companies are claiming they are exempt because of the
interstate commerce clause.

already have a consumption tax and there are reporting mechanisms for
heavy users such as trucks to insure that each state gets their share.

&gt; end. Those who were self-made often availed themselves of an array of
&gt; government programs from education to transportation.Those who inherited
&gt; money use everything from police and fire protection to the FDIC.

"/> You're really going off on a tanget. The past situation of these people
and how you want to somehow draw their success as the result of
government spending is not relevant. Let me put it in simple terms so
you'll understand. Let's say your federal income tax obligation all said
and done is 20% of your income. Let's say I make significantly less and
my obligation is zero after deductions. I want free ice cream every
friday, as do many others. We want the federal government to provide us ice
cream every friday. There are enough of us that congress criters want our
votes. The benefits of having ice cream once a week are brought out, some
people object that ice cream will make people fat and the lactose
intolerant will be left out. An admendment is made for special ice cream
for the lactose intolerant and a provision to raise federal income taxes
1% across the board to provide for the ice cream fridays is also added.
The bill passes and is signed into law.

You now pay 21% of your income in federal income taxes after deductions. I
still pay 0% after deductions. I and the majority of people who don't
have to pay now have free ice cream every friday.

Now we want free cake on tuesdays, and chicken every saturday...

And that's why it's a problem. It destroys the republic as people vote
themselves money from the treasury. Wether you think the cause is worthy
or not, when this condition of taxation exists, those who don't have to
pay the taxes will gleefully vote for those who transfer funds from those
paying the taxes.

&quot;If Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money,
and will promote the general welfare, the government is no longer a
limited one possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite one subject
to particular exceptions.&quot; James Madison, &quot;Letter to Edmund Pendleton,&quot;
-- James Madison, January 21, 1792, in The Papers of James Madison, vol.
14, Robert A Rutland et. al., ed (Charlottesvile: University Press of
Virginia,1984).

&quot;A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse
from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes
for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury,
with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal
policy, always followed by a dictatorship.&quot;
-- Alexander Tyler

When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will
herald the end of the republic.
-- Benjamin Franklin

&gt; Congress Paving the Way for Tolls on Interstates
&gt; Legislation backed by the Bush administration would let states charge
&gt; drivers fees to fund new highways or to reduce rush-hour traffic.
&gt; By Richard Simon, Times Staff Writer

&gt; WASHINGTON - With traffic congestion growing worse - and state and
&gt; federal budgets as red as the brake lights from cars backed up on a
Los
&gt; Angeles freeway - Congress is moving toward relaxing a decades-old
&gt; restriction on tolls on interstate highways.

&gt; The legislation, backed by the Bush administration, would give states
&gt; greater authority to impose tolls to reduce gridlock.

"/> (snip)

This doesn't surprise me. IMHO, it's consistent with the idea of a
consumption tax, where users pay as they go.

I know that the idea of a toll on an interstate highway, where many
drivers enter the state at one border and drive through the state to
get to other states, has been discussed in at least one state. The idea
would be to get the people who pass through the state on their way to
other states to pay for some highway maintenance.

At least for me, having to pay tolls on interstates wouldn't be a big
deal. At worst, it's an annoyance, IMHO. But it might be very hard to
get approved and adopted.

&gt; In the US, a flat tax (which is what fuel taxes are - everyone pays

&gt; Those who must drive will be hit harder than those who only *choose*
&gt; to drive, becasue they can choose not to drive, thus lowering their

"/> Even if you have to drive, you can often choose to
drive a small, fuel-efficient car (lighter, and thus

large gas-hog SUV (heavier, and thus harsher on the
road surface.)

Thus, the amount of fuel tax that an individual pays
can be connected to the amount of wear-and-tear that
their vehicle does to the road.

With tolls, the lighter econo-box pays the same as the
heavier, &quot;mine-is-bigger-than-yours&quot; SUV.

OTOH, the folks who can choose to drive or not are a
good group for giving that extra incentive to take
public transit instead, reducing congestion and
pollution for everyone.

Choice is an interesting thing, and is often quite
distorted in the individual's mind. My neighbours
wouldn't even consider getting off their lazy arses and
*walking* 1.5 km to the store (e.g. for their weekly
lotto ticket...), and sneer at me for chosen, voluntary
daily exercise walk. They have just as much option to
walk as I do, and yet they refuse to accept
responsibility for choosing to drive.

I have met people who claimed that public transport
simply wasn't an option at all, because they were just
a better class of people, who are entitled to private
car transport (including people who expect others to do
the driving and provide the car.) They wouldn't wanna
sink down to the emotional humiliation of riding around
with those poor black folks...

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am simply stunned at the number of positive responses supporting a tax
&gt;&gt;&gt; collector building roadblocks in the middle of a damn high speed
&gt; roadway.

&gt;&gt; The toll booth doesn't need to be in the middle of the roadway. The NJ
&gt;&gt; Turnpike, which is part of I-95, has tolls that you pay as you exit.

&gt; Do you have to STOP to pay the toll? Yes or no? It's still a roadblock,
&gt; even if it's relocated. -Dave

"/> That is why you need to get into the 21st century, and
invite Big Brother into your car, to keep track of your
movements with a multi-jurisdiction toll transponder.
Later, it will be replaced with a GPS logging device
for tracking your total distance driven (ostensibly to
prevent hybrid and electric cars from avoiding road
taxes for non-toll roads [and that logging will go way
deeper than just total distance..]) How conveeeenient!

&gt;&gt; A consumption tax (which you said you'd prefer) will never happen in

&gt;and thusly one group always gets breaks at the expense of another. Somebody
&gt;with kids gets a deduction on their income taxes, I have no kids, I do
&gt;not. Yet, by not having children thus far, I require less in government

&gt;forth. And before someone says 'but you benefit from educated childern'
&gt;I'll wager it's the same person who would also say since I have no
&gt;children I should shut up about how they are to be educated, despite
&gt;paying for said education.

&gt;And as I have been saying what is wanted, are groups of citizens
&gt;demanding money from another group and using the power of government as a
&gt;weapon to do it. It's theft just as the mugger does with a gun.

"/> You're right.
What I'm saying is that we won't get a fundamental change on what is
taxed; i.e., we won't change from our current income tax to a
consumption (sales/value added) tax or a flat rate tax.
We might get another tax simplification or code overhaul, but it won't
make much differenct to the average taxpayer, IMO.

&gt;Even if you have to drive, you can often choose to

You get what you can afford. The option of getting what's going to

the very poor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Thus, the amount of fuel tax that an individual pays
&gt;can be connected to the amount of wear-and-tear that
&gt;their vehicle does to the road.

&gt;With tolls, the lighter econo-box pays the same as the
&gt;heavier, &quot;mine-is-bigger-than-yours&quot; SUV.

&gt;OTOH, the folks who can choose to drive or not are a
&gt;good group for giving that extra incentive to take
&gt;public transit instead, reducing congestion and
&gt;pollution for everyone.

&gt;Choice is an interesting thing, and is often quite
&gt;distorted in the individual's mind. My neighbours
&gt;wouldn't even consider getting off their lazy arses and
&gt;*walking* 1.5 km to the store (e.g. for their weekly
&gt;lotto ticket...), and sneer at me for chosen, voluntary
&gt;daily exercise walk. They have just as much option to
&gt;walk as I do, and yet they refuse to accept
&gt;responsibility for choosing to drive.

&gt;I have met people who claimed that public transport
&gt;simply wasn't an option at all, because they were just
&gt;a better class of people, who are entitled to private
&gt;car transport (including people who expect others to do
&gt;the driving and provide the car.) They wouldn't wanna

"/> This is generally true, but there are a few toll plazas with EZ-Pass
express lanes which run at or near full speed. For example, both the
north and south end of the New Jersey Turnpike have express toll
plazas which you can drive through at 55 MPH.

At the other extreme, the DE/MD state line toll plaza on the Delaware
Turnpike often backs up on holidays and weekend nights because there are
not enough EZ-Passes; the toll booths cannot handle the traffic volume,
and even the left (EZ-Pass only) lane gets caught in a backup of several
miles. This tollbooth certainly does increase congestion. (I've never
used this toll plaza at rush hour, but I assume it is not as bad,
because the regular commuters do have EZ-Passes and thus the toll plaza
capacity is much higher.)

age will be higher than 65. All the money that is taken from me for social security
is gone. It's an income tax, just like any other.

So, GWB is offering me something, a chance at having some money. Democrats are offering
nothing.

This isn't a tough choice. No matter how much shrub's plan may suck, even if it nets
me 50 cents, it's better than presently proposed alternative of doing nothing.

Just to be fair, President Clinton offered up personal accounts in 1999 to the cheers
of democrats. But now that Bush has taken up carrying the torch the democrats have
decided to oppose it.

Really, I would just like to opt-out. Let me out now, keep everything taken thus far.
I can save money myself, and if need be, can prove it to the government.

&gt; Because their goal goes beyond a simple tax increase.

&gt; A transponder tracking system has far more benefits for the government.
&gt; 1) All sorts of contracts to give to the connected and get kickbacks from.
&gt; 2) Lot's of new government jobs to give to friends and people that help
&gt; at election time.
&gt; 3) The ability to log where people go. Especially good if some
&gt; 'troublemaker' decides to run against those already in office.
&gt; 4) A tax that people will be billed for and may not really even notice as
&gt; it increases since their account will auto-renew or in some way just show
&gt; up as a charge on their credit card.

"/>  You forgot one:

5) A convenient way for local police to watch for potential violators. For
example when I got nabbed last fall for having an expired inspection sticker.
(I honestly was going to get inspected the next day; they just caught me before
I could get to it. But that's irrelevant, I know.) County officers were
stationed at the toll plaza where they could easily see the windshield stickers
of everyone passing through, plus at that point we were all going slow enough
they could pull us over with a hand-wave.

BTW, for the person who claimed that the transponder systems sped people
through toll plazas, perhaps sometimes this is true. My most frequent
experience is with the Dulles Toll Road in northern Virginia. I don't have a
transponder, and have noticed that quite frequently when traffic is heavy the
lines for the smart-tag/ezpass lanes are backed up further than the
exact-change-only lanes. I have no idea why! Why don't people just go to the
shortest line - the transponders work in all lanes.

the other person's PERCEPTION of my financial/socio-
economic status. And that their PERCEPTION could be
very different from reality...

"/> OK, but are they going to change the notion of the standard workday being

When I used to live in an area with tolls, I would bypass them by using
either surface roads, or back roads [county roads] and generally get to
where I was going at the same time, or a little earlier.

&gt;&gt;The legislation, backed by the Bush administration, would give states

&gt;&gt;The trucking industry group also warns that tolls on existing highways

&gt;That's an empty threat. Truckers are under ridiculously tight

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm glad we agree. Of course at the same time completely get rid of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; corporate taxes, since corporate taxes really are consumer taxes since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the tax burden is just built into the price of goods.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a myth propagated by people who don't understand economics. If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;corporate taxes were eliminated, Starbucks isn't going to lower the price
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of its coffee. The reason it charges $4 for a cup of coffee is that they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have determined the consumer is willing to pay that price. If their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;market gurus found that the consumer was willing to pay $5 for a cup of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;coffee with an acceptable drop off in demand, Starbucks will charge $5,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;corporate tax or no corporate tax.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a myth propagated by people who have a little knowledge about
&gt;&gt;&gt; economics. The model where cost has no impact on price only works in
&gt;&gt;&gt; a monopoly world.

&gt;&gt;Try studying the subject of &quot;Branding.&quot; It is part of
&gt;&gt;advertising/marketing.

&gt;&gt;For example, Branding is why the tin of beans with the
&gt;&gt;recognisable name and pretty picture on the label costs
&gt;&gt;more than the generic &quot;no-name&quot; tin of beans. Even if
&gt;&gt;the actual product inside is identical (sometimes even
&gt;&gt;made in the same factory on the same line.)

&gt; You've never tried the no-name tins, have you?

"/> Is that really a question, or just an ASSumption?

I have eaten plenty of generic, no-name, store-brand,
off-brand, food. Recently. In fact, I have some in
the cupboard right now.

When I go to a supermarket, my brand choices are solely
based upon price. Been doing it for over a decade.

Never bothered me in the least.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sometimes, the no-name
&gt; products are just as good. Often, they simply aren't. The advantage
&gt; to the consumer of the brand is one of consistency.

"/> Like the consistent 50-80% (or more) higher cost?

Besides, for high-quality (better than supermarket),
low-dollar (compensated by my work, discipline, and
attitude), vegetables, I go to my personal organic
vegetable garden.

If that makes you disappointed or uncomfortable, note
that I have at least two recently-moved-in neighbours
who are hoping to increase the hassle and negativity
until... they won't have to see that example of
healthy, positive living, anymore.) I never had a
problem before those dorks arrived.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Starbucks IS a quasi-monopoly, since they are the only
&gt;&gt;ones who sell *Starbucks_Brand* coffee, which may be
&gt;&gt;PERCEIVED as special, and worth a $$$ premium.

&gt; Substitute products abound within their market;

"/> Branding is about *emotions* and social stereotypes.
It is actually a strategy to *avoid* a rational apples-
to-apples comparison. Like I said: look it up, and do
some reading.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; a monopoly on selling a particular brand is _not_ at all
&gt; the same as having a monopoly on the product. Brand loyalty
&gt; allows them to maintain some premium, not
&gt; total insulation from competition.

"/> That is right. And &quot;some&quot; premium may be enough for
profitability. By playing on the emotions of the
marketing-ad-targets/consumers.

&quot;Ooooohhh... S/he has a kewl new Beemer... Whoa... must
be a really kewl human being...&quot;

Try living and socialising in Southern California for a
few years. Then you know what I mean.

And, of course, it is still emotional. The kewl person
with the kewl car might really be in debt up to their
elbows, with a negative net worth which will end at
Bankruptcy Court. Or moving back in with their mommy.
Or, sometimes, moving into &quot;Cardboard Condo&quot; down on
Skid Row.

Before you continue any condescension, please note that
my JOB is tightly intertwined with the concept of
Branding. (Feels rather goofy, considering my own
personal values and lifestyle...)

compete, and compete on price at that.
