Unrecognized&quot; Palestinians

By Stephen Lendman

09/13/07 &quot;ICH&quot; --- -- Israel's population today is about 7,150,000.
About 5.4 million are Jews (76%) plus another 400,000 Jewish settlers
in over 200 expanding settlements on occupied Palestinian land in the
West Bank that includes Palestinian East Jerusalem. They're the chosen
ones afforded full rights and privileges under the laws of the Jewish
state for Jews alone.

Palestinian Arabs are another story. Their population is around 5.3
million (plus six million or more in the Palestinian diaspora). Around
3.9 million live in occupied Gaza and the West Bank, and another 1.4
million are Arab citizens of Israel (20% of the population), including
about 260,000 classified as internally displaced. Palestinians get no
rights afforded Jews even though those inside Israel are citizens of
the Jewish state, have passports and IDs, and can vote in Knesset
elections for what good it does them. They're subjected to constant
abuse and neglect, are confined to 2% of the land plus 1% more for
agricultural use, and are treated disdainfully as nonpersons.

Arab Israeli citizens live mainly in all-Arab towns and villages in
three heartlands - the Galilee in the north; what's called the &quot;Little
Triangle&quot; in the center that runs along the Israeli side of the Green
Line separating Israel from the West Bank; and the Negev desert region
in the country's south. These communities aren't geographically
consolidated and are surrounded by established Jewish communities,
hostile to Arab neighbors, and with Israel's full military might
backing them. A minority of Palestinians also live uneasily in mixed
Jewish-Arab cities like Tel Aviv, Jaffa, Haifa, Acre, Jerusalem in the
West Bank and others.

The Plight of Palestinian Nonpersons in &quot;Unrecognized Villages&quot;

The term is Orwellian in its worst sense. How can something real not
officially exist? Around 150,000 or more (accurate numbers are hard to
come by) Palestinian Arabs today live in over 100 so-called
&quot;unrecognized villages,&quot; mainly in the Galilee and the Negev desert.
They're unrecognized because their inhabitants are considered internal
refugees who were forced to flee their original homes during Israel's
1948 &quot;War of Independence&quot; and were prevented from returning when it
ended.

These villages were delegitimized by Israel's 1965 Planning and
Construction Law that established a regulatory framework and national
plan for future development. It zoned land for residential,
agriculture and industrial use, forbade unlicensed construction,
banned it on agricultural land, and stipulated where Israeli Jews and
Palestinians could live. That's how apartheid worked in South Africa.

Existing communities are circumscribed on a map with blue lines around
them. Areas inside the lines can be developed. Those outside cannot.
For Jewish communities, great latitude is allowed for future
expansion, and new communities are added as a result. In contrast,
Palestinian areas are severely constricted leaving no room for
expansion. Their land was reclassified as agricultural meaning no new
construction is allowed. This meant entire communities became
&quot;unrecognized&quot; and all homes and buildings there declared illegal,
even the 95% of them built before the 1965 law passed. They're subject
to demolition and inhabitant displacement at the whim of Israeli
officials. They want new land for Jews and freely take it from Arab
owners, helpless to stop it.

All Israeli public land is administered by the Israel Land Authority
(ILA) that has a legal obligation to treat all its citizens fairly.
Instead and with impunity, it serves Jewish interests only using
various methods to do it. It restricts and prohibits Palestinian land
development by:

-- putting large Arab areas under its control through the creation of
regional councils;

-- zoning restrictions mentioned above;

-- transferring public land adjacent to Arab communities to Jewish
National Fund (JNF) ownership that mandates it's only for Jews;

-- connecting the cost of leasing land to military service that
discriminates against Palestinians not required to serve and almost
none do;

-- declaring national priority town areas for Jews only;

-- delaying, restricting and prohibiting local development in Arab
communities;

-- ignoring Arab needs in regional and national plans;

-- allowing Palestinians little or no representation on national
planning committees;

-- enforcing a policy of forced evictions and demolitions of buildings
without appropriate permits. In &quot;unrecognized villages,&quot; no permits
are allowed Palestinians on their own land. Entire villages thus face
prosecution in the courts and loss of their homes, land and
possessions through a state-sponsored policy to remove them
judicially.

It gets worse. No new Palestinian communities are allowed, and
existing &quot;unrecognized villages&quot; are denied essential municipal
services like clean drinking water, electricity, roads, transport,
sanitation, education, healthcare, postal and telephone service,
refuse removal and more because under the Planning and Construction
Law they're illegal. The toll on their people is devastating:

-- clean water is unavailable almost everywhere unless people have
access to well water,

-- the few available health services are inadequate,

-- many homes have no bathrooms, and no permits are allowed to build
them,

-- only villages with private generators have electricity enough for
lighting only,

-- no village is connected to the main road network,

-- some villages are fenced in prohibiting their residents from access
to their traditional lands,

-- in the North, only one school remains open and children must travel
10 - 15 kilometers to attend another; as a result, achievement levels
are low and dropout rates high.

It's worse still when home demolitions are ordered. It may stipulate
Palestinians must do it themselves or be fined for contempt of court
and face up to a year in prison. They may also have to cover the cost
when Israeli bulldozers do it under a system of convoluted justice
penalizing Palestinians twice over.

Discriminatory Israeli Law

Israel is a signatory to the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR). Its Preamble states &quot;the obligation of
(signatory) States under the Charter of the United Nations to promote
universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and freedom.&quot;
It then covers what states must observe in 53 Articles that stipulate
the following:

-- &quot;All people have the right of self-determination.&quot;

-- &quot;Each state party....undertakes to respect and ensure to all
individuals within its territory the rights in this Covenant, without
distinction of any kind&quot; for any reason.

-- &quot;Every human being has the inherent right to life,&quot; to &quot;be
protected by law,&quot; and no activity may be undertaken to destroy any
rights and freedom covered under this Covenant.

-- &quot;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment.&quot;

-- &quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention.&quot;

-- &quot;Everyone....within the territory (shall) have the right to liberty
of movement and freedom to chose his residence (and) to be free to
leave any country (and not be) deprived of the right to enter (or
return to) his own country.&quot;

-- &quot;All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals.&quot;

-- &quot;Everyone shall have the right to recognition everywhere as a
person before the law.&quot;

-- &quot;All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any
discrimination to the equal protection of the law.&quot;

-- In states with &quot;ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities (those
persons) shall not be denied the
(same) right(s)....as the other members.&quot;

In Israel, for all intents and purposes, the ICCPR is a nonstarter. It
applies to Jews alone, not to Arabs and other non-Jews. Israeli laws
allow it by subjecting non-Jews, and specifically Arabs, to three
types of discrimination:

-- legal direct discrimination guaranteeing Jews alone the right to
immigrate and become citizens; it also gives various Jewish
organizations in the country quasi-government status serving Jews
only.

-- indirect discrimination through &quot;neutral&quot; laws and criteria
applying principally to Palestinians; government preferences and
benefits are predicated on prior military service most Palestinians
don't perform; the categorization of the country into preferential
zones for Jews provides them privileges and benefits denied
Palestinians.

-- institutional discrimination through a legal framework facilitating
a pattern of privileges afforded Jews only; they're allocated through
budgets and resources showing preferential treatment for Jews and
discrimination against Palestinians; Israeli courts enforce the bias
by refusing to hear cases where Palestinians claim their rights have
been denied;

-- even when courts hear cases and rule favorably, Palestinians get
only crumbs; an example was in the early September Supreme Court
decision that Israel reroute part of its illegal apartheid wall and
return a small portion of stolen land to the people of Bil'in; a far
greater issue was ignored by allowing the illegal Modiin Illit
settlement on Bil'in land to remain intact; for anti-occupation Gush
Shalom, the court decision message to settlers is do as you please,
build fast and expect court approval retrospectively.

Israel professes to be a democracy. It is not by any reasonable
standard. It defines itself as a Jewish state which contradicts its
claimed democratic credentials. It treats Jews preferentially and
entitles them to special consideration denied non-Jews who are
discriminated against as second-class citizens and denied comparable
rights.

Israel has no formal constitution and instead is governed by its Basic
Laws that before 1992 guaranteed no basic rights. That year, the Basic
Law: Human Dignity and Freedom passed authorizing the Knesset to
overturn laws contrary to the right to dignity, life, freedom,
privacy, property and to leave and enter the country. The law states
&quot;There shall be no violation of the life, body or dignity of any
person. All persons are entitled to protection&quot; of these rights, and
&quot;There shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a
person by imprisonment, arrest, extradition or otherwise.&quot;

For a nation committed to violence, the irony is particularly galling
that a section of the Basic Law also deals with &quot;The Right to Life and
Limb in Israeli Law.&quot; It states &quot;Israeli law has abolished the death
penalty for murder (and corporal punishment).&quot; It notes this penalty
exists in principle but only under limited circumstances such as for
treason during war and under the Law for the Prevention and Punishment
of Genocide. It further notes Israel's 1998 Good Samaritan Law
requires assistance be given in situations &quot;of immediate and severe
danger to another.&quot; Omitted from the Basic Law is the right to
equality so all rights in it apply to Jews only.

Palestinian Arabs have none, yet can stand for public office in the
Knesset. Some do, a few are elected but have no power beyond a public
stage to state their views and be shouted down or ignored. They're
also constrained by the 1992 Law of Political Parties and section
7A(1) of the Basic Law that prohibits candidates for office from
denying &quot;the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the
Jewish people.&quot; No candidate may challenge the fundamental Jewish
character of the state or demand equal rights, privileges and justice
under the law for Arabs and Jews. The essential Zionist identity is
inviolable, the rule of law works for Jews alone, and Palestinians are
denied all rights, equal treatment and justice under a legal system
for Jews that discriminates against Arab Muslims. In South Africa it
was called apartheid.

The Current Plight of Palestinian Israeli Citizens in the Negev

About half the 160,000 Bedouin Arabs today face forced displacement in
the Negev. Why? Because they live in dozens &quot;unrecognized villages&quot;
making their homes illegal under Israeli law. They face imprisonment
and fines if they refuse to leave so their land can be cleared, homes
demolished, and the area Judaised for a Negev development plan. It's
described as &quot;A Miracle in the Desert&quot; that aims to populate the area
with a half million new Jewish residents in the next decade. Plans are
for 25 new communities and 100,000 homes on cleared Bedouin lands. For
the past two years, Israel has been ethnically cleansing the Negev and
erasing Bedouin villages to make it possible.

All Bedouin Arabs in &quot;unrecognized villages&quot; face what those living in
Tawil Abu Jarwal endured in January. The entire village was destroyed
when the Israeli military (IDF), a large police contingent and special
task forces, a helicopter and bulldozers came in January 9. They
demolished all 21 of its homes that consisted of shacks, brick rooms
and tents. It followed a month earlier assault when 17 other homes
were destroyed and their residents forcibly displaced. The people
became homeless, and 63 of them in January were children. In late
2006, Israel's interior minister, Roni Bar-On, announced his intention
to destroy all 42,000 &quot;illegal structures&quot; in the Negev in a bandit
declaration of planned forced ethnic cleansing against people helpless
to stop it.

It's happening in Al-Sadir, Tel-Arad, Amara-Tarabin and on June 25 to
Bedouin families in the small villages of Um al-Hiran and Atir that
are homes to about 1000 people. Hundreds of police and Israeli
security forces destroyed over 20 of their homes to make way for a
Jewish community called Hiran to replace them. People living in them
lost everything including their possessions they had no chance to
remove. Haaretz reported Atir villagers lived there for 51 years after
being transferred to the area in
1956 under martial law. The article continued saying the Israeli
Regional Council of &quot;Unrecognized Villages&quot; will move displaced
families to a refugee camp in the center of Jerusalem (where Bedouins
don't wish to live) &quot;as part of the government's (forced ethnic
cleansing) relocation project&quot; to make the &quot;desert bloom&quot; for new
Jewish only communities.

This is what all Negev Bedouin Arabs now face unless something can
stop it. Large numbers of them attended an early August protest
conference. It was held in solidarity with unaffected Palestinians who
together called on Arab and other countries to support their right to
remain in their homes and denounce Israel's racist apartheid laws.

Arab Knesset member, Talab Al Sane, spoke on their behalf. So did
Hussein Al Rafay'a, head of the regional council of the &quot;unrecognized
villages,&quot; who said Israel wants Palestinians to be refugees in their
own lands and has been forcing them into this status by a policy of
home demolitions and continued displacement. Arabs once owned 5.5
million dunams of land (550,000 hectares) in the Negev, he said. They
now own less than 200,000 (20,000 hectares) and are threatened with
losing all of it. &quot;We will resort to the Security Council, and the
international court (in the Hague) to provide the residents and their
lands with needed protection.&quot;

With an assured US veto in the Security Council and Israel's record of
ignoring UN resolutions and World Court rulings against it, there's
little chance for success and every likelihood legal Israeli Arab
citizens will continue being displaced from their own land.

Advocacy for Palestinian Arabs in &quot;Unrecognized Villages&quot;

Israel denies all Palestinians their basic rights. However, those
living in so-called &quot;unrecognized villages&quot; face a special threat -
demolition of their homes, loss of their land and possessions, and
frightening displacement that will make them refugees along with
millions of others in their own land. Few organizations advocate on
their behalf, but a group that does is called The Association of
Forty.

It's a grassroots NGO in Israel committed to promoting social justice
for Israeli Arabs and to gain official recognition for their
&quot;unrecognized villages.&quot; It was formed in December, 1988 when Arab and
Jewish residents from several of the affected villages and other areas
formed the Association. It now &quot;represents the residents of the
'unrecognized villages' and their problems, and promotes support
locally and internationally&quot; on their behalf. It seeks official
recognition for the villages, an improvement in their living
conditions, and &quot;full rights and equality for the Arab citizens of the
state&quot; of Israel.

Its work consists of initiating &quot;the preparation and implementation of
active projects within these villages such as paving roads, improving
existing roads and helping the residents to achieve their rights, to
connect their villages to the network of water, electricity and
telephones, to establish and operate kindergartens and clinics for
mother and child care, and to obtain educational non-curricular
activities for the schoolchildren....&quot; It publishes a monthly
newspaper, Sawt Al-Qura, has photographic exhibitions, films and
documentaries that reflect the plight of the villages. It also
organizes study days, holds local and international conferences, and
participates in other international ones.

The Palestinians Enduring Struggle for Freedom and Justice

Palestinians today live under horrendous conditions. By any standard,
they're appalling, repressive and in violation of fundamental human
rights principles under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
stating:

-- &quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.&quot;

-- &quot;Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms....in this
Declaration, without distinction of any kind.&quot;

-- &quot;Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.&quot;

-- &quot;Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person
before the law.&quot;

-- &quot;All are equal before the law and are entitled....to equal
protection.&quot;

-- &quot;Everyone has the right to own property (nor shall anyone) be
arbitrarily (be) deprived of his property.&quot;

Israel offers these rights to Jews alone. It denies them to
Palestinian Arab Muslims in violation of its own Basic Law professing
&quot;Fundamental human rights....founded upon recognition of the value of
the human being, the sanctity of human life, and the principle that
all persons are free.&quot; It continues stating the Basic Law of Israel
&quot;is to protect human dignity and liberty....(that) There shall be no
violation of the property of a person....(that) All persons are
entitled to protection of their life, body and dignity....(that) All
government authorities are bound to respect the rights under this
Basic Law.&quot;

The Basic Law also states Israel is a Jewish state, and the message is
clear. All rights, benefits, privileges and protections are for Jews
alone. All others are unwelcome, unwanted, unprotected, and unequal
under the law. For them, justice unrecognized is justice denied and
for Palestinians it's willful and with malice.

They face constant harassment, abuse and near daily assaults in the
West Bank and even worse treatment under virtual imprisonment in Gaza.
Their democratically elected government was ousted by a US-Israeli
orchestrated coup in June to the shameless applause of Western leaders
and silence from Arab ones. They're now isolated, surrounded and
dangerously close to a humanitarian disaster affecting 1.4 million
people.

It's no better for Israeli Palestinian citizens. They're nonpersons in
their own land, are treated like intruders, given no rights, face
constant harassment and mistreatment, get no justice, and face
imminent loss of their homes, land, freedom and lives any time Israeli
authorities wish to act against them. Yet they persist and endure as
do their brethren in the Occupied Territories. They reach out to the
world community, press their case, and a delegation from occupied
Palestine stated it at the World Social Forum in Nairobi, Kenya in
January.

It was a call to action and cry for help for &quot;freedom, justice and (a)
durable peace&quot; and an end to six decades of repression. It called for
a &quot;global Campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against
Israel until it ends its apartheid-like regime of discrimination,
occupation and colonization, and respects the right of return of
Palestinian refugees and internally displaced persons.&quot;

It called for &quot;Consumer boycotts of Israeli products; boycott of
Israeli academic, athletic and cultural events and institutions
complicit in human rights abuses; divestment from Israeli companies
(and) international companies involved in perpetuating injustice, and
pressuring governments to impose sanctions on Israel....&quot;

Silence is not an option, and people of conscience can help. Noted
author and documentary filmmaker, John Pilger, believes &quot;something is
changing,&quot; and he saw it in a recent full page New York Times ad
having a &quot;distinct odour of panic.&quot; It called for boycotting Israel,
and Pilger senses the &quot;swell....is growing inexorably, as if an
important marker has been passed
(and it's) reminiscent of the boycotts that led to sanctions against
apartheid South Africa.....once distant voices,&quot; notes Pilger, have
&quot;gone global,&quot; it caught Israel off guard and may signal change. But
not easily or fast and may not happen at all unless global pressure
becomes mass public outrage that this injustice no longer will be
tolerated by people of conscience anywhere.
