I take it the bottom bracket isn't meant to look like this.  Has a crank-
bolt-thingy sheared off in it?

Looks fine to me (or as fine as that type of bracket ever were...). The
crank's secured with a nut, rather than a bolt. Do you not have the
parts? If not, a decent LBS should be able to help you.

However, it's just possible that it *is* a conventional axle, and that
a bolt *has* sheared off in it! You should be able to tell, though - I
can't, because (as you mention) the picture's a bit out of focus. I
think it's extremely unlikely, though.

Quite difficult to tell from the photgraphs but looks more like the crank
has a male thread for fixing a nut on and the thread has corroded/ been
stripped off.

That looks like a traditional axle which takes a nut rather than a bolt.

Looking at the rest of the bike, from what I can see, it looks about the
right age and type of bike to have the nutted sort of axle.

I agree with the other opinions; its a traditional axle with threads on end.
The cranks should be secured with a serrated nut (any good bike shop should
have them in their parts bin, shops which only sell things in sealed packets
might not have them).

As to the state of the bottom bracket.
Those axles are used in a cup/cone bottom bracket. If the cups are fine and
the axle doesn't have pits on it, then the whole assembly is probably fine.
(The axle will have a smooth wear stripe where the bearings run, this is
normal and &quot;good&quot;, pits are distinct holes, not a smooth wear line).
Possibly new ball bearings and re-greasing may help (though make sure they
are a decent grade, there are quite a lot of rubbish ball bearings sold in
bike shops).

If not sure about setting up the bearing, then a modern cartridge type
(Shimano UN52, etc) should fit.

You were right the first time, Simon. In the next photo you can see the

Probably not - it looks like the infamous Raleigh 26tpi threaded BB.

I don't think so - I think you'll find (or Mark will find!) that the
one in the picture is a standard 1.370 x 24; it's a fairly standard
chainset and BB (possibly made by SR?). It's not a Raleigh manufactured
BB, I'm pretty sure.

Mark will need only to consider axle length, obviously, but again the
LBS should be able to help - if you *do* need a new BB, take the
complete chainset with you, Mark.

What makes you think that ?
The cone and lock ring look no different to those on two bikes of mine, and
those have &quot;standard&quot; BB threads, not Raleigh specials, so you must have
spotted a detail I have missed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If it is a wierd thread BB, then an alternative option to Sheldon would be
to seek a BB for a shell with stripped threads.

A friend of mine bought one without hassle in the local (south Suffolk) bike
shop when his BB threads stripped (due to riding with loose BB in bike with
some rust in the BB). SJS list one for £20.

The SJS item is stated to need some spacing washers. So, with luck, those
will correspond to the &quot;over width&quot; nature of the Raleigh shell.  Only
question remaining is whether the hole down the Raleigh shell will take the
cartridge.

If you say so, but those 16mm flats on the cup do look pretty

I have: early 80s, I'd say, though they may have been around later. I
don't remember seeing any Raleigh ones that were quite as nicely
chromed as the one in the picture.

I spent a large part of yesterday afternoon messing about with just such

I stand corrected.  I've seen wider spaced spanner flats on standard
cups, but have only seen the 16mm spaced ones (which these look like)
on 26tpi cups.  I live and learn.

No, there was quite an overlap.  I found this out by being sold a
24tpi
cartridge BB which &quot;couldn't fail to fit&quot;, since my BB shell was
&quot;definitely standard&quot;.

It didn't.  It wasn't.

Me too - what I learned yesterday is that it's really not worth fiddling
around with knackered old stuff trying to make it work, it's much better
just to buy new parts.  And for some reason a 16mm cone spanner is
better than a regular open-ended spanner for turning that sort of
adjusting cup (when I was a proper mechanic I had a wall full of special
tools for stuff like that).

I agree about being cautious in identifying the parts.

However, the two cup/cone BB's on my bikes have the same flats and look very
much like the ones in the picture. They are circa 16mm across the flats, and
can be adjusted using a normal spanner (if the cranks are removed).

The examples on my bikes are:
Circa 1977/78 Coventry Eagle 10-speed &quot;racer&quot;, still on its original shells.
The bike is now my town/station hack.
Circa 1990 Nigel Dean World Tour. Cups now in the &quot;just incase&quot; spares bag
(for the Coventry Eagle) as the bike was changed to cartridge BB when I had
the frame re-sprayed a few years ago.

The Raleigh specials were for cottered cranks. That is a square taper,
therefor it is not a Raleigh special. There are, of course, various
different square taper standards, but that's a separate problem!

There's no reason to believe there's anything wrong with that BB, unless
it's running rough. A bit of preventive maintenance (strip, clean,
regrease) would do no harm, provided you know how to adjust a cup-and-cone
BB. If not, just leave it alone - they are typically very reliable and
have long service life (often much better than modern cartridge systems.
