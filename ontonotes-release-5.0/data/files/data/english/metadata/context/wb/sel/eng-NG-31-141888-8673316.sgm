A Statement by the Asian Human Rights Commission

WORLD: Foreign company based in Sri Lanka disregards worker's
conditions and threatens their representatives and human rights
defenders

The Asian Human Rights Commission is seriously concerned about the
developments relating to CCS Elsuma (Pvt) Ltd based at Daluwakotuwa,
Kochchikade (near Negombo) which has blatantly disregarded an
agreement entered into with workers under the auspices of the
Commissioner of Labour for the settlement of a labour dispute and
further went on to threaten the representatives of the works and
several human rights defenders in the Negombo region.

The factory workers of CCS Elsuma (Pvt) Ltd of have gone on strike
several times since 2005 on the issue of salary scales. (This company
is part of an international group whose head office is located in
Switzerland which is CCS Elsuma AG. Switzerland, at Werkstrasse 36,
3250 Lyss, Switzerland &amp;ndash; Tel: 41 32 3879110, Fax: 41 32
3851434). This company engages in manufacturing parts for computers
and other electronic equipment. At the Daluwakotuwa factory about 550
people are employed.

On the 1st and 2nd March of 2007 the workers went on strike for two
days to express dissatisfaction with the salary scheme proposed by
the employer which they felt was unfair to them.

In order to settle this dispute there was a discussion before the
Commissioner of Labour in the section of the Labour Department on
Industrial Relations. In the discussions before the Labour
Commissioner the Board of Investment (BOI) was also represented and
there were representatives of the employer and the workers.

In these discussions it was agreed to form a Savaka Sabava (Workers
Council) to negotiate on behalf of the workers and to pursue the
matter of the salaries and the other matters regarding the
worker&amp;rsquo;s welfare. The result of discussions before the
Commissioner of Labour with the participation of the BOI was to
arrive at this agreement. It was on the basis of this agreement that
the demands raised by the workers with regard to their conditions
including salaries were to be settled between the workers and the
management. The workers believed that the management came to this
agreement under the auspices of the Commissioner of Labour in good
faith and that the management would honour the agreement.

The workers selected 12 persons as their representatives and this
Savaka Sabava met and decided on a president and a secretary. The
name of the president is Maximus Krishan Rodrigo, the secretary is
W.T. Priyankara and the vice president is Roshan Costa.

The Savaka Sabava made several proposals regarding the salary scheme
and presented it to the employer on 20 May 2007. The proposals of the
Savaka Sabava centered around some salary discrepancies where about 56
workers were not to get any increment at all and about 123 were to get
an increment of less than Rs. 500/= per month. Another issue raised
was regarding 200 contract workers who had no guarantee of stability
of employment.

The director of personnel promised to give a reply to the
worker&amp;rsquo;s proposals in two days.

As there was no reply even after several days the Savaka Sabava
contacted the director who said that a reply would be given within a
very short time and the delay was due to the lack of opportunity to
discuss the matter with a foreign director.

After several days of waiting the Savaka Sabava, through its
president, gave a letter asking for an urgent reply and requested the
management for an acknowledgment of the letter. As the director
refused to give an acknowledgment a copy of the same letter was sent
to him by registered post. At this stage the Savaka Sabava began to
form the opinion that the management had not entered into the
agreement arrived at with the intervention of the Commissioner of
Labour and the BOI and that Mr. Lambert was deliberately behaving in
a way indicating that there would be indefinite postponements of
decisions relating to the proposals made by the Savaka Sabava under
one pretext or another.

A few days later on the 5th June, 2007 the president of the Savaka
Sabava went to inquire about the matter of their proposals and met
the director in the presence of his wife. At this meeting the
director told the president of the Savaka Sabava that a woman
employee has made a complaint of some threats being made to her by
the president of the Savaka Sabava.

This matter was brought to the notice of the Savaka Sabava by the
president and the Savaka Sabava&amp;rsquo;s was that some manipulation
was underway to dismiss the president of the Savaka Sabava as a way
of side tracking the proposals that they had made. Accordingly the
president was requested to make a complaint to the police regarding
this matter.

On the 6th June, the management sent a letter of interdiction to the
president of the Savaka Sabava. The Savaka Sabava saw it as an
attempt to side track the discussion on the wage issue and the
proposals of the workers. About 400 workers signed a petition to be
sent to the Commissioner of Labour and the BOI requesting an inquiry.
However, to date, neither the Commissioner of Labour nor the BOI has
conducted any such inquiries. Thereafter outside working hours many
workers participated in peaceful protest requesting the authorities
to reinstate the president of the Savaka Sabava. These protests were
conducted peacefully and often in the presence of police officers.
There had been no breach of peace at any time. A complaint by the
management that some workers and those who support them had made some
threats to the management was investigated by the police and the
police did not take any action on the complaint after the workers and
others concerned denied all allegations and explained the nature of
the industrial dispute that is going on.

On July 20th when some workers peacefully participated in a protest
in an area completely outside the territory of the company some
unknown persons came from within the company and began to take
photographs of the protestors. The protestors questioned the
photographers and asked if they were from a newspaper to which they
replied negatively. They refused to divulge their identities and went
inside the factory premises. The workers inquired who these people
were from the security guard of the company and the security section
replied that they did not know. As this is a time in Sri Lanka when
kidnappings and forced disappearances take place the workers
complained to the management that taking of the these photographs may
be for the purpose of causing some abductions. However the management
did not divulge who these photographers were.

On 26th July, 2007 the president of the Savaka Sabava received a
letter of termination of his services. Thereafter, the management
tried to intimidate the workers from demanding adjustment of wages
and other conditions proposed by the Savaka Sabava. In this manner
the management is trying to go against the agreement arrived under
the auspices of the Commissioner of Labour and the BOI, thus going
against the conditions on which the strike of the workers from 1st to
2nd March was terminated. The dismissal of the president seems to be
due to the fear that the workers may once again take to striking as
the condition on which their strike was terminated has been
dishonoured by the management.

The workers of CCS Elsuma (PVT) Ltd, Sri Lanka also want the sympathy
and support of several civil society organisations in the locality
where this factory is located. The management is also trying to
silence these organisations and to harass the human rights defenders
who have expressed solidarity for the workers. The management is
seeking the intervention of the court to silence these organisations.

The Asian Human Rights Commission has written to head office of the
CCS Elsuma group in Switzerland asking them to inquire into and
intervene in this matter.
