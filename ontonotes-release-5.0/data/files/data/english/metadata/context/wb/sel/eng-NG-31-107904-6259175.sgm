Group moves to limit speed of new trucks to 68 mph

Group moves to limit speed of new trucks to 68 mph

Study finds ground zero dogs aren't ill from work
WASHINGTON — U.S. trucking-industry leaders proposed Friday that all
new heavy trucks be equipped with tamperproof controls to prevent them
from going faster than 68 mph.

"For the sake of safety, there is a need to slow down all traffic,"
said Bill Graves, the president and chief executive officer of the
American Trucking Associations, based in Alexandria, Va.

The proposal, Graves said, is meant to address the problem of
increasing highway-death rates, which after many years of decline have
risen modestly since 2000.

Anne McCartt, the vice president for research at the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety in nearby Arlington, Va., lauded the
initiative, which the truckers offered as a petition to the Department
of Transportation.

"We applaud them," said McCartt, whose group is funded by the
insurance industry.

AAA also endorses speed limiters on trucks, said Mantill Williams, the
director of public affairs for the drivers' group, although it has
endorsed no particular speed limit.

Many truck fleets already use speed governors to improve safety and
cut fuel consumption, said Mac McCormick of Bestway Express, a
400-truck operator in Vincennes, Ind., and typically they're set at 68
mph or lower. The current International Brotherhood of Teamsters
contract standard is 62 mph or less.

But the speed regulators are easily disabled, according to the
trucking group, and they're not as widely used by the tens of
thousands of smaller scale owner-operators with whom the big fleets
compete.

"If a guy speeds, it's a (competitive) advantage that the general
public pays for," said McCormick, the American Trucking Associations'
first vice chairman. He said he hoped that requiring the devices on
all heavy trucks would "level the playing field."

Todd Spencer, the executive vice president of the Owner-Operator
Independent Drivers Association in Grain Valley, Mo., dismissed the
speed-curb proposal as "a pretty cynical PR effort." He said that
disparities in speed between cars and trucks would cause more
accidents than speed governors prevented.

That possibility has been widely debated, especially in states with
dual speed limits for trucks and cars. A Federal Highway
Administration analysis in 2004 found "no discernable effect on
accident rates" from letting cars go faster than trucks, however.

Graves said tamperproof speed governors wouldn't be hard to design.

The trucking group's measure would apply to trucks that weigh 26,000
pounds or more, which includes most trucks with double rear axles,
typically the biggest ones in rental fleets.

In a statement, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation said the
proposal would be "thoroughly evaluated."

Graves estimated that it would take at least two years for the
proposed regulation to become a federal rule of the road.

Speed controls, which are basically factory-installed microchips, have
been widely available since the mid-'90s. Because a commercial vehicle
lasts about 10 years, some safety groups, including AAA, want
tamperproof chips retrofitted into older trucks. The trucking
association's 37,000 members rejected that step at their convention in
February.

Generally speaking, truckers are good highway citizens, Department of
Transportation figures suggest. While heavy-truck mileage rose 86
percent over the past 20 years, involvement in fatal accidents dropped
51 percent.

Better yet, make it illegal for speed governors to be set lower than
the maximum posted limit on any road the truck would be driven on.
Without technology that would determine state, that would mean a
minimum governed speed of 75.

Because if those thousands of kids are too stupid to not play in the
middle of the interstate, they're too stupid to make any positive
contributions to society. Except, of course, for the rather humorous
articles in the papers about how they've used vehicles to commit
suicide.

62 mph is not a bad speed.  I rarely have to pass someone; and when I do,
they realize just slow they are going, and speed up.

With Quaalcom, companies can set the truck speed, and with the GPS on
Q-comm, it should be a no-brainer.  Enter a state, the truck runs at a
company-set speed.  Government has no business getting involved.  For
instance, Ohio has a truck speed of 55mph.  IF the company was "safety
concerned", they could lower the speed on the truck to 55.  HOWEVER, this
will not happen due to the fact that:
1) This will delay the freight, thus tying up the truck when it could be
unloaded and loaded before the truck could get there at 55.
2) When the driver gets a ticket for 62mph in a 55, the company chalks it up
as 1 ticket vs. 6 loads that made it thru.

Also, IIRC, several of the Western states that have a 75 SL have a
truck SL of 65.  Oregon is 65/55.  Oregon has not raised the car speed
limit due to the law having the truck SL 10mph lower than the car SL
and not wanting trucks legally going over 55.

&gt; The problem, of course, is that they speed up WHILE YOU ARE PASSING

The companies were setting the trucks at 57 MPH. The TEAMSTERS neogiated 62
mph in the last contract.  Seems to me that was a win for the public.  The
union cannot tell the companies how to run the company.  They can voice
their concerns at contract time, and neogiate answers.

The insurance companies and the cost of fuel have tied the companies hands
by lowering policy rates with govenors . the price of diesel has had alot to
do with it most recently.  If there were a uniform truck speed throughout
the lower 48 (say 65mph), than a cap at 68mph would be more acceptable.  But
with a wide variance in SL's for trucks, that will not happen.

&gt; Because if those thousands of kids are too stupid to not play in the

&gt; suicide.

Now if Loco Laura would just play in the middle of an interstate....

...Just not I-95... or 26... or 77... or 81.
