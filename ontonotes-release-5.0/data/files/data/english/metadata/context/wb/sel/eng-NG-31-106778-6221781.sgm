1.  Peretz and Olmert: Outposts Will Remain, By and Large

By Hillel Fendel

PM Olmert and DM Peretz have agreed, with right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu about
to join the coalition, that only illegal structures in Yesha will be
destroyed - not merely those that are "unauthorized."

According to the agreement, only structures built on private Arab-owned land
in Judea and Samaria will be removed. This is a departure from what has been
Defense Minister Peretz's stance until now. As he has publicly declared
repeatedly over the past month, he favored a blanket removal of all
unauthorized outposts in Yesha - even using force, if necessary.

The new compromise decision appears to be connected with the entry of
Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) party into the
coalition. The party is strongly opposed to the removal of outposts.

It thus appears that the presently-endangered Jewish structures are now
limited to several in the Maon Farm, south of Hevron; others in the Ronen
Farm, near Har Bracha in the Shomron; and four on the outskirts of Psagot.

As in the case of the nine structures that were demolished in Amona nine
months ago, the police are to carry out the actual destruction, with the
army merely providing protection. Hundreds of youths protesting the Amona
destruction were injured by police.

Within Labor, the new Peretz decision has already elicited strong criticism.
MK Ami Ayalon, a strong opponent to Peretz's leadership and who sees himself
as a potential contender for Peretz's position, said that the removal of
outposts is important for Israel under all circumstances and should not be
linked with other diplomatic procedures.

MK Esterina Tartman (Yisrael Beiteinu) says she sees the new Olmert-Peretz
agreement as a welcome initial result of her party's influence in the
government. She told Arutz-7's Itzik Wolfe today that she understood from
Lieberman that the destruction of the illegal structures was the "bone" that
Olmert had to throw to Peretz in order to calm down Labor's objections to
Yisrael Beiteinu's entry into the coalition.

On the other hand, it was still being reported this morning from the office
of Defense Minister Peretz that he plans to "act with determination" to
remove the outposts in Judea and Samaria. A statement released by the office
notes that time will be given for dialogue with the "settlers," but that the
destruction will take place forcefully if necessary.

2.  Labor Will Remain in the Coalition

By Yechiel Spira and Hillel Fendel

Labor Party leader Defense Minister Amir Peretz met with Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert Wednesday morning, finalizing Labor's continued membership in the
coalition.

Olmert and Peretz agreed that Labor will head a ministerial committee on
non-Jewish affairs, Labor's Ephraim Sneh will be named Deputy Defense
Minister - the first Deputy Minister in the current government - and that
the government guidelines will not be changed to accommodate Yisrael
Beiteinu.

Labor Party MKs will convene on Sunday, but are not expected to break away
from the ruling coalition to join the ranks of the opposition, despite the
introduction of Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) into the coalition.
Peretz announced today that he will recommend that the party accept Yisrael
Beiteinu's entry into the coalition.

Peretz has released, in recent weeks, numerous strong statements expressing
his opposition to the deal bringing Yisrael Beiteinu into the coalition.
However, it was essentially finalized this week that party leader MK Avigdor
Lieberman will serve as Minister of Strategic Affairs, assigned to the Prime
Minister’s Office. Lieberman will also be a deputy prime minister and a
member of the Security Cabinet.

Some Labor members are unwilling to abandon their fight, continuing to lead
the opposition to Yisrael Beiteinu's entry. Opponents include party
ministers Ophir Pines and Eitan Cabel, as well as MKs Danny Yatom and Shelly
Yechimovitch. They continue continue to attempt to persuade the party's
Central Committee members to vote against it when the committee convenes
this Sunday.

MK Yossi Beilin - a former Labor MK and currently the head of the left-wing
Meretz Party - has called for those Labor MKs who oppose the entry of
Yisrael Beiteinu to split off from Labor.

The inclusion of Yisrael Beiteinu adds 11 mandates to the coalition,
providing Olmert with a comfortable Knesset majority of nearly 2/3 of the
Knesset.

Analysts point out however that even with the stable majority giving Olmert
a comfortable base from which to begin moving ahead with his policies, the
government has no such policies to implement. Olmert’s flagship policy was
his Realignment Plan, calling for the removal of Jewish communities from
Judea and Samaria. However, following the war in Lebanon, and in light of
increasing Gaza terrorism, Olmert placed this plan in deep-freeze for the
foreseeable future. Senior intelligence community officials and others are
predicting that the IDF will be compelled to enter Gaza in the near future.

Though ex-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, father of the Disengagement which the
Realignment would have continued, acknowledged that the Gaza withdrawal
would not totally eliminate Gaza-based terror, he did promise that
day-to-day fighting would end and that Kassam rocket attacks would not be
tolerated.

In fact, however, the Kassam rocket attacks continue to increase in
frequency, and the situation for residents of Sderot and western Negev
communities is deteriorating daily.

The government has also failed to meet its responsibility to fortify public
buildings in those areas. With many schools still not capable of
withstanding rocket attacks, many pupils still study in unsafe buildings.

Defense Minister Peretz stated this week that the IDF will continue
operating in Gaza, but stated the government agenda does not include
re-taking control of Gaza.

3.  Sderot Asks Lieberman to Fulfill Gaza Promises

By Hillel Fendel

A group of Sderot residents have written a letter to future Minister of
Strategic Threats Avigdor Lieberman of Yisrael Beiteinu. The letter is
entitled "Fulfilling Your Promise."

Lieberman (pictured) is expected to assume the Cabinet post within the
coming days. The letter, which expresses disappointment in his recent stance
regarding Sderot but expresses hope for a change, reads as follows:

re: Fulfilling Your Promise

Dear MK Avigdor Lieberman,

The Task Force for Sderot Security was established a number of months ago,
in light of the continued intolerable situation of daily Kassam rockets
being fired towards the city.

Our first activity was to establish a protest tent and hold a hunger strike
outside the home of Defense Minister Amir Peretz. We were honored and happy
to host you on your solidarity visit, together with MKs of your Yisrael
Beiteinu party faction, in our protest tent.

After we explained to you the difficult situation in which the Sderot
residents find themselves, you told us you feel that "the government and its
leader are abandoning the city's residents and are not providing a solution
to the problem of the Kassams." You further said that in order to stop the
Kassams, what is needed is "to destroy the homes of the Hamas leaders and
turn the neighborhood of Beit Hanoun into a large soccer field."

We were disappointed to learn this week that during the course of the
negotiations you held with the Prime Minister regarding your entry into the
coalition, you did not even mention the urgent need to deal with the
difficult security situation in Sderot.

Though you had much to say about the issue of what should be Israel's
governmental system and about civil marriages, your strong stance favoring a
hard-hitting and broad military campaign in Gaza totally disappeared.

The security cabinet is supposed to convene - finally - next week to discuss
the security situation in Sderot and environs. We demand and expect from you
that in your new position as Minister of Strategic Threats, you will stand
by your word and work to actualize the promise you gave us outside the home
of Defense Minister Amir Peretz, to carry out a strong and broad military
action in Gaza to stop the Kassam rockets, the Arabs' arming there, and the
continued shooting.

With hope for a change,

Alon Davidi

Chairman of the Task Force for Sderot Security

Davidi.

In other Yisrael Beiteinu news, MK Dr. Yuri Shtern has sent out the
following letter:

My Dear Friends,

In recent days, my health has deteriorated. I ask that you pray for me
during these difficult times.

I strongly believe in the power of prayer. If we join together in these
coming days and months, I know that He will hear us and spread over us the
shelter of the shadow of His wings.

Yours Faithfully,

Member of Knesset Dr. Yuri Shtern

4.  Police Minister Supports Police in Western Wall Shofar Incident

By Hillel Fendel

The Knesset held a mini-debate Wednesday morning on the arrest of a young
man for blowing a shofar at the Western Wall this past Rosh HaShanah.

Several Knesset Members of the National Union party had submitted a Knesset
query to Public Security Minister Avi Dichter, who oversees the police
department, regarding the arrest. The basic thrust of all the queries, to
which Dichter responded today, was: "How can it be that in a Jewish state, a
man is arrested in the middle of prayers at the Western Wall on the holy day
of Rosh HaShanah for blowing a shofar?"

The circumstances of the case, as reported on Arutz-7 almost a month ago,
were as follows: On Rosh HaShanan morning, a group of worshipers were in the
midst of the Mussaf prayer, at the area known as the Kotel HaKatan, the
Small Western Wall (pictured). The Small Wall is a northern extension of the
Western Wall, standing opposite the presumed spot of the Holy of Holies of
the Beit HaMikdash. The service was thus one of the most solemn prayers of
the Jewish year, taking place at Judaism's most sacred widely-accessible
location.

As is customary according to Sephardic practice, the shofar (ram's horn) is
sounded several times on Rosh HaShanah, including during the silent
recitation of the Mussaf prayer. When 20-year-old Eliyahu K. began sounding
the shofar during the prayer, Border Guard policemen entered the area and
began trying to pull him away. However, Eliyahu did not cooperate or move,
as one may not move one's feet while reciting the silent prayer.

As one eyewitness later told Arutz-7, "The policeman then called on his
radio and said that [Eliyahu] was in the middle of praying and that they
would arrest him afterwards - but the order came back to arrest him right
then." The police started dragging him out, and when they stopped for a
moment, he got up and resumed his prayers. This procedure repeated itself
until the policemen finally allowed him to complete his prayers.

Eliyahu was finally arrested, and was released hours later after being
ordered not to frequent certain areas of the Old City; the latter order was
rescinded nearly a week later.

Adding insult to injury in the case was the police refusal to acknowledge
the eyewitness accounts. Instead, Police Spokesman Shmulik Ben-Ruby
repeatedly told Arutz-7 that Eliyahu was blowing the shofar "after the
prayers were finished" and that "he had already been blowing enough" and was
therefore asked to stop. This, in spite of the fact that several
participants confirmed that Eliyahu and the others were in fact in the
middle of prayers when the incident occurred.

MKs Benny Elon, Uri Ariel and Zevulun Orlev, all of the National
Union/National Religious Party, submitted Knesset queries to Minister
Dichter. They demanded to know how a shofar-blower at the Western Wall could
be arrested on Rosh HaShanah by a Jewish government. In addition, MK Elon
emphasized that the police account differed from that of several
eyewitnesses.

In Dichter's response today, he said that the policeman was within his
rights in using the force he used, in consideration of the fact that it was
the beginning of Ramadan, tensions were high, "and in his judgment, the
correct course of action was to stop the shofar blower."

MK Benny Elon responded that the police version of what happened
contradicted that which many eyewitnesses said actually occurred. He asked
the minister to check into the incident again, offering to provide him with
the telephone numbers of participants in the prayer service. He also said
that the policemen had behaved illegally by interrupting the worshiper in
the middle of his prayers.

MK Zevulun Orlev said that he was very disappointed by Dichter's answer,
"because I thought that the government of a Jewish State would allow what
the British government did not. It is well-known that the anti-Semitic
British Mandate government persecuted a shofar-blower at the Western Wall.
[The reference is to the late 1920's, when the British attempted to appease
the Arabs following violence at the Wall and forbade shofar-blowing there.
At the conclusion of the Yom Kippur services in 1929, a man named Moshe
Segal blew the shofar - and was immediately arrested by the British. Though
he had fasted for the previous 25 hours, the British detained him without
food until midnight, when he was finally released. Nearly 40 years later,
following the first Yom Kippur service at the Wall under Israeli
sovereignty, shortly after the Six Day War, the shofar was again sounded -
by Moshe Segal.]"

"Ever since the Six Day War," Orlev continued, "the shofar is sounded at the
Wall on Rosh HaShanah as an intrinsic part of the prayer service, and it has
never been forbidden. The police know that the shofar is sounded, and they
can make the proper preparations in advance. The Moslems, too, will not
object, for there is a status quo allowing every religion to keep its
commandments. The only reason that they would object is for nationalistic
reasons, and then the police must deal with this."

Orlev concluded, "To say that when a Jew blows the Shofar on Rosh HaShanah
under a Jewish government at the Western Wall consists a disturbance of the
peace is total insanity. I ask the minister if he would be willing to
reconsider the matter, in order to have a policy whereby Jews can fulfill
their mitzvot [religious commandments] all along the Western Wall, including
the Small Wall."

MK Menachem Porush (United Torah Judaism) noted that in addition to the
shofar problem, just the very fact that the police disturbed a worshiper in
the middle of his prayer is grounds for strong complaint.

Arab MK Muhammed Barakeh also spoke up, saying, "I am not expert in the
details of the case, and I can also understand the minister's answer about
the sensitivity of the location and that it could lead to all sorts of
tensions, but I think that no one, whoever he is, should be disturbed in the
middle of his prayers."

Dichter responded again, saying, "There is no status quo at the Small Wall,
as I said before, meaning that there are no set arrangements as there are at
other places such as the Machpelah Cave. Rather, the policeman is allowed to
use his judgment, whether at the Small Wall or any other place, even if it
be a holy site. The policeman has an absolute right to use his judgment
regarding the danger of a public disturbance - even if someone is in the
middle of the Amidah or any other prayer - based on the considerations of
Ramadan and the Moslems passing through the area and the like..."

"Regarding the matter in general," Dichter said, "we must look into how we
can allow several things at once: Moslems passing through the area, Jews
praying there, Jews blowing the shofar, respecting both religions - and how
to do all this [a smile began to appear on his face - ed.] in a way that
properly befits the State of Israel, this is something that I promise to
look into."

Asi Talmon, spokesman for the National Union party, later told Arutz-7 that
the MKs intend to press the matter with further queries to Minister Dichter,
in the hope of ensuring that the incident does not repeat itself.

5.  MK Gabbai: Israeli Sovereignty Eroding in Jerusalem´s Old City

By Nissan Ratzlav-Katz

Following a tour led by Jewish residents of the Old City, MK Eli Gabbai said
Tuesday that Israeli sovereignty in the heart of the capital is
deteriorating.

"There is an ongoing undermining of Israeli sovereignty in large sections
within the Old City of Jerusalem," according to Knesset Member Gabbai
(National Union-National Religious Party). Gabbai, chairman of the
legislature's Jerusalem Lobby, was given a walking tour of the Old City by
Jewish residents of the Muslim Quarter.

Gabbai said the tour revealed to him the weakness and the willful blindness
of the municipality and of the police in enforcing the law in the ancient
walled area of the city. The chronic lawbreaking among the city's Arab
residents, as cited by their Jewish neighbors, takes the form of illegal
construction, large outdoor events held without a license, unauthorized
sellers' stands - which are a security and safety danger to the public - as
well as the operation of mosque loudspeakers at unusual times and at high
volume.

In contrast to its apparent inability to enforce the law against Arab
residents of Jerusalem's Old City, MK Gabbai said, the police and
municipality have instituted ever more regulations limiting the freedom of
movement of many Jews in the city. For example, during the just-ended Muslim
holy month of Ramadan, the 800 Jews living in the Muslim Quarter of the Old
City were instructed by the Jerusalem police not to leave their homes
without prior coordination during the evening hours. This restriction was
announced because of the large number of celebrants - including many hostile
ones - returning from the Temple Mount each night of the month-long Muslim
holiday.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Education has forbidden any school trips,
including those with armed escorts, from entering the Muslim Quarter -
despite the presence of its 800 Jews. The Jewish residents of the quarter
also complained to MK Gabbai about a lack of basic services, such as mail
delivery, in their area of the Old City.

For his part, Gabbai promised the Jewish residents of the Muslim Quarter
that he would do all in his power to halt the dangerous erosion of Israeli
sovereignty in the nation's capital.

Gabbai can be emailed at &lt;ega ... @knesset.gov.il&gt;.

6.  The Goal: Stop the Parade!

By Hillel Fendel

A new united hareidi-religious-secular front was formed in Jerusalem last
night. The goal: the absolute cancellation of the homosexual march scheduled
for Jerusalem 16 days from now.

The formative meeting was held in the office of Jerusalem City Councilwoman
Mina Fenton Tuesday night, with the participation of representatives of many
religious and secular groups from around the country - and non-Jewish ones
as well.

A series of activities is planned, with the goal of convincing the police
that allowing the parade will simply be too dangerous. The message is that
the expected turnout of anti-parade protestors, as well as the clashes that
are likely to result, is likely to deteriorate into violence and possibly
even bloodshed. The organizers emphasize that the planned protest activities
will be totally legal.

Israel's Chief Rabbi, the Rishon LeTzion Rabbi Shlomo Amar, publicized a
declaration condemning the homosexual march and advocating wide public
protest. He called upon "every Jew for whom the existence of the Nation and
Land of Israel is important," as well as rabbis all over the world, to
"arouse a tremendous protest until this bad parade is totally called off."

Rabbi Amar "calls with love and affection to all our brethren, the House of
Israel, to strengthen themselves in holiness, modesty and purity, and
especially during these difficult days when Israel is persecuted from
without and within and we are in need of great Heavenly mercies..."

Among the participating groups in the new front are the Eida HaHareidit
Badatz Rabbinical Court, the Orange Task Force, Professors for a Strong
Israel, the Nahalal Forum, Emunah Women, Yesha rabbis, Women in Green, and
more.

Sabbath in Jerusalem

Rallies and marches against the parade will be held in various Jerusalem
neighborhoods in the coming days. In addition, arrangements will be made for
protestors from all around the country to spend the Sabbath at private homes
and dormitories in Jerusalem - as the homosexual march is set to end late
Friday afternoon.

Fenton reports that there is strong opposition from Jewish groups around the
world to allowing a homosexual march in the Holy Land. In addition, she
says, important donors from abroad are reconsidering their support for
various projects in Israel, in light of the government's agreement to hold
the parade.

Increasing Unity

Many of the speakers mentioned the great unity that the cause is
engendering. The sensation of fulfilling an important mission for the Jewish
People was felt by all, "totally dwarfing all that differences of opinion
that generally exist between different sectors and ideologies."

A headquarters will be active 24 hours a day "until the announcement is
received of the total cancellation of the abominable event."

Rabbi Yoel Schwartz, a prolific author and revered rabbi and teacher in the
hareidi community, said, "Our total dedication is being tested. The rabbis
must serve as an example, stopping the parade with their bodies. I am the
first to say I am willing to lie down in the streets and stop it, and
another 200 rabbis must do the same."

An unsigned poster to be hung on Jerusalem streets quotes Biblical verses
referring to the punishment reserved for those who commit "sins of
abomination," and then warns threateningly, "Jewish governments that
support, silently or otherwise, this parade and the departure of holiness
from Israel, and their courts and law-enforcers - they are all guilty and
responsible for the grave results that are foreseen as a result of this
parade and [that could happen] during the parade, Heaven forbid..."

The poster continues, "As everyone already knows, on the eve of Sabbath
Vayera [when the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra is retold], the loyal
Jewish public is threatened by a march of the abominators in Jerusalem - a
giant parade with the permission of the police and the Supreme Court... For
such sins, the Torah warns clearly that the Land will vomit out its
inhabitants... Will you [sit] closed up in your home and wait for
destruction, Heaven forbid?"

7.  Three Arabs, Two Jews, Injured in Gilad Farm Rock-Battle

By Ezra HaLevi

A second incident of violence has resulted from Arab olive-harvesters'
refusal to coordinate the harvest with the IDF and local Jewish residents.

At the Gilad Farm, in Samaria, a large group of Arabs from the village of
Farata approached the hilltop community - and then threw rocks at local
security officers who had arrived to find out what they were doing there.

Until now, Arabs have been harvesting in the area peacefully for two weeks,
having coordinated with the IDF and local residents.

The rock-throwing then led to a scuffle with local residents, injuring three
Arabs and two Jews. Among the latter was Itai Zar, a resident of Gilad Farm
and the brother of Gilad Zar, who was murdered by Arabs and for whom the
farm is named.

The left-wing Rabbis for Human Rights group, which encourages international
and Israeli volunteers to assist Arabs in harvesting trees adjacent to
Jewish communities, issued a communiqu? last week mentioning Itai Zar by
name.

The group has taken particular interest in antagonizing leaders in the
hilltop movement, which has established independent farming communities on
privately purchased land without help from the government-funded Yesha
Council. A communiqu? in March reported, “On Monday we planted trees with
the people of Jin Safut, close to the home of the Land Dealer Moshe Zar.”
Owner of the land on which the farm is built as well as other parcels of
land in the area, Zar is one of the legendary pioneer settlers of the
Shomron.

Police agreed with residents of Gilad Farm that the Arabs should have
coordinated the olive-picking as they had done in previous days. This, in
order to ensure that Arab olive-harvesters are not confused with terrorists,
who have launched attacks on the community in the past.

Last week, security personnel arrested a gang of Arabs on charges of cutting
down more than 150 pine trees belonging to the community of Beit Haggai,
just southwest of Hevron. In addition, Jewish farmers in Gush Etzion have
reported a spate of fires in recent months, which have burned wheat crops as
well as Jewish-owned trees.

Two weeks ago, an Arab man was apprehended infiltrating the hilltop
community of Mitzpeh Yitzhar in the Shomron. Residents spotted the man
attempting to set fire to one of the homes. He was arrested and claimed to
be on his way to harvest olives. He was informed by the IDF that he must
coordinate such activities in the future.

The Gilad Farm, know as Havat Gilad in Hebrew, was the site of one of the
first clashes between residents and security forces when it was ordered
demolished by the Barak government. It was subsequently rebuilt and is now
home to a dozen families.

8.  Iran's Ayatollah: Israel's Defeat is a 'New Chapter'

By Nissan Ratzlav-Katz &amp; Ezra HaLevi

Iran's Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenaei said on Tuesday that the recent Israeli
war in Lebanon opened a "new chapter" in the Middle East.

Khamenaei, referred to as the "Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution" by
Iran's official English-language news web site, was quoted as saying that
"victory in Lebanon and Israel's defeat in the war fronts opened a new
chapter in history of the Middle East."

Addressing worshipers in a sermon after the Eid El-Fitr holiday prayers at
Tehran's Mossalla Prayer Grounds, the Ayatollah said, "The policy the US
wished to implement in the Middle East has failed. ...Nations of Lebanon,
Iran, Palestine, other Arab states of the region, of Iraq and of other
Muslim nations should be watchful not to take any move to help the
treacherous plans of the US and Zionists. Whatever is regarded as a success
for the US and the Israeli regime is harmful to all Muslim states. Whatever
pleases the aggressors and plunderers in the region, would make all regional
nations unhappy and depressed."

In another message from the Iranian leadership to the Persian nation,
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called on Muslims to create a baby
boom to double his country's population. He said birth control policies
should be scrapped, and that women should work less so they can spend more
time on the "main mission" of raising children.

Ahmadinejad said, "I am against saying two children are enough. Our country
has a lot of capacity. It has the capacity for many children to grow in it.
It even has the capacity for 120 million people. Westerners have problems.
Because their population growth is negative they are worried and fear that
if our population increases, we will triumph over them."

Regarding Iran, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz stated that the
nation's nuclear program represents an existential threat to Israel. "We
must be prepared," Halutz told an industrial forum on Friday, because Tehran
is capable of using a nuclear weapon against the Jewish State.

Meanwhile, Knesset Member Muhammad Barakeh of the Arab-Communist Hadash
party declared that the government vote this week to bring Avigdor
Lieberman's nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party into the coalition is a
"declaration of war against Iran." Lieberman will be appointed to the newly
created position of minister for coordinating Israel's strategic response, a
role developed with an eye towards countering the Iranian nuclear threat.
