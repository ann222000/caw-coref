I have said it before and I will say it again, I hate grocery shopping. I
swear it is something I loath. My local grocery store is like countless
others but it's the fellow humans that frequent it that make me despise the
place.

Why do some people mindlessly push their carts about the isles oblivious to
fellow shoppers? They seem to push their cart as slow as possible down the
centre of the isle holding up half a dozen shoppers behind them. Then they
will stop and leave their cart in the middle of the isle to have a closer
look at something on a shelf, blocking the isle entirely.

This is where my compassion dissolves and I bang my cart into theirs
sending it cantering down the isle as I push past while muttering quite
audibly "God some people are rude".

However I must point out my shopping experience isn't always a bad one as
it does provide the occasional surreal and sometimes twilight zone-ish
events.

Now I know the majority of over weight people battle their weight and
cannot help being the size they are for a number of reasons but I wonder if
that applies to obese people. Do obese people have to be obese?

On this particular day I observed a very obese woman and her two children
sharing my shopping space. I am a compassionate man and felt sorry for the
little group, as it was obvious they attracted a lot of attention in way of
stares and whispers. Not only because of the size of this woman but her
children also where huge.

Going about my shopping task I moved from isle to isle gathering a cart
full of over priced commodities when I crossed paths with the obese woman
and her two children and was shocked and astonished at what I was
confronted with.

The mother was around my age maybe a little younger and when I say she was
obese, believe me she was huge. She wore dirty grey sweat pants that had
ripped at the seam at the back and came dangerously close to exposing her
expansive ass crack. Her breasts protruded from the front of her body like
she had two traffic cones under her dirty white T-shirt that had rips on
either side of the hem. On her feet where what I think were the remains of
a pair of pink ugg boots that trailed, frayed stitches and ripped pieces of
the shoes across the floor behind her as she waddled along.

Normally I would have uttered a tsk tsk and moved on but spread out across
the child carry basket of her shopping trolley was the remains of a hot
chicken. They had obviously bought a hot chicken from the deli and spread
it out to eat as they shopped. The woman's lips and four chins where
covered in chicken grease and her cheeks where spattered with it as well
and small specs of chicken flesh. She held in her hand not only the
chicken's leg but the thigh was attached also and she chewed flesh from it
while waving her free hand around telling her daughter what to put in the
cart from the shelves they passed.

I stopped in my tracks absolutely dumb founded as she looked my way grunted
slightly and gave her daughter another order pointing at something on the
shelf. The daughter was about 14 and was dressed in a huge dirty sundress
that could have shaded a small family car. He face was covered in chocolate
from the packet of cookies she was munching as she carried out her mothers
instructions.

The son was about 11 id say and obviously heavier then me, he stood and
watched, chewing on the other leg of the chicken as he scratched his butt.
His clothes, while not ripped and tattered where as dirty and dishevelled
as his female companions.

These people were human pigs.

I felt anger rise inside me and felt sorry for these kids. They were only
doing what their mother had taught them and unfortunately they hadn't
matured the awareness to understand the vulgar stupidity they displayed.

My gaze went back to the mother and my mouth was about to open to dispel a
torrent of abuse about offspring copying eating and hygiene habits from
their parents when I noticed grease from the chicken piece the woman held
had run down the entire length of her arm which glistened in the fake light
like a beacon saying "I am a stupid person and anything you say to me wont
make a shit of difference".

And then it occurred to me.

There is no way in hell this woman could get either hand around her huge
thighs and buttocks to wipe her arse after taking a dump. Ok ok I know the
strangest things pop into my head but I am deadly serious when I say this
women could not get a handful of toilet paper anywhere near her anus, it
was just physically impossible.

After studying the length of her arms and expanse of her rear end I pushed
my cart away from that scene with the firm belief, obese people cannot wipe
their own arses after taking a dump.

This now created more questions. If they can't get their hands near their
bums how do they wash them? I pondered this question and others as I
finished my shopping and was heading toward my car with a cart full of crap
and visions of obese people cleaning their butts with toilet brushes when
my train of thought was broken by raised voices.

It transpired that the obese woman had parked off centre in the space she
chose and her cars driver side was right on the white car space line, she
was now wedged between her car and a car now parked in the space beside
her. A small crowd had gathered to witness the spectacle as the large woman
screamed and struggled trying to free herself.

Misfortunes of normal people I wouldn't miss but misfortune of handicapped
people I have never considered to be an amusement, but was this woman
handicapped? Honestly, are this woman's handicaps self-inflicted?

I joined the growing crowd and realised this woman's predicament was
upsetting her greatly so I suggested we push the cars apart from the sides.
A few guys standing around joined me and we pushed the cars side ways
effectively spreading them to give her room to get out, and get out she
did.

As soon as the cars moved slightly on their springs her extreme exertion
made her shoot from her capture point like a champagne cork. I truly
expected to hear a large "POP" and "SPLAT" as she catapulted and hit the
ground like a waterbed bladder.

I wanted to laugh uncontrollably but I knew that wasn't the right thing to
do so I looked on with the best look of concern as I could muster. It
wasn't easy as I was already giggling on the inside. Ok I'm not proud of it
but shit it was funny.

Her kids helped her to her feet and she stood screaming "some people
shouldn't drive cars if they can't park them properly"

"Yes" I said walking past her toward my car "And some people should learn
the importance of wiping their butts after taking a shit"

Yuck, that can't be as efficient as toilet paper. Then again, it's their

Kudos to them if they can even find it in all those rolls. Did I say
that? A nurse I know told me about a really obese woman who during an
exam, they found a chewing gum wrapper in her butt crack. Perhaps she
was saving it. I forgot to ask if she was chewing gum. I suppose it
isn't really all that funny, but I sort of agree it is. It is somehow
different to me if someone had arthritis or was missing limbs, etc.
That's not funny, but really fat people make me jolly. No wait, it's
fat people who are jolly, I think.

I wonder how they tie their shoes, too, or trim their toenails without
throwing up. dkw

&gt; Obese people dont usually wipe their butts.  Their butt is so far from
&gt; their hands that they usually can not reach it.  However, there is a
&gt; special device that can be purchased for a large sum of money.  Its
&gt; installed in their bathroom and has a mechanical arm that is manually
&gt; directed to the butt hole via a joystick.  A camera shows the user the
&gt; position of this arm on a monitor, and the user must operate the
&gt; joystick to get the paper in position and wipe.  It requires a special
&gt; toilet paper which comes in large rolls.  Each sheet on this roll is 4
&gt; x 6 feet in size to accomodate the super large assholes in these obese
&gt; human swine.

I remember telling a colleague that he might want to use my cologne as
he had to evaluate for several hours the worst -- absolutely the worst
-- smelling client I had ever encountered. (It wasn't mine -- it was
his.)

It turned out that this very obese client hadn't wipe himself is 3
months and said he didn't care.

If smells alone could kill, my colleague (and I) would have been dead.

Yours,

Caleb

You really should hope to die young. Many problems come
with old age that are not self inflicted such as weight
gain, drug addition and mental cases.

On the other hand, maybe the Roman army was made up of obese soldiers
because their method of wiping their ass with a sponge on a stick
certainly works for obese people. Maybe the French had obese people
in mind when the invented the bidet (if they did). Maybe just letting
the shit cake up forms a protective crust. Cave men survived this
problem and apparently went on to found GEICO didn't they.

weight gain would be self inflicted even in old age i.e. you can control

I used to help someone I referred to as the 700 lb. man.  Turned out
he weighed only 540 -- I spotted him a human being, evidently.

But I found out two things:

1.  He pissed by docking his penis to a length of 2 inch pvc pipe he
would drop into the toilet.

2.  He wrapped newspaper around a plastic spatula to wipe his but.

He did crack a toilet once.

I also had to take him to the emergency room because he had a septic
sore on his side.  He thought it was a bug bite and he scratched it
with, yes, the shit spatula.

So not only did he scratch the shit out of himself, he scratched it
into himself.

He's dead now.  He tried to commit suicide.  It's actually a funny
story.

The drugs didn't work.  The face plant two days later did.

&gt; You really should hope to die young. Many problems come

&gt; gain, drug addition and mental cases.

Actually, a lot of mental problems, such as depression and schizofrenia
that young people (30 or less) suffer from is abated at age 40 or so due
to changes in cerebral chemistry.

&gt; On the other hand, maybe the Roman army was made up of obese soldiers
&gt; because their method of wiping their ass with a sponge on a stick
&gt; certainly works for obese people. Maybe the French had obese people
&gt; in mind when the invented the bidet (if they did). Maybe just letting
&gt; the shit cake up forms a protective crust. Cave men survived this
&gt; problem and apparently went on to found GEICO didn't they.

Obese people can't hunt, so I doubt a caveman would survive obesity,
even i that was a problem they had way back when.

Sure Peter, I lot of people piss in the sink. Can you think of anything else
that sets you apart? Think really hard now. Do you maybe have a child porn
collection?  Do you fantasize about little boys perhaps? Ok, now we are
getting there . . .maybe  a pedophile who pisses in the sink?? Do I have it
right? Be honest now!

Nope.

If you wanted to be nasty, you would suggest that I dream about wiping
the butts of fat people.

I don't think they do. They eke out

Since most of you will never see me, I will admit that this amplebrush
makes a lot of sense.  I aint obese and have no problem using my
beloved Charmin, but I may just look into getting me one of these
ample thingies.  BTW, Charmin aint inexpensive, and a one time
purchase of 20 bucks makes a lot of sense, in my humble opinion.
