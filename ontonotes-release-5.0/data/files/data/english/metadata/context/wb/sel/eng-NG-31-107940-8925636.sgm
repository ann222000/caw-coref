================

&quot;I spoke with Steve Knopp, owner of Pponk http://www.pponk.com/ this morning.
He commented that business was a bit slow and he had two complete engines
sitting on the floor waiting for any customer that wishes an exchange engine.
Now might be a good time to nab one.&quot;

&quot;As an aside, I asked why business was slow for him. He replied that nearby
Paine Field, a rather large G.A. airport, http://www.painefield.com/ had
reported that take-offs and landings were down 35% compared to the previous
year. If guys aren't flying much they don't need new engines. Anyway, that is
his thinking.&quot;

=================

I took my airplane to Teledyne Continental's shop this morning to have the
prop dynamically balanced.  When I called them yesterday to ask when they
could get to it, the foreman told me &quot;Bring it on in; we don't have much
going on.&quot;

I seldom go to my local airport, just to watch planes taking off and
landing, anymore - there's too little activity. Sad.

Loading that data into Excel and running a yearly total really shows
that the supply is been coming down.

Dang!!!! I didn't catch that. How simple. I am ashamed that I didn't see
that. We all need to start flying more to bring up the demand....
