&quot;Getting dark,&quot; said the owl, settling on a branch above the rabbit.  &quot;Is
this a good place to rest until dawn?&quot;

&quot;It is dawn,&quot; the rabbit replied, &quot; the sun is rising: you have it the wrong
way round.&quot;

&quot;To you perhaps; such things, indeed all 'things', are relative.  Anyhow, I
am the dawn.&quot;

&quot;If you think so&quot;, replied the rabbit politely.  &quot;Yes, the place is
excellent, peaceful, and the grass is delicious.&quot;

&quot;Grass is not my affair in relativity,&quot; remarked the owl, &quot;but I seek peace
in order to BE.  Any predatory phenomena about?&quot;

&quot;Rarely,&quot; replied the rabbit, &quot; the odd biped, but I go to earth, and they
don't eat owls.&quot;

&quot;Very well, I will rest here,&quot; said the owl, &quot;anyway I like rabbits.&quot;

&quot;I am flattered,&quot; replied the rabbit, &quot;and you are welcome.&quot;

Later.

The rabbit, looking up, said to the owl, while ingesting several inches of
grass, &quot;I often wonder why you open your eyes when it's dark and keep them
closed when it's light?&quot;

&quot;When I shine,&quot; replied the owl, &quot;there is no darkness, for darkness is only
absence of light, and then I observe you perpetually eating whatever the
earth brings forth; when I cease to shine nothing whatever can appear.&quot;

&quot;Then our worlds must be different?&quot; suggested the rabbit.

&quot;There are no worlds,&quot; snapped the owl, with a click of his beak, &quot;other
than what appears when I shine.&quot;

&quot;And what appears when the sun shines?&quot; suggested the rabbit.

&quot;I am the sun,&quot; concluded the owl; &quot;what you think you see is only a
reflection in your split-mind.&quot;

&quot;Is that so indeed?&quot; replied the rabbit, twitching her nose dubiously.
&quot;Then why do you and the sun not shine at the same time?&quot;

&quot;I am 'time',&quot; added the owl, &quot;and all 'time' is my time.  Moreover at this
'time' I am beginning to feel hungry.&quot;

&quot;All right, all right,&quot; sighed the rabbit - as she dived hastily into her
burrow.

Roby,

Thanks for offering this delightful piece. I love it! WWW presents
both characters in a sympathetic way. In response, I'll hazard some
musings.

First, the characters: rabbits vs. owls.  Rabbits are vegetarian and
live in organized society, owls are silent-flying nocturnal birds of
prey, usually solitary.

Rabbits commonly symbolize fertility and rebirth and in folklore often
appear as tricksters, using their cunning to outwit their enemies. To
Buddhists the hare is a symbol of self-sacrifice having thrown itself
into a fire to feed the Buddha when he was starving. In reward he was
given a new home in the moon.

Interestingly, rabbits are incapable of vomiting because of their
digestive system. In fact, they reingest their own droppings to fully
digest their food and extract all the nutrients.

For us owls commonly symbolize wisdom, however, in Indian culture,
interestingly, it is commonly used to refer to stupidity. Also in
India a white owl is considered a companion of Lakshmi, the goddess of
wealth, and therefore a harbinger of prosperity. Hinduism also uses
the owl as a symbol of cosmic spirituality.

Whooooo knows what WWW had in mind when he composed this piece!

The rabbit is polite and accommodating, the owl is supercilious and
curt even though he's seeking the rabbit's advice.

Even though he's pedestrian, the rabbit is not stupid because he's
asking questions and reasoning.  The only questions the owl has are
about whether it's safe to sit in that spot ans whether anything will
prey on him while he sits there. (Existence in terms of hunting for
prey?)  The owl comes up with all kinds of enigmatic answers to the
rabbit's reasoned questions, but do those answers acutally satisfy the
rabbit?

Even though the owl professes to be so aloof and remote from the
rabbit's world, he's still very concerned about the relative world...
The owl comes across to me as having the same split-mind that he says
is responsible for the rabbits's lack of understanding: he claims to
be universal but his ACTUAL concerns are all about FOOD: 1) &quot;Any
predatory phenomena about?&quot;  2) &quot;I observe you perpetually eating
whatever the earth brings forth.&quot; 3) &quot;I am beginning to feel hungry.&quot;
The great Indian sage, Shankaracharya said: &quot;There are many who go
with matted locks, many who have clean shaven heads, many whose hairs
have been plucked out; some are clothed in saffron, yet others in
various colors -- all just for a livelihood. Seeing truth revealed
before them, still the foolish ones see it not.&quot;  In one way I see the
juxtaposition of rabbit and owl as symbolising laity and sangha, and
on the other, both as depcting human split-mind. Whichever, owl/sangha
needs rabbit/laity for his comfort and survival.

On the other hand, it can be seen as calling reason into question.

A many-faceted piece. It's always daytime somewhere, we originated
with the sun and live off the sun's energy in the solar system, but
owl tells us the sun is created by our own thinking...

Looking forward to reading other people's ideas on this piece,

Hi Sheila!
Your informative and multifaceted comment is fun itself.
Here are some quotes from WWW that shed light on his perspective.
You can see Buddhist, Tao, and Advaita influences.

*****
Why are you unhappy?
Because 99.9 per cent
Of everything you think,
And of everything you do,
Is for yourself -
And there isn't one.
* * *
Truth is that which lies in a dimension beyond the reach of thought.
****
Whole-mind has no 'thoughts', thoughts are split-mind.
*****
For Void is Mind Itself, and Mind Itself is Void.
***
It is less what one is that should matter, than what one is not.
* * *
It is not for us to search but to remain still, to achieve Immobility not
Action.
* * *
There is no becoming. ALL IS.
***
What do you have to do?
Pack your bags,
Go to the station without them,
Catch the train,
And leave your self behind.
***

Metta,
R

Sheila,

I enjoyed your post immensely.  You offered us interesting angles of the
main characters with great gravitas.  Roby's weekend dharma melds many
traditions into one profound source.  WWW has boiled down non-dualistic
wisdom into a gripping and clear text accessible to all who ponder its
truths.  The fun starts because &quot;who knows what WWW had in mind when he
composed this piece&quot;, as you mentioned.

The owl has gone beyond the notion of relative happiness implied in letting
things be (&quot;I am time and all time is my time&quot;).  The owl's concern is not
about mere food alone but &quot;NOURISHMENT&quot; (&quot;Grass is not my affair in
relative, but I seek peace in order to BE&quot;).  When we are thinking, our
minds are different.  When we cut off all attachment to thinking, then your
mind and my mind are the same (&quot;There are no worlds other than what appears
when I shine&quot;.)

WWW was obviously having some fun while writing this book. I could only sum
it up by sharing this reflections from Chuang Tzu's Perfect Joy:

Heaven does nothing: its non-doing is its serenity.
Earth does nothing: its non-doing is its rest.
From the union of these two non-doings
All actions proceed,
All things are made.
How vast, how invisible
This coming-to-be!
All things come from nowhere!
How vast, how invisible
No way to explain it!
All beings in their perfection
Are born of non-doing.
Hence it is said:
&quot;Heaven and earth do nothing
Yet there is nothing they do not do.&quot;
Where is the man who can attain
To this non-doing?

Guojun Fashi always reminds me that wisdom and laughter go hand in hand.
When we cease to analyze and conceptualize reality, all that remains is
reality itself.

Hi, Victor:

From your response to an e-mail to &quot;Weekend Dharma&quot;...

&quot;Guojun Fashi always reminds me that wisdom and laughter go hand in hand.
When we cease to analyze and conceptualize reality, all that remains is
reality itself. &quot;

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.  :o)

It really made me ponder the concept of reality....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes in life, one realizes that &quot;it (life) is what it is&quot; and one
may have trouble accepting it.  Maybe it's because the acceptance of what is
real and what is desired in mind do not agree.  When one puts time and
effort into a goal that isn't accomplished, it's frustrating when true
reality hits.  If the outcome is positive, one embraces and treasures it
because it was pleasant and successful.  However, there are always risks
when taking a leap into a new adventure, project, job, interest, etc..
There's a chance that the results may also be negative.  The occurrence of
this may lead to thoughts of failure, the undesirable will of moving forward
or the feeling that this is just another life experience.

Life happens...one should take the good, the bad, the ugly and learn to deal
with the effects that accompanies it.  The idea that one should receive news
and results, whether it is good or bad, as a neutral feeling is difficult to
comprehend.  The emotional attachment one has already developed surprisingly
(and not asked for) seems to supersede and empower everything else that came
along the way.  It probably takes time, practice, learning experiences, (and
should I include counting the breath?) to return to the present moment and
accept what reality truly is. The moment one wakes up, opens its eyes and is
aware of what's real is the moment of the &quot;acceptance of life&quot;.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&quot;*The purpose of life, after all, is to live it,
to taste experience to the utmost,
to reach out eagerly and without fear
for newer and richer experience*.&quot;
~Eleanor Roosevelt

&quot;*Life can be found only in the present moment. The*
*past is gone, the future is not yet here, and if we do*
*not go back to ourselves in the present moment, we*
*cannot be in touch with life.*&quot;
~Thich Nhat Hanh

In serenity,

Phung

&gt; WWW was obviously having some fun while writing this book. I could only
&gt; sum it up by sharing this reflections from Chuang Tzu's Perfect Joy:

&gt; Heaven does nothing: its non-doing is its serenity.
&gt; Earth does nothing: its non-doing is its rest.
&gt; From the union of these two non-doings
&gt; All actions proceed,
&gt; All things are made.
&gt; How vast, how invisible
&gt; This coming-to-be!
&gt; All things come from nowhere!
&gt; How vast, how invisible
&gt; No way to explain it!
&gt; All beings in their perfection
&gt; Are born of non-doing.
&gt; Hence it is said:
&gt; &quot;Heaven and earth do nothing
&gt; Yet there is nothing they do not do.&quot;
&gt; Where is the man who can attain
&gt; To this non-doing?

&gt; Guojun Fashi always reminds me that wisdom and laughter go hand in hand.
&gt; When we cease to analyze and conceptualize reality, all that remains is

&gt; &gt; Roby,

&gt; &gt; Thanks for offering this delightful piece. I love it! WWW presents
&gt; &gt; both characters in a sympathetic way. In response, I'll hazard some
&gt; &gt; musings.

&gt; &gt; First, the characters: rabbits vs. owls.  Rabbits are vegetarian and
&gt; &gt; live in organized society, owls are silent-flying nocturnal birds of
&gt; &gt; prey, usually solitary.

&gt; &gt; Rabbits commonly symbolize fertility and rebirth and in folklore often
&gt; &gt; appear as tricksters, using their cunning to outwit their enemies. To
&gt; &gt; Buddhists the hare is a symbol of self-sacrifice having thrown itself
&gt; &gt; into a fire to feed the Buddha when he was starving. In reward he was
&gt; &gt; given a new home in the moon.

&gt; &gt; Interestingly, rabbits are incapable of vomiting because of their
&gt; &gt; digestive system. In fact, they reingest their own droppings to fully
&gt; &gt; digest their food and extract all the nutrients.

&gt; &gt; For us owls commonly symbolize wisdom, however, in Indian culture,
&gt; &gt; interestingly, it is commonly used to refer to stupidity. Also in
&gt; &gt; India a white owl is considered a companion of Lakshmi, the goddess of
&gt; &gt; wealth, and therefore a harbinger of prosperity. Hinduism also uses
&gt; &gt; the owl as a symbol of cosmic spirituality.

&gt; &gt; Whooooo knows what WWW had in mind when he composed this piece!

&gt; &gt; The rabbit is polite and accommodating, the owl is supercilious and
&gt; &gt; curt even though he's seeking the rabbit's advice.

&gt; &gt; Even though he's pedestrian, the rabbit is not stupid because he's
&gt; &gt; asking questions and reasoning.  The only questions the owl has are
&gt; &gt; about whether it's safe to sit in that spot ans whether anything will
&gt; &gt; prey on him while he sits there. (Existence in terms of hunting for
&gt; &gt; prey?)  The owl comes up with all kinds of enigmatic answers to the
&gt; &gt; rabbit's reasoned questions, but do those answers acutally satisfy the
&gt; &gt; rabbit?

&gt; &gt; Even though the owl professes to be so aloof and remote from the
&gt; &gt; rabbit's world, he's still very concerned about the relative world...
&gt; &gt; The owl comes across to me as having the same split-mind that he says
&gt; &gt; is responsible for the rabbits's lack of understanding: he claims to
&gt; &gt; be universal but his ACTUAL concerns are all about FOOD: 1) &quot;Any
&gt; &gt; predatory phenomena about?&quot;  2) &quot;I observe you perpetually eating
&gt; &gt; whatever the earth brings forth.&quot; 3) &quot;I am beginning to feel hungry.&quot;
&gt; &gt; The great Indian sage, Shankaracharya said: &quot;There are many who go
&gt; &gt; with matted locks, many who have clean shaven heads, many whose hairs
&gt; &gt; have been plucked out; some are clothed in saffron, yet others in
&gt; &gt; various colors -- all just for a livelihood. Seeing truth revealed
&gt; &gt; before them, still the foolish ones see it not.&quot;  In one way I see the
&gt; &gt; juxtaposition of rabbit and owl as symbolising laity and sangha, and
&gt; &gt; on the other, both as depcting human split-mind. Whichever, owl/sangha
&gt; &gt; needs rabbit/laity for his comfort and survival.

&gt; &gt; On the other hand, it can be seen as calling reason into question.

&gt; &gt; A many-faceted piece. It's always daytime somewhere, we originated
&gt; &gt; with the sun and live off the sun's energy in the solar system, but
&gt; &gt; owl tells us the sun is created by our own thinking...

&gt; &gt; Looking forward to reading other people's ideas on this piece,
&gt; &gt; Metta,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It is dawn,&quot; the rabbit replied, &quot; the sun is rising: you have it the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;To you perhaps; such things, indeed all 'things', are

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;If you think so&quot;, replied the rabbit politely.  &quot;Yes, the place is
&gt; &gt; &gt; excellent, peaceful, and the grass is delicious.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Grass is not my affair in relativity,&quot; remarked the owl, &quot;but I seek
&gt; &gt; peace
&gt; &gt; &gt; in order to BE.  Any predatory phenomena about?&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Rarely,&quot; replied the rabbit, &quot; the odd biped, but I go to earth, and

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Very well, I will rest here,&quot; said the owl, &quot;anyway I like rabbits.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I am flattered,&quot; replied the rabbit, &quot;and you are welcome.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Later.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The rabbit, looking up, said to the owl, while ingesting several
&gt; &gt; inches of
&gt; &gt; &gt; grass, &quot;I often wonder why you open your eyes when it's dark and keep
&gt; &gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt; closed when it's light?&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;When I shine,&quot; replied the owl, &quot;there is no darkness, for darkness
&gt; &gt; is only
&gt; &gt; &gt; absence of light, and then I observe you perpetually eating whatever
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; earth brings forth; when I cease to shine nothing whatever can
&gt; &gt; appear.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Then our worlds must be different?&quot; suggested the rabbit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;There are no worlds,&quot; snapped the owl, with a click of his beak,
&gt; &gt; &quot;other
&gt; &gt; &gt; than what appears when I shine.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;And what appears when the sun shines?&quot; suggested the rabbit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I am the sun,&quot; concluded the owl; &quot;what you think you see is only a
&gt; &gt; &gt; reflection in your split-mind.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Is that so indeed?&quot; replied the rabbit, twitching her nose dubiously.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Then why do you and the sun not shine at the same time?&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I am 'time',&quot; added the owl, &quot;and all 'time' is my time.  Moreover at
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'time' I am beginning to feel hungry.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;All right, all right,&quot; sighed the rabbit - as she dived hastily into
&gt; &gt; her
&gt; &gt; &gt; burrow.

Hi, Victor:

From your response to an e-mail to &quot;Weekend Dharma&quot;...

&quot;Guojun Fashi always reminds me that wisdom and laughter go hand in hand.
When we cease to analyze and conceptualize reality, all that remains is
reality itself. &quot;

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.  :o)

It really made me ponder the concept of reality....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes in life, one realizes that &quot;it (life) is what it is&quot; and one may
have trouble accepting it.  Maybe it's because the acceptance of what is
real and what is desired in mind do not agree.  When one puts time and
effort into a goal that isn't accomplished, it's frustrating when true
reality hits.  If the outcome is positive, one embraces and treasures it
because it was pleasant and successful.  However, there are always risks
when taking a leap into a new adventure, project, job, interest, etc..
There's a chance that the results may also be negative.  The occurrence of
this may lead to thoughts of failure, the undesirable will of moving forward
or the feeling that this is just another life experience.

Life happens...one should take the good, the bad, the ugly and learn to deal
with the effects that accompanies it.  The idea that one should receive news
and results, whether it is good or bad, as a neutral feeling is difficult to
comprehend.  The emotional attachment one has already developed surprisingly
(and not asked for) seems to supersede and empower everything else that came
along the way.  It probably takes time, practice, learning experiences, (and
should I include counting the breath?) to return to the present moment and
accept what reality truly is. The moment one wakes up, opens its eyes and is
aware of what's real is the moment of the &quot;acceptance of life&quot;.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&quot;The purpose of life, after all, is to live it,
to taste experience to the utmost,
to reach out eagerly and without fear
for newer and richer experience.&quot;
~Eleanor Roosevelt

&quot;Life can be found only in the present moment. The

past is gone, the future is not yet here, and if we do

not go back to ourselves in the present moment, we

cannot be in touch with life.&quot;

~Thich Nhat Hanh

In serenity,

Phung

Sheila,

I enjoyed your post immensely.  You offered us interesting angles of the
main characters with great gravitas.  Roby's weekend dharma melds many
traditions into one profound source.  WWW has boiled down non-dualistic
wisdom into a gripping and clear text accessible to all who ponder its
truths.  The fun starts because &quot;who knows what WWW had in mind when he
composed this piece&quot;, as you mentioned.

The owl has gone beyond the notion of relative happiness implied in letting
things be (&quot;I am time and all time is my time&quot;).  The owl's concern is not
about mere food alone but &quot;NOURISHMENT&quot; ( &quot;Grass is not my affair in
relative, but I seek peace in order to BE&quot;).  When we are thinking, our
minds are different.  When we cut off all attachment to thinking, then your
mind and my mind are the same ( &quot;There are no worlds other than what appears
when I shine&quot;.)
