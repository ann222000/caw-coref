What is Epistemology?

Here's a defition:
&quot;Epistemology: The branch of philosophy that studies the nature of
knowledge, its presuppositions and foundations, and its extent and
validity.&quot;

Etymological Roots:
&quot;Greek epistm, knowledge (from epistasthai, epist-, to understand :
epi-, epi- + histasthai, middle voice of histanai, to place, determine;
see st- in Indo-European Roots) + -logy.&quot;

Good to see that you're not an absolute cynic, goozelfotz. It's just one
definition out of a number of definitions. I posted this one because
itraises a number of questions, such as:
1. What is knowledge? Can one person claim or believe to have specific
knowledge, while someone else claims or believes something else or even the
direct opposite?
2. What are the foundations and presuppositions of knowledge? Can we
preassume that knowledge exists and can be obtained and exchanged? If so,
how can one obtain knowledge? What methodologies are (un)acceptable or
(in)appropriate when gaining, changing and exchanging knowledge?
3. What is the extent of knowledge? What is the difference between
information, impressions, feelings, predictions and knowledge? What is the
difference between scientific knowledge and other knowledge (if such
knowledge exists in the first place)?
4. How valid is knowledge and how can such validity be assessed? What if
some knowledge is inconsistent with some other knowledge? Should we seek
ways to reconcile differences?
5. Finally, what is the width of epistemology? Is epistemology restricted
to the study of knowledge, or does it also cover issues like conscience,
belief, logic, principles, values, science, feelings and information? If
epistemology is limited, does this limit its philosophical conclusions?

I am agnostic but here is a realy cute riddle; What is greater than
god,more evil than the devil and if you eat it you die?

Here is another: You are at the fork of two
roads.One goes to the village where the villagers speak only truth the
other to where they only speak lies.You may only ask the villager
standing at the fork one question.What do you ask to find the village
of truth?

How could you possibly have blasphemed? Your interesting questions only
hint at your point of view and even your single declaritive statement
raises another question. When you say that &quot;we 'almost always'
describe new knowledge in terms of the old knowledge...&quot;, are you
implying that there are a priori exceptions?
It seems to me (as a 'plain man) that to 'know what knowledge is' is an
expression so involuted that it is meaningless. Limitations of language
requires that we accept some consensus on the approximation
of'knowledge'. This consensus,of course, must be thrown back into the
hopper and 'continuosly' renewed on the basis of logic!
Some of your and Sam's questions would be moot in light of such a
consensus, whilst others could be addressed much more meaningfully.

pfizer the answer to the first riddle is nothing, and one question that
would work for the second(and there should be more, and all will
require the villager to self-reference)is
which road leads to the town you live in? the liar would have to send
you down the road that leads to the village where the villagers speak
only truth since that is not where he lives and he is obliged to lie
and the truthsayer would also have to send you down the road that leads
to the village where the villagers speak only the truth since that is
where he lives and he is obliged to speak only the truth

Why do these words nesicarrily mean absolute? Not all languages have

Are we taught to think of them as absolutes by science, religion, or
social norms? For me, there is no absolute Truth with a capital

truth as a process of continual coming to know......

that is not a waste of time. search for a fairy tale Truth that Is and

say that in time the process of aquiring new truth may not lead us to
find that there is a Truth that never wavers.....even saying that there
is no such thing as an absolute Truth is a statement of absolute
belief, and is just as grounded as saying that there are absolute
Truths......

just some thoughts.....no answers.

I also would like to konw how you make a difference between objective
and subjuctive awareness?
According to Quantum Physics it happens. even though it seems to berake
the laws of cause and effect, though I have to admit that quantum
effects outside the atom loose most of their meanings.
there is a classic experiment to show a similar paradox:
suppost you have a source of electrons and two detectors. suppost the
distance between these detectors is astronomical as well as the
distanceto the source (wich is the same for both detectors)
Suppose now that the source sends elctrons at random to each detector.
for an observer who can only see the detectors, how is it possible for
one detector to know that the other detector doesn´t have an electron
when it gets one itself? specially if there is no tiem for it to
receive information? Does this mean that there could be a possibility
where two electrons could reach the detectors simultaneously?

exactly...if you abosolutely believe that ....blah blah(insert anything
here) then you do in fact believe in absolutes. you made my point for
me. if you say you do not believe in absolutes then you must admit the
possibility that there might be such as thing as an absolute.

i think of it in terms of probability. i am 99% sure there is no such
thing as an absolute. but there is always that 1% chance that there
could be an absolute that i am not currently aware of.

this isn't knowledge persay, it is probability. and it is what alot of
human science and understanding is based on. Things with a higher
probability are labeled &quot;true&quot; and things with a lower probability are
labeled &quot;false&quot;. You need only to prove that the affirmitive is more
likely, not that it is absolute.

What this means is that an assertion is not nesicarrily &quot;untrue&quot;
because someone can provide a single instance to the contrary.....

You are &quot;absolutely correct &quot; that, if we have a 99 % probability
that there is no absolute certainty, there remains a 1 %
probability that there is some absolute certainty of which you are
unaware. However you are aware of the 99% probability! What is your
lifestyle bet?
A single instance to the contrary does establish that an absolute
assertion is &quot;untrue&quot;. It does not establish that a 99% correct
assertion is never true.

Yes. For example, we cannot know the momentum and position of an object

All knowledge, in the final analysis is subjective. There is no form of

because your eyes sense the light that comes off it, and your skin
senses the electrostatic potential of its molecules when you touch it

Science is an effort to consistently explain the barrage of sensory
information of experience and experiment (aka phenomenon) by assuming a
structure (aka physical reality / neumenon) underlying it. It is an
assumption, and present theories of physics are grappling with this
bedrock assumption. We believe there must be such a reality 'out there'
because our daily life experiences give us an unmistakable sense of it
-- however, it could entirely be prejudice to assume objective reality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, it invariably does. Phenomenon implies observation. Observation
implies perturbing the system you are trying to measure (by shining it
with light / setting up a magnetic field to see its response in it).
Hence, observation implicitly disturbs the system (assuming I can use
this word) we are trying to observe. Such is the nature of phenomena.

The Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is a manifestation of this
principle.

passive observation does not. You are so wrapped up in the theoretical

I suppose what you mean by active observation is shining light (or
something) onto an object and observing the photons that bounce off it.
What you mean by passive observation is simply observing whatever comes
off the object (photons etc).

In our present, most consistent framework of physics, both these kind
of observations perturb the system. The way a passive observation
perturbs a system is by collapsing the photon that hits your eye out
from a quantum superposition of this photon travelling in all possible
directions. (You remarked that you don't remember what state-vector
reduction is in quantum mechanics: It is precisely this process. That
of collapsing the wavefunction of an object into one specific
eigenvalue of whatever property you are measuring out of a linear
superposition of all eigenvalues. This is the process of bringing into
'actuality' one of the many ghostly 'possibilities' that may be thought
to co-exist until observation.)

Alright, once you collapse the photon into actuality by observing it,
the star that emitted it is presumably jolted back (a million years in
the past) ever so slightly to effect momentum conservation.

As for common sense, it is the sum of all prejudices about nature we
accumulate by the age of 18.

hmmm...interesting point.

science is based on the assumption that empirical methods, objective
observation, and reasoning can be used to asses the validty of any
truth claim. while epistemology also aims at assesing the validity of
truth claims, it does tout a particualr method as the only way of doing
so. rather, it is, in my understanding, aimed at assesing the
validity of the method, or at discovering which method(s) are best
suited for that task, and under what conditions.

souvik has given some good examples from quantum physics, but i was
thinking of things from a bit of a different angle.

take for example, when you want to gain knowledge about something like
oh human behavior or moods. the act of observing the behavior of the
individuals is bound to effect the behavior of the individual themself.
you can put people in rooms with two way mirrors, but they still are
not in their normal or natural environment, so they may behave
differently due to any number of factors introduced by the observation
itself. you can try to observe people in their natural setting, but
there is only so much that you will be able to observe objectively.
eventually, you reach the point when you must ask the individual to
provide a report of their experience. &quot;how did it make you feel when
blah blah&quot; on a scale of 1 to 10. at this point you are only
obtaining subjective information. there is no way to objectively
observe how an indivual feels or interprets the world.

this is just one example, but the point is that there are some
phenomena which you cannot gain knowledge of through objective
observation alone. at some point you must rely on the subjective.
and this is not nesicarrily a bad thing. it doesn't make the
information or knowledge automatically &quot;untrue&quot; or &quot;true&quot; because it is
obtained from the subjective. But, there is some further scrutinity,
it seems that is applied in this case. though what that scrutinity is,
i am not sure. it seems that every individual has different parameters
for truth at this point, regardless of any claims of &quot;common sense&quot;.
in my expereince, things that i, as an individual, take for &quot;common
sense&quot; or obviously true, are not so common afterall. simple things
to me, are not so simple to everyone. it seems to depend on the
individual, their experience, and to some extent, their intelligence.

it is this quandry that presents the scientific only method of gaining
knowledge with a problem to be solved. how do you evaluate the truth
value of a claim when you cannot objectively observe the circumstances
from which the truth claim is derrived?

What I meant is, the notion of 'obvious from common sense' is derived
from years of experience with the operations of Nature *at the scale of
daily life*. Any first course in relativity (the scale of the very
large and very fast) or quantum theory (the scale of the very small)
will have you going: &quot;C'mon, its common sense that time cannot go
faster here and slower there!&quot; etc. In fact, if it didn't make you say
that, I would doubt if you truly understood it. When we get down to
studying the fundamental aspects of Nature: 'How does it really work?
How does information flow in Nature?', we need to set aside our
pre-conceived notions from daily life because they are simply
inapplicable.

I am not arguing about the superiority or inferiority of 'common sense'
as it is, because the evolution of 'common sense' has ensured the
survival of our species for 11 million years. However, it is an
unreliable guide for probing the fundamental aspects of Nature because
Nature is not only stranger than you imagine, it is stranger than you
*can* imagine!

I know that &quot;prejudices&quot; is in common usage in this regard, but it
really smacks of elitism. Why not use &quot;approximations&quot; when
'characterizing' the very useful concepts that constitute the greater
part of a plain man's common sense?.

I would appreciate your help in clarifying my perception of the
relationship between observation/actuality. If photons are not
'observed' by impinging on the retina of a sentient entity, but impinge
on the mass of another star, are they then also &quot;collapsed into
actuality&quot;? If they do not 'impinge' on anything' do these photons
'actualy' not exist in their own right? Given that emission involves
an interaction between the photon and its source why is a subsequent
interaction necessary for actualization of that proton?

Those are the very questions that modern quantum mechanics leaves to
interpretation. To my knowledge, there are five or six independent and
self-consistent interpretations of quantum theory, and they will answer
your questions differently.

1. The Copenhagen Interpretation (Initiated by Neils Bohr, and possibly
the most down to earth interpretation physicists stick to.): The
photons become actual only when you record them. If you input the fact
that photons become actual when *you* record them, theory and
experiment will agree from *your* point of view.

You asked -- What if the photon impinged on a star instead of your
retina?
Copenhagen: The star and the photon remain entangled in a superposition
of 'photon went elsewhere and did not hit star' &amp; 'photon hit star'
from *your point of view*.

Sentience is not a necessity for this collapse. What is necessary is a
measuring entity -- and the world is described and explained from the
point of view of this entity. (In this weird sense, quantum theory is a
subjective theory of the world.)

I am sure you will find seemingly different explanations of this
Copenhagen interpretation if you look up Wiki based on momenta and
position etc -- this would be the strict Copenhagen interpretation of
the photon situation.

2. The Many Universe Interpretation: The universe splits up into myriad
universes when the photon was emitted by star A. In some of these
universes, they hit star B. In some of them, they hit your retina.
(Very disturbingly uneconomic on universes, and personally not my
favourite because photons are known to interfere with non-actualised
copies of themselves. But in this picture, each non-actualised copy
exists in a separate universe.)

3. The Consciousness Hypothesis from Eugene Wigner: Consciousness and
sentience condenses reality out of ghostly superpositions.

4. Objective Reduction:

a) By Environment Induced Decoherence: That nature actualises the
photon out of this superposition mess by interaction with the
environment in which the photon propagates. So, photon's trajectory is
sort of all flailing out in creepy superpositions if there's absolutely
nothing in the space it is propagating -- no gas, no stars, no retinae.
However, a distribution of matter in its environment induces it to
decohere into actuality. (I've been favouring this one lately as an
offshoot of my work.) This is also what Feynman hints at in his Feynman
Volume III.

b) By gravity or by some fundamentally new physical law: Trust
Penrose to come with shit like this. When the difference in the
stress-energy tensor (the energy and momentum of a photon that causes
dents in spacetime) of the non-actualised photon's trajectory crosses a
critical value, some unknown process snaps it out of superposition. I
almost believed this for a while, but now don't because when I do the
math, I land into absurdities like: The sum of the probabilities of all
the non-actualised photons is not equal to one.

Anyway, I hope this gives you a flavour of the mess we're in. I feel
the resolution of this issue will probably come from ironing out the
epistemology underlying the observer / observed dichotomy.

silly interpretation. Come to think of it, QM has become a religion to

A video camera can be used to measure and record the position of an
object on film. From the point of view of the video camera (if there is
such a thing :-)), the world will make sense with quantum mechanics.

However, from a point of view of a human, the (camera film records
particle here + particle here) remains in a linear superposition with
(the camera film records particle there + particle there) until he
observes the piece of film.

I hope you see the 'subjective weirdness' involved in this description.
Think up some gedankens with systems being measured by other systems,
and systems on their backs to measure them, (a Russian doll of systems)
and you will see how weird it really is. Make one of the intermediate
systems *yourself* and think about what that would mean. Drives many
people to solipsism...

Also consider systems that are observed by parts of themselves. Like
the universe with us in it. I have a feeling that there are mechanisms
in our brain that observe ourselves and are also observed by higher
order neural networks.

Of course, you must understand that all this is purely an extension of
quantum mechanics that applies in the microscopic world into the
macroscopic domain -- where quantum phenomena are difficult to isolate
from fluctuations due to heat etc. You must take these with a pinch of
salt.

There is no authority in science. It progresses by anarchy. The

That is because with time, humans learnt to explore their environment,
dig up dinosaur fossils, observe and understand how marvelous nature
really is and refute religious dogma and fear. The Christian religion
(and the Judaist tradition) have been the most vulnerable on two
counts: 1. It is most easily refuted by direct observation (The world
is 6000 years old etc) and 2. Throwing out of theories that didn't
match experience and experiment regardless of how smart the theorist
was, how good he looked or what his name was started in the West with
Galileo. Soon the church was cornered intellectually and started
playing the 'It's all figurative! It lies in the interpretation.' card
to intellectuals. The reason we have such colourful interpretations of
QM are not even analogous to this.

I was thinking of objective observation in the &quot;common&quot; sense. I set
up an expirament where two chemicals come into contact with one another
and observe the result.

I searched for a definition on the web, and found surprisingly few for
a concept that is supposed to be widely understood.

Objective observation
An observation that is not, or is only minimally, influenced by the
opinion of the person who performs the measurement.

------------------------------------------

Observations that have only facts and events recorded are objective
observations. Observations that include personal impressions,
speculations, judgments and feelings are called subjective
observations.
------------------------------------------

Of course the obvious argument against objective observation is that is
it not possible to observe without being biased. But, even if it is
impossible to remove oneself from bias, that does not nesicarily imply
that the bias will effect the outcome. But how can you be sure?

Nice quote indeed, Diana, but can we allow people who claim to have
studied things to hide behind ignorance? What makes people believe in
something that is at odds with reality? Is it naivity? Is it perhaps
that only the most gullible people remain captive within the education
system, in an obsessive desire to one day be able to switch positions
and lecture other people? Just hold the mirror up to them and they may
recognize the little boy who is throwing a tantrum in the face of
wisdom!

Some people seek to present their own political views as if they were
not political. They use science as a mask to hide their hypocricy.
Epistemology may briefly look into this kind of rhetoric, but it isn't
a worthwhile issue in epistemology, as it takes just one quick post
like this for the culprit to be exposed.

Yes, there is govt influence on what kind of science should be pursued
and who should be given money to pursue it. However, in the enterprise
of science (scientific ideas) itself, there is no sacred authority
(like papal authority) that is beyond question. Scientific heroism lies
in overthrowing old beliefs and ideas about our world. Talk about
Galileo overthrowing Aristotlean ideas on motion. Or Einstein with his
geometric picture of gravity. Feynman, Planck etc... the who's who of
science are people who defied the authority of old ideas. Science is
what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves.

There is an old quote from Feynman:
For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public
relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.

That kind of sums up scientists feel about govt pressure in their work.

Well, the observation then was a series of sensations in your optic
pathways. Any observation can always be boiled down to sensory
information received by a subject. Hence the procedure is essentially
subjective.

Have lots of people take the observation, so any random errors
introduced by personal bias will get washed out. You can never be sure
about washing away systematic errors. That is something that is usually
washed away by people of other generations and cultures taking the
observation. [Like Aristotle was biased about a simple observational
truth -- how objects fell. No one of his time refuted him and all made
the systematic error of confirming him. Then Galileo went up the tower
of Pisa and the rest is history.]

There is a phrase which describes Souvik's posts: &quot;Arrogant
pontification&quot;. Noonne is smarter than he is; noone knows more than he
does. So why does he post on this lowly board? Why, to feed his ego,
of course. And why does he need to feed his ego? Because he is not
certain that he is really as smart as he acts like he is. Come on,
Souvik, this isn't a faculty meeting! It's just some guys trying to
talk about things. I notice that there are no &quot;in my opinion&quot; type
disclaimers there. Why should there be? We are constantly subjected
to the &quot;appeal to authority - me&quot; argument. I am bored with this and
am no longer interested in being the foil for your ego trips.

&gt; There is no authority in science. It progresses by anarchy. The
&gt; 'latest' interpretations of QM are possibilities that arise out of
&gt; direct observation. We would be happy if anyone could upset the
&gt; applecart and show us a more reasonable interpretation / physical
&gt; theory. They did not arise from dogmatic belief systems independent of
&gt; observation as did most religions.

&gt; (In passing, I'd like to mention that the Catholic Church doesn't
&gt; constitute or affect a majority fraction of theological and irrational
&gt; beliefs and in the world.)

&gt;&gt; As time has gone by they have gotten more
&gt;&gt; and more complicated and convoluted, with silly interpretation piled on
&gt;&gt; silly interpretation.

&gt; That is because with time, humans learnt to explore their environment,
&gt; dig up dinosaur fossils, observe and understand how marvelous nature
&gt; really is and refute religious dogma and fear. The Christian religion
&gt; (and the Judaist tradition) have been the most vulnerable on two
&gt; counts: 1. It is most easily refuted by direct observation (The world
&gt; is 6000 years old etc) and 2. Throwing out of theories that didn't
&gt; match experience and experiment regardless of how smart the theorist
&gt; was, how good he looked or what his name was started in the West with
&gt; Galileo. Soon the church was cornered intellectually and started
&gt; playing the 'It's all figurative! It lies in the interpretation.' card
&gt; to intellectuals. The reason we have such colourful interpretations of
&gt; QM are not even analogous to this.

&gt;&gt; Come to think of it, QM has become a religion to
&gt;&gt; a certain portion of the scientific community.

&gt; Well, then that would be sad. Because although QED is battletested to
&gt; the 31st decimal place, science is the belief in the ignorance of
&gt; experts.

&gt;&gt; QM is a wonderful tool, not a substitute God.

&gt; What do you mean? Theology is not God, it is an attempt to explain the
&gt; nature of existence with the hypothesis of God. QM and other scientific
&gt; theories do not need that hypothesis.

Okay Goozle.
I was trying to get some interesting ideas from trained philosophers
about the epistemological problem in QM.
I don't think any &quot;in my opinions&quot; disclaimers are needed because
everything I say are obviously in my opinion. I figure the proof of
that is trivial.
Umm.. did I say I am the authority? I just gave you some physics facts
(that I can safely say I have had some on-hand experience with), but do
not understand in any coherent framework without a better grasp of the
epistemology involved.

No one is smarter than me. That's actually true though. :-)

Hi Souvik. Yes, you are smart and I like what you're saying. However, not
every scientist will agree with you. I get the impression that you make a
distinction between what science should be and what the sad reality is, i.e.
science is typically presented in the education system as a collection of
dogmas and laws, rather than as the defiance of that. That brings us back to

Scientific theories are tested by experiment. If a theory doesn't match
experiment or predicts phenomena that is not observed, it is wrong.
Simply, WRONG! It doesn't matter how grand its scope or the ancestry of
whoever invented it. It's chafed out.

That is how we distil scientific theories from dogma. Since Galileo
(overthrew Aristotlean dogma).

At least in my education (which wasn't very formal initially), science
was my own efforts to make sense of natural experience -- of magnets
and trees and plasticine... I'm sure everyone's gone through phases
where they're inventing a new picture of their world every week and
throwing it out the next. As we grow up, this process gets finely toned
into science. I know what you're saying about how science is presented
in the US education system. In my experience, it is done to produce
engineers, not scientists. If you're 19 and haven't really
experimented, thought and read about the world enough to have some
roughly approximate *independent* understanding of nature, and YET you
want to get a scientific job, the best we can do is push accepted
scientific theories down your throat. Maybe with a minimum of boring
labs which is entirely against the scientific spirit. We can't help it!
There's so much to learn today if one wants to command nature as an
engineer. That is so not the way real scientists are trained though.

Countries like the USSR (former Russia) had a much more liberal way of
teaching the sciences which was really close to the scientific spirit.
Teaching science in the USA leaves a LOT to be desired. Yes. Even
*doing* real science in the USA is difficult under the present
administration. Europe doesn't have the money, but things are closer to
the spirit of real science there.

Well, that's not how public school appears to work. Children are forced
to go to school. Many leave school socially irresponsible, unemployable
and functionally illiterate. That is a phenomenon that can be observed.
Yet, few people seem to draw the conclusion that public school is
WRONG! Ergo, the method you describe above, appears not to be applied
to public school itself. In other words, public school doesn't appear
to teach such logic.

Indeed, many people seem to somhow hang on to the dogma that public
school was good. They continue to argue that common people should see
their hard-earned money forcibly taken away from them, in order to fund
this scheme, as well as that children should be forced to attend public
school under the pretence that this was somehow &quot;free&quot;, futhermore,
that it gave some children a better education than they would otherwise
get. It's a dogma and you can look at it from various angles, but if
one looks at how many leave public school socially irresponsible,
unemployable and functionally illiterate, then the conclusion must be
that it's WRONG. Moreover, to observe those facts without make any
protest will be taken by the system as an implicit acknowledgement that
public school was doing a good job. How can anyone reject the dogma
that the sun was in orbit around earth and at the same time insist that
public school was doing a good job?

Wouldn't it be better not to present theories as if they were facts?
Schools typically rank students as if one student had more &quot;knowledge&quot;

Indeed and public school does a poor job in preparing students to be an
engineer. In fact, once they find a job, they will need to be
deprogrammed for some time and re-educated, meaning that the employer
basically looks after most of the education. To become a good engineer,
apprenticeship would be a better alternative, complemented with
self-study, tutoring, etc. But of course, not everyone does want to
become an engineer. BTW, tell me how scientists are &quot;trained&quot;.. Isn't

Government's involvement in education is WRONG. The very idea that

eulogize such control simply have the WRONG political ideas. If they
start indoctrinating our kids with such ideas under the pretence that
this was education, then it's not only WRONG, but it's also a LIE! When
education that is politically colored is falsely presented as if it was
neutral, then students are by definition indoctrinated with something
that doesn't add up, which in a very fundamental way will cause the
very mental paralysis you can observe so clearly in so many students.
If epistemologists don't want someone to raise a finger about this,
then what hope do we have for the education system in general?

Can I safely assume you're talking about the US education system?
If so, my sympathies lie with you. It is hardly representative of the
rest of the world. I received my elementary, high school and
undergraduate education in India and all I can say is: we face a very
different problem there.

Of whatever little contact I've made with teaching science in
elementary and high schools in the US, I've come to conclude that it
suffers from the same syndrome as the rest of America: What do you do
when you have plenty?

Most science teachers at the school level in the US (and also in India)
are crap. They're themselves the product of the
knowledge-pushed-down-throat routine and are being paid to perpetrate
it. If they were any better, they wouldn't be school teachers with such
miserable pay, would they?

The way we get away with that in India is extreme competition. For
real. If you don't pass exams, you don't get a job and chances are
you'll be hungry on the streets within a few years. So high school kids
have to learn a LOT (which would put sophomores of an ivy league in the
US to shame). I know you're thinking: BUT HOW DOES THAT HELP? Now, some
kids realise soon enough that what their pathetic teachers taught them
doesn't add up -- they know enough to realise that. And so they
essentially re-invent their picture of the world from scratch, but this
time with much sharper logical skills. That is how some of my close
friends who did not have the good fortune of being insulated from
rote-education by thoughtful parents, but nevertheless are honest
formidable scientists now describe the process.

Such competition does not exist in Fatland. Kids know that even if they
don't understand crap, they'll still make a comfortable living. I think
the *only* solution to the US situation is by increasing the pay of
elementary and high school teachers and offering the posts to people at
the top of their profession who can communicate with utmost honesty to
impressionable minds.

There are *plenty* of such not geeky, but genuine professors out there
who'd like to teach kids, but would rather teach the preprogrammed
morons of grad school because of the pay. The US has enough money to do
that. Maybe it needs a little less Bush to see that.

Yeah, I find that weird. I got plenty of that when I was growing up.
One doesn't really need to teach a child stuff, one just needs to keep

to question!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Certainly. It is a good practice to indicate what degree of 'maybe' we
know such and such a theory to be true. But alas, it requires a depth
of knowledge and reasoning to know alternative theories (to gravity,
electrodynamics etc..) and also know why each of them fail. That is
beyond the capacity of any school teacher I have met so far.

True. Idealistically speaking, education should be secular and free of
political hues. But again, where can the education system get its money
from, if not the government, i.e. the people? You might say private
organisations, but that'll obviously make things worse. If money for
education comes from the govt, then the govt can and definitely will
try to steer it somewhat. The fight lies in minimising this influence.
At least you're born in an age when the Church isn't given as much
control as it once was. And concepts like evolution are allowed to be
taught with sufficient evidence. (Except Texas?) [No other religion in
the world except the Judaist - Christian and Muslim tradition battles
the theory of evolution to this day when it is experimentally
reproducible in lab petridishes! (What do you say to them after the
Inquisition... bunch of dogmatic jerks?)]

But you are right though. The only thing that interferes with my
learning is my education.

&gt;&gt; observe so clearly in so many students. If epistemologists don't want
&gt;&gt; someone to raise a finger about this, then what hope do we have for the
&gt;&gt; education system in general?

&gt; True. Idealistically speaking, education should be secular and free of
&gt; political hues. But again, where can the education system get its money
&gt; from, if not the government, i.e. the people? You might say private
&gt; organisations, but that'll obviously make things worse. If money for
&gt; education comes from the govt, then the govt can and definitely will try to
&gt; steer it somewhat. The fight lies in minimising this influence. At least
&gt; you're born in an age when the Church isn't given as much control as it once
&gt; was. And concepts like evolution are allowed to be taught with sufficient
&gt; evidence. (Except Texas?) [No other religion in the world except the Judaist
&gt; - Christian and Muslim tradition battles the theory of evolution to this day
&gt; when it is experimentally reproducible in lab petridishes! (What do you say
&gt; to them after the Inquisition... bunch of dogmatic jerks?)]

&gt; But you are right though. The only thing that interferes with my
&gt; learning is my education.

"/>

Again, if we want students to have an inquisitive mind, why then hold on to
the dogma of public school? You have to see public school separate from
funding. Vouchers have been successfully introduced giving families choice
as to what school they want to send their children to. Vouchers are a step
in the right direction, in that it questions the public school dogma.
Another dogma is funding. Does a good education need much funding? As you
say yourself, you and your friends basically had to start from scratch. In
other words, you didn't need public school. As I said above, to become a
good engineer, apprenticeship would be a better alternative than public
school, especially when complemented with self-study, tutoring, online
studies, etc. That may imply that the study is partly paid for by an
employer, but the point is that we need to question the dogma that a good
education required funding by either government, churches or charities. In
fact, many homeschoolers are the living evidence that good education can be
achieved without requiring outside funding.
And another dogma is that to learn, kids must sit in a classroom together
with their age-peers. In fact, there is some research that indicates that
kids can work much better at home, but much more ominous is the fact that
there is so little research done into such questions, despite the fact that
so many people get paid high salaries for supposedly doing research in
education. There are so many dogmas associated with education, such as that
it could not be combined with work, entertainment, daily activities such as
shopping, etc.
How can people who have supposedly &quot;learned&quot; all about such issues get it
so dramatically wrong? The reason is politics. The situation is decided by
politicians who see benefits in keeping the system as it is. The sad truth
is that many scientists collaborate with this, spreading political opinions

Can't comment on that now. I'm grateful to people who showed me the

&gt;&gt; Scientists are 'trained' to question as vigorously as they're trained to

&gt;&gt; Identifying the the relevant and central questions and hacking it down to
&gt;&gt; the point it may be tackled by ordinary intellect.

&gt; But does this require training? Isn't this more of an attitude, a way of
&gt; looking at things that one can adopt by choice? If scientists really did
&gt; have an inquisitive mind, why then do they refuse to question the dogma of
&gt; public school?

"/>

It definitely requires training. This is because there are bad
questions and good questions. It takes a certain sharpness to point out
the loose joints of a theory, or to invent explicit paradoxes that
illustrate them. With just the attitude of questioning and no sense of
relevance, you'd end up like so many flustering armchair philosophers
who go:

A: 'What is reality?'
B: 'Define what.'

Just questioning for the heck of it doesn't get us anywhere. It has to
be intelligent questioning.

The reason scientists do not question the dogma of public school is
because public school is not a dogma. It is an institution that has
withstood the ravages of war, politics, religion, Romans, communism,
capitalism, globalisation and modern corporate-isation of society.
Therefore, the institution of public school is something that evolves
time and again in different places out of simple necessity, not out of
dogma. The reason it crops up in every civilisation of the world is
because it is a jungle out there and you need basic reading, writing
and arithmetic skills to live in the world. Every person can't pay for
it out of their pockets, so they form groups -&gt; govts to pay for them.

No, we definitely needed public school. It taught us skills of memory,
arithmetic, etc. In time we hacked away what we figured was wrong and
reinvented a lot for ourselves. But I don't think I'd come up with
every single theorem in mathematics and calculus by independent thought
without being told about them at some point! Public school also gave us
the opportunity to interact with our own ignorance -- to identify what
was inconsistent, or what we didn't understand. I do have my grudges

undermine the whole experience.

I have a theory (hypothesis really) about the decline of excellence in
our schools. It is that the funding is tied to the NUMBER of students
and not to how much they learn. Thus the educators are loath to do
anything that will cause the loss of a warm body. Non-performers are
drug along with their contemporaries, lowering the overall atmosphere
and making a burden for the teachers.

Also, I have been curious since this thread started as to Sam's
educational history. Sam, would you mind giving us a resume of your
educational background?

primary and part of kindergarten then part of secondary,.... This meant

I think you give them too much credit. I think there is no design at

I have taught a couple of remedial algebra classes. At one university,
there was a math lab available to help the kids. I got fired for

Yes, very interesting ideas, Andrés, and well worth some further thought.
In order to understand what science and knowledge was, we do need to look at
things like that. Yes, if it's not too much trouble, I'd love to see some
links to texts that discusses this.
I can well understand what you went through, goozlefotz, and I'm glad to
hear that you do have strong principles. Indeed, why should teachers make
fools out of themselves by begging students to listen to something these
students are not interested in? I fully support your position, i.e. that you
refuse to act like a fool, and I applaude your strong stand in this, i.e.
that you rather be fired than to act like a fool!
If we want to know what epistemology was, we'll have to ask questions such
as what science and knowledge was. Problem is that many people claim to have
strong ideas about what knowledge was, but it doesn't add up. If it was the
purpose of school to teach knowledge, then there would be a way to assess
what knowledge was, i.e. kids who leave school must have something more than
what kids who don't go to school lack, i.e. knowledge. In reality, however,
homeschooling turns out to give kids more &quot;knowledge&quot;, whatever way you try
and measure it. So, what is knowledge and what is the purpose of school?
Don't blame me from bringing this issue up again and again. School becomes
an epistemological issue because some people do insist that schoolteachers
gave students knowledge. The sad truth is that we need to question this. For
some, it may be politically beneficial to pretend that schoolteachers gave
students knowledge, but epistemologists should not confuse personal
political ambition with general epistemological conclusions. As long as
there are people who confuse their own political bias with scientific or
epistemological wisdom, public school will remain one of the hottest issues
in epistemology.
If, on the other had, we accept the shortcomings of public school, in
particular that public school doesn't appear to meet whatever its purpose
was, then wouldn't it make sense to abolish it? If public school is
supported, even though we know well that it doesn't meet its stated purpose,
then what values does that teach kids? Should epistemology be based on a
lie? Shouldn't we instead explore alternatives to public school?

Sure, some things do happen at school. Perhaps even some learning. But the
question is whether school is the best alternative. For many kids,
apprenticeships would be a better alternative, especially when complemented

be much more attractive. Also, a lot of kids would be better off with

Andres- your parenthetical question mark conveys in a 'nutshell' what I
(and other posters) have tried to say in multiple posts.

Moving into Sam's world:
I admit to being biased, because I am grateful for the education I
received in public schools and universities. As the first university
graduate of my 'uneducated' blue collar family, I became one of those
'contemptible' professors 'dedicated to the destruction of
independent thinking'. According to some, I was not 'educated' but
brain-washed by a government-controlled system that rendered me
incapable of independent and creative thinking.
I admit to being unable to give credit to students who consistently
claimed that their 'independent' thinking should take precedence
over my conception of reality. Apparently my closed mind (and of
'educators' like me) proves that the &quot;men in black's&quot;' conspiracy to
control the minds and actions of the hoi poloi (thru public
education)has been successful.

IMO, no matter how imperfect, public education is the only system that
offers those of us, who lack exceptional talent, sufficient finances or
dedicated parents , the means of advancing ourselves and making a
significant contribution to society. A huge potential contribution
remains in the untapped gene pool of those economic classes who, as
yet, do not have the 'disadvantage' of being 'brain-washed' by a
public education.
This is not to deny that the educational system needs to be improved.
Compulsory education beyond the capabilities and interests of young
people is not productive. That everyone should remain in high school
until they are 18 years old without the requirement (and ability) to
participate in &quot;advanced' classes is ridiculous. Once minimal
requirements of education are achieved (surely there is a consensus?),
students should have the choice to enter avenues by which they can be
gainfully employed and/or trained. Many programs currently exist, and
many more can be developed, for training individuals in skills that
will enable them to prosper in mainstream society.
I am not at all concerned with the possibility that most will not
ponder the 'mysteries' of epistemology, or the the tragic significance
of 'Romeo and Juliet'. You can be sure that, lacking any education,
they will waste their time trying to reinvent the wheel!

Sam you are an extremist! I do believe that their is a valuable

system. You do not!

Let me state my position once and for all.
I oppose your advocacy of the TOTAL abolition of public schools and

Correct me if that is NOT what you advocate! (Whilst you are at it,
explain how your voucher system would operate independently of
government administration).

Apparently, what you demand from a discussion is an unquestioning
acceptance of all your views! I have no interest in participating on

Isn't it obvious that education cannot and should not be privatised
because:
1. Corporations (citizens directly or whatever private party is funding
this) will invariably inject bias into their teachings and shut out
secular viewpoints. Corporate advertising in education is abhorrent
enough -- let alone THROUGH education.

2. It encourages eliticism in society at the very basic level: The
richer folk will get to send their wards to better schools with more
competent teachers and they in turn will get richer and richer with
better jobs and opportunities. It also shuts out play and discussion
between kids of rich people and poor people, thereby imbalancing
society at a very fundamental level.

Privatised education implies setting up a potential aristocracy. This
is something Communist / Socialist leaders recognised long back, and if
you go to Communist states in the world, you will see how reluctant
people are to even 'sell education' (or even books that can be bought
by only rich folk). Basic education, if anything should be universally
accessible and secular. Such a thing can only be done by the government
which usually have a minimum of vested interests compared to
corporations.

It's an example of (supposedly) secular public schools indoctrinating
children with the values associated with one specific religion. It shows
that public school is no guarantee that indoctrination does not occur. Many

are upfront with that and they do not force families with opposite values to

It seems that you have little grasp of what I do advocate and instead seek

I was talking about vouchers issued by government, which will by definition
operate under some control of our democratic government. Our democratic
government has, in its wisdom, chosen to introduce vouchers at many places.
However, zinnic seems to disagree with that, when saying: &quot;public education
is the ONLY system that offers those of us, who lack exceptional talent,
sufficient finances or dedicated parents , the means of advancing ourselves
and making a significant contribution to society.&quot;

&lt;skip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Zinnic:
&gt; I agree that policies need to be gradually improved to better reflect our

"/>

Are you suggesting that politicians decide what our rights were? That
constitutes not only a denial of the very essence of our rights, it's also
an insult to what many people believe in. The epistemological relevance is
that some people in the education system seem to be out to teach our
children the very opposite of what we believe in, under the pretence that
they had a clearer view on the &quot;truth&quot;.

Always interesting to discuss terms of discussion. Once more, are you

I didn't mean that as an offence and I merely asked. I still think you are

See my answer above, re my use of &quot;only&quot;.

I still don't understand it. If you say that public school is the only
system for some students, then where should such students go, if there is no
public school close to where they live? Should they be bussed for hundreds
of miles daily to the nearest public school, even if the cost of that would
twice pay for the school fees of a nearby private school?

However YOU seem to have forgotten to explain how your voucher system would
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It's not my voucher system, but thanks for the credit. It works well, thank
you, but it typically is controlled narrowly by government administrators,
who will allow vouchers to be spent on school fees, but not on other
educational alternatives, such as homeschooling, apprenticeships, tutoring,
online courses and self-study. So, vouchers are clearly not the end of the
road and we have a long way to go in removing government from education. But
vouchers are a good step in the right direction, as they challenge the
paralysis of public school, which is not an extremist position at all!

It doesn't. It actually seems to constitute another argument in favor

No, I don't favor retention of some government control. I merely say that

changes in education, which - I believe - will eventually make it
unnecessary for government to issue vouchers. Again, that is the outcome of
policy reform, it's not a policy in itself. I'm not proposing for government
to stop issuing vouchers. I foresee that government-issued vouchers will
eventually become obsolete. This will be eventuate - I believe - because
school fees will drop dramatically at the lower end, once private schools
will be able to focus on this market. Secondly, I advocate reform in other
areas, such as changes to the tax system that will allow schools to subtract
from their own income tax any waiving of fees for poor families. Similarly,
I advocate that employers will be able to subtract from their income tax the
education they give to under-age employees who cannot afford school fees.

Obviously you're foreign to financial insecurity and squalor in third

twelve years, you may discover that your child doesn't possess enough
technical knowledge to pursue whatever he wants to or has had enough
*exposure* to deal with trade or academia. Homeschooling in technical
matters and the physical sciences need large investments of money and
infrastructure. If the homeschooling isn't upto the mark, the child
doesn't have much of a graduation record to get a reasonable job with.
In a third world country, she'd be out on her knees in the streets.
Going with the flow affords the security homeschooling lacks.

Things are different in the USA because even if you're a homeschooling
disaster, you can still get a job waiting at McDonalds or something and

With jobs getting scarce in the US thanks to outsourcing and it's
citizens getting progressively insecure about jobs, the homeschooling
paradigm might lose its adherents. Homeschoolers are largely alien to
competition, at least cut-throat competition at every stage. Which is
what is coming into this country with globalisation -- fiercely
competitive, highly trained professionals taking over jobs from other
(often third world) countries.

Sam knows (s)he cannot lose when (s)he translates what one says into
what one &quot;seems&quot; to say, and then claims that this &quot;implies&quot; whatever
(s)he wishes . It gets tedious at times, but it gives me some insight

Zinnic! You stated that the public education system was the only system to
educate poor kids. When I questioned you about this, it turned out that you
included private school attendence when paid for by government. I guess if
it's paid for by tax deductions or corporate sponsorship, you'd still argue
that this was the public education system that gave those poor kids an
education.
When I say that someone seems to be saying something, I give people a
chance to explain their words. In your case, zinnic, I don't have to do
that, because you don't seem, no, I'm convinced you ARE out to present your
biased political view as if it was an objective truth and should be taught
to children as if it was the Truth. If parents have another political view,
you'll force their children into the hands of teachers like yourself,
indoctrinating them into the socialist mould, teaching that private
enterprise is bad. You embody the very example of what is wrong in the
education system and as such you present an example for everuyone who reads
this why things should be changed.

I would be very happy to keep on reading this discussion on a forum

Unfortunately each new person who joins the group catches up with

So, what is epistemology, Andrés, should or should epistemology not ask what
science is? And what better place to find out what science is than looking
at public schools? After all, there are courtcases about disputes going on
between &quot;intelligent design&quot; and evolution that focus on this very question
what science is supposed to be. If science turns out to reflect one specific
political, religious or philosophical view, then should science be taught at
public school without giving equal weight to other views?

I think Andres is right. The schooling thing isn't quite a
epistemological debate -- it may be peripherally. Yeah, what you're
referring to science in schools, Sam, is *teaching science in US
schools* -- that is pedagogy, not epistemology. That has little to do
with the enterprise of science itself -- which is simply exploring
nature.

Science is about discovering patterns and laws in nature -- to people
who say scientific laws are socio-political constructs, I'd invite them
to transgress one of those laws by stepping out of my 7th story office
window.

The question is &quot;what is epistemology&quot;? So, let me repeat what I just said,
Souvik and Andrés, should or should epistemology not ask what science is? If
we're wondering what science is, what better place to find out what science
is than looking at what is taught at public schools under the name
&quot;science&quot;? Perhaps you'll say that it it is or isn't science what is being
taught there. But that's what makes the courtcases so interesting about the
disputes going on between &quot;intelligent design&quot; and evolution. They focus on
this very question what science is supposed to be. So, feel welcome to give
your view on this, but do not act is if this was irrelevant to epistemology.

Good question, what is science? To take up your challenge, I would happily
step out of some 7th story windows, because in some cases, there's a balcony
outside. In other words, your &quot;theory&quot; about stepping out of windows fails
to apply universally. You start with some biased ideas and seek to present
them as if they were unbiased, which is epistemologically incorrect. Many
&quot;scientists&quot; make this mistake and have the foolish idea that their
scientific background made them fit to participate in epistemological
discussions. But their scientific background makes them take the very things
for granted that epistemology in fact looks at, and does so with less bias.
Dogmas and preconceived ideas about truth and nature aren't helpful in this
respect. Why accept any a-priori dogma that there must be laws in nature. Is
there something like &quot;nature&quot; in the first place and if so, what is it? If
you fall back to scientific explanations as to why we should accept such
dogmas, then what makes you convinced that you're not just using circular
rhetoric? Even if you do find some &quot;patterns&quot;, why do you assume that random
occurence isn't more predominant than what you perceive as patterns? What is
a pattern in the first place? Does universality apply? What about
perpetuality? What makes you think that your observed patterns aren't part
of your self-constructed spectacles? What is &quot;nature&quot; in the first place?
Are you part of nature? Are your ideas about nature part of nature? You
start with so much prejudice, bias and dogmas and that I wouldn't allow you
into court as a witness, let alone as a member of a jury.

Sam, every scientist, especially particle physics theorists has asked
himself over and over again those questions about objective and
subjective reality and the character of 'the physical law'. I know
where you're coming from, because those are questions that baffle
people when they begin to seriously examine nature -- most serious
theoretical physicists have been there very many times.

Most people, like myself, after having studied a range of phenomena
(which you might say are all subjective really -- apples falling off
trees, STM pictures of atoms, hadron collisions -- are all happening in
the mind) come to the conclusion that there is reality independent of
observer out there, and there exist patterns in them that allow general
statements to be made about them -- that is what a law is. A general
statement.

Oh yeah, and do let me know when you approach any physical phenomenon
without any a-priori prejudice. Because we all do to certain degrees
and then it shifts the better we understand it. This shifting based on
experimental evidence means that it is not dogma.

I can't restrain this personal poke, Sam, but really, you confirm my
view that people who end up studying epistemology without really having
a good grasp of what we know and how we know it. The ones I've come
across so far had tried to understand physics, given up due to
incompetent abstract mathematical thinking, and then find refuge in
post-modern epistemology with all its misinterpreted soundbites of
'relativism' and 'uncertainty' and musing over if nature really exists.

It's a grapes are sour thing mostly.

Your postscript clarifies what I've suspected all along. Here is an easy way
to pick the better epistemologist. Good epistemologists will always be
interested in hearing from people who disagree with them. After all, there
may be an argument out there that could convince them to improve their
ideas. I do welcome someone who can point me out where I can improve my
ideas. I'd be most grateful to anyone who can point out new ideas,
directions or innovative approaches that I wasn't yet aware of.
This is not your approach. You instead resort to insults. You stubbornly
hold on to your desired &quot;truth&quot;, not because of convincing evidence, but
because you have made up your political view in advance and you only want to
hear things that suit your political conviction. Moreover, instead of being
upfront about this, you seek to conceal your political view in a
&quot;scientific&quot; wrapper, to ensure that children at young and thus more
impressionable ages are indoctrinated with such a political view by stealth.
To top it of, you think that you can push your way through by means of
insults, rather than argument. QED.

Well, even if neumenal reality were observed, you'd still claim it
isn't there because all you have is the observation of reality -- which
is still phenomenal reality.

The reason we suspect that there is objective reality out there is
because

1. There are unmistakable patterns in nature. (And by no amount of
drugging of our minds can we defy them, maybe defy our perception of
them.)
2. That billions of people observe the same patterns in nature
independent of social, lingual, religious or scientific background.
Example: Falling objects accelerate.

So, Sam, what's your proof that there is no reality independent of our
perception (of 'it')? It'd be best if you could design an experiment to
test this viewpoint.

I don't see philosophers who claim no objective reality really going
anywhere with their doctrine! Can they tell us diffraction limits in
quantum systems / why the CMB is uneven / or anything quantifiably
testable AT ALL?

anathema to Sam. Retrospection of Sam's posts to yourself and others

rules and free enterprise is unfettered. The slightest deviation from
this rule results in one being labelled a 'socialist', and judged as
a participant in the political plot which is responsible for all of

Since it is possible to explain observed phenomena by postulating one
objective reality, therefore by Occam's Razor it is superfluous to
postulate any more.

Sam, the perception of reality is subjective. Everyone knows that.
Physical theories are subjective to the human race. Everyone knows that

Is souvik a socialist or not? Make up your own mind, if you like, but first
have a look at what he said in message 76:

In this message (5 aug), souvik says that private enterprise should not be
allowed to operate primary schools, quoting the UN to support this view,
while conveniently leaving out the other two sections of the respective
article, as I pointed out to him in message 77 that same day:

Now tell me what souvik is expressing there, a political view or not? I
caught him red-handed, right in the middle of the act. Why do you think is
Souvik leaving out the most essential part of the referenced text? Isn't
this a blatant example of falsifying the evidence, in order to advance a
political view?
This is not something that I made up, Zinnic, it's all there in black and
white. Are you going to falsify the evidence as well, by making it look as
if souvik was making a scientific analysis while I was demanding people to
&quot;unconditionally accept a simplistic world in which parental authority ruled
and free enterprise was unfettered&quot;? I didn't make this one up, zinnic, it's
not my demand, but it's the UN that says this and it's supported by many
countries with socialist governments as well!
Should any scientist be allowed to get away with something like that? This
is why I call for a Pledge for Scientists!

So, billions of people share the same political view? It must be because
they have all be taught to think that way at school! Well, here's news for
you. Not all people see these patterns, or, to rephrase that in better
wording, not all people see the patterns that you claim to be seeing! I

Hey, I didn't say there was NO reality. I was the one who pointed out to

Don't be silly! Just because your biased view of reality falls apart
doesn't mean there was no reality at all. It just means that your model of
reality has been unmasked as a political view that doesn't square up with
reality. The reality is that the UN says that parents have a prior right to
choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children. That
isn't MY reality, it's the UN speaking, the very source you quoted while

Firstly, it doesn't explain much, other than what you want to hear. It may
simplify parts of reality, but doesn't it do so by obscuring other parts
that defy the respective theory? In other words, you're confident that a
specific approach will give a specific outcome. Fine, but don't try and
portray it as some kind of law that should be imposed onto everyone else.
Secondly, it's Occam's Razor that makes you say this. But wasn't Occam
expressing a specifc philosophy that happened to be welcomed by the
scientific elite, as it suited their political view and better articulated
it. So, all you're saying is that you're a follower of Occam, like many
other scientists are.
But Occam's ideas are fundamentally at odds with our rights and therefore
are unacceptable as a philosophy. Some other scientists with more right-wing
political views may adhere to slightly different views (e.g. objectivism)
and seek to advance that by making other scientists into followers of their
doctrines. Some scientists may take a bit from Ayn Rand and a bit from
Occam, effectively adhering to something that they see as &quot;balance&quot;. They
may claim to believe in objective science, they may deny that they were
followers of a specific political doctrine, but they're just as much
expressing and following political views as all the others. That's why I
suggest a Pledge for Scientists, to bring some more honesty into the system.

1. My stand on physical reality has nothing to do with my stand on

what me leaving out a certain portion of an article of human rights in
our discussion over public / private schooling can have anything to do

&gt; The reason we suspect that there is objective reality out there is because

&gt;&gt; 1. There are unmistakable patterns in nature. (And by no amount of

&gt; You may see patterns, but what makes you think that you aren't making the
&gt; mistake of presuming that they were patterns of nature, rather than patterns
&gt; that existed in your head? Perhaps it's not even in your head. You may be
&gt; merely copying and pasting prefabricated responses obtained from the
&gt; propaganda material of your political party. Point is that your observing of
&gt; patterns is wishful thinking.

Let's say there's a brick falling off a high building and you're right
under it. Will you convince yourself that the pattern of falling
objects is really a political viewpoint and maybe transcended by
liberal thought? What, are you Neo now?

Methinks you are arguing for the sake of arguing now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. That billions of people observe the same patterns in nature
&gt;&gt; independent of social, lingual, religious or scientific background.
&gt;&gt; Example: Falling objects accelerate.

&gt; So, billions of people share the same political view? It must be because
&gt; they have all be taught to think that way at school! Well, here's news for
&gt; you. Not all people see these patterns, or, to rephrase that in better
&gt; wording, not all people see the patterns that you claim to be seeing! I
&gt; don't see them! If your principle is universality, then the occurence of one
&gt; event is sufficient to disprove it, so here I am, not seeing the patterns
&gt; you claim to be seeing. And here's your response - you want me to jump out
&gt; of a window, as if that would resolve your political problem. But that
&gt; wouldn't change much, souvik, your views would remain as biased as they were
&gt; before and the fact that others would let you get away with it would only
&gt; encourage you to go further down this devious path. Repent, souvik, and
&gt; confess that you were wrong!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Don't be silly! Just because your biased view of reality falls apart
&gt; doesn't mean there was no reality at all. It just means that your model of
&gt; reality has been unmasked as a political view that doesn't square up with
&gt; reality. The reality is that the UN says that parents have a prior right to
&gt; choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children. That
&gt; isn't MY reality, it's the UN speaking, the very source you quoted while

&gt; a view that was politically convenient to them? Open your eyes, souvik,
&gt; there's a world out there!
&gt; Sam

"/>

The reason I left out the portion on parents deciding the education of
their children is because it is irrelevant up front! Firstly, it must
be *accessible* equally to every citizen. If corporations are allowed
to privatise basic education, they will unavoidably introduce unwanted
egalitarianism at a fundamental level of society. These things have
been tested in countries in times of hardship and then discarded. Not
because people were dogmatic, but because such systems simply create
strife!

And no, I don't think political viewpoint in science has much of a
chance. The enterprise runs on upsetting the applecart.

Frankly Sam, you're the very brand of pseudo-intellectuals who were
laughed at when the Sokal hoax came out in the Social Text. I would
highly recommend you read that:

It is a critique on the political aspects of science.

For the record, I do believe socialism works in a set of political
circumstances. Especially when aristocracy arising out of capitalism
begins to threaten human rights. It doesn't work in every demography
and economic climate though -- I don't know of any single correct
political formula that does.

It is my opinion that media in the US programmed fear and loathing of
socialism during the cold wars and the Vietnam wars based on political
and wartime gain on its citizens. The general American populace is
poorly travelled and consider their country the causally connected
universe. Hence the impression survives and is perpetrated.

Also for the record, Sam is mad.
I know how fine the line between lunacy and genius is. But this is not
the case here. He simply has a case of 'arguing for the sake of
arguing', loves the word 'dogma' and will connect anything... from
broomsticks to bowling... to public education, his favourite topic. And
has recently begun adding obscure 'quotes' at the end of his posts for
whatever reason. Here's a quote then to the memory of Sam Carana:

&quot;
Walter Sobchak: Those rich fucks! This whole fucking thing... I did not
watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking
strumpet...
The Dude: I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Walter Sobchak: Well, there isn't a literal connection...
The Dude: Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.
&quot;

Goodbye.

- Firstly, people don't have brains in their little toes.
- Secondly, if you confuse such biased political views with wisdom and

views as pseudo-epistemology.
- Thirdly, readers will see that I didn't start with the insults, which only
shows that you have no interest in discussing the issues. That kind of

Let's continue with our reflections on epistemology.

If we accept that science is a self-restricted discipline that will
focus exclusively on - say - natural phenomena, does it then follow
that science was unable or unfit to answer questions such as: &quot;What is
nature?&quot; Is such a question therefore only an epistemological question?
Are all claims to approach such a question scientifically
inappropriate? Do those who reject any answers to such a question or
the question itself as &quot;unscientific&quot;, miss the point?

Indeed, we have to be very cautious about scientists making statements
outside their discipline, especially when they do so under the pretence
that they had scientific evidence to support their view.

Let's look at objectivity. Is the issue of objectivity purely an
epistemological question? Are scientists who claim to make objective
observations, effectively making epistemological statements?

While there is no obligation for epistemologists to come up with an answer,
or THE answer for that matter, epistemology does look into such questions.
Point is that such questions emerge from the position of scientists who
claim to study nature. I'm referring to questions such as &quot;what is nature?&quot;
Scientists are inclined to leave such questions unanswered, while at the
same time claiming to focus on &quot;nature&quot;. Thus, this epistemological question
starts with and follows from science itself. The distinction between nature
and whatever it was that wasn't nature is one that follows from the position
of scientists, rather than that such issues were outside the domain of
science and were therefore merely trivia, whether epistemological or
philosophical. For an epistemologist, there is not necessarily such a
distinction, after all, aren't the scientists who make the observation just
as much part of &quot;nature&quot; as the object they claim to be observing?
Thus, epistemology is able to warn scientists of certain pitfalls, which
makes epistemology suitable as the place to discuss other issues as well,
such as a Pledge for Scientists.

If epistemologists need to dodge a straightforward, honest query to the
nature of their question ('what is nature?' from previous post) and
cannot even come up with a sample answer, I must say with utmost
disrespect that they should take up farming or something more directly
useful to society who's food they eat.

Scientists contribute to society by making technology -- which is
simply an implementation of their knowledge about reality. If there was
grain of truth in their mapping of objective reality, technology
wouldn't work. Epistemologists, if Sam is to be any representative, on
the other hand are obviously interested in arguing over ill-defined
questions they don't have a clue about and aren't willing to make an
honest attempt at. Even the ones I've come across in major universities
(US and otherwise) are usually the product of pop-science books with
peripheral knowledge of 'quantum physics', 'relativity', 'Godel's
Incompletenes Theorem' and now the more fashionable 'string theory' and
are a shining example of &quot;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.&quot;

PS: Sam also believes that the brain does not reside in the toe. Being
a top-notch epistemologist, how can he entertain such dogma!

And who decides what is &quot;knowledge&quot; and whether it was &quot;true&quot;? How does a
teacher know what to teach in science classes? Does the teacher have to be a
scientist to know? Or isn't that kind of knowledge part of knowledge? And
what if it turns out that the &quot;knowledge&quot; wasn't the &quot;knowledge&quot; after all?
Is it simply a question of redefining &quot;knowledge&quot; at your convenience, in
order to ensure that scientists can perpetuate their exclusive competence of
knowing the truth? Is that the kind of rhetoric you're promulgating here,
souvik?
A technician may have a lucky break and put something together that works.
Without knowing why it works, the technician simply concludes that it does
and submits the device for a patent. It's interesting to argue whether or
not a patent can or should be awarded in such a case, but the deeper
question here is what is the difference between a technician and a
scientist, if any?

Epistemologists, if Sam is to be any representative, on

&gt; questions they don't have a clue about and aren't willing to make an honest

So, you're saying that you're a &quot;scientist&quot; and not an epistemologist - in
fact, you dislike epistemologists. But do you really believe that, by
stating this, people will believe that you therefore were better at
epistemology? If honesty and competence is the issue, then you've squarely
put yourself out of range.

Even the ones I've come across in major universities (US and otherwise) are

&gt; knowledge is a dangerous thing.&quot;

"/>

So, you're saying that only scientists were competent in epistemology, I
suppose because they didn't study it? And at the same time, epistemologists
weren't competent because they did? Is that perhaps your scientific theory?
A case of double negatives? You feel threatened by epistemologists and you
believe you can insult them with authority because you didn't study it? Is
that your naive observation, which you've made into a major theory that you
like to share here with us?

You were not asked to define nature. You were asked to provide a sample

Most epistemologists are dumb. Not because they're at odds with
scientists or whatever, but because they're just sloppy incomplete
thinkers -- sometimes dodgy too. Epistemology itself is a rather
interesting discipline with interesting and possibly relevant
questions. It's just that I think formal training in epistemology is
horrible -- given the standards of philosophers I've met so far.

Lastly, relevance should be a keyword for any academic enterprise that
is paid by taxpayers. There has to be concrete returns to society, or
else academia is a racket of the intellectuals. The way science returns
to society is by exploiting their knowledge of nature (perception of or
not) to design technology. That gives scientists a well earned
arrogance over other racketeering forms of academia.

LASER is an acronym for 'Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
Radiation'. I said that. Laser is not defined as something that doesn't
occur in nature -- there is an adjective for that specifically;
'artificial'. Laser is a noun defined as the amplification of light by
fine tuning molecular orbitals to metastable states. The reason we can
fine tune such things such unobserved ephemeral concepts to produce the
effects we need is because our theories must have a large element of
the truth in it.

Huh? As a practicing physicist, I can assure no such thing. Absolutely
not. It is not a scientist's responsibility to ensure that knowledge he
has uncovered will not be used to kill. That may be the responsibility
of the human being that he is. Science, unlike religion, lays no rules

will point out that in reality it doesn't add up. Instead of admitting that
you didn't know the truth after all, you will redefine again and again what
a &quot;physcial&quot; situation was at your own convenience and in your own terms.
You will do so every time someone points out that things don't add up.
You think that, if you start with a &quot;grain&quot; of truth, few people will
object. You think that, by adding grain after grain, your power will
increase, resulting in world control. But if you start playing the game that
way, at some stage, you can expect someone to call your bluff. In your case,
you claim to know the truth, but you've got an empty hand. I asked you to
show your hand and you had nothing at all.
Let me refresh your memory again:

Fine! Apparently, I gave you more credit than you deserve. Rather than
claiming to build a scientific structure grain by grain, you do even less
than that. You hang on desperately to one single grain of truth, as if this
&quot;modesty&quot; will allow you to get away with your scheme. And apparently, it
takes epistemology to point out that your starting point is shaky and that
your entire house of cards is built not on truth, but on the shaky ground of
a politics. Your status is derived from the fact that scientists are
currently given an undeserved privileged position in society. As long as you
remain within the safe grounds of science, you can pretend to know a lot,
but from an epistemological perspective, your claim to know the truth is
quickly exposed as a scheme that is based on political rhetoric.
So, what do you claim to &quot;know&quot; about epistemology that I supposedly
didn't? That people should listen to you, because you're a scientist who has
a hotline to God, in case there was a dispute about what was the truth? Oh,
I'm twisting words again, am I? Should I say that you have exclusive access
to this elusive grain of truth? And why can mere mortals like me not find
this grain of truth? Ahh, because it's only in your head, is it?
The fact that you fail to contemplate such questions can be explained by
your scientific background. Scientists are not used to question whether
truth existed. You prefer to accept there was a grain of truth in principle.
Perhaps that makes you an obedient scientist. But it makes you a lousy
epistemologist, as is evident in the derogatory language you resort to, in
an effort to reject ideas that don't fit in with your view and your
associated status.
You could have known that this conflict between us would happen, souvik.
You earlier said what your opinion was of epistemologists. You knew there
were worlds of difference between science and epistemology. So, don't be
surprised if someone here points this out to you. It's nothing personal,
it's just that you want to hang on to something that epistemology questions.
Perhaps you were provocative or I was, that's irrelevant, the point remains
that this is an epistemology group, not a science group! Either you accept
this, or you go and find a science group to hang out, but if you continue to
make derogatory remarks about epistemology and members of this group, you
can expect that this will eventually lead to you being removed from this
group here. While the same applies to zinnic and goozlefotz, what really

The reason scientists have an exclusive hotline to God is because we
know enough about nature to exploit its principles to create working
technology.

Archimedes could make his war machines because the geometry and physics
he knew had a large grain of truth. If he had been a sloppy geometer /
physicist, his machines wouldn't have worked in turning back Rome. It
is as simple as that.

Oh, the blatant hostility is towards you and *dumb* epistemologists. I

I just said we can claim to a grain of truth.

Zinnic(the above are my capital emphases):
Sam started this thread, yet he has cast no light on how epistemology
can help the 'plain' (wo)man come to terms with advanced concepts of
what constitutes 'reality'.
(S)he takes refuge in the inexactitude (approximation) inherent in
language by ignoring the context of a posted statement, strips the
statement of all aspects of relativity and conditionality, and then
proceeds to accuse the author of being complicit in a political
conspiracy (by the Men in Black?)to suppress individual 'rights'.

Sam believes that 'they' (all who question Sam) conspire to sustain the
present psychologically (public education) and economically (science
and the military) enslaved Society as a barrier against formation of
his/her ideal society that would naturally emerge from the unfettered
practice of individual choice and free enterprise. Sam is no less
extreme than is a religious fundamentalist.

Time and time again Sam claims that 'epistemology' is the only arbiter
of 'Truth' and repeatedly uses &quot;BUT EPISTEMOLOGISTS WILL QUICKLY EXPOSE
SUCH SCHEMES&quot; to dimiss claims that scientific observations and
theories provide the 'plain (wo)man with at least some sense of
reality. It is generally accepted that science does not and will not
have the answers to every question. For Sam, any scientific answer is
invalidated because it is not the 'Truth, the whole Truth and nothing
but the Truth'. No one but Sam says science claims to reveal the
absolute 'Truth'.
Sam's naive 'epistemology' is &quot;Gotcha! That is not the absolute truth!
&quot; His/her 'epistemology' is 'questionable' in that it is a series of
questions (see the original post). Sam has no answers! In contrast,
science provides partial answers that are readily translated into a
perception of 'reality' by 'plain' (wo)man. The proof is the huge
technological advances that has enabled the control of the natural
environment to the great advantage of the human condition.

You may seek to ridicule and twist my words by putting labels like
religious fundamentalism and conspiracy theory on it, but that only shows

getting funding quite openly. People are forced to pay taxes and part of
that goes to fund public school. That's not a conspiracy theory. That's

Insults like this expose the true character of the people behind this

Scientists get money because they can make bombs, food, transport etc.
Weapons, mostly. The reason they can make these is because they have a
reasonable grasp of the principles of nature. It takes a lot of effort
to refine that knowledge, and even pass it on to future generations. It
is obviously very precious knowledge, and that is what taxpayers pay
through their noses for.

I'm afraid, they don't pay for empty academia. As are most present-day

Maybe. However, it is irrelevant to this thread of argument which was
why scientists receive so much money from the public if they're just
finding out about their (socio-politically tainited) perception of
nature. Stick to the topic. We can discuss your pledge for scientists
elsewhere.

Archimedes is a proper noun.

Let's not fool ourselves. There may be scientists who are merely playing
around, taking trips into nature to naively make sandcastles on the beach.
But as you said yourself, scientists receive funding to make bombs, weapons
mostly, weapons of yet unknown destructive impact and consequences, so all
the more reason to have some discussion on the points I mentioned, such as
openness about what's going on, a pledge for scientists, liability, etc.
If your attitude is an indication, then scientists are unable or unwilling
to discuss things, so perhaps it takes an epistemologist to point things
out. There's one of the &quot;results&quot; you argued that philosophy failed to
deliver.

Let's get down to basics.

The One is the object of our search. It is reality. Our search is
'knowing' the One. 'Knowing' is not one, but of necessity two, or
more.

Why? Because 'to know' requires a knower and a known; k + k = 2
things. But, wait a minute. A knower and a known involves a
'relation' between knower and known called 'perception'. So, now we
have k + k + r = 3 things.

Now, however, we have a knower, a known, a relation, and a perception
of the relation which we will call R2, this in turn generates R3, . . .
, Rn. And, this I believe is an infinity.

Thus, we have the unknowable One which is Reality. And, the world that
we perceive that is Many. And, no matter how much, or how long, we
examine -- using the rose colored glasses of either science or
philosophy -- this Many, we will always have a less than complete
perception of it. Hence, . . . necessary Error.

So much for Reality, Knowing, and the problem of Knowledge -- Error.

Yes, philosophers and scientists both are immersed in error.
Scientists say they observe things better with their scientific method
and copious use of hard mathematics. Philosophers, on the other hand,
say they observe a more complete world using introspection combined
with icy logic.

Well, both disciplines are in the same boat. So, keep on rowing and
don't stop bailing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I gave a straightforward example. There were no definitions and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; re-definitions in it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, is that how you define nature? Archimedes? Or, was this just an
&gt;&gt;&gt; example? And what if that doesn't add up either? What if your test don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; square up with the redefinition of your definition? Redefine it again
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; again, in the hope that nobody will realize that you never knew the
&gt;&gt; truth in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the first place?

&gt;&gt; Archimedes is a proper noun.

&gt;&gt; A result is something concrete: one of the most concrete results of subtle
&gt;&gt; physics were the fission bombs over Japan. There is no question of
&gt;&gt; redefinition -- it simply worked the way our theories said it would. Same
&gt;&gt; goes for other less dramatic examples like tunnel diodes etc.

&gt; Our theories? Stop taking credit for what other people made. You cannot be
&gt; trusted with access to weaponry, if your conduct here is any indication of
&gt; how your behavior in general. That kind of conduct will have the very result
&gt; of people agreeing with me that a pledge for scientists makes sense. That's
&gt; a result!

A pledge for scientists definitely is something for discussion among
epistemologists. It's not something that should be left to scientists to
look after, as that could constitute a conflict of interest. People may not

Alarming.

Where does he get these notions of 'People who aren't scientists don't
have access to the truth' from? Anyone who has senses has access to
nature. The process of finding out the principles of nature's workings
have been distilled over the ages into what we call 'the scientific
method' of experimentation and inference.

There definitely are other ways people try to find out about nature,
like dowsing. The only problem with them is they don't work.

(A big problem in understanding what you're saying, Sam, is you provide
no examples. It is easy to warp logic by words loosely strung together

This was added as an example of the kind of circular rhetoric that is so

There you go! Confusing your definition of 'nature' with the truth! And

You started to claim sole access to 'the truth', in the form of a grain of

I already explained why we believe in a simple explanation for nature's

I think your problem is, you have done little or no science yourself

You use the &quot;royal we&quot;, but you're just one person. A simplified model by
definition is a simplification of something that was actually more complex.
A model of something by definition isn't the real thing. You may like to
believe that complexity can be fully captured in simplicity, but implicit in
your own definition is that the best you can come up with are
approximations. Simplifying things presumes there was something coherent out
there in the first place, something that could be observed and that could be
simplified. To avoid a perception that one merely made such a presumption to
suit one's political desire, the prior question must be asked whether there
was something like 'nature' in the first place that could be simplified.
That question is no longer a scientific question. When a theory doesn't
hold, a scientist may perceive that as a wake-up call handed out by reality
itself, as if there was some teacher out there called 'Nature' slapping
sloppy scientists on the hand for making up poor theories. But
philosophically, the question is whether this is a teacher called 'nature'
or a belief in 'simplicity for simplicity's sake'. You cannot turn things
around by holding up the shortcomings of a theory as proof that 'nature' was
out there. There may be all kinds of things out there, but a failed theory
doesn't constitute evidence of any rule governing whatever there was out
there.

Are you saying that scientists are the only ones allowed to speak in this
group, but that all epistemologists should be banned? That's nonsense, of
course! Epistemology doesn't conduct research by testing whether perceived
or imagined particles abide by a specific theory. Epistemology asks
questions like what is science, what is knowledge, and what is nature. So,
what is lost when complexity is simplified? When a scientist says &quot;nothing&quot;,
an epistemologist may well reply with &quot;integrity&quot;! And indeed, one only has
to look at the insults accumulated in your posts to see how much integrity
you have.

Oh, science doesn't get more 'complex' as you go deeper into the
Russian Doll of Explanations. It gets more abstract with respect to day
to day experience, and in that abstraction, radical simplification,
usually beyond the belief of people who conjectured them, are noticed.
So, doesn't abstraction imply complication? No, it doesn't -- it just
implies that day to day experience doesn't prepare us to think in those
terms and it requires a little imagination to wrangle with such
abstract but technically simpler ideas.

An example which I'm sure most laypersons know would illustrate my
point: Space and time were viewed as distinct 'things' before Einstein.
Equations of motion and equations of gravity were disjoint -- two
*completely* different concepts (2 equations) -- and they were obtained
largely by Newton et al by honest observation of falling objects and
heavenly bodies. No one, but a fool, would suspect that spatial
separations would have ANYTHING to do with time which was different
'stuff' altogether. But then Einstein's insight that the equations of
motion simplified a LOT when you just considered time as another
dimension came along. And soon, people came to realise how easily that
setup could accomodate electromagnetism (4 equations) -- electricity
and magnetism, that the duality of electricity and magnetism FOLLOWED
from the duality of time and space. And of course, in a breakthrough,
Einstein himself realised how gravity must really be a dent in
spacetime. So, the equations of motion, equations of spacetime,
equations of gravity and their corollary (with one added assumption of
there being a field) of electromagnetism became 1 equation. The
equation itself is very abstract -- written in tensor calculus as an
equality G = T. But from it follow so many phenomena -- EXACTLY with no
measurable deviation. So we suspect a large grain of physical truth is
captured in that equation / understanding.

About the comment that sometimes the people who make the theory do not
fathom the depth of the simplification achieved: The orbit of Mercury
was known not to follow the usual laws of Newton's gravity -- so
everyone suspected there was another planet, Vulcan, between the Sun
and Mercury that was affecting it. There was TREMENDOUS amounts of
money pumped in by various nations into their observatories for the
prestige of discovering the planet. But soon after Einstein's theory,
someone calculated that General Relativity predicted the wobble in
Mercury's orbit. All govt funding into finding Vulcan (which was too
close to home to be that elusive after 70 years or so) immediately
vanished -- it was another triumph for an abstract unification.

There are hundreds of other examples of such unification -- simplicity
in abstraction, that leads us to believe that there must be a simple
explanation underlying it all. There is no proof for it, apart from the
fact that it has happened so many times!

As for the interference of politics in the physical sciences, I'd say
there's very little scope. If the wobble in Mercury's orbit (which can
be observed by any diligent home-based astronomer today) had been off
by a factor of 0.5% from the prediction of General Relativity, GR
would've been seriously doubted if not thrown out the window. (The
figure 0.5% is from the error bars of the actual data when it was first
matched. It's probably been matched to more accuracy now.) If it were
as easy to come up politically backed theories that are consistent with
experiment to that level, people would come up with them. And they have
-- there have been tens of competiting theories to General Relativity
-- but almost all but one or two because they simply can't match up to
accurate experimentation. Usually other competitive theories will
predict something else -- like the slowing down of Jupiter or something
that we don't observe.

And seriously, I don't see what political advantage might be gained
from backing one deeply physical theory over another.

As a scientist myself, I would say explaining fundamental theories to
an absolute laymen is not so much a matter of explaining something
complicated, but coaxing the person's imagination to expand and
accomodate such grand concepts.

Also, I don't think science is a pursuit exclusive to 'scientists'. Any
child who looks at a river and wonders why it meanders, or a bird and
wonders how it flies, or at a flower and wonders why it is colourful,
is embarking on the same human enterprise we call science.

Sure, while opponents may argue that the formula itself may be more
difficult to understand, from the perspective of simplicity, one theory
makes more sense than another - it makes it look easier to make predictions,
requiring less calculations, looks neater, gives greater abstraction, etc.
But the even more abstract question is whether such theories can be
presented as absolute and universal. Are scientists portraying science as
one coherent structure? If so, wasn't this an over-simplification that
actually increased complexity?
If Occam's razor did actually lead us into a dead-end-street, all for the
sake of supposedly greater simplicity, wouldn't that in fact complicate
things? As long as one kept wearing the blindfold of Occam's Razor, things
may seem simple, as if there was only one way ahead, i.e. forward. But once
you hit your head against the wall, you suddenly realize that navigation is
actually extremely difficult, especially if you keep wearing this blindfold.

I'd say they go hand in hand. Occam's Razor is the equivalent of a

And yet, when any person asks for funding for scientific research, applies
to a scientific position in the education system or seeks to do something
else in an area where scientists are privileged, the one with the science
qualifications, references and experience will get it. The system controls
itself, excluding outsiders from the ivory tower. On the one hand,
scientists demand peer review only and independence from public scrutiny. On
the other hand, scientists demand public funding and are involved in the
development of weapons, which warrents closer scrutiny. It's two-faced in so
many ways, that the suggestion that this lead to greater simplicity appears
false, which is the point where you bang your head against the wall.

I think you are hinting at the fact that we may stick along with one
theory too sure of ourselves, for too long. And when the time comes to
discard that theory and look elsewhere, it becomes too difficult. That
I fear is partly true. Especially with our current halt at String
Theory. It is a disease afflicting a large section of younger US
physicists on the block who come in and all they see is a *massive
effort* in String Theory. The media and the administration's
conspicuous lack of scientific competence is largely to blame for this.
The matter is different in Europe and Russia. However, physicists who
are today at the top of the game have at least 6 or 7 pet theories
(that are NOT Occam Razored) for the same phenomena. I am a relatively
young theorist, and I produce and discard an alternative theory every
month or two. The looking out for alternatives is a MAJOR part of the
game. As is having an intuition for which alternatives will fail.

Scientists expect peer reviews for the same reason a doctor won't ask
for public opinion when performing a vital surgery. He will consult
other doctors. And hell, they make a lot of money!

It's a simple sentence, at the danger of being too simplistic, but since
that is the very point, it's appropriate. Relying on simplicity risks
oversimplifying things.

But the even more abstract question is whether such theories can be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; presented as absolute and universal. Are scientists portraying science as
&gt;&gt; one coherent structure? If so, wasn't this an over-simplification that
&gt;&gt; actually increased complexity?

&gt; How does it increase complexity? Please do not leave flaky assertions like
&gt; that unsubstantiated without proof or example.

"/>

For starters, it increases complexity because it hinges on a huge
bureacratic apparatus that forces people to cough up their money and that
channels this money into development of weapons with yet unknown dangerous
aspects and into indoctrination of people that this was the right way to go.
When people come up with ideas that fit in with this scheme, this
bureaucracy appropriates those ideas and portrays them as if they were part
of this fabricated structure it calls science. To you, this may sound simple
in theory, but in reality you are making a huge effort to suppress the
better approaches.

If Occam's razor did actually lead us into a dead-end-street, all for the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; sake of supposedly greater simplicity, wouldn't that in fact complicate
&gt;&gt; things? As long as one kept wearing the blindfold of Occam's Razor, things
&gt;&gt; may seem simple, as if there was only one way ahead, i.e. forward. But
&gt;&gt; once you hit your head against the wall, you suddenly realize that
&gt;&gt; navigation is actually extremely difficult, especially if you keep wearing
&gt;&gt; this blindfold.

&gt; Occam's razor is definitely a guiding principle. The simplest possible
&gt; theory that can explain the widest range of phenomena is the best. Give me a
&gt; reason to suspect otherwise to this natural tendency of philosophy -- WITH
&gt; AN EXAMPLE.

I just did! If you're walking into a dead-end street with your eyes closed,
you're making things more complicated. You may not realize this until you
hit your head against a wall, but it's just a matter of time until you do.

As for the interference of politics in the physical sciences, I'd say

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; there's very little scope.

&gt;&gt; I'd say they go hand in hand. Occam's Razor is the equivalent of a

&gt;&gt; scientists expect peer reviews to ensure things will be OK. Scientists claim

OK, here's another example, since you keep asking for them. The teacher
walked up and down the classroom, intimidating the kids to swallow his
words. &quot;These kids are so stupid and obnoxious&quot;, he heard himself thinking,
&quot;one day, I'll teach at a private school, where authority is respected....&quot;
All the kids' eyes followed him closely, knowing that at moments like this
he demanded their undivided attention. &quot;Two, four, six, eight... these are
the EVEN numbers, they can all be divided by two&quot;, he spoke out loudly. &quot;If
a number isn't even, it's an ODD number&quot;, he continued, &quot;DO YOU HEAR ME?&quot;
With angry eyes he looked into the classroom, demanding an immediate reply.
&quot;Yes, master&quot;, the class responded in unison. &quot;SIX&quot;, he asked, &quot;who can tell
me what kind of number that is?&quot; He looked with satisfaction as he counted
the number of raised hands. &quot;TIMMY&quot;, he said, pointing his finger at Timmy.
Timmy was holding his breath, so that he could shout it out: &quot;It's an EVEN
number, Master!&quot; The teacher nodded with approval and said &quot;CORRECT&quot;, while
turning to little Johnny Doolan, asking: &quot;Five, can that be divided by two?&quot;
He looked Johnny deep into the eye, to instill the kind of fear that shaped
obedience. &quot;Yes, Master!&quot;, Johnny said enthusiastically. &quot;Wroooong!&quot;, the
teacher shouted, &quot;it's odd!&quot; Johnny looked in surprise: &quot;That's odd...&quot; The
teacher was fuming: &quot;Out, now, you're a zero! You're suspended!&quot; Johnny
walked out the door, shaking his head, thinking: &quot;Zero can be divided by two
as well, but why would anyone want to divide zero by two?&quot;

Yeah, she's continuing to dodge straightforward argument. I have no
clue what example or evidence she has provided againest Occam's Razor
or for ANY of the assertions she makes. But she thinks she has... and
everytime you ask her, she'll say 'I just did!'.

After reading her last paragraph, I suspect she was brought up under an
authoritarian school system that did not encourage anything in between
'you're wrong!' and 'you're right'. The fact that she thinks 'Symbols
are meant to intimidate' terminates the argument with the fact that Sam
is a bonafide idiot. I'm sure Sam's heard that plenty of times about
herself. (She was probably in a school that identified symbolism with
obscurity and intimidation.) Bonafide idiots are idiots who do not have
the critical intelligence level to realise that they're being an idiot.

Yeah, Zinnic, I think it is pointless to have a straightforward
argument with her.

Lubos Motl is a theoretical physicist at Harvard. And like any other,
receives inane volumes of mail from crackpots. A lot of what he says
has tremendous relevance to 'epistemologists' like Sam Carana:

I quote: (from   which makes an interesting
read independently)

Belief that whole fields of science are wrong without being able to
identify the error

This observation is related to many previous observations, for example
the missing will of crackpots to verify their assertions and their
frequent pride about their state of confusion and misunderstanding. But
once again, let me use other words. Crackpots often believe that whole
scientific fields, including many fields that have been tested for
decades or centuries, must be wrong. This is usually derived from the
inconsistency of the basic ideas underlying these fields with a basic
dogma of the crackpot, or simply from his inability to understand the
existing theories. A crackpot will typically focus on the inconsistency
between his basic idea and a fundamental idea of the existing science,
and he will rarely try to study any further &quot;details&quot;.

For example, a crackpot may decide that a theory named in a certain way
(e.g. string theory) must be ridiculous and inconsistent based on
verbal patterns, but he will always find it unimportant for his final
answer to look at any particular quantitative arguments or formulae. A
crackpot is always convinced that the whole fields of science can be
faithfully summarized in a single over-simplified sentence, and this
sentence is a sufficient tool to exclude thousands of papers without
any need to study what they exactly say and why they do it.

In this category, one must also mention that there are many particular
scientific fields that are simply difficult to understand for most
laymen and where the crackpots concentrate: crackpots can rarely
understand quantum mechanics, relativity, and sometimes not even the
Newtonian physics. Crackpots want to think &quot;big&quot; and therefore they
concentrate around these general enough frameworks, instead of trying
to study the &quot;details&quot;.

Reality can be hard to face, and for some people it seems almost impossible
to ever accept that they were wrong. Time and again, people make theories
and in practice it turns out that their theories were not so absolute and
universal as they hoped.
A good scientist will welcome anyone who can point that out for them. Bad
scientists will resort to insults, as can be seen here in virtually every
message they post in response to my questioning. They prefer to close their
eyes not just for my questions, but for any criticism and any questioning.
All this wouldn't even be such a big point, if these were just a few people
with too large egos. After all, what is fact and what is attitude, one might
wonder. But fact is that scientists demand huge amounts of public money, to
be spent as they please, while risking the huge dangers associated with
development of yet untested weapons of mass destruction. Are people like

However, no-one is willing to listen to a crackpot who is bent on
twisting straightforward English, dodging questions, bluffing
profundity with statements such as 'duality' and 'singularity' in
string theory that took epistemologists such as himself to figure out,
misquoting, misrepresenting and is in no way contributing to anything
concretely. As a scientist, I welcome the lay-persons' suggestions as
they often have something we overlooked. But you're not going that way
-- you are bent on proving yourself 'intellectual' methinks.

Sadly, your last few posts about symbolism being there to intimidate
people, etc etc... reflect your complete lack of understanding in this

&gt;&gt;&gt; misquoting, misrepresenting and is in no way contributing to anything
&gt;&gt;&gt; concretely.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As a scientist, I welcome the lay-persons' suggestions as
&gt;&gt;&gt; they often have something we overlooked. But you're not going that way
&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt; you are bent on proving yourself 'intellectual' methinks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sadly, your last few posts about symbolism being there to intimidate
&gt;&gt;&gt; people, etc etc... reflect your complete lack of understanding in this
&gt;&gt;&gt; regard. I would have to ask you to shut up, simply on grounds of
&gt; letting
&gt;&gt;&gt; intelligent conversation proceed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, at least you're not convincing anyone of anything in this forum
&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt; far as I noticed.

&gt; Insulting someone for misrepresentation, plain dishonesty (intellectual
&gt; and otherwise) is usually acceptable. In case you haven't noticed, there are
&gt; more people in this group against you than me, based primarily on the
&gt; aforementioned reasons.

Remarks like this are defamatory and unacceptable in a group like this. In
this case, they are part of a pattern of ongoing insults, in violation of
the terms set for this group. I call upon the owner(s) of this group to
remove this member.

Oh, my previous post wasn't an insult. It was a statement of facts
based on evidence. Another sign you cannot comprehend plain English.
Now THAT is an insult.

I have forwarded the message to the owner(s) of this group, as further

Zinnic and Goozlefotz have asked you not to misrepresent and be plain
dishonest several times. Then you started the bullshit with me. I'm not
sure why you think you DON'T deserve the insults you've sustained here.

Right, *anyone* who has commented on our conversation has spoken
against you. Notice that?

That doesn't even remotely sound like an apology. This person just keeps
adding insult to insult.

You ask for it. And *everyone* hands it down to you!
For misrepresentation, deliberate misinterpretation, blatant
dishonesty, wild unsubstantiated assertions and dodging straightforward
questions.
Expecting an apology out of the blue is in itself an insult (to
possible injury?) to your intellectual faculties.

No, I don't ask people to insult other people. I expect the group owner to
moderate where people violate the terms and where there seems little or no
reason to assume they will improve their conduct.

It is comforting that this thread is like a TV soap opera: I have been
on vacation for two weeks and I see that I haven't missed a thing.
Anyway, I do not need permission to insult other people; I do it on my
own volition.
