Stop Acid Reflux With Two Natural Supplements

Reflux Gone Forever
http://www.refluxgoneforever.com

Many people approach the treatment of acid reflux like the quest
for the Holy Grail. They become so bogged down with different
opinions that they become confused and give up. When they do,
they tend to rely on the convenience of drugs to treat the
symptoms of acid reflux rather than to seek a cure.

Our culture has become far too dependent on pharmaceuticals to
treat the symptoms of illnesses. Drugs certainly have their
place, but there are also natural ways to treat, if not cure
disease. It would seem that the medical community, at large, is
more concerned with the treatment of symptoms than the
elimination of disease itself. There are three classifications of
drugs which treat acid reflux. The first of these is antacids,
which neutralize the acid in your stomach and are at best only a
temporary fix. They are loaded with harmful ingredients such as
sodium and aluminum.

The next group of drugs is called H2 Blockers. They reduce the
amount of acid that the stomach produces and provide longer
lasting relief than antacids. Finally there are the PPI drugs
(proton pump inhibitors), which shut off the proton pumps in the
stomach that manufacture hydrochloric acid. PPI drugs are the
most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals for the acid reflux
condition. These drugs, in my opinion, which actually stop the
production of stomach acid, are quite dangerous. Obviously, our
bodies were designed to produce stomach acid for a specific
purpose. Stomach acid is necessary to break down, digest and
assimilate food. Without proper digestion and assimilation, our
bodies cannot work as they were designed to. I believe that most
people who pop those PPI drugs are walking around in a state of
malnutrition.

Sometimes we overlook the reality of a negative situation by
choosing convenience over common sense. The simple and natural
way is usually the best way to go. Two inexpensive supplements,
when taken together, can alleviate most acid reflux symptoms, in
time. These supplements are probiotics and digestive enzymes.
Wouldn't it be wiser to take two capsules containing natural
ingredients rather than drugs?  Drugs are expensive and most have
dangerous side effects.

Probiotics are beneficial microbes which protect the digestive
tract by keeping the natural flora in balance. The most well
known is lactobacillus acidophilus, which is found in yogurt and
in supplement form.

A good probiotic should contain at least five billion live
microorganisms per capsule. The ideal composition should include
L. acidophilus, L rhamnosus, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus.
These are considered &quot;friendly bacteria&quot;. They are of great
benefit to the health of the colon and to the immune system, in
general. Taken in conjunction with digestive enzymes, they
balance the digestive system and reduce the possibility of acid
reflux.

Digestive enzymes, which are normally secreted by different
glands in the digestive system, help to break down food molecules
into smaller particles in order to aid digestion. Each enzyme has
a specific function related to different elements of food. For
example: lactase breaks down lactose (milk sugars), protease and
pepsin break down proteins and diatase digests vegetable starch.

Those who suffer from acid reflux usually need more digestive
enzymes than their bodies produce. A good digestive enzyme
supplement should contain protease, amylase, lipase, cellulase,
diastase, invertase, lactase, pectinase and alpha galactosidase.
Just ask for a full spectrum product.

In addition to these supplements aiding the digestive process,
they are also beneficial in treating allergies and skin problems.
When the digestive system is functioning properly, our bodies
become more alkaline. Many believe that disease cannot exist in
an alkaline environment.

In treating acid reflux, you might also consider drinking at
least eight glasses of water each day - more won't hurt. Water
hydrates the body and flushes out the toxins that we collect on a
daily basis. Do not drink anything with a meal as it dilutes
stomach acid and the body produces more to compensate.

Eat raw vegetables as often as possible. Munch on them as snacks
or appetizers before a main meal. Eat fruit and nuts for
breakfast and a salad for lunch. These foods are easy to digest.
The less strain we place on the digestive system, the more energy
we have and the healthier we will be.

Refrain from lying down too soon after a meal. You should allow
at least two hours before doing so. Take a walk instead. Walk for
thirty minutes each day. Aerobic exercise is essential for the
over all health of the body. It encourages a healthy digestive
system.

Chew gum between and after meals. Chewing produces saliva, which
is alkaline in nature and counteracts the over production of
acid. Try to eat slowly in a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere.
Stress is a major cause of poor digestion and ill-health in
general. There are many small things you can do to avoid acid
reflux. Let common sense be your guide.

By taking responsibility for your health and making a few little
changes in life style, you can avoid a problem like acid reflux
before it evolves into a more serious medical issue. Supplements
like probiotics and digestive enzymes will give you a jump start
and get you on your way to better digestive health.
