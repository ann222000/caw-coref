Book Tackles Old Debate: Role of Art in Schools
===============================================

By ROBIN POGREBIN

When two researchers published a study a few years ago concluding that
arts classes do not improve students’ overall academic performance, the
backlash was bitter.

Some scholars argued that the 2000 study’s authors, Ellen Winner and Lois
Hetland of Project Zero — an arts-education program at the Harvard
Graduate School of Education — had failed to mention some beneficial
effects of arts classes that their research had revealed. Others cited
findings that reached the opposite conclusion, indicating that students
who take high-quality art classes indeed do better in other courses. Some
even accused the authors of devaluing arts education and the arts in
general.

But Ms. Winner, Ms. Hetland and two other collaborators are pushing back.
In a new book due out this month, they argue forcefully for the benefits
of art education, while still defending their 2000 thesis.

In their view art education should be championed for its own sake, not
because of a wishful sentiment that classes in painting, dance and music
improve pupils’ math and reading skills and standardized test scores.

“We feel we need to change the conversation about the arts in this
country,” said Ms. Winner, a professor of psychology at Boston College
and a senior research associate at Project Zero. “These instrumental
arguments are going to doom the arts to failure, because any
superintendent is going to say, ‘If the only reason I’m having art is to
improve math, let’s just have more math.’ “

“Do we want to therefore say, ‘No singing,’ because singing didn’t lead
to spatial improvement?” Ms. Winner added. “You get yourself in a bind
there. The arts need to be valued for their own intrinsic reasons. Let’s
figure out what the arts really do teach.”

In their new study Ms. Winner, Ms. Hetland and their co-authors, Shirley
Veenema and Kimberly Sheridan, focused on the benefits accrued through
classes in painting, drawing, sculpture and the other visual arts. The
results are to be published in their book, “Studio Thinking: The Real
Benefits of Visual Arts Education” (Teachers College Press).

They observed students taught by five visual arts teachers in two high
schools in Massachussetts: three at the Boston Arts Academy, a public
urban high school, and two at the Walnut Hill School for the arts, an
independent secondary school in Natick. At both schools, all students
specialize in an art form but are enrolled in a regular academic
curriculum.

The authors videotaped a two- to three-hour class of each teacher once a
month for one academic year. They then zeroed in on what they deemed to
be crucial segments of teaching and learning, showed those clips to the
teacher after each class and interviewed them about their intentions.

“Why did you do that, what was your goal, what kind of learning were you
trying to effect?,” Ms. Winner said, citing some of the questions.

After transcribing all the interviews, the authors spent a year
developing a method for coding the tapes and transcripts according to the
thinking, or “mind habits,” of the teachers as they sought to convey
concepts and strategies to the students.

The researchers found that the visual arts classes did have broad
indirect benefits, even if they were not directly related to quantifiable
performance in other subjects. “Students who study the arts seriously are
taught to see better, to envision, to persist, to be playful and learn
from mistakes, to make critical judgments and justify such judgments,”
the authors conclude.

In a design class taught by Mickey Telemaque at the Boston Arts Academy
mentioned in the book, for example, students are encouraged to look
through a viewfinder with one eye, so that they lose their depth
perception and see the world as if it were a two-dimensional picture with
flat lines, shapes and colors. Ultimately, the exercise not only
demystifies the challenge of drawing but also enables students to grasp
alternative ways of seeing.

Yet some educators assert that improved critical thinking redounds to
measurable academic achievement too. A study by James S. Catterall, a
professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles,
found that students who had more involvement in the arts in school and
after school scored better on standardized tests.

He contends that the executive summary of Ms. Winner’s 2000 study did not
reflect the full results of her research, which he said showed many
positive benefits from arts classes. But Ms. Winner said the three
statistically significant benefits that she found were unrelated to
grades or test results: making music in the classroom improved visual
skills in children; listening to 10 to 15 minutes of classical music
improved the same type of skills in college students (although the
effects lasted only 10 to 15 minutes); and classroom drama improved some
verbal skills.

“When kids take a lot of art, they don’t improve in their core subject
areas,” she said in an interview. “We simply found no evidence of that.”

When students who take art also generally do well in school, Ms. Winner
and her co- researchers say, this may be because academically strong
schools tend to have strong arts programs, or because families who value
academic achievement also value achievement in the arts.

“You cannot conclude that because they’re taking art, they’re doing well
in school,” Ms. Winner said. “There’s just no way to conclude anything
about causality.”

In campaigning for keeping arts education, some educators say, advocates
need to form more realistic arguments.

“Not everything has a practical utility, but maybe it’s experientially
valuable,” said Elliot Eisner, a professor emeritus of education at
Stanford University. “Learning through the arts promotes the idea that
there is more than one solution to a problem, or more than one answer to
a question.”

Edward Pauly, the director of research and evaluation at the Wallace
Foundation, which finances arts education, said that the arts can promote
experiences of empathy and tolerance. “There is no substitute for
listening to jazz, seeing ‘Death of a Salesman’ performed, reading ‘To
Kill a Mockingbird,’ seeing the Vietnam War Memorial,” he said. “Those
powerful experiences only come about through the arts.”

Still, such reasoning may not be sufficient to keep arts education alive
in public schools. “That’s not the kind of argument that gets a lot of
traction in a high-stakes testing environment,” said Douglas J. Dempster,
dean of the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas, Austin.

In a time when President Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policy emphasizes
test results, the arts do not easily lend themselves to quantifiable
measurements.

Art classes are often the first thing to be jettisoned from a crowded
curriculum. As a result, Ms. Winner said, it is understandable that some
arts advocates hew to the academic argument to keep the arts in the
curriculum. “The arts are totally threatened in our schools,” she said.
“Arts advocates don’t even think about whether they’re accurate — they
latch onto these claims.”

“I am an arts advocate,” she added. “I just want to make plausible
arguments for the arts.”

About Project Zero

Project Zero was founded at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in
1967 by the philosopher Nelson Goodman to study and improve education in
and through the arts. Goodman believed that arts learning should be
studied as a serious cognitive activity, but that &quot;zero&quot; had been firmly
established about the field; hence, the project was given its name.

Today, Project Zero is building on this research to help create
communities of reflective, independent learners; to enhance deep
understanding within and across disciplines; and to promote critical and
creative thinking. Project Zero's mission is to understand and enhance
learning, thinking, and creativity in the arts, as well as humanistic and
scientific disciplines, at the individual and institutional levels.

Project Zero's research initiatives build on and contribute to detailed
understandings of human cognitive development and the processes of
learning in the arts and other disciplines. They place the learner at the
center of the educational process, respecting the different ways in which
an individual learns at various stages of life, as well as differences
among individuals in the ways they perceive the world and express their
ideas. Many of these initiatives involve collaborators in schools,
universities, museums, or other settings in the United States and other
countries.
