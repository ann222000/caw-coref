Chime associated with blinker?

I exited the freeway the other day on a long gradual curve of an exit.
I straightened out and stayed in my lane, then noticed the blinker was still
on.  At the same time that I was reaching for the lever, I heard a chime,
same as when the keys are in the ignition, the door is open, etc...  I
quickly looked at my overhead console and the instrument panel to see if
there were any visabale indicators, there wasn't...   So I'm wondering if
there's some sort of audible notification that the blinker has been on for
an excessive length of time?

Ram 2500, 2005, Cummins 4x4.

Thanks,

My '99 Ram chimes out two slow "pings" when the low fuel warning light turns
on. Was your fuel level at 1/8th of a tank when this happened?

If you leave your blinker on for an extended period of time, yes, your chime
will sound to let you know that it's on.

I've done it numerous times and after a while the chime will start. Wondered
what it was at first but turned the blinker off and it stopped....

Aha!

I have '97 Grand Caravan.

Have you tried asking the owner's manual?  I bet it knows the answer... (not
just being a smart-ass...  the procedure to disable the seat-belt chime is
in your manual)

The owners manual does have a way to disable it, I don't have the manual in
front of me, but I recall that it's a trick procedure.  It took me nearly a
dozen attempts.  I spoke with a  service tech and they have problems also,
but it can be done and still leave all other chimes intact.

To bad it's not a little louder, with the windows down and a diesel pruuing
along in front of you, it's a little hard to hear it :-)

And I am sure it wasn't a low fuel or service indicator, or.. etc...

Now I'm going to have to test mine out. I guess I never left the blinker on
long enough to have it chime at me.
I did notice another peculiar thing about my Ram. When I leave my doors open
for more than about 10 minutes the seat belts lock themselves in the
retracted position. I thought I had one jam up on me. I tugged at it,
whacked the seat back, and tried to feed some of the slack back into the
seat to get it free. Nothing helped. I pushed the door jamb button to re-set
the dome lamp timer because it was starting to get dark outside and the seat
belt immediately released. I wonder what the purpose of that is?

I think some cars and trucks have a solenoid as part of the seat-belt
mechanism.  When the solenoid is energized, you can unreel the belt
freely, but when it is powered off, the belt doesn't move or is very
difficult to move.  I suspect that when you first open the door of the
truck, the solenoid is energized, on the premise that you will soon
get in the truck, sit down, and put the belt on.  But if you let the
truck stand with the door open, the solenoid is probably shut off by the
same logic that shuts off the dome light, to help conserve the battery.

On the Ch@vy I owned that I know had solenoids like this, you could hear
a faint click near the belt retractor mechanism when the solenoid engaged
and disengaged, and the belt would sometimes move a fraction of an inch
as well.
