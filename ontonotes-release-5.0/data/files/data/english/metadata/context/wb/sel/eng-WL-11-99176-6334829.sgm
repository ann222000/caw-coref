Although the real count of American dead in Iraq passed 1000 some time ago , today the "official" count hit 1000, as readers undoubtedly know by now. And, once again, Left I on the News takes this opportunity to reiterate the obvious - U.S. troops must leave Iraq now . Not four years from now, not six months from now, not after they are replaced by U.N. troops, not after the situation has "stabilized," but now .

There are many Americans who opposed, or at least now oppose, the invasion and occupation of Iraq, but still think the "out now" position is "unrealistic," that "we" have to "finish the job," that an American pullout now will see Iraq descend into chaos with Iraqis dying left and right. And, again as Left I has noted before, whatever happens after American troops leave couldn't possibly be as bad for Iraqis as what is happening to them right now.

Here are the headlines from from just the last few days :
Item : "US Marines Say Up To 100 Insurgents Killed In Fallujah Air Strikes"
Item : "40 killed in clashes in Sadr City"
Item : "American forces arrest Ezzat al-Douri [sic], 70 men were killed trying to rescue him" That's all on top of the hundreds killed in Najaf recently, and countless (and uncounted) more killed day after day in cities across Iraq..

Some will say it is "unrealistic" to say "out now" because neither Bush nor Kerry (or even Nader, for that matter) are for that position. And that's true. The American people don't get a chance to vote for war, neither to start wars nor to end them. Only constant pressure from people opposed to the war and occupation can do that. Demonstrations, speakouts, actions, letters to the editor, talking to our neighbors, and in short doing everything we can to raise the din of voices shouting "out now" will ever accomplish that goal. So get started (or keep going)!

My only resistance to "out now" is the same as it was in Vietnam: the physical impossibility. It took several months to lay the groundwork for the invasion; it will take time to get everybody out, even assuming a deliberate policy of doing it ASAP.

"Set the date!" was the alternate slogan then and it's the one I push now. (And "the date" is more like "the end of the year," not "when the job is done" or any of that crap.)

So I say STDD&amp;GTHO: Set The Damn Date &amp; Get The Hell Out.

LarryE - I agree - set the damn date - wish 'em the best - and go home. We gave them their freedom - what more do they want?

What pisses me off are people like Condoleezza Rice. She said "Our commitment to Iraq, she says, will be for a "generation."

How can any administration, elected for a single term, commit a nation for a generation to anything?

God, you bleeding heart liberals need to go to France so you can be cowards together and you can all spread your legs and prepare for an injection of terrorism up your asses. You are all scared and pathetic. Also, if Ariel Sharon deserves any criticism, its for not targeting the right places to bomb. They should start in the schools, I want to see palestinian boys and girls dead with charred remains, so I can dance in the street like those bastards did on 9/11. DIE MUSLUMS DIE, kill em all.....

Hey MattA, aren't you sorry you missed the jamboree that was the Nationalist Socialist Party experiment about 50 years ago? They also had a concept of bombing or killing or destroying their way to world supremacy; wonder what happened to that gem of an idea? Oh yeah, it was crushed by the forces of sanity. But of course, you're an American, the whole fucking world belongs to you, so if you want to kill or destroy anyone of your choosing, well Jesus won't mind now will he? After all, Jesus was an American too. Who also loved guns and killing and fear mongering and ignorance, y'all should get along just fine.

Oh, and you want to dance in the streets for the deaths of Palestinian children? What's the matter, you don't get the news in your part of the country? They are killed every single day of the year by zealous morons like you who see political solutions from the barrel of a gun. You like that problem solving technique do you? That's good, because like the occupied territories of Israel, Iraq and Afghanistan will provide an endless parade of death and misery to US forces as long as they remain there.

Put on your red shoes and dance the blues.....

But hey, that shouldn't bother you; everyone knows that the only REAL Amercians are 'shoot first and solve problems later' Americans, and who doesn't like those guys huh?
