IRISH BUTTER.—The *Cork Constitution *says:—&quot;it is worth while to
investigate in *time*, if indeed it be yet in time, the cause of that
decline in the quality of our butter which is rendering so unsaleable.
Newfoundland
is gone—South America is going—and even the West Indies are looking
elsewhere for supplies.  The greater quantity of salt employed in
Continental butter can scarcely be the reason of the preference other latter
obtains, for that has always been the case, and would have affected us
formerly as well as now.   It is not worth the agriculturist's while to
inquire whether turnip-feeding may not have something to do with it?  and
whether his gain in that way is worth the loss which he must anticipate from
the closing of the markets in which his butter has hitherto been accustomed
to find sale?
