The Amazing Puppy Wizard is the cognomen of a dog
behaviorist, Jerry Howe, of Orlando, Fl.  Howe's primary
teaching is that dogs deserve unconditional love, respect,
and attention and that by providing these emotional needs
dogs will regulate their own behavior.

Howe is bombastically antagonistic to rewarders, but he is
aggressively hostile to punishers - he refers antagonists to
B.F. Skinner, Mary Cover Jones, and J.B. Watson and
especially to Samuel A. Corson when they mistakenly
annunciate behavioral principles to support their use of
punishment.

Punishment always deranges behavior, says Skinner, Jones,
Watson, Corson and Jerry Howe!

Howe developed a sonic device which calms dogs and has
been broadly tested in a wide range of different situations.

The present author is a Who's Who recognized psychologist
who was asked to evaluate Howe's device by a former student.

Howe provided the author with a device, without charge, and
said device worked as reported.

George von Hilsheimer, Ph.D., F.R.S.H. Then cross reference
to Jerry Howe, etc.

If you have read the newsgroup posts then you must
already have a good idea about what I think.

His methods are the best I have come across. They
aren't a quick fix but an entire training concept
so if you aren't in for the long haul then don't
bother.

If you go his way then you have to forget all the
other gibberish that other people spew, you have
to believe in what you are doing, then and only
then will you get the results.

You can't combine his methods with other training
methods, not until you  understand what you are
trying to achieve, and even then I have only ever
combined about 2 other trainers ideas and even
then just a snip of what they suggest which works
in parallel with the Wits End concept.

His methods make you as the trainer completely
responsible for your actions, his methods make
you think and work out your own solutions for
any given situation, the default (the recall)
is always there to get things under control again.

His ideas and concepts teach you to work with
the dog, to develop a team and a willingness
to work together which is surely the best way to be.

His methods don't use force or intimidation but
they do totally emphasize the absolute importance
of pack (family pack) structure, without that you
can achieve almost nothing.

If you are wondering how a dog can be trained
without any negativity the answer lies in the
recall, anytime your dog doesn't follow through
with a request you call him / her to you, since
the recall is the first thing taught and it is
taught in such a way it becomes a reflex the dog
always returns to you, it is a subordinate position
for the dog and we release it by asking for a &quot;heel&quot;
which is an &quot;equal&quot; position.

His methods are very good, his understanding
of dogs is excellent, I recommend his methods.

Disciple Paulie Sez:

&quot;No One Understands How Wits End Training Really Works,
They Assume It's All Nicey Nicey And don't Realise It's
A Very Disciplined Method That Deals With Any Situation
And The Foundation Is Built On Trust And Understanding.

I've never forced my dogs to do anything, I tell them
they are good dogs and they seem to follow me, once I
told them they were bad dogs and they ran away from me,
now I only ever tell them they are good dogs and they
always are, always.

Trust your dog, ask it to do your request and say &quot;good
dog&quot; sincerely at the end of the request and I bet you'll
find your dog thinking then responding everytime.

A bit of respect works wonders, the same rule applies to
every aspect of the relationship with your dog.

Obedience and affection are not related, if they
were everyone would have obedient dogs.

I have found giving dogs &quot;payment&quot; in advance i.e.
&quot;Sam sit goodboy&quot; makes the dogs want to respond,
after all, all dogs want to be &quot;good dogs&quot; and if
you tell them they are good then they feel an
obligation to obey your request.

Telling Sam he's a good dog AFTER he sit's apart
from been too late is also a gamble because if he
doesn't sit then there's no positive interaction.

Wits' End Training Method Manual!

ENJOY!!:

Dr. Larry Male (a.k.a. TooCool) ruminates
on Dog Behavior and Dog Training

Dr. Larry Male, Engineer, Scientist and
Mathematician, writes to Dr. Miller about
his dog Duke, the importance of DOG-MASTER®,
and his opinion on other dog &quot;training&quot; methods.

Dear Dr. Miller,

It was such a pleasure for me to talk with
you on the phone this morning.

I never did see your television appearances
although they were well within my era. I think
that I am perhaps 15 years your junior. I wish
I had seen them though.

It was a little ad in Dog Fancy, I think, that
I initially responded to back in 1992. I remember
that the wording seemed to be a bit like a snake
oil salesman, e.g., miraculous, magic learning
sound etc. But at that time, I was investigating
different dog training techniques and I could
easily afford a stamp to find out. But when I
received your literature, I immediately grasped
that this was important and scientific.

I already had my Golden when I received my DOG
MASTER kit and he was perhaps 2 years old at the
time. I had tried my best to train him, using the choke
chain dog training class once a week. Oh, I should
mention that I am currently a software engineer, but I
have a master's in zoology and a doctorate in
mathematics and biometrics.

Anyway, when I received your DOG MASTER System
book I was capable of understanding the magnitude of
your accomplishment.

I had such a great and immediate success that I dropped
out of the dog training class. For 9 more years my Duke
continued to learn more and more and more. He loved to
learn and to show off what he had learned. People were
so amazed at his behavior that they could not believe it.

He responded to complex commands, within
sentences spoken in a normal tone of voice.
To those watching, he must have seemed almost
human. His eyes were always upon me.

I remember that he would lie on the floor watching
me for hours. I could give him subtle hand signals
with my finger to make him sit up, lie down, stand,
stay etc. As he learned, I begin to make the hand
signals less and less obvious. And he learned to
respond to whisper commands. Oh, it was so much
fun and rewarding.

It has been two years now since Duke passed on
and now I have decided to get a Pembroke Welch
Corgi. I have been rereading the DOG MASTER
System book. My poor little book is falling apart
now. But as I reread I begin to realize how much
more effective I could have been if I had followed
your directions more closely.

How much better it will be for me now, to study
and to practice before I get my puppy. When you
already have your dog, you are so anxious to try
the DOG MASTER, that you don't take the time to
grasp the importance of each element of your system.

As I now reread your book, I think to myself,
&quot;How was he able to develop this complex system?&quot;
But each of your directions is supported by an
analysis of dog behavior. These explanations are
so important to me. A human mind requires those
explanations in order to apply the DOG MASTER
System intelligently.

I have purchased a number of top books on clicker
training (operant conditioning). This is the current
rage in dog training. But these authors freely admit
in their books that they no answers for dog behavior
problems.

They don't know how to prevent them or cure them.
They don't seem to know how to housetrain a dog.
Everyday I see dogs walking their owners (dragging
them forward and backwards through the park). The
owners plead and yell and tackle and treat and give
up in frustration.

Their only consolation is that everyone else's
dog behaves the same. I feel so sorry for everyone.

I know that there exists a training system that will
produce a dream dog, but it isn't advertised or
available. The DOG MASTER System is so vastly
superior to any other alternative that I experience
a feeling of great loss that it isn't readily available.

You know, instead of attending dog training classes
before or at least when they get their puppy.

Teach them about dog behavior and show them how
to use DOG MASTER; stress how important it is
to use it precisely according to the directions.

Tell them that they might as well throw it in
the trash if they don't intend to use it properly.
I think that it would be so much easier to grasp
in a good video production. Then you could watch
it over and over. Hey, don't we all need that
timing, rhythm and repetition to learn?

(... and so on....)

Sincerely,

Larry M. Male

A Professor and a Veterinarian compliment Dr. Miller

Correspondence from two professionals
in field of canine studies...

Dear Dr. Miller:

Sometime ago you sent me a complimentary copy of
your book &quot;The Secret of Canine Communication.&quot;
This book has been used extensively in the School
of Veterinary Medicine both by the faculty and the
student body. They have found this a very useful
text and have had much benefit from the opportunity
to review the fine work which you have done.

I do appreciate your kindness in sending me this
book. I will see that it is placed in our Veterinary
Medical Library for the full use of the faculty
and the student body of the school. I am sure that
many of the students will be interested in placing
order for copies of this book as they engage in the
practice of canine medicine.

Sincerely,

Wm. E. Jennings, Professor

Dear Dr. Miller:

The following review has been submitted to
New York City Veterinarian and should be
published in due course, at the discretion
of the Executive Editor:

**********

This is the unique training manual based upon
subliminal suggestion by means of a special
chain that is so constructed that when it is
shaken or thrown it takes advantage of certain
harmonic attributions of the dog, and training
takes place without leash restraint by means
of applying fundamental principles of conditioned
reflex psychology.

Apparent dramatic results have been obtained with
this approach to training, and it seems to render
more conventional approaches obsolete.

The reader who seeks a practical and thorough
lesson in applied canine psychology can learn
a great deal from the careful perusal of this
popularly written manual.

**********

So there you are. I trust it may be helpful to you.

Respectfully yours,

A. Barton, D.V.M.

Subject: Puppy Wizard's Wits End Training Method

http://www.freewebs.com/thesimplyamazingpuppy
wizard/777witsendmanual.htm

I have studied canine behavior and dog
training for years. I have a huge library
that covers every system of training.

The Puppy Wizard's (Jerry Howe's) Wits'
End Training Method is by far the most
scientific, the most advanced, the kindest,
the quickest and the most effective training
method yet discovered.

It is not an assortment of training tips
and tricks; it is a logically consistent
system. Every behavior problem and every
obedience skill is treated in the same
logically consistent manner.

Please study his manual carefully. Please
endeavor to understand the basis of his
system and please follow his directions
exactly. His manual is a masterpiece. It
is dense with theory, with explanation,
with detailed descriptions about why
behavior problems occur and how their
solution should be approached.

One should not pick and choose from among
his methods based upon what you personally
like or dislike. His is not a bag of tricks
but a complete and integrated system for
not only training a dog but for raising a
loving companion.

When I once said to Jerry that his system
creates for you the dog of your dreams,
his response was that it produces for your
dog the owner of his dreams.

You see, Jerry has discovered that if
you are gentle with your dog then he
will be gentle with you, if you praise
your dog every time he looks at you,
then you will become the center of your
dogs world, if you use Jerry's sound
distraction with praise, then it takes
just minutes-sometimes merely seconds-to
train your dog to not misbehave (even in
your absence) (Just 15 seconds this morning
to train my 10 week old puppy to lie quietly
and let me clip his nails).

Using Jerry's scientific method (sound
distraction / praise / alteration /
variation) it takes just minutes to train
you dog to respond to your commands.

What a pleasure it was for me to see my
6 week old puppy running as fast has his
wobbly little legs would carry him in
response to my recall command-and he
comes running every time I call no matter
where we are or what he is doing.

At ten weeks old now, my puppy never
strains upon his leash thanks to Jerry's
hot &amp; cold exercises and his Family Pack
Leadership exercises.

Jerry has discovered that if you scold
your dog, if you scream at him, if you
intimidate him, if you hurt him, if you
force him then his natural response is
to oppose you.

Is Jerry a nut?

It doesn't make any difference to me whether
he is or not. It is a logical fallacy to judge
a person's ideas based upon their personality.
As far as dogs are concerned, Jerry wears his
heart upon his sleeve. It touches him deeply
when he hears of trainers forcing, intimidating,
scolding or hurting dogs.

More than that, he knows  that force is
not effective and that it will certainly
lead to behavior problems; sometime
problems so severe that people put their
dogs down because of those problems.

I believe that it is natural for humans
to want to control their dog by force.
Jerry knows this too. We have all been
at our wits' end, haven't we?

Dogs have a natural tendency to mimic. In
scientific literature it is referred to
allelomimetic behavior. Dogs respond in
like kind to force; they respond in like
kind to praise.

Don't bribe your dog with treats; give him
what he wants most-your kind attention. Give
him your praise.

You will be astonished at how your dog 's
anxiety will dissipate and how their behavior
problems will dissipate along with their anxiety.

Treat Jerry Howe's (The Puppy Wizard) Wits'
End Training Method as a scientific principle
just as you would the law of gravity and you
will have astounding success.

Dog behavior is just as scientific as is gravity.

If you follow Jerry's puppy rules you will get
a sweet little Magwai; if you don't you will
surely get a little gremlin (anyone see The
Gremlins?).

Subject: Dog Behavior Problems

What causes dog behavior problems? Well, first
of all, a dog doesn't know that his behavior is
a problem until you tell him so. But if you
address his behavior negatively then your dog
will tend to repeat it-that is just the nature
of dogs.

Unfortunately for us humans, our natural tendency
is to rebel with emotional outburst, intimidation
or force when our dog's behavior annoys us. But
we must bite our tongue and praise our dog instead.

You do not believe that your dog is out to get
your goat? Just begin to carefully analyze his
behavior. Take for instance the case of the
Mozart hating dog.

Whoever heard of such a thing?  How could such a
bizarre behavior begin and become established? Who
knows for sure, but it could easily happen like this. You
are relaxing listening to your favorite Mozart piece and
your dog begins to play rowdily-he is trying to attract
your attention-but his commotion annoys you.

You get upset and yell at him to shut-up.

Dogs are very sensitive to your emotions-positive
emotions calm them-negative emotions upset them.
But your negative attention has just given your
dog a lesson on how to get your attention.

How many times do think that it will take to make
this behavior automatic? Once, maybe twice is sufficient.

Does your dog act up when you are on the phone?
Why? Does he rush doors? Why? Does he jump up on
you or others? Why? Does he strain upon his leash?

Why?

What can you do to prevent such behaviors
and what can you do to cure them once they
have begun.

The classical conditioning and operant conditioning
schools of thought will advise you to condition your
dog to respond with some other, more acceptable,
behavior to the stimulus which instigates the
misbehavior.

Elaborate schemes are often devised. For instance
condition your dog to run to his crate to get a
treat when guests arrive to prevent him from
jumping upon your guests.

But this school of thought has nothing to
say about preventing such behavior problems
in the first place. And what if you don't
have any treats left? Or what if you are at
your neighbor's house with him?

And what if you wished that your dog would
just sit quietly when guests arrived instead
of each time having to bribe him to come to
his crate?

The force training school of thought will advise
you to scold, intimidate or by some means punish
your dog for what you deem to be misbehavior.

You do not believe that this approach may cause
your dog to dislike or possibly hate you? You do
not believe that your dog will find other, perhaps
more obnoxious, behaviors in order to get even with
you?

This school of thought also has nothing to recommend
upon how to prevent these behavior problems in the
first place.

I recommend that you learn the value of praise
and kind emotions toward your dog. Throw away
your treats and your hickory sticks and raise
a dog who is calm and loving and who never gets
into any trouble.

Learn how to use sound distraction combined with
praise to quickly condition your dog to avoid
behaviors that you dislike; by quickly, I mean
in just a few minutes. Learn to teach your dog
commands in minutes using sound, praise,
alternation and variation while taking advantage
of a dog's natural allelomimetic behavior).

Please study The Puppy Wizard's Wits' End Training Method.

Dogs do not understand the concept of right
and wrong. But it is their nature to oppose
you. If you pull upon them then they will
pull back, if you push upon them then they
will push back, if they chew upon your shoe
and you scold them then they will naturally
chew your shoe again.

Shoo your dog out of your kitchen and he will
immediately come back in. Try to keep him from
charging the door by pushing him away with your
foot and he will charge ever so much more
deliberately and he will become an expert at
avoiding your foot.

Once your dog figures out your intention, he
will figure out a way to oppose it. Your job
is to never oppose your dog-then he will never
oppose you.

For instance, never put tension upon his lead
and he will never strain upon his lead. Praise
him even if you do not approve of his behavior.

Use sound distraction with praise to eliminate
undesirable behaviors as described in the Puppy
Wizard's Wits' End Training Method.

It takes no more than four repetitions to
extinguish an undesirable behavior. This
can take as little as a few seconds. The
undesirable behavior will be extinguished
for good and your dog will have received
nothing but praise.

Since you have given him nothing to oppose,
his natural tendency to oppose will never be
stimulated.

It is so easy. It works like magic.

When you come to understand the principles of
canine behavior, training becomes incredibly
easy. If you oppose those principles of canine
behavior, then you may well battle with your
dog for the rest of his life.

Subject: Re: Dog Behavior Problems

Sound distraction, with praise, works for any
dog, regardless of breed, age, temperament or
past experience. It is not a trick or training
tip. It is a scientific principle that applies
to canines in general. If it did not work for
you, then you did not perform it correctly.

Remember, your sound distraction must be
accompanied immediately by praise lasting
from 5 to 15 seconds. During this 5 to 15
second period your dog will be thinking.

Observe them closely to see the telltale
signs that they are thinking.

The sound distraction must not originate from
the trainer twice in a row. The sound distraction
must alternately originate from the trainer and
then originate from the dog or beyond the dog.

That is why you need something that you can
toss that will not make any sound until it
lands. You begin praising as soon as it makes
its sound.

If the misbehavior continues after four
alternating attempts, then call your dog
to you and retry the sound distraction
with praise a little while later. This
prevents any battles with your dog.

Never use your sound distraction as an aversive
(to frighten or to intimidate)-that invalidates
the scientific principle upon which this method
is based. The praise is just as important as is
the sound distraction.

The scientific principle upon which the sound
distraction with praise method is based is the
same as that of Pavlov's conditioned reflex.

However, it has been proven that this sound
distraction system will condition a behavior
in dogs in less than half the number of attempts
as required by Pavlov's method.

Condition your dog to your praise by praising
them every time that they look at you.

If you desire a thinking dog, never use treats
for training because your dog's mind will focus
upon the food rather than upon his lesson.

Please study the Puppy Wizard's Wits' End
Training Method to learn the entire theory
and application of these principles.

His system is based upon scientific principles
and it is logically consistent from start to finish.

Once you appreciate that it is in the nature
of a dog to oppose you then you will begin to
make rapid progress with your training. You
will then devise your training techniques so
as to avoid any opposition-physical or mental.

Do not let your dog detect any emotion that will
tell him that he is succeeding in opposing you.
In other words never let your dog feel that he
is opposing you, because if you do, he will
certainly frustrate you with continued opposition.

That is why it is so important to always praise
your dog. If you reveal to your dog that he is
not doing what you want him to do, then he will,
by his very nature, continue to oppose you.

If, however, you devise your training methods so
that your dog never knows that he is opposing you,
then you will make rapid progress.

For example, to teach a dog not to forge ahead
of you, simply reverse direction without notice
and praise-this is a training method that reveals
no opposition from you.

Another example: if your dog strains upon his
lead, praise him when his lead is slack. When
he hits the end of his lead, pull him back an
inch and then praise the slack lead.

Since it doesn't take long for a dog's natural
thigmotactic reflex to operate, don't pull back
for more than an instant and then immediately
praise his slack lead.

Whoa, is that ever a naive statement.

And completely untrue.

In fact, I've seen more dogs *not* respond
to sound distraction with praise than those
who do.  Also, some who respond initially
will learn how to tune out the sound.

Here's an example:  A dog is barking his head
off.  I throw a penny can (he doesn't see me
do it).  He is startled and stops barking, and
I praise effusively.  The next time, I make
sure the can is coming from a different direction
and landing in a different place.  The dog still
stops barking for a moment, but the cessation
lasts for a shorter period of time.

The next time I throw the can, he ignores
it completely and continues to bark.

That's such a common reaction, that I pretty
much stopped using the penny can. I attempt
it if nothing else seems to be working, but
it's usually for naught.

I've also seen dogs completely freak at the
sound of a penny can.  It frightens them.
In that case, I do not use it a second time.
It would be cruel.  (And that's also why I
don't use this technique unless nothing else
is working - there's too much risk of scaring
the dog.)

Here's a technique I've found that works a lot
better.  You catch the dog *before* he starts
barking (you have to be aware of his triggers),
and immediately begin praising him and giving
him tidbits of food.  He starts barking, and
you stop praising and feeding, and attempt to
distract him into a different activity.

The moment he stops barking, you praise and
feed again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Never use your sound distraction as an
&gt; aversive (to frighten or to intimidate)
">

Right.  Which is why it is certainly not the
first method of choice.  Too many dogs become
frightened or intimidated.

The sound *is* an aversive, no matter how you
slice it.  It's startling. Certainly not pleasant
to the dog.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you desire a thinking dog, never use treats
&gt; for training because your dog 's mind will focus
&gt; upon the food rather than upon his lesson.
">

Occasionally.  I have seen dogs who are too
focused on the food.  In that case, you try
some other reward (like a toy).  But it's
few and far between.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Once you appreciate that it is in the
&gt; nature of a dog to oppose you
">

There you go again.  More horse feathers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you reveal to your dog that he is not
&gt; doing what you want him to do, then he
&gt; will, by his very nature, continue to
&gt; oppose you.
">

Boggle.

If you let the dog know he is not doing what
you want him to do, he knows he's not going
to get his reward (be it food, toys, or even
just praise).  And he is more motivated to
try to do what you want.  Because it gets
him what *he* wants.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For example, to teach a dog not to forge
&gt; ahead of you, simply reverse direction
&gt; without notice and praise-this is a training
&gt; method that reveals no opposition from you.
">

I'd like to have seen you try this with Madigan
when she was a youngster. Because I *did* try
it with her.

Did.  Not.  Work.

However, reversing direction is a good
technique for many dogs.

But one size does not fit all.  Ever.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Another example: if your dog strains upon
&gt; his lead, praise him when his lead is slack
">

Yes.  I teach that you should be praising the
dog continuously as long as the lead is slack.
When you're first teaching him to walk on a
leash, he has no clue of what you expect.
Praising every moment of him &quot;doing it right&quot;
helps him to understand.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When he hits the end of his lead, pull him
&gt; back an inch and then praise the slack lead.
">

And what dog will leave the lead slack after
you pull it back an inch?

Certainly not long enough to get the first
syllable of praise out.  If he's pulling and
you tug back, even for a second, he will
continue to pull.

Here you go, I'll let you in on a valid
principle of dog behavior.  A much more
sensible way to teach loose leash walking
is to praise and treat when the leash is
slack, and stop walking immediately when
there is tension.

The dog is pulling because he wants to move
forward.  If every time he pulls his forward
motion stops, he will learn that he gets what
he wants by leaving the leash slack.

Pretty simple.

I'm not saying that &quot;Jerry's techniques&quot; (in
quotes because I don't believe he's ever actually
trained a dog) will not work on some dogs.

They will.  But certainly not all dogs.

And IMHO, not even most dogs.

Dogs are not created with a cookie cutter any
more than people are.  What motivates one will
not motivate another.  They are all unique
individuals.

As soon as *any* trainer says that his method
is the only way and works on any dog, I know
that trainer really has no clue about dogs.

Not only is that view of dogs incorrect,
it's incredibly sad.

Cooperation is the nature of all pack animals.
It led the 1st canine to approach the human
campfire and has only been increased by all
the generations of dogs who have been selectively
bred for their cooperative nature.

Opposition only occurs when a dog is anxious &amp;
confused because they can't figure out how to
cooperate with the stupid human who can't
communicate it to them.

It doesn't matter what training method is
followed - any decent owner/handler/trainer
will avoid confrontation if at all possible.

Many never experience any opposition at all,
for the entire life of their dogs.  The smart
ones realize that if they do get opposition,
it's because they failed to utilize the dogs
nature.

&gt; Heh.  I'm guessing you've never trained a deaf
&gt; dog.  Or ever trained to a level where you had
&gt; to choose which of a particular dog's drives
&gt; to use to build a behavior.  Sample problem:
&gt; You're teaching an Eng. Bulldog to jump and
&gt; need to correct his tendency to land on both
&gt; paws at the same time.  How do you fix that
&gt; with sound distraction and praise?
&gt; &gt; Remember, your sound distraction must be
&gt; &gt; accompanied immediately by praise lasting
&gt; &gt; from 5 to 15 seconds. During this 5 to 15
&gt; &gt; second period your dog&gt; will be thinking.
&gt; &gt; Observe them closely to see the telltale
&gt; &gt; signs that they are thinking.
&gt; Reacting, but not necessarily thinking, in
&gt; the sense of making conscious decisions.
&gt; That's why any system that uses only classical
&gt; conditioning is incomplete and limited.
&gt; CC shapes how the dog responds to situations
&gt; but is useless in teaching the dog how to make
&gt; decisions when there are multiple acceptable
&gt; responses.  For example, training a directed
&gt; retrieve of one of multiple identical articles.
&gt; It simply can't be done without OC.  CC is
&gt; great for foundation relationship and attention
&gt; work, but most training requires OC.
&gt; &gt; If you reveal to your dog that he is not
&gt; &gt; doing what you want him to do, then he will,
&gt; &gt; by his very nature, continue to oppose you.
&gt; BS.  The whole point of correction (which a
&gt; sound distraction is) is to signal you want
&gt; a different behavior.  The whole point of
&gt; training is for the dog to know what behavior
&gt; you are asking for instead of the behavior
&gt; that prompted the correction, eventually
&gt; eliminating the need for the correction.
&gt; &gt; For example, to teach a dog not to forge
&gt; &gt; ahead of you, simply reverse direction
&gt; &gt; without notice and praise-this is a training
&gt; &gt; method that reveals no opposition from you.
&gt; Except for that leash-tightening, opposition
&gt; reflex thing, of course :-)  Far better to
&gt; stop and ask for attention and praise eye
&gt; contact.
&gt; Even better to teach the dog where you want
&gt; him to be in the first place, totally avoiding
&gt; confrontation about forging or pulling.  Shape
&gt; the behavior you want instead of wasting training
&gt; time eliminating unwanted behaviors.

Those who use operant conditioning produce
a robotic like animal that is unable to think out
different situations. Those dogs are as lost as
a fish out of water when environmental conditions
do not match those conditions under which they
were conditioned.

Yes, operant conditioning can be used to
condition robotic like behavior. It can
be used to tune intricate performance with
amazing accuracy. Who remembers the B.F.
Skinner conditioning boxes used by B.F.
Skinner's students to condition ducks to
play a tune on the piano and to condition
raccoons to do tricks?

These specially constructed boxes were designed
to automatically condition a specific behavior.

In the 50's these animals were exhibited at
carnivals all over the US and Japan. B.F.
Skinner himself designed a bomb guidance system
that used four pigeons to guide a bomb to its target.

My Golden Retriever was trained using Dr Dare
Miller's DOG MASTER SYSTEM. This system
is almost identical to The Puppy Wizard's Wits'
End Training Method. I would practice agility
feats with Duke.

On command and with hand signals, he would run
along curbs, he would jump back and forth through
swings at the playground, he would climb 12 foot
ladders to slide down the slide, he would take
directed jumps over what ever I directed, he
would take flying leaps into the water, he would
run through tunnels and he would navigate narrow
logs across a stream.

Until we once visited a dog show at a local park,
he had never seen an agility course. In order to
drum up interest in the sport they were letting
novices try it out. When they timed Duke, he was
off the course record by only a fraction of a
second.

That is what I mean by training a thinking dog.

I am opposed to the direction that obedience
training and that even agility training has
taken. Robotic like behavior is rewarded in
these trials. The movements of these dogs
do not appear natural. They move in a robotic
like manner. Some with their head unnaturally
cocked as if looking for the treat in their trainer's
hand.

I would like to see these trials reward dogs
that are trained to think out situations. The
value of operant conditioning would then fade
from existence.

behavior. She does not follow any scientific
training system. She does not comprehend that
dog brains are all the same, i.e., that they
all work according to the same basic principles
and that they all obey the same laws of behavior.

Her training consists of just trying different
things hoping that something will work.

She would like to lead people to believe that
there aren't any principles of canine behavior
and that no system of training that can be used

She wants people to believe that dog training

She condemns those who use a scientific system,
but she uses no logical arguments--name calling
and sarcasm are her trademarks. Her rantings
should be ignored.

She does not realize that any sound distraction
can be used, even sounds that are subliminal to
a dog's hearing.

If she scares her dogs, then she is not using
sound distraction, but is instead using an
aversive.

If her dogs ignore the sound, then she is not
praising immediately. It is not the resulting
behavior that should be praised but instead
the sound.

This system of sound distraction has been
perfected through testing upon thousands
of dogs. See &quot;The Secret of Canine Communication&quot;
by Dr Dare Miller (1969).

Please read the Puppy Wizard's Wits' End
Training Method to learn how to properly
perform sound distraction with praise.

It cannot fail if performed properly-it is
a scientific principle just as is Pavlov's
conditioned reflex.

But you cannot take your own liberties with
the technique. You must perform it properly
in order to succeed.

If you seem to be failing, go back and reread
the instructions again. Don't blame the system-
don't blame your dog.

You wouldn't expect to hypnotize someone if
you didn't perform the technique correctly,
would you?

&gt; had a handful who haven't responded well,
&gt; and none who didn't learn and improve their

&gt; But reward-based training doesn't consist of

Yes, Leah, to call someone naïve is name-calling.
It is a logical fallacy to attempt to discredit
an idea by attempting to discredit the person who
espouses it.

Appeal to authority is also a logical fallacy.

An idea's truth cannot be gauged by the
credentials of the person who espouses it.
Yes, I have read the authors that you mention
and they are just as mistaken as are you.

Sarcasm is also a logical fallacy. Your own
distaste for an idea is irrelevant to its truth.

Those who are persuaded through logical fallacy
have been tricked. Their attention has been
surreptitiously diverted away from the idea in
question.

Those who employ logical fallacies should
apologize to everyone.

Yes, all dogs can be trained using the same system-
failure reflects upon your system, not upon the dog.

Dog brains are all the same.

Canine psychology is a science. Those who learn
it can train any dog using the same system.

Dogs are not born with individual personalities.

Personalities are formed and they can be changed.

If you are gentle with your dog, if you treat
him with kindness, respect and praise, then his
personality will be a reflection of that treatment.
If you bribe your dog, if you force him physically
or mentally then his personality will reflect that
treatment as well.

A training system not based upon knowledge of
canine psychology will fail or its success may
be hit and miss because it may be only partly
based upon canine psychology.

Those who claim that their training technique
must be individually tailored to a dog's
personality are not using a system based
upon knowledge of canine psychology. To claim,
for instance, that sound distraction with praise
doesn't always work is like claiming that some
dogs cannot be conditioned to salivate at the
ring of a bell.

It is just a scientific impossibility if
the method is performed correctly.

A basic tenant of canine psychology is that
it is the nature of a canine to oppose you.

That does not mean that a canine won't do what
you want him to do; it means that he will oppose
what he detects that you don't want him to do.

The way to defuse this natural opposition is to
never let your dog detect your intention-never
let him know what you don't want him to do.

That is why praise, even for behaviors that
you deem undesirable is so important.

If your dog detects the slightest indication
that you disapprove of his behavior then he
will drive you nuts repeating it-it is as if
he is out to get your goat.

Unfortunately, natural human reaction is in
direct conflict with the principles of canine
psychology.

When a dog continually repeats an obnoxious
behavior, a human tends to get emotionally
upset. Even without any overt physical action,
a dog can detect your emotional disapproval
and this naturally drives him to continue
his obnoxious behavior.

But if you can successfully hide your disapproval
and praise them instead, then the stimulus that
motivates them disappears and their obnoxious
behavior may cease.

If it does not immediately cease, then sound
distraction with praise, will quickly extinguish
the behavior.

Thus a training system based upon canine
psychology will emphasize the positive.
Don't worry about your dog's mistakes.
Realize that your dog will become more
and more sensitive to your worry and that
will cause him to repeat the behaviors of
which you disapprove.

There is innate temperament that is

OTOH, I also see dogs that have never had a single

such a client right now, a 9 month old GSD who we've
been fighting to save for months.

He's been seen by Jean Donaldson and Leslie Nelson
and a slew of others, and has received nothing by
loving care all his life.

His littermates are normal, his breeding excellent,
and there was no triggering event or medical cause
.
As much as it breaks my heart, the dog cannot be saved.

&quot;Put a prong collar with a six-foot leash on

Electronics can be used to create an aversion
to cats, but should be used under the direction
of a trainer who knows how to instruct the owner
in their proper use.

Electronics can take the form of shock, sonic or
citronella collars.  At that time the owner will
train with electronics instead of food or whatever
other reward system was being used.&quot;

Have the dog in a sit-stay next to you with most
of the slack out of the leash and let the cat walk
through the room and up to the dog if it wishes
(this is why you have the dog muzzled).

If the dog makes an aggressive move towards the
cat, it must be corrected strongly with both your
voice and the collar.

This is important - the correction must be
physically very strong - not a nag.

I've found dog parks to be great places for
proofing the recall, even with young puppies.
Let the pup play with other pups, while on a
long line.

Call the pup, reeling in if necessary, and
praise the heck out of him, then let him go
play again.  The reason this works so well
at the dog park is that the pup learns that
leaving the fun to obey the command doesn't
mean the fun is over.  A very good thing to
learn early.

Timing is critical here, because what you want
is for him to think about escaping, maybe even
start, but still have time to give the command
and have him decide to come back to you before
he hits the end of the long line.

The very 1st thing is to secure her while
you're training so she can't chase when
you are preoccupied and can't work with her.

And, yes, I've had more than a few &quot;come to
Jesus meetings&quot; with dogs over willful
disobedience.

Example - pup who knows full well what a recall
is hits adolesence and decides that the recall
is optional.

Putting him back on a long line and doing 5 fast
recalls is a &quot;come to Jesus meeting&quot;.  Or if he
suddenly decides that he can release himself from
a down/stay after being solid at it for 5 months,
and turns it into a catch-me game, a sharp downward
collar correction as you put him back into position
is a &quot;come to Jesus meeting&quot;.

Don't infer from that description that force is an
intrinsic part of it, though, because it isn't.

I know that that is what you are trying to get at,
but you'd be very wrong.

Thanks Jerry,

I enjoyed the scientific discussion debunking
operant conditioning for teaching thinking animals.
Humans think by forming concepts. All of their
knowledge is held as a hierarchy of concepts
(more complex concepts defined in terms of
simpler ones). In my mind, to treat such a being
as a B. F. Skinner robot is criminal.

I don't believe that dogs hold their knowledge
as concepts as do humans but their ability to
think is unquestionable.

Operant conditioning doesn't utilize an animal's
ability to think. When you show a dog what you
want them to do, then they are able to grasp the
problem; they are able to think about it and to
integrate possible solutions into their mind.

But with operant conditioning a trainer is actually
hiding the problem to be solved from the animal.

For example, it is good for your dog's attention to
be upon you. When heeling, he will notice your
movements, your subtle hand signals, your facial
expressions and he will immediately sense your
next command. But the clicker trainers have forgotten
the reasons why a dog's attention should be upon you.

So they condition a dog to unnaturally cock his
head to stare upward at you. The dog doesn't
appreciate the meaning of this and neither does
the trainer. Since this unnatural behavior is
prized in the obedience ring, the clicker
trainers are motivated to condition it.

Don't you think that the &quot;high five&quot; hand shake
that clicker trainers use to motivate novices
looks like a Nazi salute (an unthinking reflex).
It is not at all like a warm hand shake from a
loving companion, is it?

Some of your testimonials bring tears to my eyes.
I love to see how some &quot;thinking&quot; people appreciate
your methods.

Using a proper training method, a method
consonant with a dog's nature, it is possible
to enhance a dog's ability to think.

If their thinking faculty is not exercised and
developed then dogs have a tendency to bounce
around, like a billiard ball, from one stimulus
to another.

But when a dog's thinking faculty is exercised and
developed then they enjoy using that faculty more
and more. They begin to feel pride in their
accomplishments-you can observe their delight in
the way that they love to show off what they have
learned.

As their thinking faculty develops you will begin
to see them improvise more and more, i.e., applying
what they have learned to new situations.

Operant conditioning (clicker training) does not
exercise a dog's ability to think-it conditions a
reflex like reaction at the nervous system level.

If you desire to train a thinking dog, please read
the Puppy Wizard's Wits' End Training Method-
it caters to the nature of our thinking dogs.

Your SCIENTIFIC STUDIES PROVES your

Dr. George VonHilsheimer writes in
&quot;Is There A SCIENCE Of BEHAVIOR?&quot;:

&quot;Valette 1966 is a complete trivialization of
scientific findings. It overstates the case for
reinforcement theory. No careful researcher
would contend that operant techniques CAN
ANY THING MORE than modify SHORT TERM
BEHAVIOR in a highly controlled and limited
environment with a large number of skillful
experimenters. Certainly the most elaborate
studies have shown that the withdrawal or
temprary inefficiency of the reward system is
immediately followed by CESSATION of the
programmed behavior.

In fortunate contrast to this depressing paper
is the research reported by Whelan (1966) who
makes the simple but profHOWEND caveat that
&quot;It is only through CORRECT, EFFICIENT APPLICATION
(of operant principles) that children's behavor can
be changed to the extent that they can subsequently
contribute to the REAL WORLD in which they live.&quot;

Dr. Von continues:

&quot;Whelan illustrates the simple nature or the
learning process by referring to Ferster's
engaging study of two three year old
chimpanzees taught mathematics through
simple procedures. Whelan carries this
EVIDENCE a step futher by pointing HOWET
it's applicability to disturbed children.&quot;

A Dog Is A Dog As A Child Is A Child As A Kat

Innate, Normal, Natural, Instinctive, Reflexive,
Ways To Circumstances And Situations Of Their
Environments Which We Create For Them.

ALL BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY
MISHANDLING. Damn The Descartean War of
&quot;Nature Vs Nurture.&quot; We Teach By HOWER Words
And Actions And GET BACK What We TAUGHT.

In The Problem Animal Behavior BUSINESS
FAILURE MEANS DEATH. SAME SAME SAME
SAME, For The Problem Child Behavior BUSINESS.

Dr. Von continues:
&quot;If  chimpanzees CAN LEARN mathematics
through step by step learning AT THEIR OWN
PACE, reinforced primarily by CORRECT
ANSWERS rather than with &quot;fruit loops and
rasins&quot;, we can assume that even developmentally
RETARDED or CONfHOWENDED children CAN
LEARN as well. Moreover, Whelan makes the
EXXXTREMELY important point that while most
teachers assume that learning takes place verbally,
primarily it is a non verbal process..

Unfortunately Whelan limits himself to the
problem that &quot;teachers must not only modify
or remove specific deviant behaviors, but
must also develop socially acceptable behavior
patterns in the classroom and classroom
conditioned goals, NOT LEARNING.

Other researchers have emphasized the importance
ofadult behaviors in conditioning classroom behavior.
An EXXXCELLENT review of this researchshowd that
tantrum behavior, excessive crawling and dependency,
isolated play, passivity, spelling failure, and other problem
behaviorscan be managed by altering habitual adult
responses to children (Harris, Wolf and Baer, 1964) .

Such RESEARCHholds GREATER PROMISE in that
alteration of the conditioning social environment seems
to provide more STABLE and LASTING CHANGES
than &quot;M and M's&quot;.

Moreover, a great deal of work has been
done developing EFFECTIVE techniques of
behavior modificaton through the conditioning
social environment of peers (Hartup, 1964).

These directions would seem more PRODUCTIVE
than a simple minded trainslation of the
Skinner cage to the classroom.

Skinner (1963) pointed HOWET that operant techniques
can &quot;be utilized fully ONLY IF we REDEFINE the GOALS
of education and the CONDITIONS in the educational
environment under which those goals may be reached...
(through) a DIFFERENT KIND of educational research
which is much more closely concerned with the immediate
dimensions of the student's behavior than with gross
changes such as IMPROVED PERFORMANCES.&quot;

UNFORTUNATELY, neither Skinner nor ANY OTHER
learning theorist has provided us with a
working model of a school or research enterprise
based on systemic and thorough-going APPLICATION
of LEARNING PRINCIPLES. Skinner (1948, 1953)
approaches a definition of the philosophical
issues involved, and provides an utopian model
of a school, but generally psychologists seem
STUCK at a level of MANAGEMENT of an aggressively
disturbing child in the classroom, through peer
approval, or the aplication of accelerating
CONsequences in the classroom, or scientifically
S-HOWENDING tactics like &quot;TIME HOWET&quot; (which
we used to know more simply as &quot;sendin the kid
to the cloakroom&quot;).

Hobbs (op. cit.) claims that the classroom is a
natural environement for the child. Thelen (1965)
contends that &quot;classroom practices are UNnatural,
UNreasonable, and 'against NATURE.' &quot;.  This
would seem the central issue for the philosophy of
education. Mere trivial application of research findings
to an institution essentially unchanged from Sumerian
academies (Kramer, 1962) will NOT create useful
teaching for human beings.

It seems relevant to ask EXXXACTLY WHAT do we
know abHOWT the learning situation in which HOWER
children find themselves, and why, in the light
of HOWER knowledge, do we do any of the things
that schools do?&quot;

We know that there is little agreement among adults
as to what it is they are SUPPOSED to be DOING,
what something to do could be that MIGHT be
EFFECTVE, and what it IS that other people who
have authority over children ought to be doing (Mc-
Eachern and Taylor, 1967). Wherefor the child's
CONfusiHOWEN?

It is NO WONDER hat the marked changes in
deviant behavior of children can be achieved
through brief, simple educative routines with
their mothers which modify the mother's
social behaviors shaping the child (Whaler,
1966). Some clinics have reported ELIMINATION
ofthe need for child THERAPY through changing
the clinical emphasis from  clinical to parental
HANDLING of the child (Szrynski 1965). A large
number of cases improved sufficiently after
preliminary contact with parents that NO treatment
of children was required, and almost ALL cases
SHOWE a remarkably shortened period for therapy.
Quite severe cases of anorexia nervosa have been
treated in own to five months by simply REPLACING
the parents temporarily with EFFUSIVELY LOVING
SUBSTITUTES (Groen, 1966).

Probably the most absurd figure in  Amaerican mass
media is the TEACHER (Gerbner, 1966). HOWE can
we EXXXPECT children to LEARN responsible P-HOWER
from models of IMPOTENCE? We KNOW that LEARNING
a complex ritualized social role, is facilitated by observation
of an INTELLIGIBLE MODEL much more effectively than by
trial and error with REINFORCEMENT. Roles which are
relatively arbitrary and senseless are the most difficult to
learn (Luchins, 1966).

Do we make ANY EFFORT as teachers to CORRECT the
massive impact of media? HOWE can the ARBITRARINESS
and SENSELESSNESS of IMPOTENT ADULT MODELS be
redeemed by anything short of RELEVANCE and
COMMITMENT?

As an engaging final comment on the PROFESSION
let me mention the little study by Dittman et al (1965) tha when 15
psychotherapists and 9
professional dancers evaluated facial and
bodily expressons for effect the dancers were
much MOORE accurate. Need we say MOORE abHOWET
the training of therapists?

THE OPERANT FALLACY

Programs utilizing the &quot;contingencies of
reinforcement model&quot; proposed by Skinner
(1963) ar no more well established in
research than the various dynamic therapists.

Research in four areas : 1) direct evaluation of
programmed systems for elarning; 2) reinforcement;
3) cognitive dissonance; and  4) motivation, MOST
SURELY DEMOLISH eth claims of operant programers.

The 190 studies annotated by Schramm (1964)
when inspected display NO SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES in SUCCESS among approaches and
modifications.

Programmed instruction is no worse than
conventional instruction, and takes less
time, but time reductions in conventional
instruction has frequently been shown
possible without detrimental effects.

If you draw your controls cagily you can
always show the superiority of your PET
technique.

Moore and Smit (1964) compared variations on
programmed materials, machines, texts, written
responses, merely reading, free response, multiple
choice, and iving or not giving the students results.
There were NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES despite
Skinner's insistence on the importance of the
CONTINGENCY of REINFORCEMENT.

Carpenter and Greenhill (1963) could find NO
DIFFERENCE in RESULTS even after eliminating
the self-pacing feature by presenting the
materials by TV or Video.

Krumboltz and Kiesler (1965) reported that a
two month follow up test showed NO DIFFERENCE
between students given a variety of reinforcement
schedules. Mayo and Longo (1966) report that
naval and marine trainees saved 30% of time in
learning electronics fundamentals through a
programed course witrh superior scores on one
measure but not on another, and with no follow-
up reported.

The same authors reported a reductionj from
26 HOWERS to 19 HOWERS in instruction time
through the use of program with NO DIFFERENCE
in test scores, except that as longer blocks
of materiallearned through programmed
means were tesed the scores DECREASED.

When the control instruction is manipulated an
entirely DIFFERENT picture emerges Jacobs and
Kulkarni (1966) assignedstudents in three different
schools to classes with standard programmed
material giving immediate knowledge of results
to classes without results and to classes with
the order of sections of the program inverted.

In two schools the groups without knowledge of
results and the groups with inverted material
SCORED HIGHER.

In one school there was NO DIFFERENCE.

So much for THEORY.

Reid and Taylor (1965) presented a linear
program on paper-making to 60 paid undergrads
with a 12 week follow up test. The group which
merely read learned the same material in 154
minutes to 243 minutes for the group given
responses-a REVERSAL of the usual BIASED RESULTS
based on POOR CON-TROLLS.

There were no differences on post tests.

Spagnoli (1965) reports on a study exposing
the control and programed group to the same
material in a concentrated effort over a
limited period of time.

There were NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES.

Sassenrath and Garverick (1965) gave 4 matched
groups of 120 students four procedures: 1) looking
up the wrong answers, 2) having questions discussed
by the instructors, 3) checking answers from correct
ones on the board, and 4) no feedback. The discussion
method proved best.

&lt;snip&gt;

Finally, in studying means of training men
to perform a 72 action prcedure on Nike-
Hercules equipment, Cox and Boren (1965)
demonstrated that the time required to learn
the procedure to critterion was NO DIFFERENT
when the actions were organized into seven
operant spans and taught in reverse order,
in natural order, or without grouping into
operant spans at all.

IT IS CLEAR that as comparisons became more
sophisticated programed instruction and other
operant teaching techniquesreveal tehemselves
as simply another prestigiHOWES FAD--somewhat
better than conventional instruction in saving
time, but certainly not providing a better or
better organized or more independently useful
GRASP of KNOWLEDGE.

The IMBECILITY of some ofthe claims for operant
technique simply take the breath away. Lovas et
al (1966) report a standard contingent reward/
punishment procedure developing imitative speech
in two severly disturbed non verbal schizophrenic
boys.

After twenty-six days the boys are reported to
have been learning new words with alacrity.
HOWEver, when REWARDS were moved to a delayed
contingency the behavoir and learning immediately
deteriorated.

Despite this, and despite the fact that there
was no evidence of cognitive association with
the words, the authors leap to the conclusion
that the fact that the boys improved in the
acquisition of Norwegian words WITHOUT REWARDS
while still being given English words WITH REWARDS
suggest hat the children may be able to acquire
new behaviors on their own.

The need for this study escapes one,
particularly in view of the very well
established fact that schizophrenics
condition quite readily (Mednick, 1958)

One can see the &quot;SCIENTIFIC&quot; PRECISION by
which the authors drop contingent reinforcements
thus PROVING that the parrot behavior was
indeed caused by the schedule and NOT by some
other mystical force.

The use of Norwegian to demonstrate learning
that could not even remotely be related to
previous history is a grotesquery too bizarre
to be credited. Who could possibly doubt that
this useless and probably damaging trained seal
routine depended on the psychologist's antics?

What on earth led them to believe that
a schizophrenic needs even more other-
focused responsiveness?

Lovaas et al (1965) reported three programs
carried out on five year old autistic twins
conditioining them to &quot;social behavior&quot; and
to eliminate pathologial behaviors such as
self-stimulation and tantrums.

Affectionate and other social behaviors toward
adults increaseed after adults had been associated
with shock reduction. The routine for this treatment
brings immediate relief to mind Sawrey and Wesz
(1956) routine for producing ulcers in monkeys.

I suppose it is USELESS to speculate on the source
of SO CALLED THERAPISTS willingness to experiment
on human beings with procedures for which there is
sound experimentally established WARNINGS. If the
&quot;double blind&quot; theory of the origin of schizophrenia
(Bateson, 1956) is at all valid, HOWE DEVASTATING
the experience must ULTIMATELY BE.

Do Lovaas et al REALLY BELIEVE the schizophrenic
has no cognitive processes and DOES NOT KNOW WHO
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOCK?

Greger (1965) criticized this study on the basis
that trainsfer CANNOT be generalized. That issue
can be answered by experience, and, of curse, the
&quot;social&quot; behavior of these children deteriorates
as soon as the psychologists LOOSE INTEREST.

The IMPORTANT ISSUE for a SCIENCE OF BEHAVIOR
is why not attempt those things which are KNOWN
to WORK at least in some cases if only for control
puporses.

Kanner (1954) reports that 13 classically
autistic children improved enough to go to
school without &quot;anything that is regarded
as good psychotherapy or as psychotherapy
at all...&quot;

Autistic children have been known to become
permenantely social by deinstitutionalization,
BY REMOVAL from the parents, BY RADICAL CHANGES
in other environments, and by MASSIVE DOSAGE of
TOUCHING, HOLDING, FONDLING LOVE DESPITE THE
REJECTION OF THE CHILD.

My case, Larry, (vonHilsheimer, 1965b),
demonstrates a recovery by using the
mother as an autistic boy's teacher in
an open millieu.

It is curiHOWES that the operant technicians
provide as few, and as UNIMAGINITAVE controls
for thier &quot;research&quot; as the Freudians.

REWARD / PUNISHMENT

Despite Skinner's clear denunciation of &quot;negative
reinforcement&quot; (1958) NEARLY EVER LEARNING
THEORY model involves the USE OF PUNISHMENT.
Of curse, Skinner has never to my knowledge,
demonstrated HOWE we escape the phenomenon
that an expected reward not received is experienced
as a punishment and can produce extensive and
persistent aggression (Azrin et al, 1966).

MIMICRY, PLAY, EXPLORATION AND
THE NEED FOR DATA

Complex activities are LEARNED MORE QUICKLY
through OBSERVATION (copying, if you will) than
by trial and error with reinforcemet (Luchins,).

Observers of subjects making a first trial of a multiple
choice bolt head maze made fewer errors than the
practiced subjects in the second run, while subjects
who have been shocked for error on a first trial made
more errors than either (Rosenbaum &amp; Hewitt, 1966).

Students will modify their beliefs more when
rewarded for the way in which they carried out
arguing for a disagreeable position (role reward),
than when rewarded for the content of the argument
(Wallace, 1966).
