The Tax-Cut Con
By PAUL KRUGMAN

1. The Cartoon and the Reality

Bruce Tinsley's comic strip, ''Mallard Fillmore,'' is, he says, ''for
the average person out there: the forgotten American taxpayer who's
sick of the liberal media.'' In June, that forgotten taxpayer made an
appearance in the strip, attacking his TV set with a baseball bat and
yelling: ''I can't afford to send my kids to college, or even take 'em
out of their substandard public school, because the federal, state and
local governments take more than 50 percent of my income in taxes. And
then the guy on the news asks with a straight face whether or not we
can 'afford' tax cuts.''

But that's just a cartoon. Meanwhile, Bob Riley has to face the
reality.

Riley knows all about substandard public schools. He's the governor of
Alabama, which ranks near the bottom of the nation in both spending
per pupil and educational achievement. The state has also neglected
other public services -- for example, 28,000 inmates are held in a
prison system built for 12,000. And thanks in part to a lack of health
care, it has the second-highest infant mortality in the nation.

When he was a member of Congress, Riley, a Republican, was a staunch
supporter of tax cuts. Faced with a fiscal crisis in his state,
however, he seems to have had an epiphany. He decided that it was
impossible to balance Alabama's budget without a significant tax
increase. And that, apparently, led him to reconsider everything.
''The largest tax increase in state history just to maintain the
status quo?'' he asked. ''I don't think so.'' Instead, Riley proposed
a wholesale restructuring of the state's tax system: reducing taxes on
the poor and middle class while raising them on corporations and the
rich and increasing overall tax receipts enough to pay for a big
increase in education spending. You might call it a New Deal for
Alabama.

Nobody likes paying taxes, and no doubt some Americans are as angry
about their taxes as Tinsley's imaginary character. But most Americans
also care a lot about the things taxes pay for. All politicians say
they're for public education; almost all of them also say they support
a strong national defense, maintaining Social Security and, if
anything, expanding the coverage of Medicare. When the ''guy on the
news'' asks whether we can afford a tax cut, he's asking whether,
after yet another tax cut goes through, there will be enough money to
pay for those things. And the answer is no.

But it's very difficult to get that answer across in modern American
politics, which has been dominated for 25 years by a crusade against
taxes.

I don't use the word ''crusade'' lightly. The advocates of tax cuts
are relentless, even fanatical. An indication of the movement's fervor
-- and of its political power -- came during the Iraq war. War is
expensive and is almost always accompanied by tax increases. But not
in 2003. ''Nothing is more important in the face of a war,'' declared
Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, ''than cutting taxes.'' And sure
enough, taxes were cut, not just in a time of war but also in the face
of record budget deficits. Nor will it be easy to reverse those tax
cuts: the tax-cut movement has convinced many Americans -- like
Tinsley -- that everybody still pays far too much in taxes.

A result of the tax-cut crusade is that there is now a fundamental
mismatch between the benefits Americans expect to receive from the
government and the revenues government collect. This mismatch is
already having profound effects at the state and local levels:
teachers and policemen are being laid off and children are being
denied health insurance. The federal government can mask its problems
for a while, by running huge budget deficits, but it, too, will
eventually have to decide whether to cut services or raise taxes. And
we are not talking about minor policy adjustments. If taxes stay as
low as they are now, government as we know it cannot be maintained. In
particular, Social Security will have to become far less generous;
Medicare will no longer be able to guarantee comprehensive medical
care to older Americans; Medicaid will no longer provide basic medical
care to the poor.

How did we reach this point? What are the origins of the antitax
crusade? And where is it taking us? To answer these questions, we will
have to look both at who the antitax crusaders are and at the evidence
on what tax cuts do to the budget and the economy. But first, let's
set the stage by taking a look at the current state of taxation in
America.

2. How High Are Our Taxes?

The reason Tinsley's comic strip about the angry taxpayer caught my
eye was, of course, that the numbers were all wrong. Very few
Americans pay as much as 50 percent of their income in taxes; on
average, families near the middle of the income distribution pay only
about half that percentage in federal, state and local taxes combined.

In fact, though most Americans feel that they pay too much in taxes,
they get off quite lightly compared with the citizens of other
advanced countries. Furthermore, for most Americans tax rates probably
haven't risen for a generation. And a few Americans -- namely those
with high incomes -- face much lower taxes than they did a generation
ago.

To assess trends in the overall level of taxes and to compare taxation
across countries, economists usually look first at the ratio of taxes
to gross domestic product, the total value of output produced in the
country. In the United States, all taxes -- federal, state and local
-- reached a peak of 29.6 percent of G.D.P. in 2000. That number was,
however, swollen by taxes on capital gains during the stock-market
bubble.

By 2002, the tax take was down to 26.3 percent of G.D.P., and all
indications are that it will be lower still this year and next.

This is a low number compared with almost every other advanced
country. In 1999, Canada collected 38.2 percent of G.D.P. in taxes,
France collected 45.8 percent and Sweden, 52.2 percent.

Still, aren't taxes much higher than they used to be? Not if we're
looking back over the past 30 years. As a share of G.D.P., federal
taxes are currently at their lowest point since the Eisenhower
administration. State and local taxes rose substantially between 1960
and the early 1970's, but have been roughly stable since then. Aside
from the capital gains taxes paid during the bubble years, the share
of income Americans pay in taxes has been flat since Richard Nixon was
president.

Of course, overall levels of taxation don't necessarily tell you how
heavily particular individuals and families are taxed. As it turns
out, however, middle-income Americans, like the country as a whole,
haven't seen much change in their overall taxes over the past 30
years. On average, families in the middle of the income distribution
find themselves paying about 26 percent of their income in taxes
today. This number hasn't changed significantly since 1989, and though
hard data are lacking, it probably hasn't changed much since 1970.

Meanwhile, wealthy Americans have seen a sharp drop in their tax
burden. The top tax rate -- the income-tax rate on the highest bracket
-- is now 35 percent, half what it was in the 1970's. With the
exception of a brief period between 1988 and 1993, that's the lowest
rate since 1932. Other taxes that, directly or indirectly, bear mainly
on the very affluent have also been cut sharply. The effective tax
rate on corporate profits has been cut in half since the 1960's. The
2001 tax cut phases out the inheritance tax, which is overwhelmingly a
tax on the very wealthy: in 1999, only 2 percent of estates paid any
tax, and half the tax was paid by only 3,300 estates worth more than
$5 million. The 2003 tax act sharply cuts taxes on dividend income,
another boon to the very well off. By the time the Bush tax cuts have
taken full effect, people with really high incomes will face their
lowest average tax rate since the Hoover administration.

So here's the picture: Americans pay low taxes by international
standards. Most people's taxes haven't gone up in the past generation;
the wealthy have had their taxes cut to levels not seen since before
the New Deal. Even before the latest round of tax cuts, when compared
with citizens of other advanced nations or compared with Americans a
generation ago, we had nothing to complain about -- and those with
high incomes now have a lot to celebrate. Yet a significant number of
Americans rage against taxes, and the party that controls all three
branches of the federal government has made tax cuts its supreme
priority. Why?

3. Supply-Siders, Starve-the-Beasters and Lucky Duckies

It is often hard to pin down what antitax crusaders are trying to
achieve. The reason is not, or not only, that they are disingenuous
about their motives -- though as we will see, disingenuity has become
a hallmark of the movement in recent years. Rather, the fuzziness
comes from the fact that today's antitax movement moves back and forth
between two doctrines. Both doctrines favor the same thing: big tax
cuts for people with high incomes. But they favor it for different
reasons.

One of those doctrines has become famous under the name ''supply-side
economics.'' It's the view that the government can cut taxes without
severe cuts in public spending. The other doctrine is often referred
to as ''starving the beast,'' a phrase coined by David Stockman,
Ronald Reagan's budget director. It's the view that taxes should be
cut precisely in order to force severe cuts in public spending.
Supply-side economics is the friendly, attractive face of the tax-cut
movement. But starve-the-beast is where the power lies.

The starting point of supply-side economics is an assertion that no
economist would dispute: taxes reduce the incentive to work, save and
invest. A businessman who knows that 70 cents of every extra dollar he
makes will go to the I.R.S. is less willing to make ...

&gt; A casual glance at the data might suggest not: federal spending as a

&gt; end of the 1980's than it was at the end of the 1970's. But that
&gt; number includes both defense spending and ''entitlements,'' mainly
&gt; Social Security and Medicare, whose growth is automatic unless
&gt; Congress votes to cut benefits. What's left is a grab bag known as
&gt; domestic discretionary spending, including everything from courts and
&gt; national parks to environmental cleanups and education. And domestic
&gt; discretionary spending fell from 4.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1981 to 3.2
&gt; percent in 1988.

&gt; But that's probably about as far as any president can shrink domestic

&gt; Nice try. THAT figure doesn't include sales taxes, property taxes, estate

&gt; taxes, or corporate income taxes.

&gt;&gt; By 2002, the tax take was down to 26.3 percent of G.D.P., and all
&gt;&gt; indications are that it will be lower still this year and next.

&gt;&gt; This is a low number compared with almost every other advanced
&gt;&gt; country. In 1999, Canada collected 38.2 percent of G.D.P. in taxes,
&gt;&gt; France collected 45.8 percent and Sweden, 52.2 percent.

&gt; Still true.

&gt;&gt; The top tax rate -- the income-tax rate on the highest bracket
&gt;&gt; -- is now 35 percent, half what it was in the 1970's.

&gt; Yes and no. The top stated tax rate is now 35%. The actual marginal
&gt; tax rate can be as high as around 37%. The top stated and actual
&gt; tax rate in the 70's was 70%, so this is a slight exaggeration.

&gt; For what it's worth, the marginal tax rate in the earned income credit
&gt; phase-out region (up to around $20K for a family of 4) is over 50%.

&gt;&gt; 3. Supply-Siders, Starve-the-Beasters and Lucky Duckies

&gt;&gt; A casual glance at the data might suggest not: federal spending as a
&gt;&gt; share of gross domestic product was actually slightly higher at the
&gt;&gt; end of the 1980's than it was at the end of the 1970's. But that
&gt;&gt; number includes both defense spending and ''entitlements,'' mainly
&gt;&gt; Social Security and Medicare, whose growth is automatic unless
&gt;&gt; Congress votes to cut benefits. What's left is a grab bag known as
&gt;&gt; domestic discretionary spending, including everything from courts and
&gt;&gt; national parks to environmental cleanups and education. And domestic
&gt;&gt; discretionary spending fell from 4.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1981 to 3.2
&gt;&gt; percent in 1988.

&gt;&gt; But that's probably about as far as any president can shrink domestic
&gt;&gt; discretionary spending.

&gt; Perhaps. Reagan used all his political capital on the tax cuts, so he
&gt; couldn't
&gt; get ANY discretionary domestic spending cuts in real or inflation-adjusted

&gt; dollars. (Again, as in politics -- sometimes a reduction in the
&gt; acceleration
&gt; of the rate of growth in spending is called a &quot;spending cut&quot;.)

&gt;&gt; 5. Second Wind: The Bush Tax Cuts

&gt;&gt; As demonstrated, the estate tax is a tax on the very, very well off.
&gt;&gt; Yet advocates of repeal began portraying it as a terrible burden on
&gt;&gt; the little guy. They renamed it the ''death tax'' and put out reports
&gt;&gt; decrying its impact on struggling farmers and businessmen -- reports
&gt;&gt; that never provided real-world examples because actual cases of family
&gt;&gt; farms or small businesses broken up to pay estate taxes are almost
&gt;&gt; impossible to find.

&gt; This, as usual, is false. Many &quot;small&quot; businesses and farms WERE sold off

&gt; for estate taxes, although there is a deferral of the tax for one
&gt; generation in
&gt; some cases.

&gt;&gt; According to estimates by the Tax Policy Center -- a liberal-oriented
&gt;&gt; institution, but one with a reputation for scrupulous accuracy -- the
&gt;&gt; 2001 tax cut, once fully phased in, will deliver 42 percent of its
&gt;&gt; benefits to the top 1 percent of the income distribution.

&gt; But how much of the taxes do these people pay? 60%? 80%?

&gt; How much of the income (or wealth) do these people have? 50%?
&gt; 80%? No relevant figures given in the article.

&gt; ... and those are just the errors I'm sure of.

"/> You want a tax con? Here's a tax con for you. How about making people pay a
100% tax rate on their income? I bet you didn't know that rate was in effect
here in the good old USA, did you? Well, it is! Under the guise of
&quot;concurrent receipt&quot;.

Bush preemptively attacked Iraq is because, since we spend more than all the
other industrial nations in the world combined on defense, he could.
Starving defense just might keep us out of these unnecessary wars.

Of course, the same thing might result if Congress simply told the President
they would never authorize any war without being first presented a cost
estimate that he had to sign off on personally. Then any effort to low-ball
the anticipated cost would be an issue in the next election. It should be in
2004 anyway, but they can always say they weren't sure so they didn't make
any estimate. That will be a lie, but it is harder to demonstrate the lack

"/> In fact, I think Krugman is the best columnist in the country. But even he
fails to make the crucial point that the bulk of wasteful government spending
is the debt interest. Since Bush II and Reagan jacked the debt way up, they
both have created (and are creating) far more wasteful government spending than
any other politicians ever have. Every time a conservative complains about
some piddly amount of government spending they need to be reminded that
Bush II is wasting *serious* amounts of the people's money and they are doing
nothing about it. The difference between the projected 10 year surplus under
Clinton and the projected debt under Bush is, well let's just round off to $20
trillion. At a historical 6% interest rate that comes to $1.2 trillion PER
YEAR of additional government spending FOREVER. That additional government
spending can _never_ be used for military, infrastructure, tax cuts, or
anything else.
