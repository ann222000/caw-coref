It was great.  19 years without a national in texas is too long.  They
did it right.  Villopoto, Short, Langston and Alessi were flying.
Great to see everybody in person.

Yes indeed. I've been waiting 35 years to see one these and it lived up to
my expectations and then some. I was worried that this was going to be a
National alright...a national embarrassment. That we'd end up with a
supercross track out in the sun-baked prairie with a concrete-like, hardpack
clay surface. Boy, was I ever wrong. I tip my hat to the organizers because
they must've spent an ungodly amount of money and it showed. The track was
beautiful, the races came off like clockwork, and the facilities were
excellent. Clearly the folks who put this together spent a lot of time
looking at other tracks and took note of what to do and what to avoid. The
track surface was varied,  most of the track was perfect loam, some hardpack
(primarily on jump faces, not a bad thing) and a long, sandy, whoop section.
There were a lot of large trees around the track with one area that was very
Washougal-like.

I'd like to hear what the riders thought of the track. It didn't appear to
me to be all that difficult of a course. In the qualifying sessions on
Saturday the track looked like a vision of MX heaven with a cushion of soft
loam about 2-3 feet thick all the way around but it pretty quickly started
to develop some deep ruts in the low-lying areas and some Texas-sized
braking and acceleration bumps. Still, it didn't seem nearly as rough as
some of the other National tracks that I've seen on TV. The only nit that I
have to pick is that I thought the track was a bit narrow. Again, all I have
to go on is what I've seen on TV and that can be deceptive, but it seemed
that if it was little wider then more line choices would develop which would
encourage more passing. But that's a very minor issue which is easily
corrected and again, it may not even be an issue at all because I don't know
squat about what a motocross track should look like.

The racers seemed to have no trouble with track and the only section that
consistenly caused them any grief was the long, sandy, kick-ass whoop
section. The announcers called it the &quot;Texas 12-pack&quot; and it bit several
riders, especially on Saturday. I noticed that overnight they straightened
out the entry to the whoops which made it a little easier for the riders to
set up but it still collected riders throughout the day Sunday. I won't
spoil it for anyone but it made for the most exciting moment of the weekend
so pay attention when you watch the race on TV.

The races themselves were great, particularly Moto 1 of the Lites class.
(Hint: watch the battle for second place.) I wish I could've seen RC and
Bubba go at but with points battles raging in both classes it did not
disappoint. The racing was fast and furious with the emphasis on fast. Jeez,
I wish I could rail a corner like that! I was slack-jawed the whole weekend
and in awe of the ability of the riders to ride through what would have been
a sure crash for me.

I can't wait to see the race on TV and I'm already making plans for next
years event.

I know it sounds sappy but to me it was a &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;
experience. Seeing Roger D., many of the top guys, and getting a nod
from a pro coming through the mechanic's area made me proud to be
living in America.  Those guys that suit up from the slowest to #1 are
all awesome dudes ;)
