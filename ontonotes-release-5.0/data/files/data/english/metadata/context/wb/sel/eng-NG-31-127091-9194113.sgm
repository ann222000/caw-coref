I totally agree with Pete on this one.  This story appeared on Fark

has gotten.  Synopsis: once children are involved, all rational

Note the discussion group, too.

There ARE a handful of horror stories of adults who accuse adult
strangers of crimes without so much as a word of testimony from the
child in question (and some are apparently made up strictly to get
money out of the victim). There are also those who point out that just
because most sexual predators are men, that hardly proves that more
than 2% or so of men are predators. Not to mention that nearly 100% of
baby-kidnappers in hospitals are women, so would that justify banning
unaccompanied women from maternity wards? However,  I couldn't help
noticing that most of the postings had no anecdotes to tell - they
just wanted to complain in the abstract about how society's going to
hell via paranoia. On the other hand there are those - especially one
poster named &quot;Paranoia&quot; - who have more common sense. She may have
been the one who said something like: &quot;Get a grip, dads. Hold your
daughter's hand in public all you want. Suspicious looks in public
won't kill you.&quot; Not to mention one dad who happened to drive past his
daughter, so he called to her to get in. Minutes later, the police
arrived at his house because a stranger saw her get in the car. Yes,
it was awkward having to prove he was the dad and that yes, they all
lived in that house, but, he added, he was also grateful to know that
if it had not been his car, someone would still have been watching
alertly.

DW's cow-worker (who has adult sons still living at home, BTW) had a
problem with neighborhood hellions vandalizing their cars and home.
Her hubby decided to photograph the little sociopaths in the act.
Wouldn't you know, they turned him in for photographing kids.  Only a
perv would do that!  I mean, the pictures clearly showed these little
hellions committing acts of property damage, but the cops didn't
care.  They tried to bust hubby for taking pictures of children!

Hellspawn all know how to work the system.  All you have to do is
accuse somebody of being a pervert and it's like labeling some old
lady a witch back in the days of Cotton Mather.  All that matters is
the accusation.  Forget about facts.

This country is sick.  Life expectancy is rising, and average IQ is
falling.  I think they passed each other.

Doncha know.  He was obviously trolling for them.  At some schools parents
can't take pictures of school events because they might be after the kids or
put their pictures up on the 'net.   OTOH, the adoption  industry has no
compunction about posting pictures of &quot;waiting children&quot; with the most
intimate information about them.  I saw one advertisement for a abused  girl
who sexually &quot;acts out.&quot;   This as from a &quot;legitimate&quot; adoption agency  And
that's legal!!!  This whole country is freaking sick.

&gt; Why would any sane person move to a subdivision &quot;occupied by families

Most subdivisions are primarily families with children. If a non-family
person or couple wants to live in a suburb, I don't think it's &quot;not
sane.&quot; The options are to live in the city, which many people don't want
to do, or live very distantly, rurally, which many people don't want to
do or can't do, due to work.

I used to think I *had* to live in the city because that's where there
were significant numbers of people like me. But I missed nature, I
wanted dogs, and I was tired of the downsides of a tiny condo. I needed
a house for that. Now, I'm not in a subdivision, because there really
aren't that many of them in my area (not like the miles and miles in,
say, south Jersey). Suburbs here tend to be the outlying areas between
towns. There's isn't enough land for big subdivisions.

But I can see where a sane person would live in a suburb or subdivision
(as I look out the window at my half-acre of woods and my five dogs
gather around me). And I don't have to cooperate with nuthin' and
nobody, I just have to make the mortgage payments.

I see no reason why temptation should not be minimized (and/or
contraception provided) if nobody, including the suspected man, is
seriously inconvenienced.  In this case the other house was offered
and if it is as roomy and convenient as the first house then why not
avoid the male presence?
The problem comes not when convenient options exist but when they do
not, and either men or children are expected to drastically limit
their activities (including hitchiking) for the purpose of avoiding
each other.  The man could be asked to sleep elsewhere only if a
convenient and comfortable elsewhere exists.  He could go fishing if
he likes fishing, and has a fishing cabin, but not if he doesn't.
The best way to solve these problems is to not have children and
then nobody has to worry about child abuse or molestation, or global
warming etc. either.

&gt; Wow. Everyone is getting into the act.

&gt; From the Dear Prudence column in this week's Slate

&gt; Dear Prudence,
&gt; My younger, 13-year-old sister is having a slumber party for her
&gt; birthday, and invited three or so of her 13- to 14-year-old
&gt; girlfriends to our house. Shortly after, &quot;Sara's&quot; mother suggested
&gt; that my sister's party should be held at &quot;Tammy's&quot; house. Why? Because
&gt; Tammy has a single mother. Sara's mother is concerned that my father
&gt; will be in his house during the festivities. There is no reason to be
&gt; concerned about my father doing anything inappropriate to any of the
&gt; girls (all the parents have met each other), but she is just
&gt; uncomfortable about the idea of her daughter sleeping in the same
&gt; house with another nonfamily man. She has also convinced the other
&gt; parents that a change of venue would be a good idea. Although Tammy's
&gt; mother is willing to host the event, my family is offended that the
&gt; situation has come to this. Since when is it a crime to have a happy
&gt; two-parent household? Should we cancel the event altogether, at my
&gt; sister's expense? Ask my dad to go on a mini vacation? Go along with
&gt; the venue change? Tell this lady she is overreacting?

&gt; -Befuddled

&gt; Dear Befuddled,
&gt; Jeffrey Zaslow of the Wall Street Journal has written some disturbing
&gt; pieces recently about the insidious trend of assuming all men are
&gt; predators unless proven otherwise. Society-particularly our
&gt; children-pays the price for broken homes and for families that have
&gt; never even had a father around. Now we're supposed to run screaming in
&gt; the night because a father actually lives with his own wife and
&gt; children? Obviously, it is up to the parents involved to handle this
&gt; situation, but I think yours must take a firm stand. (And I'm taking
&gt; at face value that there is no reason for Sara's objection beyond the
&gt; one stated.) Your mother should speak to Tammy's mother and explain
&gt; that while she's nice to offer her home, her daughter has been looking
&gt; forward to being hostess for this event, that they want to go ahead
&gt; and have it at your house, and she hopes her daughter will attend.
&gt; Then call Sara's mother and explain that while she is sensitive to her
&gt; concerns, it's unfair that her daughter can't have a planned sleepover
&gt; just because both she and her husband will be home. Tell her they're
&gt; going ahead with it, and hope she will let her daughter be included.
&gt; Contact the other parents to let them know they're back to the
&gt; original sleepover plans. I hope that is the end of this ugly
&gt; situation. We look back with horror at witch trials; let's hope we're
&gt; not embarking on warlock hunts.

What are SI units?

I think I have 11 lots that were all 20 ft. by 100 ft. The area was
originally subdivided that way for little shacks with wells and
outhouses. They have all been torn down or were never built or have been
built over (the traditional fire, where no one was hurt but insurance
has to pay).

My original lot was five lots with a three-room cottage. Then I bought
the adjoining six lots of woods. My new house is in the middle of the

I'd rather not live in a childed area, but I haven't always had a choice.
Our previous neighborhood was made up of lower-income apartment buildings.
We lucked out in that our building had at first just one kyd, then none.
The other buildings on the block were pretty infested with them.
Here there's only one house on the block with kyds (at least those are the
only ones I see and hear).  Most of our neighbors are middle-aged couples
without kyds.

All the years I lived in and around Cambridge, I didn't give kids a
thought. Kids were those who lived in suburbs or in the few ethnic
neighborhoods. My areas were a sea of one-room, one-bedroom,
single-person households. It never occurred to me until later that one
reason I felt so drawn to such an area (despite lack of nature, dogs,
etc.) was that I just felt I belonged in an area with no kids and only
some couples.

My old neighborhood (Radcliffe area, between Harvard and Porter for you
locals) now does seem to have a lot more strollers. I think it's the
wives of tech guys and biotech people (anecdotally). A lot of condos in
the area that weren't there 20 years ago, or weren't condos. The major
sign, cutesy-named kiddieKrap stores, upscale, of course,

Frankly, a CFer might do better in an older suburb, where a lot of the
kids are grown and gone. I think the typical &quot;young family&quot; suburb is
more likely to be a new subdivision, carved out of a field somewhere far
off. The older suburbs (at least around here, coming from town areas)
are a lot of older people, who had the houses built post-war and all. I
know my town is something like 30% over 65, and most have lived here for
decades.
Sign of the times- instead of everything being for &quot;the schools,&quot; now
there's some community group that raises money- half for school stuff,
half for the Council on Aging. I think that's a very good idea.

An hectare is the area which, when covered to a depth of one centifurlong,
contains exactly 63265.433 hogsheads.  Since there are about 16.3 acre-feet
per hectare-centifurlong, we can see that an acre is just a bit less than
7.99x10^12 circular mils, or about 2.5 acres to the hectare.

I don't know about this SI stuff, though.  Metric is hard.

Describes where I live exactly. An inner suburb built in the 1940s.
There are a few of the original inhabitants left (one neighbour is 90
and flew against Japan),  and most of the neighbourhood population
seems to have inherited from them; i.e. they are 50-60 years old. I
think there are exactly 2 people under 20 in a 100 yard radius.

Suits me just fine.

Yes, thank you. I fought against having &quot;a house&quot; be my driving force in
life, but of all the things I've done/places I've gone/etc., this house
in the woods with multiple dogs has by far given me the most joy and
stability. It's really a sanctuary for me. It's completely worth the
expense. I spent much of my earlier life convinced I had to live in the
city, where &quot;life&quot; was outside, elsewhere, in restaurants and movies and
arts n' culture. Not that I don't still value those things, but don't
want to live in or for them anymore.

I do think that older suburbs (or in my case, an older town- very old-
300 years old) is not the breeder sprawl of newer suburbs. The houses
are usually much smaller. People raised families in them and are still
in them in older age. (There are a number of aging war brides in my
town, German and English, and lots of vets). When I hear &quot;suburb,&quot; I
think of sprawling cookie-cutter new homes in big subdivisions with big
garages jutting out in an unwelcoming front- like any new area, like
Atlanta, like Las Vegas.

For that matter, the older areas of my growing-up suburb are still very
modest houses, many of which have not been added-onto. Perfectly
suitable for one or two adults.

And a town, like where I live, is likely to have a broader cross-section
of people, including suburban houses on the outskirts (but not large
subdivisions). Of course people with kids will always want these &quot;good
school&quot; towns, but there are usually modest houses in the older areas.

A hectare is the area occupied by a square 100 meters on a side =
10,000 sq. meters.

With the right landscaping or fencing, that can still be pretty sweet. 8-)

And here's a REALLY long thread in response:

A pity one can't speed up the reading by just doing a search for real-
life anecdotes. There are plenty of them.

However, for a couple of crushing stories and one or two nice,
uneventful ones, start near the bottom at Sept. 9, 12:40:02 by Polyron
and then read all the ones that follow.

What no one mentioned, oddly, is that while some kids certainly do
deliberately make false accusations, the reason is not that all kids
are pathological liars, per se, but that it's just too easy for kids
to lie about things they hear about practically every day - especially
if the parents have never stated what the punishment for a seriously
malicious lie will be. That is, it USED to be true that even middle-
schoolers seldom lied about it - because they weren't taught about it
in detail, especially with regard to non-strangers such as teachers or
clergymen. So they didn't have the proper vocabulary and fluency.

As someone pointed out, even a toddler will deny knocking over a glass
when no one else could have done it.

&gt; I am an attorney and I used to share office space with another lawyer who
&gt; specialized in divorce/family law matters. If you folks think its the
&gt; proto-typical &quot;feminists&quot; who are behind this, you are sadly mistaken. Most
&gt; of this crap originates and develops more from the Rev. Mrs. Lovejoy (won't
&gt; someone think of the children!) types than anywhere else. Its usually the
&gt; stay-at-home, church-going, mom with 3.4 children who imagines every man a
&gt; molestor and reacts in such a manner. They think that men basically should
&gt; the third wheel in the parent child relationship and think that only a
&gt; &quot;mother&quot; can be nurturing and be involved in the children's lives, while the
&gt; &quot;man of the house&quot; should be delegated to working and bringing home a
&gt; paycheck.

&gt; Don't blame the feminists for this one. Put the blame at the hoverrounds
&gt; (helicopter) moms who overreact to everything and who have such boring lives
&gt; that they must create some kind of &quot;drama&quot; to divert themselves from their
&gt; aforementioned boring lives.
