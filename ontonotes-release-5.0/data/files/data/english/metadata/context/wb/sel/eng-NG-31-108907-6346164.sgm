I am afraid of love; I am hesitant to love now and tomorrow,

Because, sometimes love goes hand in hand with pain, sacrifice,
suffering and sorrow.

It is highly deceptive, paradoxically life - encouraging,

However, in other times death - advocating.

Frequently it offers fallacious ecstasy,

Ambiguous, obfuscated emotions, leading to misery.

It clouds the wisdom of the sage and steals the spirit of the prudent,

Weakens the body of the strong and hardens the heart of the
benevolent.

It changes the avaricious to being generous and transforms the
charitable to being greedy,

Compels the poor to become wealthy and drives the affluent to become
needy.

I borrow the concept of Aristotelian virtues as variable of life
influenced by love greatly,

I scrutinize and realize that love's venom diminishes the courage of
the brave, or makes him foolhardy.

To the temperate, it affects licentiousness or insensibility,

To the liberal, causes prodigality or illiberality,

To the magnificent, urges meanness or vulgarity,

To the magnanimous, induces inferiority or vanity,

To the determined surprisingly pushes depression,

But in other moments, it thrusts illusion.

It inculcates impassivity or irascibility to the gentlest,

And bestows depreciation or boastfulness to the honest,

It promotes boorishness or buffoonery to the witty,

Evokes quarrelsomeness or obsequiousness to the friendly.

To the modest, it develops bashfulness or shamelessness,

And most of all, to righteous indignation, brings envy or
maliciousness.

Generally, love snatches the moderation of these virtues, replaces
them with vices of deficiency or excess.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From all of these, therefore, I meticulously deduce, oftentimes in
">

love there is really no justice,

And to majority of its zealots it is obviously unfair,

Some celebrate while others weep, some embrace laughter while others
feel despair.

Love blinds the eyes so clear,

And deafens the astute ears.

It turns the eloquent tongue into dumb,

And converts the sensitive skin into numb.

Alas! The worst of all stupefies clever consciousness,

And suddenly engulfs it into a tunnel of wilderness.

Love is an exquisite flower with obnoxious odor,

A marvelous rainbow governed by tragic color.

It is a fresh spring that seems to quench the thirst,

Yet when you start to drink it, a sweet poison will burst,

Resembles road that waves hope to a desolate wanderer,

Nevertheless, as he explores it, a cliff of maelstrom will appear.

At first you're in paradise dancing with the fairies,

Later, you're in Hades, mourning, full of worries.

However, I am human and love is part of life,

I have to pass this struggle without the aid of knife.

I must submit my purest soul someday to someone else;

I should prepare my sassy heart to clanging sound of bells.

The Bible says, if I've not loved, it profits me nothing,

Indeed, my confused pristine heart should seek love's true meaning,

But who will be my savior to extinguish my fears?

The one who can assure I'll not shed lonely tears?

Is there a mortal who can teach me that genuine love is kind?

If yes, then shackles of my virgin heart will begin to unbind.

Will she be my source of fortitude to face love's ups and downs?

Make me a king because of love and place on my head a crown?

Zealously, I cast my wish to meet someone along the way,

A perfect gift form heaven who will make my blue heart gay.

I also pray for vigor to outlive the tests of love,

To pacify the rapid beating of my queer heart's unsullied throb.

The tempest and the turmoil, may I triumphantly sustain,

My dignity and honor, may I victoriously maintain.

I want my dreadful judgment of love to fade away,

Replace with optimism of love in splendid way.

But still, love must only be the slave and I must be the master,

My willpower should surpass love; I should be the controller.

Although I know there are some falls and failures will sprout,

Yet I will fight to survive these until the light comes out.

I will be bold to accept love no matter how difficult it is,

I will endure tribulations so that I finally find the bliss.

Lastly, I beg Almighty God to grant me real serenity,

So that, I can enjoy pure love from now until eternity.
