A reminder: I think people will be pouring in as soon as they hear
about these threads' low rats.

ANGEL
Season One, Episode 9: &quot;Hero&quot;
Writers: Howard Gordon and Tim Minear
Director: Tucker Gates

The episode that gives Doyle his sudden send-off has the job of
basically handling a whole hero's journey story, and the writing and
Quinn's performance are up to the task of selling me on both his
horror over what he's done through inaction, and the transformation.
Given that ATS has a well earned reputation for treating its
protagonists roughly, it's kinda nice to see someone go out as a hero,
in a blaze of glory, just this once.  &quot;Hero&quot; has some seriously great
stuff in it, but it's bogged down by moments which are both slow and
seem random, like Doyle's neck trick or Angel managing to infiltrate
the enemy with so little fuss.  One of the episode's more infamous
aspects is its marching Nazis, imagery which should be too weighty for
a show like this to support.  My end feeling about that is that
although the parallel was not the right choice, it's a minor enough
component of the episode that I don't feel the need to dwell on it.
It's too bad they had to show the Scourge at all - they're way more
effective as villains early on, when they're a primal, unseen force.
Rating: Good

Season One, Episode 10: &quot;Parting Gifts&quot;
Writers: David Fury and Jeannine Renshaw
Director: James A. Contner

I want to like &quot;Parting Gifts&quot; more than I do.  It's theoretically an
important episode, with Cordelia inheriting the visions and reacting
in the way that only she would, and Wesley riding into town and
briefly trying to break out of his niche before sitting down with the
other two for a family meal to end the calendar year.  Unfortunately,
almost every scene in the episode either stumbles somewhere in the
delivery (i.e. the commercial shoot, Wesley's insecurities), or wasn't
a particularly interesting idea to begin with.  All the shake-ups in
the world can't convey a &quot;special&quot; feeling when the show is still
closely focused around an A-story that's so ordinary.
Rating: Decent

Season One, Episode 11: &quot;Somnambulist&quot;
Writer: Tim Minear
Director: Winrich Kolbe

I latched on to this one as hope for the future the first time around,
because it showed me a side of ATS that I'd seen so little of in the
first block of episodes.  Angel dealing with a problem directly
brought about by that past he's all about atoning for, seeing how his
time as Angelus seeps into his current personality and influences his
relationships - this is strong stuff, conceptually, especially once
you throw Kate into the mix.   I liked Kate a lot at times, but never
more so than when she kills Penn at the end here, with her and Angel
fighting evil side by side yet very far apart.  On the level of
plotting mechanics, &quot;Somnambulist&quot; kinda throws me with the pacing.
It keeps twisting in unexpected directions, and throwing in layer
after layer of conflict, which feels exhilarating at times.  But it
also makes me feel a little exhausted with the nearly constant &quot;one
confrontation after another&quot; vibe, and that feeling gets more
pronounced every time I watch it.  Nonetheless, lucky number eleven is
one of the stronger episodes to date.
Rating: Good

Additional comments on S1D3: Random note - In his commentary for
&quot;Helpless,&quot; David F. talks about enjoying seeing something that he
wrote (Giles getting fired) have such long-reaching consequences as
Wes becoming such a big part of ATS... and hey, David gets to write his
debut here.

&quot;Parting Gifts&quot; is where my Significant Other stopped watching the
series with me, forcing the reviewing gig to become a more solitary
pursuit.  She didn't see the best of the series, but based on her
reactions to selected later things, it's not her show.  Vampire-based
apocalyptic serialized male-dominated quests for redemption are
apparently a bit of a niche product.

My brother was very annoyed, until I told him that there were outside
reasons, at the decision to kill Doyle just as he was starting to
work, and replace him with a comic relief character who hadn't yet
given us any reason to care about him (this is before ATS became so
firmly established as the show where BTVS go to get redeemed).  I
remember, once the crossover aspect stopped being exciting, how
quickly I started to have misgivings about making Wes such a big part
of the story.  I wrote that &quot;two primarily wimpy comic-relief types in
a cast of three&quot; seemed like way too much.  A fair amount of the third
quarter of S1 appears to be devoted to making them more competent at
the sidekicking; we can debate how natural or not the transition
seems.

Did we ever come to a consensus about whether Doyle knew what was
going to happen when he kissed Cordy?

Thoughts?

I think the episode does a nice job of summing Doyle up and sending him off.
It's the best part of the episode - and a pretty big part.  It's a take on
his shame of being part demon that I didn't expect, but a pretty powerful
take.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the nice resolution to Cordy
romance when she tosses off the fact that he's half demon.

Cordy:  So, you're half demon.  Big Whoop!  I can't believe you'd think I'd
care about that.  I mean, I work for a vampire! Hello?

So self evident in retrospect.  Thank you Cordelia.

The sentimental ending with his taped commercial is near perfect.

The problem I have with the approach is that the secret he reveals is so big
and defining that it seems to overwhelm much of what we've seen before.
Makes me wonder why The Bachelor Party even exists.  His ex-wife seems so
trivial now.  I wonder how suddenly M.E. decided to get rid of the
character.  I sense that it was decided right when this episode was written,
which perhaps made it run a little roughshod over the past.

Hmmm.  Maybe this perception varies with how much time you've spent with
holocaust history.  I've spent a fair amount of time on the subject and hung
out with a lot of people positively obsessed by it.  So, to me, this episode
absolutely reeks of the theme.  It is far and away the dominant aspect of
the show - exceeding Doyle's story, very nearly overwhelming it entirely.

In itself I have mixed feelings about the holocaust theme.  It hits pretty
sharply at a surprisingly large number of elements, suggesting writers well
schooled in both the history and philosophy of it.  (I'm still not sure what
the big light is supposed to represent, but I realized this time around that
the ship's hold they are stuck in represents the gas chamber.  It's made
especially clear when they find themselves locked in with mass death
approaching.)  The horrible gaunt look of the victims is terribly suggestive
of those in concentration camps or, perhaps, the Warsaw Ghetto.  That's a
real connection to make, but horribly dispiriting.  Makes for oppressive
viewing.  Some details come off poorly IMO.  The 1940's motorcycle seems
gratuitous.  The demon rally seems flat.  Demon troops marching through L.A.
at night just doesn't fit the AtS mythos at this point.  That would be more
appropriate in Jasmine's time.  And the big light seems dopey.

Mostly it could be pretty interesting and worthy.  But the problem is that
this is Doyle's story, and all this Nazi stuff is sapping the energy from
it.  In the end I think the episode is greatly diminished by it.

That's a fair summation.  It gets a barely Decent from me - dangerously
close to Weak.  There are moments I like in this episode - of the sort that
make me want to like the whole thing as you say.  The introduction of the
Rogue Demon Hunter is quite amusing.  Cordelia's kisses are quite amusing.
The insight into understanding the gift left to Cordelia is nicely done.
Indeed, considering what we now know the significance of the visions will be
to changing Cordelia's sense of humanity, the whole idea that Cordelia needs
to get past her self centered view of everything to appreciate Doyle's gift
is kind of powerful.

But the episode seems to grind down everything good and keeps getting worse
as it goes along.  The late scenes around kidnapped Cordy are pretty Bad.
At the very end I do like a lot the notion of Angel cooking breakfast for
his team after a hard night of demon fighting.  But then I had to listen to
Wesley whimper.  And whatever good Wesley brings to AtS, his whimpering is
not among it.

I was really struck this watching by the ride Kate had to take this episode.
We get her little flirtations with Angel early, simultaneously getting a
glimpse of what a tough job/life she has as we look through her folder about
mass killing.  Angel is one of the few bright lights in her world -
something good.  And then that crashes around her as she watches Angel turn
vampire in the warehouse.  I don't know what it is about her character that
gets me emotionally - her face tends to be so impassive and her lines
delivered with minimal emotional tone.  But whatever it is that she's doing,
it works.  The little spat at her door when she lays into Angel.  First time
I was impressed at how evenly she took it, but now I see the seeds of her
later near madness over where Angel took her life.  And then the close of
them, as you so aptly put, fighting evil side by side yet very far apart.
The lest is a kind of resolution between them, but of a sort that cannot
truly stand.

Again I note how she is the only character of early AtS that genuinely
enthused me.

I really enjoyed this episode this time around.  2nd best so far, though
we're heading into some troubled waters.  As I said first time I'd really
like to rate it an Excellent for its relative quality.  But as I see myself
leaving Something Blue and Pangs as merely Good over in the other series,
that's lowering standards too much.  It's good to see Angel feeling the
Angelus inside, but I think the good in that is mostly because they've
avoided it until now rather than it being all that special now.  It was also
good to see the flashbacks because they're an important part of the mythos.
But they aren't particularly good flashbacks here.  So I'm going to settle
for a pretty high Good.

&gt; Did we ever come to a consensus about whether Doyle knew what was

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; going to happen when he kissed Cordy?
">

Not that I know of.  Parting Gifts does seem to go out of its way to suggest
that it was deliberate, but it doesn't make sense to me.  Doyle always
seemed to find his visions to be mysterious.  It doesn't seem natural to me
that he would know that kissing at that time would transmit the talent.
Besides, he just wanted to kiss Cordy.  So my opinion is that Doyle didn't
know.

I don't think that negates the message in Parting Gifts though.  The issue
was Cordy - not Doyle.  She needed to recognize that the piece of Doyle that
she wanted to remember him by was truly within her.  And then there's the
thing about getting over her totally self centered self thing that the
visions will eventually force.

I'm a little dubious about the legitimacy of it as a profile, but never

That's good.  I especially like the observation about being the only true

rather compelling even with the periods of sporadic use.  It's just a meaty

Many characters start out as &quot;types&quot; or stock roles.  Viewers latch on
to the ones who distinguish themselves, and become interesting in and

&gt;  I was also pleasantly surprised by the nice resolution to Cordy

As mentioned last thread, that's my contention, especially when seeing
RWAV and TBP after knowing how it turns out.  There's no way they were
planning to get rid of him so soon.  And as it's easy to tell once
someone else mentions it, the Angel/Cordelia rooftop scene that closes
&quot;Somnambulist&quot; is a hastily rewritten Angel/Doyle conversation.

I didn't know that - or had forgotten.  Now I'll have to watch that again.

That does remind me that one function of Doyle that had been played with a
little, was for him to be Angel's sounding board.  The one who'd hear a
little of what Angel was really feeling.  That's a valid function, and one
that I'm not sure is quickly replaced.  Something to keep an eye out for.

Maus is good.  I don't think it's quite as extraordinary as often made out
to be.  (I suspect some people are over-awed that it's a comic book.)  But
it's definitely worth going through.  I don't find myself re-reading it like
some other graphic novels though.  I assume that's because of the topic.

I don't read much on the subject anymore myself.  It finally wore me out
some time ago.

&gt;A reminder: I think people will be pouring in as soon as they hear
&gt; about these threads' low rats.

&gt; ANGEL
&gt; Season One, Episode 9: &quot;Hero&quot;
&gt; Writers: Howard Gordon and Tim Minear
&gt; Director: Tucker Gates

&gt; The episode that gives Doyle his sudden send-off has the job of
&gt; basically handling a whole hero's journey story, and the writing and
&gt; Quinn's performance are up to the task of selling me on both his
&gt; horror over what he's done through inaction, and the transformation.
&gt; Given that ATS has a well earned reputation for treating its
&gt; protagonists roughly, it's kinda nice to see someone go out as a hero,
&gt; in a blaze of glory, just this once.
">

I guess its due to sympathy for Quinn by the writers. Which is kinda nice,
but tailoring an episode to give an actor a good send off isn't normally the
mark of a great episode. &quot;You're Welcome&quot; gets a pass (though for my part,
not by much) because its Cordy, but we haven't known Doyle as long.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;Hero&quot; has some seriously great
&gt; stuff in it, but it's bogged down by moments which are both slow and
&gt; seem random, like Doyle's neck trick or Angel managing to infiltrate
&gt; the enemy with so little fuss.  One of the episode's more infamous
&gt; aspects is its marching Nazis, imagery which should be too weighty for

&gt; although the parallel was not the right choice, it's a minor enough

&gt; It's too bad they had to show the Scourge at all - they're way more
&gt; effective as villains early on, when they're a primal, unseen force.

Yep, lose the Nazi demon horde, and the episode would improve immeasurably.
As it is, it's the start and the end of the episode that works for me, the
rest I'm happy to skip. It's my 72nd favourite AtS episode, 14th best in
season 1(last year was 56th and 11th).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Season One, Episode 10: &quot;Parting Gifts&quot;
&gt; Writers: David Fury and Jeannine Renshaw
&gt; Director: James A. Contner

&gt; I want to like &quot;Parting Gifts&quot; more than I do.  It's theoretically an
&gt; important episode, with Cordelia inheriting the visions and reacting
&gt; in the way that only she would, and Wesley riding into town and
&gt; briefly trying to break out of his niche before sitting down with the
&gt; other two for a family meal to end the calendar year.  Unfortunately,
&gt; almost every scene in the episode either stumbles somewhere in the
&gt; delivery (i.e. the commercial shoot, Wesley's insecurities), or wasn't
&gt; a particularly interesting idea to begin with.  All the shake-ups in
&gt; the world can't convey a &quot;special&quot; feeling when the show is still
&gt; closely focused around an A-story that's so ordinary.
&gt; Rating: Decent
">

I like the way Wes fails so far short of his aspirations. A man's reach
should exceed his grasp, but probably not by that much. And I like the way
it plays against Angel's cool. And the importance of the introduction of the
series' central character can't be overstated. But on the other hand the
story that goes with it isn't all that flash. Still, it remains a lowish
Good for me. It's my 24th favourite AtS episode, 3rd best in season 1 (last
year was 19th and 1st - at least at the time I commented on your original
review of this episode, it was later overtaken by another episode which I
also rated best in season 1 when commenting on it).

&gt; Season One, Episode 11: &quot;Somnambulist&quot;
&gt; Writer: Tim Minear
&gt; Director: Winrich Kolbe

&gt; I latched on to this one as hope for the future the first time around,
&gt; because it showed me a side of ATS that I'd seen so little of in the
&gt; first block of episodes.  Angel dealing with a problem directly
&gt; brought about by that past he's all about atoning for, seeing how his
&gt; time as Angelus seeps into his current personality and influences his
&gt; relationships - this is strong stuff, conceptually, especially once
&gt; you throw Kate into the mix.   I liked Kate a lot at times, but never
&gt; more so than when she kills Penn at the end here, with her and Angel
&gt; fighting evil side by side yet very far apart.  On the level of
&gt; plotting mechanics, &quot;Somnambulist&quot; kinda throws me with the pacing.
&gt; It keeps twisting in unexpected directions, and throwing in layer
&gt; after layer of conflict, which feels exhilarating at times.  But it
&gt; also makes me feel a little exhausted with the nearly constant &quot;one
&gt; confrontation after another&quot; vibe, and that feeling gets more
&gt; pronounced every time I watch it.  Nonetheless, lucky number eleven is
&gt; one of the stronger episodes to date.
&gt; Rating: Good
">

Only a high Decent for me. I like the concept of Angel faced with his past,
but the actual story doesn't grab me as much as it should given the concept.
There is a bit of irritating playing to the ad breaks that brings it down a
little. It is my 46th favourite AtS episode, 7th best in season 1(last year
was 43rd and 8th)

That's the kind of thing that's never worked for me with my lack of
sense of humor and such.  When a man's self-image is consistently
correlated with his reach rather than his grasp, it very quickly gets
cartoony.  And even if one does find early Wes funny, ATS (unlike
BTVS) wants to treat Wesley as a character rather than simply comic
relief or plot device, so jumps back and forth between the smug guy
who falls down a lot and the guy who wears his myriad insecurities on
his sleeve.  It's unpleasantly bi-polar, I think.

In re-watching, I have the same feeling I did originally: an initial
rush once Wesley appears springing from seeing a familiar face about
to become a major player, and then a medium-speed deflation over the
rest of the episode as I come to terms with whom exactly the familiar
face is.

We saw in the latter stages of BtVS 3 that Wes wants to change. But wanting
to change isn't enough on its own, especially when the change one wants to
make in oneself is to become &quot;stronger&quot;. He backslid rather spectacularly at
the end of GD 2. We know he has made more progress since then - he wouldn't
be a rogue demon hunter if he hadn't, but we shouldn't be surprised at more
backsliding. Change like that is difficult, especially when one attempts it
on one's own. Now if only Wes could meet a nice girl who could take him in
hand and sort him out - that would help enormously in allowing him to set in
concrete the changes he wants to make, and to some extent has made, but
can't yet reliably stick to.
