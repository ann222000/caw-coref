When naming children, is it customary to use April, May, June and August
as first names only when the child's birth month corresponds to the name?

Also, I've never met anyone with a first name the same as any of the
other eight months, but I'd guess those names have occassionally been
used, huh?

My niece April was born in mid-March, and not prematurely.  Her
parents just liked the name.

I also once knew girls named January and September; didn't think to
ask when they were born, though it seems a good question now.  I was a
lot less nosy back then, too.

Septimus, Octavius/Octavia -- which didn't arise from the month, but
from birth order, but it's the same set of ordinal numbers.

Augusta was probably named after Gaius Julius' adopted nephew.  Julia,
Julius, and Julian probably were named after Octavian's uncle.

I am not a good souce for non-latin Month Names appearing as Person
Names, but the Chinese may be among those who use the ordinal trick
(check your Fortune cookie for the Chinese name for May and August).

I would say the first three have lives independent of the month, I've
never met an August, other than variations like Augusto/Augustus,
which also have lives independent of the month.

I've met a January, a Fevrier, and a March, though Fevrier is a common
French surname and March the same for English, so I think the persons
came to them that way.  Actually, January's also a surname, so it may
be true for all those.

That's:

Jan:  42% of     78
Feb: 100% of      1
Mar:  50% of    292
Apr:  38% of  2 171
May:  25% of 51 240
Jun:  46% of 61 611
Jul:  32% of     75
Aug:  16% of 45 807
Sep:  47% of     15
Oct:  60% of     15
Nov:  82% of     11
Dec:  71% of     17

Although that doesn't give the numbers _now_, but rather when these
people were named.

Strange that I didn't think of that since our daughter's name is Julia,
but she insists on being called Julie.

Just Julius Caesar as far as I know.

The name &quot;Julius&quot; predates the name of the month. Those named
&quot;Julius&quot; subsequent to the month getting named are not, as far as I
know, being named after the month (except if &quot;after&quot; is interpreted
in a strict chronological sense). They're still just being named
Julius.

In contrast, I believe the names &quot;April,&quot; &quot;May,&quot; and &quot;June,&quot; were
chosen, at least originally, to evoke the pleasant characteristics of
those months.

So we can't count either August or January either by that

&gt; Hits for months as first names on the Social Security Death Index:

&gt; January--78, 33 born in January
&gt; February--1, 1 born in February (guess it really is the least-loved
&gt; month!) March--292, 147 born in March
&gt; April--2,171, 818 born in April
&gt; May--51,240, 12,755 born in May
">

So how did you get this for the larger ones?  All of the SSDI sites I used,
either they would not let you specify the month, or they would let you but
then they wouldn't tell you the total number of results founds until you
paged through all of them 10 per page.

&gt; Just Julius Caesar as far as I know.

&gt; The name &quot;Julius&quot; predates the name of the month. Those named

I thought you were wrong, but it seems you are right. Only slightly more
than a tenth of Juliuss (Julii?), Julias, Julies were born in July, so any
month-name effect must be slight.

June may be more complicated. I'm not sure how well the name survived
as a descendant of Juno. I would guess that most modern day Junes are
named after the month.

No known connection between the names Janus and Janice.
Is there any record of the name Janice being used before 1899?

I'd be willing to bet most modern day Junes are named because their
mums like the name. It seems to me it now exists as a name
independently of the month.

The Social Security death rolls find Janices with birth years going
back at least to 1880, but they are very rare--single-digit quantities
for most years in the 1880s and 1890s. (Compare to 23,811 Marys on the
list who were born in 1889.)
