Hello everyone,

I have the following question in Number Theory:

Find the determinant of a matrix A(n)=[gcd(i,j)] i.e. the matrix of size n x n and the entry (i,j)=gcd(i,j) ?

from the answer in the back of the book I know that the det(A(n))= phi(1)phi(2)...phi(n) where phi(k) is the euler-phi function of k.

all what I get is that
the matrix A(n) will be a the matrix(A(n-1)) and the nth row is the same as the nth coulonm have phi(n) one's but I couldn't move further.

So If can any one give me a hint to start?

Best Regards,

Abdulla Eid

looking at concrete examples helps me think better (to see a pattern):

A(6) is

1 1 1 1 1 1
1 2 1 2 1 2
1 1 3 1 1 3
1 2 1 4 1 2
1 1 1 1 5 1
1 2 3 2 1 6

Notice how some rows look a little like others (2,4,6), or {3,6}.

For determinants of structured matrices, the best direction (to start
off) is to see if you can convert it to upper diagonal form with
Gaussian elimination, by fortuitously (and systematically) choosing
the right sequence of pairs of rows and coefficients.

For this matrix, the hint is to try pairs where one index divides
another.

If you do it right, you'll get an upper triangular matrix with the
diagonals being phi(i) leading to the determinant above.

How nice!

So, your basically saying that the solution becomes clearer
when you look at the LU decomposition of the matrix:

[1    0    0    0    0    0]       [1    1    1    1    1    1]
[1    1    0    0    0    0]       [0    1    0    1    0    1]
[1    0    1    0    0    0]   .   [0    0    2    0    0    2]
[1    1    0    1    0    0]       [0    0    0    2    0    0]
[1    0    0    0    1    0]       [0    0    0    0    4    0]
[1    1    1    0    0    1]       [0    0    0    0    0    2]

Wow! (To really see what the coefficients of the factors "are",
you will have to decompose a larger matrix, like 10x10.)

BTW:
What other matrices have "nice" LU decompositions?
(Nicer than just matrices whose entries
are polynomial functions of the indices, please.)

I also faintly recall that LU decomposition of Vandermonde matrices
had connections to polynomial interpolation formulas...

... and to combinatorics - for matrices like

[1    0     0      0      0       0]
[1    1     1      1      1       1]
[1    2     4      8     16      32]
[1    3     9     27     81     243]
[1    4    16     64    256    1024]
[1    5    25    125    625    3125]

(Gottfried Helms is thinking a lot about these...)
