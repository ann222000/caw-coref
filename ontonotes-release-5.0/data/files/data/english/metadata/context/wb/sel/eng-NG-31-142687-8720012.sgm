Liberals seem to have buried their heads up their ass on this one. Well
that's no surprise. Further, notice there's no talk about whether or not the
Germans obtained a search warrant when capturing these suspects?

Again, no surprise since liberals in denial to facts they don't want to
hear/discuss/know which is pretty much status quo for their ilk!

Police have smashed a suspected al Qaeda terror cell nursing a &quot;profound
hatred of US citizens&quot; plotting to bomb civilian and military jets.

The force of the planned explosions would have been worse than the train
bombings in Madrid and the Tube and bus attacks in London on 7 July, 2005,
according to German security sources. Those attacks killed 191 and 52 people
respectively.

Three men aged 22, 28 and 29 have been arrested in Germany days before they
planned to strike, and bomb-making equipment and explosives have been
seized.

The arrests come a day after Danish police conducted raids and took eight
young Muslims into custody whom they suspect of plotting a bomb attack and
having links with al Qaeda. No direct link has yet been established between
the two plots.

Federal prosecutor Monika Harms said the three suspects had bought 700kg
(1,500lbs) of hydrogen peroxide to make massive bombs. She said: &quot;We have
prevented what we believe would have been the worst terror attacks ever on
German soil&quot;.

She declined to name specific targets but said the suspects had an eye on
institutions and establishments frequented by Americans in Germany,
including discos, pubs and airports.

Citing unnamed security sources in Berlin, the broadcaster Suedwestfunk said
Frankfurt International Airport and US Ramstein Air Base were among targets.

Joerg Ziercke, the head of Germany's federal crime office, said the men had
a &quot;profound hatred of US citizens&quot;.

German security sources have reportedly said the men belonged to the Islamic
Jihad, an Egyptain terrorist group that merged with al Qaeda in 2001.

Wolfgang Bosbach, an MP with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats,
said the plot may have been timed to coincide with the anniversary of the
2001 atrocities in the US.

Franz Josef Jung, the defence minister, said: &quot;The attacks were planned for
the near future. They presented a real threat to life.&quot;

The suspects are believed to have been planning simultaneous attacks on
aircraft sitting on the ground. Security services had been watching them for
six months until yesterday, when the investigators spontaneously made the
arrests after the men were observed moving chemicals from one storage
location to another.

As is customary in Germany, the suspects have only been identified by their
first names and last initials. Daniel S comes from the Saarland, Fritz G
from Ulm in Bavaria and Adem Y from Turkey, although there are reports that
he holds a Pakistani passport. The two Germans are 22 and 28, while Adem Y
is 29.

The men were arrested yesterday as two dozen raids took place across
Germany. They are believed to have been detained in the Frankfurt area.

One of those held, Fritz G, put up a fight when police raided the men's
house in the Frankfurt area. He escaped through a bathroom window and
managed to reach an outer cordon of officers about 300 metres away before
being aprehended. He was able to snatch a gun, which went off, from a
policeman. No one was hurt.

A German network reported that shots had been fired when police raided a
house in a town in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The Germans are converts to Islam. At least one of the men is reported to
have received terrorist training overseas.

The German intelligence service is said to have learned of the plot through
emails.

The suspects are reported to have confessed. Security services are trawling
their contacts to make sure there are no back-up teams.

Ramstein serves as America's main logistical base to service the war in
Iraq. Germany has ground troops in Afghanistan.

&quot;There are clear indications that at a minimum Ramstein and the Frankfurt
airport were possible targets and that they would not have waited long to
strike,&quot; leading conservative politician Wolfgang Bosbach told German
television station N24, adding the attacks could have been timed to coincide
with the anniversary of September 11.

Police believe that the men wanted to experiment in the coming days and
weeks with the chemicals and possibly start building a bomb. They were,
however, far away from making a bomb that could be detonated.

A &quot;bomb factory&quot; is said to have been found in the village of Oberschledorn
in the Sauerland. Locals said undercover police had been watching the house
from a caravan.

Captain Jeff Gradeck, a spokesman for the US European Command (EUCOM) in
Stuttgart, said: &quot;We don't have any information yet that US facilities were
targeted.&quot;

There was no comment from Frankfurt airport, one of Europe's busiest. The
Ramstein base in the nearby state of Rhineland-Palatinate, 130 km (80 miles)
southwest of the airport, is one of the most important US air bases
overseas.

Germany, which has forces stationed in Afghanistan, has been on high alert
for attacks. The country has feared a re-emergence of militant Islamic
groups since 2001, when the northern city of Hamburg was used as a base for
planning the September 11 attacks.

Earlier this year, federal prosecutors charged a Lebanese man held in
detention over an unsuccessful attempt to detonate bombs on two trains in
Germany in 2006.

He and another suspect were caught on surveillance cameras wheeling
suitcases containing bombs aboard trains at Cologne's main railway station.

Both men left suitcases on the trains, which they planned to detonate later
in the day with a timed explosive device. Despite being activated, the bombs
failed to go off because of a technical error, the prosecutor's office said.

Not exactly, my little moo-moo.

Liberals are astonished at the huge job growth the Coward-in-Chief has
created in the newly expanded terrorist sector.

Normally, we would herald any such job growth news, but, to Liberals,
having increased the danger to the rest of the world is nothing to
celebrate.

We're more likely to apologize for our idiot in the Whitehouse and his
criminally deadly antics...

Since the occupation of Iraq there has been an upsurge in these radicalised
morons.
Fortunately the majority are just infuriated amateurs and are easily caught.

'Links with Al Queda' usually turns out to be watching a video on the web or
something similar.
However, it's probably just a matter of time before some of them manage to
kill somebody.
Thanks a fucking lot Mr Bush.

&gt; Liberals seem to have buried their heads up their ass on this one. Well

&gt; Police have smashed a suspected al Qaeda terror cell nursing a &quot;profound
&gt; hatred of US citizens&quot; plotting to bomb civilian and military jets.

&gt; The force of the planned explosions would have been worse than the train
&gt; bombings in Madrid and the Tube and bus attacks in London on 7 July, 2005,
&gt; according to German security sources. Those attacks killed 191 and 52
&gt; people respectively.

&gt; Three men aged 22, 28 and 29 have been arrested in Germany days before
&gt; they planned to strike, and bomb-making equipment and explosives have been
&gt; seized.

&gt; The arrests come a day after Danish police conducted raids and took eight
&gt; young Muslims into custody whom they suspect of plotting a bomb attack and
&gt; having links with al Qaeda. No direct link has yet been established
&gt; between the two plots.

&gt; Federal prosecutor Monika Harms said the three suspects had bought 700kg
&gt; (1,500lbs) of hydrogen peroxide to make massive bombs. She said: &quot;We have
&gt; prevented what we believe would have been the worst terror attacks ever on
&gt; German soil&quot;.

&gt; She declined to name specific targets but said the suspects had an eye on
&gt; institutions and establishments frequented by Americans in Germany,
&gt; including discos, pubs and airports.

&gt; Citing unnamed security sources in Berlin, the broadcaster Suedwestfunk
&gt; said Frankfurt International Airport and US Ramstein Air Base were among
&gt; targets.

&gt; Joerg Ziercke, the head of Germany's federal crime office, said the men
&gt; had a &quot;profound hatred of US citizens&quot;.

&gt; German security sources have reportedly said the men belonged to the
&gt; Islamic Jihad, an Egyptain terrorist group that merged with al Qaeda in
&gt; 2001.

&gt; Wolfgang Bosbach, an MP with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian
&gt; Democrats, said the plot may have been timed to coincide with the
&gt; anniversary of the 2001 atrocities in the US.

&gt; Franz Josef Jung, the defence minister, said: &quot;The attacks were planned
&gt; for the near future. They presented a real threat to life.&quot;

&gt; The suspects are believed to have been planning simultaneous attacks on
&gt; aircraft sitting on the ground. Security services had been watching them
&gt; for six months until yesterday, when the investigators spontaneously made
&gt; the arrests after the men were observed moving chemicals from one storage
&gt; location to another.

&gt; As is customary in Germany, the suspects have only been identified by
&gt; their first names and last initials. Daniel S comes from the Saarland,
&gt; Fritz G from Ulm in Bavaria and Adem Y from Turkey, although there are
&gt; reports that he holds a Pakistani passport. The two Germans are 22 and 28,
&gt; while Adem Y is 29.

&gt; The men were arrested yesterday as two dozen raids took place across
&gt; Germany. They are believed to have been detained in the Frankfurt area.

&gt; One of those held, Fritz G, put up a fight when police raided the men's
&gt; house in the Frankfurt area. He escaped through a bathroom window and
&gt; managed to reach an outer cordon of officers about 300 metres away before
&gt; being aprehended. He was able to snatch a gun, which went off, from a
&gt; policeman. No one was hurt.

&gt; A German network reported that shots had been fired when police raided a
&gt; house in a town in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

&gt; The Germans are converts to Islam. At least one of the men is reported to
&gt; have received terrorist training overseas.

&gt; The German intelligence service is said to have learned of the plot
&gt; through emails.

&gt; The suspects are reported to have confessed. Security services are
&gt; trawling their contacts to make sure there are no back-up teams.

&gt; Ramstein serves as America's main logistical base to service the war in
&gt; Iraq. Germany has ground troops in Afghanistan.

&gt; &quot;There are clear indications that at a minimum Ramstein and the Frankfurt
&gt; airport were possible targets and that they would not have waited long to
&gt; strike,&quot; leading conservative politician Wolfgang Bosbach told German
&gt; television station N24, adding the attacks could have been timed to
&gt; coincide with the anniversary of September 11.

&gt; Police believe that the men wanted to experiment in the coming days and
&gt; weeks with the chemicals and possibly start building a bomb. They were,
&gt; however, far away from making a bomb that could be detonated.

&gt; A &quot;bomb factory&quot; is said to have been found in the village of
&gt; Oberschledorn in the Sauerland. Locals said undercover police had been
&gt; watching the house from a caravan.

&gt; Captain Jeff Gradeck, a spokesman for the US European Command (EUCOM) in
&gt; Stuttgart, said: &quot;We don't have any information yet that US facilities
&gt; were targeted.&quot;

&gt; There was no comment from Frankfurt airport, one of Europe's busiest. The
&gt; Ramstein base in the nearby state of Rhineland-Palatinate, 130 km (80
&gt; miles) southwest of the airport, is one of the most important US air bases
&gt; overseas.

&gt; Germany, which has forces stationed in Afghanistan, has been on high alert
&gt; for attacks. The country has feared a re-emergence of militant Islamic
&gt; groups since 2001, when the northern city of Hamburg was used as a base
&gt; for planning the September 11 attacks.

&gt; Earlier this year, federal prosecutors charged a Lebanese man held in
&gt; detention over an unsuccessful attempt to detonate bombs on two trains in
&gt; Germany in 2006.

&gt; He and another suspect were caught on surveillance cameras wheeling
&gt; suitcases containing bombs aboard trains at Cologne's main railway
&gt; station.

&gt; Both men left suitcases on the trains, which they planned to detonate
&gt; later in the day with a timed explosive device. Despite being activated,
&gt; the bombs failed to go off because of a technical error, the prosecutor's
&gt; office said.

True enough, no indication the German police acted without some sort of
warrant.

Also, no indication the Germans are preparing to invade Indonesia in
retaliation for the Turk with the Pakistani passport. Perhaps they
learned something 1939-45 that we didn't.

&gt; &gt; If you were a prisoner and made to piss on a cross, how would you feel?

&gt; I would feel ALIVE!

&gt; &gt; If you don't realise the panties thing, you don't understand the culture
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; that's why you're losing in Iraq. With the Iraqi people.

&gt; Your ignorance is bliss lib!

Well

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What's that got to do with OURS?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Either you believe in protecting civil liberties everywhere or your a

&gt; &gt;&gt; hanging panties on the head), yelling or upsetting their sensibilities

Obviously the Jihadist Terrorist do not want America in Iraq. However the
DULY elected government does.

If you disagree, you're welcome to prove otherwise.

There has been a spate of stupid amateur 'terrorists' in Europe of late.
Exactly as we predicted there would be following Bush's invasion and
occupation of Iraq.
Fortunately they are mostly inept and have been easily caught so far as they
are generally just ordinary people who have been infuriated by what is being
done to their perceived 'brothers' in Iraq.
However, it is probably just a matter of time before one of them manages to
kill a few people.
Thanks a fucking lot Mr Bush.

However I deal in reality not radical left wing delusions.

Here's a picture of an Iraqi who apparently couldn't tolerate what you
describe as &quot;upsetting their sensibilities&quot;. He's dead.
