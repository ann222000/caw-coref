Well, it's been about 6 weeks since I took ownership of my first H-D,
the Ultra I mentioned in a post back about...oh, 6 weeks ago...;~)

Have a tall cool one, or a short hot one, depending on your mood and
location, whilst I share my impressions thus far:

I must say, it just keeps getting better! I am extremely impressed
with it, love the way it rides, handles well for a big fat bike, gets
me where I want to go in comfort and style (an added plus!), as well
as in a relaxed, non-road weary condition. It lulls me into wanting to
ride from tankfull to tankfull, which I have done and plan to do
often. Doesn't really matter where I go or end up, it's just a
pleasure doing so.

There are so many gadgets that I get distracted while riding, but that
is slowly subsiding as I get to know all the fun doo-dads and how and
when to fiddle with them or not. I was at first somewhat underwhelmed
by its apparent lack of power, (even though it sports a PCIII), but I
soon came to realize that this is what a touring bike is all about.
The bike I sold to buy this (Royal Star Venture) was quick and fast,
but IMO that kinda took away from the whole idea of leisurely touring.
Now, as those who own these know, it is no slouch, but I have taken on
a whole new mode of riding. The whole world kind of slows down and I
see/hear/experience more on it than I have on any other bike I have
owned or still own. Of course my Goose is still my baby and always
will be, and when the need for speed on a hard riding, hooligan-ish
bike calls, I take her out. She still commands looks and inquiries
from everyone. But she's in semi-retirement now, and happily snuggled
up to Mr. Ultra.

Sure, there have been some &quot;questions&quot; and the learning curve has been
a little wide, but that was to be expected, especially since I never
considered myself a &quot;Harley&quot; kinda guy, (whatever that is) and still
don't, really, but rather an enjoyer (new word?) of a fine ride on a
well made machine which does what it is supposed to do with aplomb
aplenty! (I have even purchased a couple of H-D shirts, oh the
humanityl)! I have had some heat issues, my thighs got cooked more
than once (deflectors on order), it kept shutting down on me on an
exceptionally hot day while riding in Gawd-awful traffic during Fleet
Week and the Columbus Day Parade and the Blue Angels show on the Hills
of San Francisco recently, but re-started without a squawk once we got
rolling again.

I see some long rides on some never ending two lane blacktops in my
future, and look forward to starting a new one everytime I finish an
old one. Monument Valley is high on my list. An old timer once told me
that the epitome of American riding (to him) was a lone roll along a
deserted road in M/V on a Harley. I have never gotten that image out
of my head and plan to do just that, one day. Glad I made the jump and
the huge (to me) financial committment. After 12+ bikes I never had a
bike payment before, but I can't say that anymore, LOL! So far, it's
been worth every hard earned cent!

Thanks for listening, and for the help and advice on questions past
and future, and there'll be some, to be sure!
~Ride Safe~

Where in the bay area are you? I was watching out of my office window

SF Native! Yes, there are still a few of us lollygagging around.
(Well OK, I'll admit to now being up in God's Private Riding Gorunds
of Marin county)!
I headed into The City that day with the Mrs. on back intending to try
the new ride out on the steeper hills. You know the ones with the
steps built into them?  ;~)
Decided to go see the parade and got caught up in the mess crossing
Columbus at Bay while the beginning of the parade was allowed to pass
by. Took us about 20 minutes to go the one block, and the bike was
really REALLY getting hot. That's when it shut down.

I'm over in the Stockton area but work in Emeryville out on the point.

I haven't had any overheating issues on my '07 Ultra. I bought it new in
April, saw how hot that rear cylinder got and changed pipes. I put on
the V&amp;H 2 into 1's and a V&amp;H fuel pak, over 17K on the bike now and no
heat issues. I also had the stage 1 flash done before I picked it up at
the dealer. Runs great now.

Glad you are liking you news ride. I like to ride mine from sun up, to sun
down, with several tank full in between!

Not sure why you'd give a bike rave reviews when it &quot;shut down&quot;
on you. I'd be a bit upset. It's brand new.

It's not brand new. It's an '06 with 14K on it. The &quot;shut down&quot; was
due to a sensor sensing overly high heat in the rear cylinder as I was
told by H-D techs. It's been checked out (under warranty), re-set and
all is A-OK. The reviews remain &quot;rave&quot;.
By the way...you top posted!
