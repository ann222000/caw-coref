&lt;&lt;On July 23, 1567, while practicing fencing with Edward Baynam,
a TAILOR, in the backyard of CECIL's house in the Strand,
the 17-year-old Oxford killed an unarmed undercook named
.
THOMAS BRINCKNELL
.
with a thrust to the THIGH. A packed jury instructed
by CECIL found that Brincknell had caused his own death
by wilfully hurling himself on Oxford's rapier.

On July 23, 1567, at Lochleven, Mary Queen of Scots had
to sign an act of withdrawal in favor of her one year old son,
who was crowned as James VI five days afterward at Scone
and was harangued by a long speech from John KNOX.
----------------------------------------------------------------
William Perkins's *salve for a Sicke Man* (1597):

&lt;&lt;[John KNOX] lay on his death bedde silent for
the space of four hours, very often giving great
sighes, sobbes, and grones... &quot;But blessed be God
which brought to my minde such Scriptures whereby

I might QUENCH [Spense] the fierie DARTS of the devill,

By the grace of God, I AM THAT I AM: and, not I but the
grace of God in me: and thus being vanquished he departed.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;In the autumn of 1848 EVERt Duyckinck, editor of The Literary World,
sent his friend Herman Melville a copy of Joseph C. Hart's
The Romance of Yachting: Voyage the First with a request for a review.

Melville returned the book in November with the comment:

&quot;What the deuce does it mean? -- Here's a book positively turned wrong
side out, the title page on the coVER, an index to the whole in more
ways than one. -- I open at the beginning, &amp; find myself in the MIDDLE
of the Blue Laws of Dr. O'Callaghan. Then proceeding, find sEVERal
extracts from the Log Book of Noah's ARK -- Still further,
take a hand at 3 or 4 BULL fights, &amp; then I'm set down to a
digest of all the commentators on Shakspeare, who, according
'to our author' was a dunce &amp; a BLACKGUARD -- Vide passim.&quot;&gt;&gt;

Melville letter to EVERt Duyckinck, February 24 1849
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;I have been passing my time VERy pleasurably here, But cheifly in lounging on a sofa (a la the poet Grey) &amp; reading Shakspeare. It is an edition in glorious great type, EVERy letter whereof is a soldier, &amp; the top of EVERy &quot;T&quot; like a musket barrel. Dolt &amp; ass that I am I have lived more than 29 years, &amp; until a few days ago, nEVER made close acquaintance with the divine William. Ah, he's full of sermons-on-the-mount, and gentle, aye, almost as JEsus. I take such men to be inspired. I fancy that this moment Shakspeare in heaven ranks with Gabriel Raphael and Michael.

And if another Messiah EVER COMES
tWILL be in SHAKESPER's person.

-- I am mad to think how minute a cause has prevented me hitherto from reading Shakspeare. But until now, EVERy copy that was COME-atable to me, happened to be in a vile small print unendurable to my eyes which are tender as young sparrows. But chancing to fall in with this glorious edition, I now exult in it, PAGE after PAGE.&gt;&gt;

As great as is thy master, greater, for

Continue where he is: to shift his being

JOHN (1296-1346), king of Bohemia,
was a chivalrous &amp; romantic personage, who enjoyed
a reputation for valour both before and after his death;
but as a ruler he was careless &amp; extravagant, interested only
in his kingdom when seeking relief from his constant pecuniary
embarrassments. According to Camden the crest or badge of 3 ostrich
FEATHERs, with the motto &quot;ICH DIEN&quot;, borne by the prince of Wales
was originally that of John of Bohemia and was first assumed
by Edward the Black Prince after the battle of Crecy.

But see!- see!- yonder scampers a RAGGED little urchin. Where is

the king is coming in triumph; that he is dressed in state;
that he has just finished putting to death, with his own hand,

THE RED HORSE (Hippo) OF TYSOE

&quot;My Red Horse of you all contemned lies,

&lt;&lt;The de VERES were an ancient dynastic family seated at their ancestral
village of VER (from which they took their name), near Bayeaux and
the River VIRE, in MANCHE on the NORMANdy coast of present-day northern
France. The name of the town itself came from the &quot;VER,&quot; a Norse word
meaning &quot;fishdam&quot; that the Vikings had introduced into NORMANdy,
and etymologically akin to the Old English word &quot;weir&quot; meaning a
&quot;fish dam,&quot; and originally spelled both &quot;Wier&quot; and &quot;Wear&quot; also,
hence the diverse spellings of the FAMILY name.&gt;&gt;

The Symbolism of the GOAT &amp; the Horse

&lt;&lt;The GOAT and the Horse represent the dual aspects of Creation. They
represent, as we already said, the Universe. The Horse is Celestial &amp;
supreme, whereas the GOAT is Infernal &amp; humble. The GOAT represents
Capricornus, the Water-GOAT. In other words, he is the Fallen Sun,
fallen from the supreme position down into the seas, into the
infernal depths of the great abyss. Greek myths tell how Pan,
during the war of the gods with Typhon and his hosts,
assumed the shape of a GOAT (Capricornus), and jumped
into the NILE river in order to escape the fearful giant.&gt;&gt;

*RISE* 'after the night of the carrying of the word of Nuahs [Shaun]
and the night of making Mehs [Shem] to cuddle up in a coddlepot'.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Melville: &quot;I would to God Shakspeare had lived later, &amp; promenaded
in Broadway. Not that I might have had the pleasure of leaving my card
for him at the Astor, or made merry with him oVER a bowl of the fine
Duyckinck punch; but that the muzzle which all men wore on their soul
in the Elizebethan day, might not have intercepted Shakspers full
articulations. For I hold it a VERity, that even Shakspeare,
was not a FRANK man [i.e., Francis Bacon] to the uttermost.
And, indeed, who in this intolerant uniVERse is, or can be?
But the Declaration of Independence makes a difference.&quot;&gt;&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Melville: &quot;And do not think, my boy, that because I,
impulsively broke forth in jubillations oVER Shakspeare,
that, therefore, I am of the number of the SNOBS

No, I would stand afar off &amp; alone, &amp; burn some pure Palm oil,

&quot;The word 'Messiah' comes from the Hebrew verb 'to anoint', which

The custom sprang from kingly practice in old Mesopotamia.&quot;

A GNAT settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time.

Just as he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise,
and inquired of the Bull if he would like him to go.

The Bull replied, &quot;I did not know you had come,
and I shall not miss you when you go away.&quot;

A GNAT came and said to a Lion, &quot;I do not in the least fear you,
nor are you stronger than I am. For in what does your strength
consist? You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth
an a woman in her quarrels. I repeat that I am altogether more
powerful than you; and if you doubt it, let us fight and see who
will conquer.&quot; The GNAT, having sounded his horn, fastened
himself upon the Lion and stung him on the nostrils and the parts
of the face devoid of hair. While trying to crush him, the Lion
tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself sEVERely.
The GNAT thus prevailed over the Lion, and, buzzing about in a
song of triumph, flew away. But shortly afterwards he became
entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider.
He greatly lamented his fate, saying, &quot;Woe is me! that I, who
can wage war successfully with the hugest beasts, should perish
myself from this spider, the most inconsiderable of insects!&quot;

Any annoyance in that precious sense!

Irritable little GNAT she was and always would be and
that was why no-one could get on with her, poking her
nose into what was no concern of hers.

MERCUTIO O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

Her chariot is an empty HAZEL-NUT

Edmund Spenser's _VIRGILS GNAT_
sold at The Signe of the GUNNE

A poem by Spenser, published 1591, and adapted from the
Culex attributed to Virgil. A shepherd sleeping in the
shade is about to be attacked by a serpent, when a GNAT,
to warn him, stings him on the eyelid. The shepherd
crushes the GNAT, and sees and kills the serpent.

The next night the ghost of the GNAT reproaches him
for his cruelty. The shepherd, filled with remorse,
raises a monument to the GNAT.

Virgils GNAT.

Long since dedicated
To the most noble and excellent Lord,
THE EARLE OF LEICESTER.
late deceased.

WRONG'D, yet not daring to expresse my paine,
To you (great Lord) the causer of my care,
In clowdie teares my case I thus complaine
Vnto yourselfe, that onely priuie are:
But if that any Oedipus vnware
Shall chaunce, through power of some diuining spright,

To reade the SECRETE OF THIS RIDDLE RARE,

And know the purporte of my euill plight,
Let him rest pleased with his owne insight,
Ne further seeke to glose vpon the text:
For griefe enough it is to grieued wight
To feele his fault, and not be further vext.
But what so by my selfe may not be showen,
May by this GNATTS complaint be easily knowen.
