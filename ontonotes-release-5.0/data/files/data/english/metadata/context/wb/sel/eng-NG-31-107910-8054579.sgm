Clunk after installing new sway bars

I upgraded the factory sway bars on my 96 Miata with a pair of solid
FM bars.  Since then, I can hear a small clunk sound from my right
rear whenever I pull up a driveway, even at 5mph.  I've email FM
support and basically they asked me to recheck the torque and do more
investigation.

I've check the torque on all 4 brackets and endlinks.  I haven't
bother with the suspension bolts since those bolts look like they
haven't been touched since coming out of the factory and probably need
a few shots of WD40.

I've grab the wheel wells on all 4 corners and rocked the car pretty
hard, but did not hear any noise.  I've also tap the catback with my
foot at different places, harder than I imagine going up a driveway
will shake it, and heard nothing.

Also, when I installed the rear bar, it was pretty hard to get both
end links attached, so the rear sway bar is pretty loaded.  I haven't
notice any clunking noise when I autocross, and I've done 17 runs with
the new bars already.

The only thing I can think of is to tape that area up and see if I can
find out that parts are banging against each other.  I would
appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks,
Mack

After I installed my original sway bars, I had a clunk too.  The instructions
had a note about which hole in the bar not to use, and of course, I got
them mixed up.  So the bolts would get into the springs when the sway bar
shifted in its supports during driving.

Check the RR lower spring perch for a shiny spot or dent where the bar
is hitting it under full compression. To fix it, you may have to use a
different endlink hole. The middle hole should be OK. If you don't like
the resulting handling balance, correct it by adjusting the front-rear
camber bias at your next alignment.

On my '94 with FM sways, I use the middle hole in the 5/8&quot; rear bar, the
outer hole in the 7/8&quot; front bar, and a 0.55° camber bias. The result is
the tiniest bit on the understeer side of dead neutral. Just enough
understeer that I don't have to make constant corrections to stay in the
center of a highway lane.

I used the FM suggested setting for my car.  I didn't see any marks on
my springs, but to be sure, I painted my springs near the sway bar
with white house paint.  I'll test it tomorrow after the paint drys.

My rear bar is using the middle hole and the front is using the
outside hole.  I don't see any marks on the perch or springs.  I went
ahead and painted the lower inside of my springs and perch white, so I
can test again tomorrow.  I also balanced my car on 3 wheels, front on
jacks, rear right tire on an 8&quot; block, and the rear left tire about 1&quot;
off the ground.  I checked the sway bars with this heavy static
loading of the rear sway bars and there was still decent space between
the spring plane and sway bar.

If I don't see any marks on the paint tomorrow, I'll try different
sway bar mount holes.  I did notice my end link bushing are worn.  Any
change this can cause the clunking noise?  My car only has 40K.

Thanks.

After farther investigation, I found that my rear sway bars are moving
left and right about 1&quot; to 1.5&quot;.  The bars are not hitting the springs
or perch.  I'm guessing the clunking noise is from the bars hitting
the piece of frame its mounted on.

I'm under the impression that the bars should not move left and
right.  Any ideas how I can fix this?

Thanks,
Mack

Did you use the lube that (usually) comes with the new bars? Maybe it's
grabbing and letting loose instead of sliding thru the bushings as intended.

Good Luck,

I got one small tube from FM and I used it all on the front bar.  I
used Pennzoil Wheel Bearing Grease instead for the rear (http://
automotive.hardwarestore.com/89-550-grease/pennzoil-wheel-bearing-
grease-662720.aspx?CAWELAID=42556446).

Do you recommend a different grease?  I only install the bars2 weeks
ago and the clunking noise was there almost right away.

Mack

Waterproof wheel bearing grease for boat trailers, from a boat store.

To prevent lateral shifting, you can wrap a piece of old radiator hose
around the bar outboard of each frame bushing, secured with a hose clamp.

FWIW, my bars never move sideways. Dunno why some do and some don't.

I bought my sticky green marine wheel bearing grease from Autozone about
7 years ago.
I would think that any major auto parts store would carry it, &quot;probably&quot;
at a somewhat lower price, not that a tube of grease is that expensive
to begin with.

After using it on 4 different sway bar installations, it still at least
90% full.

As Lanny recommended, waterproof wheel bearing grease.

Still, since you used any type of bearing grease during the rear
install, it probably is not catching and letting go like Chris suggested
as a possibility.

The grease that you used will wash out from driving in the rain much
faster than grease designed for trailers that regularly get pushed into
the water, but the result will most likely be an irritating squeak.

I think that I have only re-applied the grease to one set of sway bar
bushings, and that was on my daily driver which saw a lot of rain
driving, and it still took 4 years or more before it needed attention.

My bar has only been on for 2 weeks, so I don't think the grease is
the issue.  It still moves freely in the bracket.  I'll get so get
some marina quality grease before the rain season starts.

The guy at FM also suggested the using a hose like you suggested.
That seem to dampen the noise the first couple of times, but after
that, it same sound returned.  There was too much lateral force for
the clamp and hose to stay in place.

For a temporary fix, I'm going to use the same hose and clamp as a
buffer between the two piece of banging metal.  I'll still
investigating a permanent solution.

Did you lower the car before doing the final bolt tightening?

I wiped the grease off with a rag, but maybe that's not enough.  Let
me try some cleaners and really get a good cleaning.

Yes.  I got the bolts on while it was still jacked up, but I tighten
and torque the bar on the ground.
When you attached your end links to the bar, did it fit easily, or did
you have to muscle it in a bit?

With my FM bars, the endlinks fit fine...provided I went with the bar
holes they were telling me to use: outer front, middle rear. Anything
else would've been a real struggle.

Those endlinks knew what they were doing; the handling balance was close
to perfect with my stock springs. The fine tuning was a matter of
adjusting the front-rear camber bias on the alignment rack.

The noise is gone.  I went to the hardware store and got a few screw
type tube clamps instead of the spring type I was using.  I also got a
foot of 5/8&quot; washer hose which is a perfect fit for the rear FM bar.
I also used WD-40 and a rough sponge pad to clean the grease off the
bar.  As an added precaution, I put some hose over the part of the bar
that used to bump the frame(I was under the car anyways and had some
extra hose).  I did some test and the sway bar is not moving.
Hopefully, it'll hold up at Thunderhill on Saturday.

I really appreciate everyone's help.
