Netopia 3347W DSL modem on AT&amp;T BellSouth -- only one desktop gets the Internet

I ask here for your advice, since many of us have or support very small
businesses, and many of those use BellSouth (AT&amp;T) for DSL, and many of
those use Netopia DSL modems.

I support a small company, with an SBS 2003 and three desktops, all wired to
a Netopia 3347W DSL modem/router (Wireless &amp; DHCP disabled in the Netopia).
They're gone for three days for Labor Day, and coming back on Monday, no one
can get to the Internet.  I tell the owner to reset (unplug the power) from
the Netopia, and power off the desktops.

When things are restarted, one desktop connects to the Internet, but the
other two, and the server, do not.  They all share files ok, the desktops
are pulling IP addresses from the server, they all can access the Netopia's
web interface (192.168.1.254), but the server and the other two desktops are
off the Internet.

One of the employees even brought in a laptop today, which also picks up an
IP, but no Internet.

I have tried all I can think to do, including a Factory Reset of the
Netopia, but the score remains: 1 desktop connected to the Internet, 1
server &amp; 2 others not connected to the Internet (but to each other, and to
the DSL modem, is ok).

I have asked BS to overnight a new DSL modem, but the business owner had to
ask me: what if the new modem doesn't fix the problem?  I answered honestly
that at this point, I don't really know.

It seems logical that somehow the MAC address of the working desktop has
been stored in the modem, and it's only permitting passage for it.  It seems
unlikely that the MAC address would remain stored after a Factory Reset.  It
also seems unlikely that all (but one) of the desktops, laptop, or server
have an identical malady.  I checked the logs on each -- there weren't any
updates or installations noted in the Event Logs in any of them, during the
past week.  Spyware &amp; virus scans show nada.  The server couldn't possibly
provide DNS lookup to just that one desktop (and not to itself)!

&lt;?&gt;

Each of the desktops and the laptop show the server's address as the only
DNS entry.  On the server, the lone Network adapter is static-set for IP (
192.168.1.10), and its DNS entry shows itself (192.168.1.10) in the settings
for TCP/IP for the adapter, and the Netopia (192.168.1.254) as its Gateway.
I remember rerunning CEICW on the server, and the settings looked right,
with the DNS set to BellSouth's 205.152.144.23 and 205.152.132.23 -- and the
working desktop is using the server's IP (192.168.1.10) as its only DNS.

The server has only one Ethernet port, for a number of reasons (which are no
longer valid); when this is resolved, it will have two.

Has anyone encountered anything like this?

I'm stumped for now.

Greg,

Do a remote session with me tomorrow and I will look at it to give you a
second set of eyes.

I also have a spare modem you can borrow.

Chuck

Chuck,

Thanks.  You just reminded me that I have a &quot;spare&quot; Netopia 3347W available,
sitting right next to me, in fact!

I appreciate the offer of a remote session, too.
I'll give you a call.

Problem solved.

I had to go back 6 days in the Event Logs to find it, but there it was,
Error 8003 from MrXSmb, another computer trying to identify itself as the
master browser.  Turns out that the owner's desktop decided to play tricks
on Friday night, and it tried to take over from the SBS 2003.  Somehow, the
SBS 2003 decided to play back seat to the workstation, and did not elect
itself as the master browser.  Thus, the workstation had no problems
accessing the Internet, but everyone else did.

Solution:  EventID.net had several suggestions for Event 8003, including
some registry changes to insure that if this happens again, the SBS 2003
will elect itself the master.  The fix for this, though, was to remove the
Browser service from the workstation (disabling and stopping it, it was
said, would cause hundreds of error messages).  So, on the workstation, I
stopped and disabled the Computer Browser service (in services.msc), then I
ran this:

sc delete browser

For good measure, I ran this on both the workstation and the SBS 2003:

ipconfig /flushdns

Then I restarted the workstation.

I reran CEICW, and while it was saving changes, the other workstations were
finally able to access the Internet again.

For good measure, I downloaded the latest Windows Updates for the SBS 2003,
and when that was done, I restarted it.  Everything is green now.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The topology here was:  DSL into Netopia 3347W (with Wireless and DHCP
disabled), the SBS 2003 and the owner's desktop are plugged directly into
the Netopia, the other two desktops (and the occasional laptop) are plugged
into a switch which is run into the Netopia.  There was a single NIC in the
SBS 2003, and DHCP was running on the SBS 2003.

As soon as AT&amp;T assigns a static IP bank, I will be changing this to:
DSL -&gt; Netopia -&gt; SBS 2003 -&gt; Switch -&gt; owner's desktop and (distant) switch
-&gt; other workstations and network printers.

---------------------------------------------------------------

As Sherlock Holmes says: &quot;You always find what you seek in the last place
you look.&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------

...because, of course, any sensible person would stop looking at that point.

Thanks to all who responded to my request for ideas.  (In particular, thanks
to the two people who called me.)  Many of your suggestions are worth
implementing, even if they didn't fix this problem.

BellSouth says they don't want a modem returned, so now I have two extra
Netopia 3347W DSL modem/routers -- one of them brand-new.  If anyone needs
one to test out a problem, please call me.
