&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The solution to the mexican invasion is simple. Every city
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should announce there will no prosecution for crimes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against illegals. The muds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will then leave on their own overnight and it won't cost a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now all you need to do is convince sober, intelligent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people of that. Good luck with that, champ.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The solution to illegal immigration is to not provide
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illegal's anything...no schooling for their kids, no medical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My, how compassionate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It isn't supposed to be compassionate you pig ignorant moron.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's no need to show compassion to people who come here
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illegally.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WWJD?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prosecute the companies and people giving them jobs, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make the punishment for hiring illegal's very severe.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprint and photograph every illegal in the country.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone caught sneaking in to this country is immediately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deported.  Any money found on any illegal in this country
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be confiscated before sending them back across the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; border.  Make it so that it is not attractive for them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come here. It is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dark cloud of liberalism that allows this country to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conditions here so favorable and attractive for them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the native Hawaiians should do the same to you racist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; repugnant haole cunts who invaded and destroyed their lands.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Hawaiian Islands were allowed to be ceded to the United
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; States by Queen Lilioukalani.  There was no miltiary takeover. There was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no use of force.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bwahahahahaha!  It was a coup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Another primitive backwards stoneage people who have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ultimately benefitted from white Anglo Saxon colonization.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your race also benefitted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My race?  You don't know anything about my race.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have the right to make your comments, however ignorant and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; misguided they may be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That right gripes your ass, doesn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If &quot;benefitted&quot; means &quot;almost wiped out by disease and having
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one's country forcibly annexed&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiians ruled their own country until 1898.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, it was their own country until we annexed it.  By
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; force.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No force was used.  You need a new source of information.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please enlighten me.  Also, do you have any sources on how the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grateful Indians gave their lands away?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They were forced to give up their land.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They were moved by gunpoint.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many tribes were hunted by the military.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The whites used biological warfare on them by giving them blankets
&gt;&gt;&gt; contaminated with smallpox and yellow fever.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You hold that as a standard to be admired?  You advocate that?

&gt;&gt; Good heavens!  Do you have a reading comprehension problem?  Where do
&gt;&gt; you get the idea that I admire a policy that forces an independent
&gt;&gt; people to give up their land?

&gt; You typed it and posted it above.

&gt; The takeover of Indian territories is a
&gt;&gt; shameful part of of our history, and my point is that some of the
&gt;&gt; same techniques were used to annex Hawaii.

&gt; No they were not.  The Hawaiians were not forced off their lands. They were
&gt; not denied their culture or their religion.  They were not
&gt; forced to live on reservations.  They were not hunted by the military.  They
&gt; wre not denied basic human rights, as were the native Americans.
&gt; The Hawaiians did not suffer because the islands were annexed.  They
&gt; were allowed to particiapte in the new

&quot;Conquest of Hawai'i&quot; PAINFULLY TRUE
Original VIEWPOINT
as submitted to The Maui News
(Edited version was published Tuesday, October 21, 2003)

By CHARLES K. MAXWELL

The History Channel presentation on Sunday night (10/12/03), &quot;Conquest of
Hawaii&quot;, was very accurate and painfully true as to the history of Hawaii and
the facts of the past. It was very surprising that your Editorial did not think
so. Whoever wrote the editorial in The Maui News (10/14/03) must have looked at
the show with a jaundiced eye to question the people who were involved with the
show and call them &quot;Outsiders if that is what they were&quot;. For your information
Mr. Editor, some of them were Kanaka Maoli. The narrator, Mr. John Osorio, is a
professor of Hawaiian Studies at the University Of Hawaii; Kelly Hu is a native
Hawaiian actress and a graduate of Kamehameha School. Rocky Jensen is a sculptor
and deeply involved in the Hawaiian culture, they are truly kama-aina (children
of the land).

Almost every question that you raised in the presentation was based on books
that were written about past history. Research was done with the Hawaiian method
of passing oral history from one generation to the other in the form of oli or
chants. It is our unique method of documentation. Believe it or not, we have a
chant of creation which is called the Kumulipo, created thousands of years ago
and it tells us where we came from and how we evolved as Polynesians. We have
chants that predicted the coming of the Western man 2 to 3 hundred years before
they arrived in 1778. The facts of this exist in foot prints that were carved in
sandstone by a Kahuna (priest) who predicted that the western man would come
here someday and obliterate the Kanaka Maoli. These sandstone plaques are
displayed at Mo'omomi Beach on Molokai and it is called Kalaina Waewae.

As a Kanaka Maoli viewing this presentation it brought tears to my eyes to see
again the numerous atrocities our people suffered. As a historian, lecturer and
cultural specialist, I can vouch for the authenticity of the presentation and
the accuracy of the events in our past history. Overall it was well put
together.

The traumatic events that occurred was the arrival of Capt. James Cook in 1778
which brought all the deceases known to western man and disseminated our people
by the hundreds of thousands. The 2nd was the arrival of the Missionaries in
1820, to do exactly what the host Kelly Hu said, &quot;They came here to do good,
instead they did well&quot;.

Missionaries who left the ministry saw how bountiful this land was. In the
name of Christianity, they became advisors to the Kings and Queens of Hawaii and
changed laws to allow the acquisition of Hawaiian land. Not being satisfied with
controlling the land, with the help of U.S. troops, took over the Hawaiian
Islands in 1893 as what is known as the &quot;Overthrow&quot;. It should have been known
as a Terrorist Attack on a friendly nation. The events were as traumatic to us
as the 911 attack on America and like the attack, has far reaching effects, even
a hundred plus years later. The illegal Overthrow of Hawaii, reeks of terrorism
in the literally sense of the word. Do events of what happened to our Queen and
the Hawaiian Kingdom sound similar? American troops land on Hawaiian soil
uninvited, take over the royal palace, hold the residence of Honolulu hostage,
recognize a coup d'etat, made up of American citizens, and descendants of the
first missionaries, then imprison the Queen and arrest her followers. And yet,
Queen Liliuokalani did not have weapons of mass destruction. She only had ALOHA
for her fellow man.

The Petition circulated by the Hawaiian people did contain 98% percent of all
the Hawaiians living in Hawaii signing the petition against the Annexation. As
far as the Statehood Act, America accepted Hawaii with tainted title. Missionary
descendants, American Business men and others gave Hawaii to America, they not
the true owners of the land. No vote or plebiscite was taken from the Kanaka
Maoli people in the Statehood Act, everyone that lived in Hawaii voted for
Statehood. The question is are we better off as Kanaka Maoli today because of
the Statehood Act?

This is what we are faced with today and it is a direct result of being
colonized. Presently we make up all the social ills of society. Our people can
not find affordable homes; living is high that they have to leave Hawaii because
not even 3 jobs are enough to support their family. Homes can only be purchased
by the rich who wants to turn our islands into a Mecca for second homes, gated
communities were only the rice can live and play. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs
was already attacked using the laws of this great nation and again to attack the
Hawaiian People, their entitlements and the Ali'i Trust. A Princess will is
being threatened, the Hawaiian Homes Lands

Maybe they should secede from the union. They better hope those tourist
dollars go far though, because I don't think Hawaii has much in the way
of exports.

Hawaiians, like all other native american indian people, ignore the BENEFITS
that being a part of the US has bestowed upon them. The roads they drive,
the airports they use, the educational system they use were all paid for, to
some degree, by the US.

&gt;&gt; &quot;Conquest of Hawai'i&quot; PAINFULLY TRUE
&gt;&gt; Original VIEWPOINT
&gt;&gt; as submitted to The Maui News
&gt;&gt; (Edited version was published Tuesday, October 21, 2003)

&gt;&gt;  By CHARLES K. MAXWELL

&gt;&gt;  The History Channel presentation on Sunday night (10/12/03), &quot;Conquest
&gt;&gt; of Hawaii&quot;, was very accurate and painfully true as to the history of
&gt;&gt; Hawaii and the facts of the past. It was very surprising that your
&gt;&gt; Editorial did not think so. Whoever wrote the editorial in The Maui News
&gt;&gt; (10/14/03) must have looked at the show with a jaundiced eye to question
&gt;&gt; the people who were involved with the show and call them &quot;Outsiders if
&gt;&gt; that is what they were&quot;. For your information Mr. Editor, some of them
&gt;&gt; were Kanaka Maoli. The narrator, Mr. John Osorio, is a professor of
&gt;&gt; Hawaiian Studies at the University Of Hawaii; Kelly Hu is a native
&gt;&gt; Hawaiian actress and a graduate of Kamehameha School. Rocky Jensen is a
&gt;&gt; sculptor and deeply involved in the Hawaiian culture, they are truly
&gt;&gt; kama-aina (children of the land).

&gt;&gt;  Almost every question that you raised in the presentation was based on
&gt;&gt; books that were written about past history. Research was done with the
&gt;&gt; Hawaiian method of passing oral history from one generation to the other
&gt;&gt; in the form of oli or chants. It is our unique method of documentation.
&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, we have a chant of creation which is called the
&gt;&gt; Kumulipo, created thousands of years ago and it tells us where we came
&gt;&gt; from and how we evolved as Polynesians. We have chants that predicted the
&gt;&gt; coming of the Western man 2 to 3 hundred years before they arrived in
&gt;&gt; 1778. The facts of this exist in foot prints that were carved in
&gt;&gt; sandstone by a Kahuna (priest) who predicted that the western man would
&gt;&gt; come here someday and obliterate the Kanaka Maoli. These sandstone
&gt;&gt; plaques are displayed at Mo'omomi Beach on Molokai and it is called
&gt;&gt; Kalaina Waewae.

&gt;&gt;  As a Kanaka Maoli viewing this presentation it brought tears to my eyes
&gt;&gt; to see again the numerous atrocities our people suffered. As a historian,
&gt;&gt; lecturer and cultural specialist, I can vouch for the authenticity of the
&gt;&gt; presentation and the accuracy of the events in our past history. Overall
&gt;&gt; it was well put together.

&gt;&gt;  The traumatic events that occurred was the arrival of Capt. James Cook
&gt;&gt; in 1778 which brought all the deceases known to western man and
&gt;&gt; disseminated our people by the hundreds of thousands. The 2nd was the
&gt;&gt; arrival of the Missionaries in 1820, to do exactly what the host Kelly Hu
&gt;&gt; said, &quot;They came here to do good, instead they did well&quot;.

&gt;&gt;  Missionaries who left the ministry saw how bountiful this land was. In
&gt;&gt; the name of Christianity, they became advisors to the Kings and Queens of
&gt;&gt; Hawaii and changed laws to allow the acquisition of Hawaiian land. Not
&gt;&gt; being satisfied with controlling the land, with the help of U.S. troops,
&gt;&gt; took over the Hawaiian Islands in 1893 as what is known as the
&gt;&gt; &quot;Overthrow&quot;. It should have been known as a Terrorist Attack on a
&gt;&gt; friendly nation. The events were as traumatic to us as the 911 attack on
&gt;&gt; America and like the attack, has far reaching effects, even a hundred
&gt;&gt; plus years later. The illegal Overthrow of Hawaii, reeks of terrorism in
&gt;&gt; the literally sense of the word. Do events of what happened to our Queen
&gt;&gt; and the Hawaiian Kingdom sound similar? American troops land on Hawaiian
&gt;&gt; soil uninvited, take over the royal palace, hold the residence of
&gt;&gt; Honolulu hostage, recognize a coup d'etat, made up of American citizens,
&gt;&gt; and descendants of the first missionaries, then imprison the Queen and
&gt;&gt; arrest her followers. And yet, Queen Liliuokalani did not have weapons of
&gt;&gt; mass destruction. She only had ALOHA for her fellow man.

&gt;&gt;  The Petition circulated by the Hawaiian people did contain 98% percent
&gt;&gt; of all the Hawaiians living in Hawaii signing the petition against the
&gt;&gt; Annexation. As far as the Statehood Act, America accepted Hawaii with
&gt;&gt; tainted title. Missionary descendants, American Business men and others
&gt;&gt; gave Hawaii to America, they not the true owners of the land. No vote or
&gt;&gt; plebiscite was taken from the Kanaka Maoli people in the Statehood Act,
&gt;&gt; everyone that lived in Hawaii voted for Statehood. The question is are we
&gt;&gt; better off as Kanaka Maoli today because of the Statehood Act?

&gt;&gt;  This is what we are faced with today and it is a direct result of being
&gt;&gt; colonized. Presently we make up all the social ills of society. Our
&gt;&gt; people can not find affordable homes; living is high that they have to
&gt;&gt; leave Hawaii because not even 3 jobs are enough to support their family.
&gt;&gt; Homes can only be purchased by the rich who wants to turn our islands
&gt;&gt; into a Mecca for second homes, gated communities were only the rice can
&gt;&gt; live and play. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs was already attacked using
&gt;&gt; the laws of this great nation and again to attack the Hawaiian People,
&gt;&gt; their entitlements and the Ali'i Trust. A Princess will is being
&gt;&gt; threatened, the Hawaiian Homes Lands Act is being challenged. If the law
&gt;&gt; suit is successful, it would presently displace 7000 Hawaiians that
&gt;&gt; presently live on Hawaiian Homes Land. Law suites that have been brought
&gt;&gt; by &quot;wannabe&quot; Hawaiians, William Burgess, Kenneth Conklin and the grandson
&gt;&gt; of the missionary descendant, Thrustin-Twigg Smith and others want to
&gt;&gt; make Hawaii &quot;color-blind&quot;.

&gt;&gt;  Your editorial says that the movie avoided &quot;questions facing Hawaiians
&gt;&gt; today&quot;. If you looked good the answers of what is happening today are
&gt;&gt; directly related to events that happened in the past. I surely hope that
&gt;&gt; the editorial views are not tainted because this newspaper was formerly
&gt;&gt; owned by the Cameron's descendants of the missionaries who still own a
&gt;&gt; large chunk of Maui with their cousins, the Baldwin's, Alexander's and
&gt;&gt; others that call Maui theirs. These islands always belonged to us, it is
&gt;&gt; our ancestral home, it is time that we stand up and fight for it. &quot;Ku I

I graduated from Nanakuli High and Intermediate School in Waianae, Oahu, and
Hawaiian History was a requirement.
Some of the events he mentioned are just plain false.

Take over of the Islands was a result of American plantation owners (Dole
and others). They instigated a revolt against powers of Hawaii and was able
to take control, not univited troops just one day decided to take over and
annex.

&gt; Maybe they should secede from the union. They better hope those tourist
&gt; dollars go far though, because I don't think Hawaii has much in the way
&gt; of exports.

&gt; Hawaiians, like all other native american indian people, ignore the
&gt; BENEFITS
&gt; that being a part of the US has bestowed upon them. The roads they drive,
&gt; the airports they use, the educational system they use were all paid for,
&gt; to
&gt; some degree, by the US.

This dude is some kook. Hawaiians are proud Americans, unlike those Puerto

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; narrator, Mr. John Osorio, is a professor of Hawaiian Studies at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the University Of Hawaii; Kelly Hu is a native Hawaiian actress
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a graduate of Kamehameha School. Rocky Jensen is a sculptor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and deeply involved in the Hawaiian culture, they are truly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kama-aina (children of the land). Almost every question that you raised in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the presentation was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; based on books that were written about past history. Research was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; done with the Hawaiian method of passing oral history from one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generation to the other in the form of oli or chants. It is our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unique method of documentation. Believe it or not, we have a chant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of creation which is called the Kumulipo, created thousands of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years ago and it tells us where we came from and how we evolved as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Polynesians. We have chants that predicted the coming of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Western man 2 to 3 hundred years before they arrived in 1778. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; facts of this exist in foot prints that were carved in sandstone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by a Kahuna (priest) who predicted that the western man would come
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here someday and obliterate the Kanaka Maoli. These sandstone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plaques are displayed at Mo'omomi Beach on Molokai and it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; called Kalaina Waewae. As a Kanaka Maoli viewing this presentation it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brought tears to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my eyes to see again the numerous atrocities our people suffered.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As a historian, lecturer and cultural specialist, I can vouch for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the authenticity of the presentation and the accuracy of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; events in our past history. Overall it was well put together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  The traumatic events that occurred was the arrival of Capt. James
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cook in 1778 which brought all the deceases known to western man
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and disseminated our people by the hundreds of thousands. The 2nd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was the arrival of the Missionaries in 1820, to do exactly what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the host Kelly Hu said, &quot;They came here to do good, instead they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did well&quot;. Missionaries who left the ministry saw how bountiful this land
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was. In the name of Christianity, they became advisors to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kings and Queens of Hawaii and changed laws to allow the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acquisition of Hawaiian land. Not being satisfied with controlling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the land, with the help of U.S. troops, took over the Hawaiian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Islands in 1893 as what is known as the &quot;Overthrow&quot;. It should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been known as a Terrorist Attack on a friendly nation. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; events were as traumatic to us as the 911 attack on America and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like the attack, has far reaching effects, even a hundred plus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years later. The illegal Overthrow of Hawaii, reeks of terrorism
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the literally sense of the word. Do events of what happened to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our Queen and the Hawaiian Kingdom sound similar? American troops
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; land on Hawaiian soil uninvited, take over the royal palace, hold
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the residence of Honolulu hostage, recognize a coup d'etat, made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up of American citizens, and descendants of the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; missionaries, then imprison the Queen and arrest her followers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And yet, Queen Liliuokalani did not have weapons of mass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; destruction. She only had ALOHA for her fellow man.  The Petition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circulated by the Hawaiian people did contain 98%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of all the Hawaiians living in Hawaii signing the petition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against the Annexation. As far as the Statehood Act, America
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accepted Hawaii with tainted title. Missionary descendants,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; American Business men and others gave Hawaii to America, they not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the true owners of the land. No vote or plebiscite was taken from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Kanaka Maoli people in the Statehood Act, everyone that lived
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Hawaii voted for Statehood. The question is are we better off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as Kanaka Maoli today because of the Statehood Act? This is what we are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; faced with today and it is a direct result of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being colonized. Presently we make up all the social ills of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; society. Our people can not find affordable homes; living is high
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that they have to leave Hawaii because not even 3 jobs are enough
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to support their family. Homes can only be purchased by the rich
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who wants to turn our islands into a Mecca for second homes, gated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; communities were only the rice can live and play. The Office of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiian Affairs was already attacked using the laws of this great
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nation and again to attack the Hawaiian People, their entitlements
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the Ali'i Trust. A Princess will is being threatened, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiian Homes Lands Act is being challenged. If the law suit is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; successful, it would presently displace 7000 Hawaiians that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presently live on Hawaiian Homes Land. Law suites that have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brought by &quot;wannabe&quot; Hawaiians, William Burgess, Kenneth Conklin
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the grandson of the missionary descendant, Thrustin-Twigg
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Smith and others want to make Hawaii &quot;color-blind&quot;. Your editorial says
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the movie avoided &quot;questions facing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiians today&quot;. If you looked good the answers of what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happening today are directly related to events that happened in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the past. I surely hope that the editorial views are not tainted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because this newspaper was formerly owned by the Cameron's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; descendants of the missionaries who still own a large chunk of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maui with their cousins, the Baldwin's, Alexander's and others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that call Maui theirs. These islands always belonged to us, it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our ancestral home, it is time that we stand up and fight for it.

&gt;&gt; Hawaiians, like all other native american indian people, ignore the
&gt;&gt; BENEFITS
&gt;&gt; that being a part of the US has bestowed upon them. The roads they
&gt;&gt; drive, the airports they use, the educational system they use were
&gt;&gt; all paid for, to
&gt;&gt; some degree, by the US.

&gt; This dude is some kook. Hawaiians are proud Americans, unlike those

&gt; Take over of the Islands was a result of American plantation owners

&gt; and was able to take control, not univited troops just one day
&gt; decided to take over and annex.
">

That what the WHITE schoolbooks taught you about Hawaiian history?

Until annexation in 1898, Hawaii was an independent sovereign state, recognized
by the United States, Great Britain, France and Germany with exchange of
ambassadors. However, there were several challenges to the reigning governments
of Hawaii during the Kingdom and Republic periods.

The most serious incident occurred on February 10, 1843. Lord George Paulet of
the Royal Navy warship HMS Carysfort entered Honolulu Harbor and captured the
Honolulu fort, effectively gaining control of the town. Paulet demanded that
King Kamehameha III abdicate and that the Hawaiian Islands be ceded to the
British Crown. Under the guns of the frigate, Kamehameha stepped down, but
lodged a formal protest with both the British government and Paulet's superior,
Admiral Richard Thomas. Thomas repudiated Paulet's actions, and on July 31,
1843, restored the Hawaiian government. In his restoration speech, Kamehameha
declared that &quot;Ua mau ke ea o ka ?aina i ka pono&quot; (The life of the land is
perpetuated in righteousness), the motto of the future State of Hawai?i.

In 1887, a group of cabinet officials and advisors to King David Kalakaua and an
armed militia forced the king to promulgate what is known by its critics as the
&quot;Bayonet Constitution&quot;. The impetus behind the imposition of the 1887
constitution was the frustration amongst members of the Reform Party (also known
as the Missionary Party) with the growing debt of the Kingdom, the spending
habits of the King, and general governance of the Kingdom. It was specifically
triggered by an ill-fated attempt by Kalakaua to create a Polynesian Federation
under his rule, and a bribery scandal Kalakaua was involved in regarding opium
licenses.[2][3] The 1887 constitution stripped the monarchy of much of its
authority, imposed significant income and property requirements for voting, and
completely disenfranchised all Asians from voting.[4][5] Only well-to-do
Europeans, Americans and native Hawaiians were given full voting rights. When
Kalakaua died in 1891, his sister Lili?uokalani assumed the throne. With
lukewarm support from native Hawaiians and other Hawaiian citizens[citation
needed], Lili?uokalani drafted a new constitution that would restore the
monarchy's authority and strip American and European residents of the suffrage
they had obtained in 1887 from Kalakaua.
In response to Lili?uokalani's attempt to promulgate a new constitution, a group
of European and American-Hawaiian subjects and Hawaii residents formed a
&quot;Committee of Safety&quot; on January 14, 1893 in opposition to the Queen and her
plans. After a mass meeting of supporters, the Committee committed itself to the
removal of the Queen, and seeking annexation to the United States.[6]

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Conquest of Hawai'i&quot; PAINFULLY TRUE
&gt;&gt;&gt; Original VIEWPOINT
&gt;&gt;&gt; as submitted to The Maui News
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Edited version was published Tuesday, October 21, 2003)

&gt;&gt;&gt;  By CHARLES K. MAXWELL

&gt;&gt;&gt;  The History Channel presentation on Sunday night (10/12/03), &quot;Conquest
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Hawaii&quot;, was very accurate and painfully true as to the history of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaii and the facts of the past. It was very surprising that your
&gt;&gt;&gt; Editorial did not think so. Whoever wrote the editorial in The Maui News
&gt;&gt;&gt; (10/14/03) must have looked at the show with a jaundiced eye to question
&gt;&gt;&gt; the people who were involved with the show and call them &quot;Outsiders if
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is what they were&quot;. For your information Mr. Editor, some of them
&gt;&gt;&gt; were Kanaka Maoli. The narrator, Mr. John Osorio, is a professor of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiian Studies at the University Of Hawaii; Kelly Hu is a native
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiian actress and a graduate of Kamehameha School. Rocky Jensen is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; sculptor and deeply involved in the Hawaiian culture, they are truly
&gt;&gt;&gt; kama-aina (children of the land).

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Almost every question that you raised in the presentation was based on
&gt;&gt;&gt; books that were written about past history. Research was done with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiian method of passing oral history from one generation to the other
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the form of oli or chants. It is our unique method of documentation.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, we have a chant of creation which is called the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kumulipo, created thousands of years ago and it tells us where we came
&gt;&gt;&gt; from and how we evolved as Polynesians. We have chants that predicted
&gt;&gt;&gt; the coming of the Western man 2 to 3 hundred years before they arrived
&gt;&gt;&gt; in 1778. The facts of this exist in foot prints that were carved in
&gt;&gt;&gt; sandstone by a Kahuna (priest) who predicted that the western man would
&gt;&gt;&gt; come here someday and obliterate the Kanaka Maoli. These sandstone
&gt;&gt;&gt; plaques are displayed at Mo'omomi Beach on Molokai and it is called
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kalaina Waewae.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  As a Kanaka Maoli viewing this presentation it brought tears to my eyes
&gt;&gt;&gt; to see again the numerous atrocities our people suffered. As a
&gt;&gt;&gt; historian, lecturer and cultural specialist, I can vouch for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; authenticity of the presentation and the accuracy of the events in our
&gt;&gt;&gt; past history. Overall it was well put together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  The traumatic events that occurred was the arrival of Capt. James Cook
&gt;&gt;&gt; in 1778 which brought all the deceases known to western man and
&gt;&gt;&gt; disseminated our people by the hundreds of thousands. The 2nd was the
&gt;&gt;&gt; arrival of the Missionaries in 1820, to do exactly what the host Kelly
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hu said, &quot;They came here to do good, instead they did well&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Missionaries who left the ministry saw how bountiful this land was. In
&gt;&gt;&gt; the name of Christianity, they became advisors to the Kings and Queens
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Hawaii and changed laws to allow the acquisition of Hawaiian land.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not being satisfied with controlling the land, with the help of U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt; troops, took over the Hawaiian Islands in 1893 as what is known as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Overthrow&quot;. It should have been known as a Terrorist Attack on a
&gt;&gt;&gt; friendly nation. The events were as traumatic to us as the 911 attack on
&gt;&gt;&gt; America and like the attack, has far reaching effects, even a hundred
&gt;&gt;&gt; plus years later. The illegal Overthrow of Hawaii, reeks of terrorism in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the literally sense of the word. Do events of what happened to our Queen
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the Hawaiian Kingdom sound similar? American troops land on Hawaiian
&gt;&gt;&gt; soil uninvited, take over the royal palace, hold the residence of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Honolulu hostage, recognize a coup d'etat, made up of American citizens,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and descendants of the first missionaries, then imprison the Queen and
&gt;&gt;&gt; arrest her followers. And yet, Queen Liliuokalani did not have weapons
&gt;&gt;&gt; of mass destruction. She only had ALOHA for her fellow man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  The Petition circulated by the Hawaiian people did contain 98% percent
&gt;&gt;&gt; of all the Hawaiians living in Hawaii signing the petition against the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Annexation. As far as the Statehood Act, America accepted Hawaii with
&gt;&gt;&gt; tainted title. Missionary descendants, American Business men and others
&gt;&gt;&gt; gave Hawaii to America, they not the true owners of the land. No vote or
&gt;&gt;&gt; plebiscite was taken from the Kanaka Maoli people in the Statehood Act,
&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone that lived in Hawaii voted for Statehood. The question is are
&gt;&gt;&gt; we better off as Kanaka Maoli today because of the Statehood Act?

&gt;&gt;&gt;  This is what we are faced with today and it is a direct result of being
&gt;&gt;&gt; colonized. Presently we make up all the social ills of society. Our
&gt;&gt;&gt; people can not find affordable homes; living is high that they have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; leave Hawaii because not even 3 jobs are enough to support their family.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Homes can only be purchased by the rich who wants to turn our islands
&gt;&gt;&gt; into a Mecca for second homes, gated communities were only the rice can

&gt;&gt;&gt; their entitlements and the Ali'i Trust. A Princess will is being

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Conquest of Hawai'i&quot; PAINFULLY TRUE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Original VIEWPOINT
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as submitted to The Maui News
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Edited version was published Tuesday, October 21, 2003)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  By CHARLES K. MAXWELL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  The History Channel presentation on Sunday night (10/12/03), &quot;Conquest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Hawaii&quot;, was very accurate and painfully true as to the history of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaii and the facts of the past. It was very surprising that your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Editorial did not think so. Whoever wrote the editorial in The Maui
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; News (10/14/03) must have looked at the show with a jaundiced eye to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question the people who were involved with the show and call them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Outsiders if that is what they were&quot;. For your information Mr. Editor,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some of them were Kanaka Maoli. The narrator, Mr. John Osorio, is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; professor of Hawaiian Studies at the University Of Hawaii; Kelly Hu is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a native Hawaiian actress and a graduate of Kamehameha School. Rocky
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jensen is a sculptor and deeply involved in the Hawaiian culture, they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are truly kama-aina (children of the land).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Almost every question that you raised in the presentation was based on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books that were written about past history. Research was done with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiian method of passing oral history from one generation to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other in the form of oli or chants. It is our unique method of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation. Believe it or not, we have a chant of creation which is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; called the Kumulipo, created thousands of years ago and it tells us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where we came from and how we evolved as Polynesians. We have chants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that predicted the coming of the Western man 2 to 3 hundred years
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before they arrived in 1778. The facts of this exist in foot prints
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that were carved in sandstone by a Kahuna (priest) who predicted that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the western man would come here someday and obliterate the Kanaka
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maoli. These sandstone plaques are displayed at Mo'omomi Beach on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Molokai and it is called Kalaina Waewae.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  As a Kanaka Maoli viewing this presentation it brought tears to my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eyes to see again the numerous atrocities our people suffered. As a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; historian, lecturer and cultural specialist, I can vouch for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authenticity of the presentation and the accuracy of the events in our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; past history. Overall it was well put together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  The traumatic events that occurred was the arrival of Capt. James Cook
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in 1778 which brought all the deceases known to western man and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disseminated our people by the hundreds of thousands. The 2nd was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arrival of the Missionaries in 1820, to do exactly what the host Kelly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hu said, &quot;They came here to do good, instead they did well&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Missionaries who left the ministry saw how bountiful this land was. In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the name of Christianity, they became advisors to the Kings and Queens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Hawaii and changed laws to allow the acquisition of Hawaiian land.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not being satisfied with controlling the land, with the help of U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; troops, took over the Hawaiian Islands in 1893 as what is known as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Overthrow&quot;. It should have been known as a Terrorist Attack on a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; friendly nation. The events were as traumatic to us as the 911 attack
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on America and like the attack, has far reaching effects, even a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hundred plus years later. The illegal Overthrow of Hawaii, reeks of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terrorism in the literally sense of the word. Do events of what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happened to our Queen and the Hawaiian Kingdom sound similar? American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; troops land on Hawaiian soil uninvited, take over the royal palace,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hold the residence of Honolulu hostage, recognize a coup d'etat, made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up of American citizens, and descendants of the first missionaries,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then imprison the Queen and arrest her followers. And yet, Queen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Liliuokalani did not have weapons of mass destruction. She only had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ALOHA for her fellow man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  The Petition circulated by the Hawaiian people did contain 98% percent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of all the Hawaiians living in Hawaii signing the petition against the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Annexation. As far as the Statehood Act, America accepted Hawaii with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tainted title. Missionary descendants, American Business men and others

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Act, everyone that lived in Hawaii voted for Statehood. The question is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are we better off as Kanaka Maoli today because of the Statehood Act?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  This is what we are faced with today and it is a direct result of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being colonized. Presently we make up all the social ills of society.

The Amerikkkans didn't have any problem returning the freshly &quot;liberated&quot;
Kuwaitis back to living under the dominion of the tyrannical Kuwaiti monarchs.

Wonder why they didn't install a &quot;Free Democracy&quot; like they claim they did in
Afghanistan and Iraq ? Guess they hate the kuwaiti civilians.

They talk about &quot;the problems of today&quot;. They talk about &quot;High housing
prices&quot;. But where do they tell you that Japanese own 50% of all the
land in Hawaii? ( I believe that this is still an accurate figure= may
be even higher now)

Again it's all Gringo's fault.

Its interesting to note that most of it is considered disputed...several
things are clear:

- Hawaii is not going to secede
- The Kanaka Maolis are going to be noisy but have no other effect
- White guilt is dropping fast.
- The current racist structure of Kam School and other race based programs
is going to be eroded to nothing.

Its overall for the best.

Why would you want to advertise that you are a racist and then expect anyone
to take your commentary seriously in the future?  Name-calling is hardly a
persuasive device that's very convincing, particularly to people who hold
opposing views.  KM

&gt;&gt; Here is Wikipedia's take on the subject matter.

&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Hawaii

&gt; Its interesting to note that most of it is considered disputed...several
&gt; things are clear:

&gt; - Hawaii is not going to secede
&gt; - The Kanaka Maolis are going to be noisy but have no other effect
&gt; - White guilt is dropping fast.
&gt; - The current racist structure of Kam School and other race based programs
&gt; is going to be eroded to nothing.

&gt; Its overall for the best.

Keith -

So you decided once again to emerge from under that rock where you've been
ducking my question.  But once again, you have yet to answer my question:

&quot;Do you agree that a maker of a statement is accountable for that
statement? A simple 'yes' or 'no' from you will suffice.&quot;

A rather simple and straightforward question, really....one which bears on
these recent posts of yours.  So now - are you going to entertain us yet
again with that six year old kid's answer that you gave before?  You know -
&quot;Yes or no.  KM&quot;.  That very sophiscated, oh so mature, and much to the
point response.  Or are you going to do the Keith Martin thing - toss out a
few non sequiturs, a couple of red herrings, and even embellish the whole
thing with a number of ad hominems before disappearing back down under that
rock to do the Alvin Toda?  Or are you going to do that Alvin Toda bit
directly of ducking the question by disappearing yet once more under that
rock?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Conquest of Hawai'i&quot; PAINFULLY TRUE
&gt; &gt;&gt; Original VIEWPOINT
&gt; &gt;&gt; as submitted to The Maui News
&gt; &gt;&gt; (Edited version was published Tuesday, October 21, 2003)

&gt; &gt;&gt;  By CHARLES K. MAXWELL

&gt; &gt;&gt;  The History Channel presentation on Sunday night (10/12/03), &quot;Conquest
&gt; &gt;&gt; of Hawaii&quot;, was very accurate and painfully true as to the history of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hawaii and the facts of the past. It was very surprising that your
&gt; &gt;&gt; Editorial did not think so. Whoever wrote the editorial in The Maui News
&gt; &gt;&gt; (10/14/03) must have looked at the show with a jaundiced eye to question
&gt; &gt;&gt; the people who were involved with the show and call them &quot;Outsiders if
&gt; &gt;&gt; that is what they were&quot;. For your information Mr. Editor, some of them
&gt; &gt;&gt; were Kanaka Maoli. The narrator, Mr. John Osorio, is a professor of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hawaiian Studies at the University Of Hawaii; Kelly Hu is a native
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hawaiian actress and a graduate of Kamehameha School. Rocky Jensen is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; sculptor and deeply involved in the Hawaiian culture, they are truly
&gt; &gt;&gt; kama-aina (children of the land).

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Almost every question that you raised in the presentation was based on
&gt; &gt;&gt; books that were written about past history. Research was done with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hawaiian method of passing oral history from one generation to the other
&gt; &gt;&gt; in the form of oli or chants. It is our unique method of documentation.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Believe it or not, we have a chant of creation which is called the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Kumulipo, created thousands of years ago and it tells us where we came
&gt; &gt;&gt; from and how we evolved as Polynesians. We have chants that predicted the
&gt; &gt;&gt; coming of the Western man 2 to 3 hundred years before they arrived in
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1778. The facts of this exist in foot prints that were carved in
&gt; &gt;&gt; sandstone by a Kahuna (priest) who predicted that the western man would
&gt; &gt;&gt; come here someday and obliterate the Kanaka Maoli. These sandstone
&gt; &gt;&gt; plaques are displayed at Mo'omomi Beach on Molokai and it is called
&gt; &gt;&gt; Kalaina Waewae.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  As a Kanaka Maoli viewing this presentation it brought tears to my eyes
&gt; &gt;&gt; to see again the numerous atrocities our people suffered. As a historian,
&gt; &gt;&gt; lecturer and cultural specialist, I can vouch for the authenticity of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; presentation and the accuracy of the events in our past history. Overall
&gt; &gt;&gt; it was well put together.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  The traumatic events that occurred was the arrival of Capt. James Cook
&gt; &gt;&gt; in 1778 which brought all the deceases known to western man and
&gt; &gt;&gt; disseminated our people by the hundreds of thousands. The 2nd was the
&gt; &gt;&gt; arrival of the Missionaries in 1820, to do exactly what the host Kelly Hu
&gt; &gt;&gt; said, &quot;They came here to do good, instead they did well&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Missionaries who left the ministry saw how bountiful this land was. In
&gt; &gt;&gt; the name of Christianity, they became advisors to the Kings and Queens of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hawaii and changed laws to allow the acquisition of Hawaiian land. Not
&gt; &gt;&gt; being satisfied with controlling the land, with the help of U.S. troops,
&gt; &gt;&gt; took over the Hawaiian Islands in 1893 as what is known as the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Overthrow&quot;. It should have been known as a Terrorist Attack on a
&gt; &gt;&gt; friendly nation. The events were as traumatic to us as the 911 attack on
&gt; &gt;&gt; America and like the attack, has far reaching effects, even a hundred
&gt; &gt;&gt; plus years later. The illegal Overthrow of Hawaii, reeks of terrorism in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the literally sense of the word. Do events of what happened to our Queen
&gt; &gt;&gt; and the Hawaiian Kingdom sound similar? American troops land on Hawaiian
&gt; &gt;&gt; soil uninvited, take over the royal palace, hold the residence of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Honolulu hostage, recognize a coup d'etat, made up of American citizens,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and descendants of the first missionaries, then imprison the Queen and
&gt; &gt;&gt; arrest her followers. And yet, Queen Liliuokalani did not have weapons of
&gt; &gt;&gt; mass destruction. She only had ALOHA for her fellow man.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  The Petition circulated by the Hawaiian people did contain 98% percent
&gt; &gt;&gt; of all the Hawaiians living in Hawaii signing the petition against the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Annexation. As far as the Statehood Act, America accepted Hawaii with
&gt; &gt;&gt; tainted title. Missionary descendants, American Business men and others
&gt; &gt;&gt; gave Hawaii to America, they not the true owners of the land. No vote or
&gt; &gt;&gt; plebiscite was taken from the Kanaka Maoli people in the Statehood Act,
&gt; &gt;&gt; everyone that lived in Hawaii voted for Statehood. The question is are we
&gt; &gt;&gt; better off as Kanaka Maoli today because of the Statehood Act?

&gt; &gt;&gt;  This is what we are faced with today and it is a direct result of being
&gt; &gt;&gt; colonized. Presently we make up all the social ills of society. Our
&gt; &gt;&gt; people can not find affordable homes; living is high that they have to
&gt; &gt;&gt; leave Hawaii because not even 3 jobs are enough to support their family.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Homes can only be purchased by the rich who wants to turn our islands
&gt; &gt;&gt; into a Mecca for second homes, gated communities were only the rice can
&gt; &gt;&gt; live and play. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs was already attacked using
&gt; &gt;&gt; the laws of this great nation and again to attack the Hawaiian People,
&gt; &gt;&gt; their entitlements and the Ali'i Trust. A Princess will is being
&gt; &gt;&gt; threatened, the Hawaiian Homes Lands Act is being challenged. If the law
&gt; &gt;&gt; suit is successful, it would presently displace 7000 Hawaiians that
&gt; &gt;&gt; presently live on Hawaiian Homes Land. Law suites that have been brought
&gt; &gt;&gt; by &quot;wannabe&quot; Hawaiians, William Burgess, Kenneth Conklin and the grandson
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the missionary descendant, Thrustin-Twigg Smith and others want to
&gt; &gt;&gt; make Hawaii &quot;color-blind&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Your editorial says that the movie avoided &quot;questions facing Hawaiians
&gt; &gt;&gt; today&quot;. If you looked good the answers of what is happening today are
&gt; &gt;&gt; directly related to events that happened in the past. I surely hope that
&gt; &gt;&gt; the editorial views are not tainted because this newspaper was formerly
&gt; &gt;&gt; owned by the Cameron's descendants of the missionaries who still own a
&gt; &gt;&gt; large chunk of Maui with their cousins, the Baldwin's, Alexander's and
&gt; &gt;&gt; others that call Maui theirs. These islands always belonged to us, it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; our ancestral home, it is time that we stand up and fight for it. &quot;Ku I

&gt; &gt; A thoughtful and provoctive post.  I changed the subject line to more
&gt; &gt; accurately reflect the subject matter.

&gt; I graduated from Nanakuli High and Intermediate School in Waianae, Oahu, and
&gt; Hawaiian History was a requirement.
&gt; Some of the events he mentioned are just plain false.

&gt; Take over of the Islands was a result of American plantation owners (Dole
&gt; and others). They instigated a revolt against powers of Hawaii and was able
&gt; to take control, not univited troops just one day decided to take over and
&gt; annex.

Geekboy,

You are on the right track, but don't have the full story.

You need more facts.

Of course should Hilary concede to the sovereignty demands, the Hawaiians
would be back under a monarchy (the Kawanakoas) and history could repeat
itself.

Hey Keith -

So here you are again, out from under that rock where you've been ducking my
question -

&quot;Do you agree that a maker of a statement is accountable for that
statement? A simple 'yes' or 'no' from you will suffice.&quot;

Now do you do your Keith Martin thing of throwing out non sequiturs, red
herrings, and a couple of ad hominems?  Or do you dig up that six year old
kid's &quot;Yes or no.  KM&quot; that you've used in the past?  Dollars to donuts
rather than addressing the question, you do that Alvin Toda bit you seem to
rely on most....crawl back under that rock once again until the next time.
