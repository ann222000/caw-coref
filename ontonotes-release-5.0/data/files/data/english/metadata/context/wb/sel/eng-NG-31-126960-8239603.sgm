Hey Judy -

Have you continued to watch Big Brother 8?  As usual, I have been
completely sucked into it again.

I'm sucked in again, too! I LOVED last night. Although I agree that Kale &amp;
Amber would be a good choice, I'll bet (or at least hope) it's Kale &amp; Jen--I
am SO ready not to have to listen to her any more.

Bob - Who was in the fab four?  I didn't think Joe was really in an
alliance, just in his mind.  He was entertaining, though.  I almost
hated to see him go.  It's a pretty decent cast of characters this
season.  Except for Amber and her crying....oy.

Oh, Bob, you know Evel is going to put Jen up for elimination!  And
he'll probably put Kail up as well.  So much for her alliance!  I knew
as soon as Nick told Danielle about it, the die was cast.  Last night's
show was one of the best I can remember.  I couldn't believe he won HOH.
Sweet revenge!  Not that I'm a huge fan of Evel's, but as a parent, I
was hoping he'd have more time to mend fences with Danielle.  Can't wait
until Sunday night!

Hi Mike!

Yes!!!!!!  I AM watching BB, and it's all because of YOU!  :o)  I
didn't get to watch last night's episode until this afternoon, as we had
company last night, so had to record SYTYCD and BB8, and  like you, I am
hooked big time on this show!  Strange how it is, cause when I watched
the 1st episode this season, I was lukewarm about it, and was trying to
figure out why everyone liked this show so much, but....by the 3rd
episode, it had &quot;reeled&quot; me in!

It is going to be VERY interesting what happens next week with Evil
D. in there as HOH, and especially after he found out Kail was going
around stabbing him in the back, and it backfired on her, cause  the 3
guys that made up the alliance she put together, all voted FOR him, and
she was the only one that vote to have him leave this week!

I was glad it was Joe going...never have cared that much for him,
but do like all the rest of the guys, and of the gals, I don't care much
for Jessica, or Jen, but do like the other gals...even though Amber is a
&quot;bawl baby&quot;!  :-(  Really she's a sweetie and her heart is in the right
place.

Well, anyway....this show is very clever and intriguing!

Have a super weekend!

Judy

Why Amber, Bob?  Other than being over emotional, and quick to tear up,
I don't think of her as being a threat? She really seems like a nice
gal, and also Jamieka, and Daniele. I'm not sure I'm spelling their
names right, but think you'll know who I mean?!

Kale and her three boys....all of whom played Brutus to her in the
eviction vote.  On the live feeds, she is going nuts trying to figure

I meant to say Jen, not Amber.  As for Jamieka, she's from the DC area.
She lost a lot of local support when she said she &quot;doesn't know a lot of
white people&quot;.  Waldorf, MD is a very diverse community.

I meant Jen, not Amber and I agree...it was a terrific show last night.
Since I'm home recuperating for some time, I've got both the 24/7
realplayer feed as well as the midnight to 3 AM EDT Showtime Too feed
(insomnia being a big part of my life now).  I use the realplayer feed
like radio in the background a lot of the time..

I suspect the real story of Evel and Danielle goes much deeper than we
are told.  I hope they can start to square things away before one of
them goes out.

I can't stand Jen but I want Kale out first.  I'm not a big fan of
phonies like her (&quot;I don't want them to know I own half the town&quot; etc.)

Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

I don't have a favorite yet though.

I agree.  She and Dick have been two of the most outrageously
enjoyable hamsters to watch. Ever! I hope this week is Kail's ticket
to ride.  I trust that bitch as far as I could throw her and she's
much more dangerous to have around the house. Get her out - NOW! Jen
is fairly harmless and easily disposable later on.

IMHO, the hamsters typically succumb to a groupthink mentality this
early in the game and vote off people they don't &quot;like,&quot; as opposed to
thinking strategically. The survival gene kicks in when 4-6 are left.

Unfortunately, unless Jen gets veto, I see her gone.
