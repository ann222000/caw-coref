How does one get on a 'do not call list' (in the US so as not to be pestered
by telemarketers? Does one have to inform each caller of the wish to be put
on the DNC list, or is there some central number one can call?

TIA

"/> Currently, you must inform each caller. Be very precise about your
language: &quot;Put me on your do-not-call list.&quot; Do not say &quot;take me off
your list&quot; as this does not invoke the law.

Starting in July,(*) a US-government-run do-not-call list will begin
taking registrations. Rest assured there will be plenty of
publicity.

In the meantime, check with your state. Several states (including
New York) already have state lists. In those states there is no need
to inform callers directly.

(*) Unless the Republicans gut this as they have so many other
consumer privacy initiatives.

"/> I did. According to the site, there is an 800 number to call, starting in
July, to put your number on the list. They expect this 800 number to crash
the telephone network by overwhelming it with volume of incoming phone
calls. Thus, it won't be open to everybody all at once. It will be phased
in by regions. I think this is hilarious. I mean, the people who wrote the
law know that the volume of calls to register will overwhelm the phone
system. Wouldn't it have been simpler to adopt an opt-in system instead?
That is, call an 800 number if you actually WANT telemarketers to call you?
Maybe it could be 800-findashrink, 'cause if you'd want to call it, you
obviously need your head examined. :)

Seriously though, I predict that by August, there will be 10 or 12 phone
numbers in this country that are NOT on the national &quot;do not call&quot; list.
These will be the few folks who haven't heard about it YET. By September, I
predict the national &quot;do not call&quot; list will have more telephone number than
are currently in service (due to disconnected lines not removed from the
list).

Anybody else think it would be a lot smarter just to outlaw telemarketing?
Is there any good reason that it should be legal AT ALL? -Dave

"/> Of course it would be simpler. But it would not be business
friendly. Translation: telemarketers spend big lobbying bucks, and
they were able to spend enough to prevent having an opt-in list.

With the Republicans in charge, I'm amazed that even the opt-out
list is going through. It will be, err, _interesting_ to see how
well it is enforced.

"/> There is currently a federal law on the books which outlaws *automated*
telemarketing calls to private residences. However, this law has not been
effective, due to the difficulty of *catching* the violaters.

However, with a national do-not-call registry, it should prove much easier
to catch the creeps. Have you ever been reached by automated dialing from
a telemarketer? If so, have you been able to *catch the perpetrator*? If
not, then why not?

"/> Because I've never been willing to listen that long.

Worst example: When I was working late at the office and the same
automated message rang every phone (maybe 20 on the rotaery) in sequence.
Bastards. I ultimately listened to the whole message, and left a
thoroughly ugly and disgusting message on THEIR machine. Not that they'd
care, but it made me feel better.

&gt;There is, but for some the product is a 900 call. For example, one is
&gt;asking &quot;Should 'under God' be removed from the pledge of allegiance?&quot;
&gt;1-900-255-1550 for yes, 1-900-622-1550 for no. $2.95/minute. The
&gt;other is &quot;Get paid to Shop&quot; or &quot;Get paid to drive&quot;. Call
&gt;1-900-388-9995 at $2.95/minute.

"/> Gack! I don't own a fax machine myself. I was under the impression
(obviously wrong) that junk faxes were from companies wanting to
sell things like office products.

I think if you really wanted to pursue it, you could ferret out the
owner of the 900 numbers. _Or_ you could *57 the junk faxer. But I
can understand that you might not consider it worth your while.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The travel and loan faxes usually do have a 800 number to call. But
&gt;since the company with the advertised product is not the same as the
&gt;fax sender, if you ask them to remove your number from the database,
&gt;they tell you they can't do that and sometimes, or they just make you
&gt;call an automated number to take your number off their database.

"/> But this is not like telemarketing phone calls: an unsolicited fax,
even one, is a violation. You have no need to request to be &quot;removed
from their database&quot; or even put on their do-not-call list. The
companies are responsible for the acts of their marketers, so you
could sue them and win. In theory. As you said, however:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Laws don't really help if there is not an easy way to enforce them.

"/> Sad but true. Here's my own illustration. I had a home-improvement
company calling me persistently back when I lived in Ohio. Not only
were the calls unwelcome, but most were prerecording, another
violation. The company was located in the next county over. I trued
to file suit in small-claims court, but the court clerk refused to
accept the filing.

Of course she was wrong, but I decided it would cost too much of my
time _and_ money to get a mandamus writ from a higher court ordering
her to accept the suit -- and then the judge who heard the case
could quite possibly find against me just because he was pissed off
at having a higher court issue instructions.
