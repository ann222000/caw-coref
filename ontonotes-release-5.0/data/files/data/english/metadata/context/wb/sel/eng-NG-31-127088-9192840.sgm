Due to boredom, I decided to post my cellphone number to a TV adds
looking for friends trough texting.
My husband read some of the messages sent by one of my textmate. The
message says ;
Hi! how are you?,
Where can I invest my money, any suggestion?,
Thanks for your advice.
He confronted me and told me that its not proper since I'm already
married. And even accused me of having sex with my textmates. (I am a
Filipina from Philippines)
I was really hurt and tried to explain that I'm not doing any immoral
act, since what I offered to my textmates is friendship only.
Eversince we got married he's been having an illicit affair for so
many times, since I don't like to have a broken family I decided to
stay, eventhough everytime I found out about his affair with other
woman I got hurt and devastated.
I really don't know if I still love him, but what I know is I stayed
because of my kids.
Now, both of us don't  respect and trust each other, I think it's time
for us to have separate lives......
Help..... I need your advice

His adultery fully justifies your leaving him.  But the texting issue
that you've created is not one of your finer moments.  IMHO,
it doesn't matter why or what the content is, looking for buddies
outside the marriage, instead of working on or confronting the
real issues in your marriage only makes matters worse.  I see it
as  passive-aggressive behavior to kick a little sand in his face.

What's called for is confronting him on his misconduct, insisting
on the respect you deserve, and having plan ready to go if you
do not get it.  Too often, the parties ignore the bad stuff and
fight over these side issues, instead.  Is that any way to live?

Is it better for them to be raised in family where the parents do
not like or trust each other?  What are you teaching them about
life?  I suggest that you consult a lawyer to get a handle on your
options and can prepare a plan of action.

Having friends outside of marriage is not ok? I dont understand this. You
have no friends but your partner (now wife IIRC)?

--------------------
I was perhaps not very articulate or specific enuff.  Of course,
my wife and I have other friends and encourage each other to
nurture these friendships.  But gimme a break here...

She responds to a TV ad by posting her cellphone # for texting
with strangers... due to boredom.  I'm sorry, but IMHO that's
not appropriate for someone who's marriage is in trouble, for
for someone who's marriage is not in trouble.  I do not see it as
a sincere effort to find friends, but rather an act of desperation.

I don't.  She can do what she wants.  If she finds companionship
talking stock with textmates so be it.  It is up to her to keep it,
well,... on the up and up.
Looks like she is pretty clear about wanting to stay in her marriage,
just lead a separate life.  At least that is my take on it.  If she is
good with it, fine.
Her husband is obviously a fucking prick; messed around multiple
times.  If anyone has set a crap example of how marriage &quot;should&quot; be
it is him.

I don't know Rog.  Seems like the more I hear about marriage now-a-
days, the more it is all about &quot;separate lives&quot; (separate vacations,
separate finances, separate rooms).  What a sham most marriages are
today.  Why is this one any different?

So you can only have friends outside of marriage when your marriage is not
in trouble? Or it is inappropriate to respond to digital medium? I truly
don't understand your point here. There are a zillion ways to meet people.
Online is one of them.
