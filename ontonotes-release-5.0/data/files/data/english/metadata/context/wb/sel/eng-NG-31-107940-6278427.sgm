Ohio anti-terrorism effort slap in face to aircraft owners

Ohio aircraft owners have been singled out by the state to sign a
declaration with their annual aircraft registration renewal that they
are not involved in terrorist activity. They are the only license
holders under the state's Department of Transportation required to do
this.

AOPA and aircraft owners are extremely displeased at this
discrimination. The association, on behalf of members, has requested
that the state remove this requirement.

"Frankly, it is offensive to Ohio's pilot population to suggest that
they are more suspect than people who own boats, trucks, or
automobiles," wrote Greg Pecoraro, AOPA vice president of regional
affairs, in a letter to the state's department of public safety.  Ohio
singles out pilots...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----

OK, now assume you're a bad guy living in Ohio. What are you going to
do, say "Oh s**t, now I have to move because I can't sign this paper"?

Here's the best part -- these lawmakers were elected and someone
convinced .a majority of them this was a good idea.

There is no cure for stupidity.

We're in a big transition here in Ohio, where many Republicans have been

So if I read this correctly, the D.O.T. actually believes that their
penalties for falsifying information on a registration form are such
that any pilot who actually is involved in terrorism will feel obligated
to advise them of that fact.

And I thought that OUR beaurocrats were dumb!

That form has got to make you, and all people living in Ohio, feel much
more secure.

It's too bad, however, that airplanes can fly to Ohio from other
places, and those owners will not have signed the form. Maybe, in the
interest of keeping Ohio safe, all airplanes coming from the east
should have to land in Pittsburgh so the PIC can sign off on the form.
It would be like clearing customs.

It should also apply to overflights  -- if you're over Ohio without
having signed the form you may be a threat so land and sign off on it.

The bad guys are honorable, aren't they? They wouldn't sign off on
something like this and then use the airplane for bad things, would
they?

Or, maybe I'm just not smart enough to know how this is going to be
helpful.

Yeah, that's it. Better tear up that Mesa stuff.

Fact Sheet
Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism
Washington, DC
November 15, 2002

Terrorist Exclusion List

Section 411 of the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001 (8 U.S.C. § 1182)
authorized the Secretary of State, in consultation with or upon the
request of the Attorney General, to designate terrorist organizations
for immigration purposes. This authority is known as the “Terrorist
Exclusion List (TEL)” authority. A TEL designation bolsters homeland
security efforts by facilitating the USG’s ability to exclude aliens
associated with entities on the TEL from entering the United States.

Designation Criteria

An organization can be placed on the TEL if the Secretary of State
finds that the organization:

commits or incites to commit, under circumstances indicating an
intention to cause death or serious bodily injury, a terrorist
activity;
prepares or plans a terrorist activity;
gathers information on potential targets for terrorist activity; or
provides material support to further terrorist activity.
Under the statute, “terrorist activity” means any activity that is
unlawful under U.S. law or the laws of the place where it was
committed and involves: hijacking or sabotage of an aircraft, vessel,
vehicle or other conveyance; hostage taking; a violent attack on an
internationally protected person; assassination; or the use of any
biological agent, chemical agent, nuclear weapon or device, or
explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than
for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or
indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause
substantial damage to property. The definition also captures any
threat, attempt, or conspiracy to do any of these activities.
Designation Process

The Secretary of State is authorized to designate groups as TEL
organizations in consultation with, or upon the request of the
Attorney General. Once an organization of concern is identified, or a
request is received from the Attorney General to designate a
particular organization, the State Department works closely with the
Department of Justice and the intelligence community to prepare a
detailed “administrative record,” which is a compilation of
information, typically including both classified and open sources
information, demonstrating that the statutory criteria for designation
have been satisfied. Once completed, the administrative record is sent
to the Secretary of State who decides whether to designate the
organization. Notices of designations are published in the Federal
Register.

Effects of Designation

Legal Ramifications

Individual aliens providing support to or associated with
TEL-designated organizations may be found “inadmissable” [sic] to the
U.S., i.e., such aliens may be prevented from entering the U.S. or, if
already in U.S. territory, may in certain circumstances be deported.
Examples of activity that may render an alien inadmissible as a result
of an organization’s TEL designation include:

membership in a TEL-designated organization;
use of the alien’s position of prominence within any country to
persuade others to support an organization on the TEL list;
solicitation of funds or other things of value for an organization on
the TEL list;
solicitation of any individual for membership in an organization on
the TEL list; and
commission of an act that the alien knows, or reasonably should have
known, affords material support, including a safe house,
transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other
material for financial benefit, false documentation or identification,
weapons (including chemical, biological, or radiological weapons),
explosives, or training to an organization on the TEL list.
(It should be noted that individual aliens may also found inadmissible
on the basis of other types of terrorist activity unrelated to
TEL-designated organizations; see 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(3)(B).)
Other Effects

Deters donation or contributions to named organizations.
Heightens public awareness and knowledge of terrorist organizations.
Alerts other governments to U.S. concerns about organizations engaged
in terrorist activities.
Stigmatizes and isolates designated terrorist organizations.
Background On December 5th, 2001 Secretary of State Colin Powell, in
consultation with the Attorney General designated the following
organizations, thereby placing them on the Terrorist Exclusion List:

Terrorist Exclusion List Designees

Al-Ittihad al-Islami (AIAI)
Al-Wafa al-Igatha al-Islamia
Asbat al-Ansar
Darkazanli Company
Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC)

There's something I don't understand about all this.  Why is the State
of Ohio involved in aircraft registrations to begin with?  I thought
aircraft were registered with the FAA, at the national level (?).

Perhaps.

But why isn't the law designed to cause aircraft owners to perjure
themselves by failing to declare there affiliation with listed
terrorist organizations, so that they can be prosecuted?  I doubt that
the Constitution would permit prosecuting people for merely being
members of the listed terrorist organizations alone.

You are talking about a State that just recently deported an Imam who, on
his application for citizenship didn't declare his affiliations with a
group that *wasn't* on a terrorist watch list at the time. As if that
wasn't bad enough, instead of winding up in the Palestinian territories to
where he was deported, he is being detained by Isreal, where he was
delivered. So, yes, Ohio prosecutes people for far less than merely being
members of listed terrorist organizations.

On a lesser note, this State also increased the licensing tax on GA planes
to the same amount as commercial aircraft. They do these things to pilots
because there aren't enough of us to create a political problem for them.

I agree with C J on the motivations behind this law, and the only
practical benefit to its existance.

pilot's tickets are national, airplanes are personal property, like
cars, and are taxed at the state level.

They get away with it, because people would rather pay than defend

Perhaps some will recall the attestations that at least the military had to
sign, up to at least the 1970's.  "I am not now and never have been" a
member of a whole raft of organizations.  My favorite was the "Japanese
Cherry Blossom Society".  I'm sure the repetitive signings did a whole lot
of good.

The purpose of the law is to give state officials another charge to add
to a complaint. While a pilot may have other charges dismissed, the
state would still have the perjury charge to hold and try. This is the
legal system we now have. Instead of providing evidence in a case using
existing laws, the government will add frivolous charges to try a weak case.

The State probably just greased the wheels for INS or some Federal agency.
If you are curious about the case, here's a start:

http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/01/ohio-imam-deported-to-p...

Not being a lawyer, I could only watch as events unfolded. Interestingly,
many of the reports of this are inaccurate (no surprise), for example, it
is frequently reported that he was deported to Jordan and then the
Palestinian Territories. He never made it there, and for a few days, no
one knew where he was.

Perhaps so, but it is still an absurdity. There are plenty of laws
covering any specific activity that winds up being terrorist in nature,
and a finding that someone lied on the form is meaningless unless there is
proof that they were involved in those activities *prior* to signing the
form.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; As if that

His family (American citizens) would like to know.

Yes. The rate went from about $25/yr. to $100/yr., about the same as for a
Citation as I understand it.

What "rights" do we have against unreasonable taxation? The last time we
tried to get out from under such things, we wound up dumping tea and
battling the government for years. We may have the right to do that again,
but do we have the force to pull it off?

That looks like a long shot to me, as it appears to cover only the
selective enforcement of a single law across a population. Even then, the
"Rational Relation test" seems to negate its intention to some degree.
