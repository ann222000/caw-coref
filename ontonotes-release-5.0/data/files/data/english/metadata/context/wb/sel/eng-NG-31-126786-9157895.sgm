1.1 Battle lines drawn at ANC conference in W. Cape

21October 2007, SABC News

Battle lines have been drawn as the ANC in the Western Cape prepares for its last regional conference for the biggest region in the province, the Dullar Omar region. Nearly 200 delegates will be voting for the new leadership of the region.

All top five positions of the regional executive committee are being contested. The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) has openly criticised the party's national chairperson, Mosioua Lekota, for criticising ANC deputy president, Jacob Zuma.

The league's Thandi Mahambehlala was booed by some members for criticising Lekota, who is also present at the meeting, but she was allowed to carry on. She says the ANCYL is not ashamed of its position of wanting Zuma to be party president after the national conference in December. Lekota is expected to address delegates later today and respond to the accusations.

Cosatu wants a united ANC

However the Congress of South African trade union (Cosatu) in the Western Cape has called for a united ANC. Cosatu's provincial chairperson, Munro Mkhalipi, has delivered a message of support at the conference. He called on all delegates to make sure that all the resolutions taken at the conference will influence the ANC's national conference in December.

Outside the venue, opposing ANC groups are demonstrating and dozens of delegates wearing President Mbeki T-shirts are singing songs in support of him, while another group wearing T-Shirts bearing the slogan, &quot;One Hundred Percent Zuma&quot;, are chanting songs in support of Zuma.

The ANC meets in December to decide on a new leader. Today's conference brings together delegates from about 100 branches in the ANC's biggest region in the Western Cape.

1.2 Union wants JSE to force miners to report deaths
Matthew Hill, 22 October 2007, Mining weekly

Trade union Solidarity is seeking to have rules introduced forcing JSE-listed companies to report work-related deaths within six hours of occurrence, a spokesperson said on Monday.

This came after what another union said was &quot;genocide&quot; unfolded around South African mines, with nearly a dozen workers dying over the past month.

&quot;We are going to push for legislation that requires JSE-listed companies to put out a notice to the bourse in six hours,&quot; Solidarity spokesperson Reint Dykema said over the phone.

The general secretary of the biggest represented union in the industry, the National Union Mineworkers (NUM), Frans Baleni said in a telephone interview that the union would support such legislation.

The NUM said earlier this month that it would call a nation-wide strike at the end of October or the beginning of November to protest the high rate of fatalities in the country's mines.

While its members would not join the strike, Solidarity said that it would &quot;morally&quot; support it.

South Africa is home to the deepest gold mines in the world, which are notorious for their poor safety records.

Last year 199 people died in the country's mines.

Earlier this month, President Thabo Mbeki ordered Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica to carry out a safety audit at each mine in South Africa.

2.1 Mashabane funeral 'unfortunate and ugly'

Moshoeshoe Monare, 21 October 2007, iol

The funeral of former controversial ambassador Norman Mashabane turned into a succession battleground, literally and figuratively, following a chaotic clash between two camps of supporters on Saturday.

One supporter was assaulted, and several were thrown out of a Phalaborwa stadium in Limpopo as they tried to outdo each other in howling down leaders they oppose.

The mood at the funeral was described by some guests as an &quot;unfortunate and ugly&quot; precursor to the ANC national conference to be held in the same province in December.

&quot;What's going to happen in December if a crowd of less than a thousand can be so unruly?&quot; asked a provincial leader.

Sello Moloto, the Limpopo premier and provincial ANC chairperson, and Fikile Mbalula, the ANC Youth League president, endured the emotions of opposing camps of supporters who tried to prevent them from speaking.
Moloto is regarded as a Thabo Mbeki sympathiser while Mbalula is a diehard supporter of Jacob Zuma.

According to political sources in the province, Mashabane, a former Limpopo MPL and prominent youth leader, had recently shifted to the Zuma camp.

The funeral was attended by ANC leaders across the succession spectrum, including Tokyo Sexwale, the businessman and presidential hopeful, four premiers and almost the entire Gauteng cabinet.

Moloto was twice booed by supporters chanting &quot;We have outdone Moloto's government&quot; and &quot;There come amagundwane [rats]&quot;.

The humiliated Moloto, laughing nervously, repeatedly told funeral programme director Nomvula Mokonyane, the Gauteng housing MEC, that the howling would eventually stop. But the loud singing continued. Cassel Mathale, the ANC Limpopo secretary, and Julius Malema, his youth league counterpart, tried in vain to calm down the chanting supporters.

&quot;We will not tolerate disruptive tendencies. We will not disrupt proceedings intended to pay respect to Fellow Fighter [Mashabane's struggle name],&quot; said Malema, but the crowd was undeterred.

It took Zuma to calm the rowdy crowd. It was only when he rose to the podium, to applause, that the crowd quietened down.

&quot;This cannot be allowed,&quot; said Zuma. &quot;No matter what views you have against this comrade, this is not the right place ... we cannot turn this funeral into a political something. [Moloto] has been asked to speak as chairman of the ANC and it is wrong for you to prevent the chairman of the ANC to speak.

&quot;It is an extreme form of ill- discipline. In whose name are you doing this?&quot; Zuma said, and Moloto subsequently managed to speak.

Moloto had a clash with the youth league and Gloria Baloyi, the mayor of Phalaborwa, earlier this week, but, like S'bu Ndebele, the KwaZulu-Natal premier, he is leading a province that does not agree with his succession politics.

However, a handful of supporters wearing t-shirts of the South African Students' Congress (Sasco) - and labelled Moloto supporters - started singing when Mbalula took to the podium.

&quot;Terror is our commander,&quot; they sang, in reference to Mosiuoa Lekota, the defence minister, who has criticised Zuma for singing his trademark song Umshini wami.

A scuffle broke out between the supporters. A Sasco supporter was beaten up and others were thrown out of the stadium.

An emotional Mbalula said: &quot;If there are any differences, go to the branches of the ANC.&quot;

Ngoako Ramatlhodi, the former Limpopo premier, Billy Masetlha, the former intelligence director- general, and Sydney Mufamadi, the minister of provincial and local government, tried to intervene, but by that time the pandemonium had been dealt with by the police.

Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, the minister of home affairs and the president of the ANC Women's League, also appealed for tolerance.

Zuma and Zwelinzima Vavi, the general secretary of Cosatu, were among the few prominent leaders who managed to speak without incident.

Vavi tried to do damage control around the controversy sparked by the Cosatu central committee's announcement last month of a list of its preferred ANC leaders, which had Zuma at the top.

&quot;We will work with whatever collective, democratically elected by the ANC branches, irrespective of how we feel as an organisation about how we relate to them historically,&quot; he said.

Meanwhile, several speakers - including Zuma - deplored how the media had treated Mashabane following allegations of sexual harassment when he was ambassador to Indonesia.

&quot;When he worked in Indonesia, he uncovered corruption and he took action against that corruption and he touched those who believed they are untouchables.

&quot;And this is the reason why he has been hounded ... because of his nature he could not stomach a situation of corruption in the South African embassy .

&quot;He went through a legitimate process within the department of foreign affairs on the allegations that were made against him and he was cleared. Those who cleared him were also hounded,&quot; Zuma said.

Mashabane was cleared by Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the foreign minister, who also attended the funeral. Her exoneration of him was later overturned in court.

Zuma had not been scheduled to speak, and the slot under the ANC representative on the programme was empty.

He was seen caucusing with Mufamadi and Mathale about who should speak for the ANC.

2.1 Honour Dube, fight crime, say parties

20 October 2007, iol

The condolences streaming in for murdered reggae star Lucky Dube's family were accompanied by outrage and calls for more efforts to reduce violent crime.
Dube was shot in a botched hijacking in Rosettenville, Johannesburg on Thursday night.

President Thabo Mbeki said he had been saddened by Dube's murder and called on the Springboks to play on Saturday as a &quot;tribute to Lucky Dube&quot;.

The DA said the country had been robbed of one of its most &quot;talented and patriotic musical ambassadors&quot;.

Desiree van der Walt, the party's spokesperson on arts and culture, said: &quot;The circumstances surrounding his murder again illustrate that violent crime in South Africa is out of control, and that government's remedies to address this scourge have failed.

&quot;Lucky Dube did so much for our country, both as an artist and as a patriot.

&quot;The best tribute to him and the amazing life he lived would be for government to intensify its fight against crime.&quot;

Inkatha Freedom Party MP Velaphi Ndlovu said South Africa was once again making headlines &quot;for all the wrong reasons&quot;.

Ndlovu said: &quot;The minister of safety and security and the president are in denial about crime, refusing to admit to the severity of the problem. Government apathy is what leads to 50 murders daily in this country.&quot;

The the government should say how it planned to stop the &quot;bloodbath&quot;, the party said.

&quot;Or is the truth that they just don't care and they don't know what to do?&quot;

The Pan Africanist Congress voiced its &quot;shock and anger&quot; at Dube's &quot;cold-blooded murder&quot;.

Party co-ordinator Modini Maivha said: &quot;It signifies yet again how much criminals disregard human life.&quot;

The African Christian Democratic Party called for the reinstatement of the death penalty.

The party's Western Cape representative, Hansie Louw, said: &quot;Will the death penalty not reduce the senseless killings? There is no respect for life.&quot;

Cosatu said it was &quot;appalled and outraged&quot; at the murder.

Spokesperson Patrick Craven said: &quot;We are all devastated at the sudden and senseless killing of a star who brought so much joy to so many and who was the biggest exporter of South African music.

&quot;He will always remain in our hearts as a unique person with exceptional talent, combined with a strong commitment to the values of freedom and humanity that found expression in all his songs.&quot;

The trade union federation also added its voice to calls for solutions to the country's violent crime.

&quot;This atrocity highlights the grim reality of the daily carnage on our streets, the main victims of which are working people and the poor.&quot;

The ANC Youth League said the &quot;Lion of Juda&quot; rose to prominence during the worst period in South Africa's history.

&quot;His music was an inspiration to the struggling masses and ... brought hope to millions of young people,&quot; said the league's Zizi Kodwa.

&quot;Urgent and extraordinary measures need to be taken to stop violent crime.&quot;

The Creative Workers Union of SA said the country had been deprived of a legend.

&quot;Police should do whatever it takes to bring the perpetrators to book,&quot; said the union's general secretary, Oupa Lebogo.

&quot;I knew him as a father, friend and colleague. He was creative, humble, someone with very high morals living a clean life.&quot;

Recording artist, anti-apartheid activist and poet Mzwakhe Mbuli said: &quot;What kind of country does not respect its icons?

&quot;What kind of advert does this send to the world ahead of 2010?&quot;

Dube's death would cast a shadow over Saturday's Rugby World Cup final, he added. &quot;How can we celebrate while we mourn? This is a thorn in our flesh.&quot; - Sapa

2.2 Five arrested for Lucky Dube's murder

21 October 2007, Mail and Guardian

Five men were arrested on Sunday in connection with the murder of reggae star Lucky Dube, East Rand police said.

Police arrested the five, aged between 31 and 35, in Spruitview on the East Rand on Sunday morning.

Police spokesperson Superintendent Eugene Opperman said police seized two stolen handguns and a VW Polo.

&quot;Police also recovered three other stolen vehicles during the investigation this morning [Sunday],&quot; he said.

The five are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.

Opperman said: &quot;The initial police reports regarding the murder being related to a botched hijacking remain correct.&quot;

A crack team of detectives had been assembled to search for the killers.

Dube was shot dead in Rosettenville at about 8.20pm on Thursday night. The singer was travelling in a grey Chrysler with his two teenage children at the time.

Legacy
Condolences spanned the length and breadth of the political and cultural spectrum, with everyone from President Thabo Mbeki to the South African Football Players' Union praising Dube's legacy and raising concerns about the level of violent crime.

Mbeki made an appeal to South Africans to confront the &quot;scourge&quot; of crime together.

&quot;This is ... very, very sad that this happened to an outstanding South African -- an outstanding musician, world renowned,&quot; he said as he was leaving for France to support the Springboks in the World Cup final.

Mbeki conveyed his condolences to the family and also to Dube's fans in SA and around the world.

Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said: &quot;For more than two decades he confronted pertinent social and political issues through his music, bringing to the fore the pain and suffering of many South Africans.&quot;

Arts and Culture Minister Pallo Jordan called Dube one of the most &quot;important and relevant&quot; voices to come out of the country in the 20th century.

&quot;What makes his death more painful is that it happened at a time when government has renewed its pledge to forge a partnership with people, communities and their institutions to fight crime,&quot; he said in a statement. - Sapa

2.3 Hospital killings shock Manto

20 October 2007, News 24

Durban - Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang has expressed shock at the brazen and cold blooded murder of four senior staffers from a Limpopo hospital on Friday by an apparently disgruntled employee.

Tshabalala-Msimang was addressing traditional healers at the launch of a project aimed at boosting traditional medicines in Richmond, KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday.

&quot;I'm shocked by the incident that happened at the hospital but would like to appeal to all our hospital managers not to be discouraged from taking appropriate action against employees charged with misconduct,&quot; she said.

The dismissed driver from the Seshego Hospital shot and killed the chief executive officer, the human resource manager, administration officer and an administration worker.

Police said the man had come to collect his dismissal letter which was issued after a disciplinary inquiry found him guilty of a hit-and-run driving offence. He was escorted by a security guard into the building.

Superintendent Motlafela Mojapelo said while the two were inside the building the driver overpowered the guard and disarmed him, taking his handgun.

&quot;He shot the chief executive officer dead behind her desk,&quot; said Mojapelo.

The man had been arrested on four counts of murder and was detained at the Seshego police station shortly after he was caught at the gate of the hospital on Friday.

Tshabalala-Msimang sent her condolences to the bereaved families and applauded the police for their speedy response.

2.4 Race debate awaits World Cup heroes

Chris Otton, 22 October 2007, Mail and Guardian

They may be the world champions, but the Springboks have few illusions that their new status will stave off a new push by the government to overhaul the team's racial composition.

Even before their arrival back home, politicians have mixed their words of praise with a warning that they expect the World Cup final victory to act as a springboard to genuine racial transformation in a team that featured just two coloured players in Saturday's starting line-up.

Sports and Recreation Minister Makhenkesi Stofile said the Boks squandered the opportunity after their first title triumph in 1995 to make the game truly representative of the country's racial mix and a repeat failure would be unacceptable.

&quot;This victory should herald a new era -- an era in which we all embrace change and tackle the challenges still being faced by our rugby and sport in general,&quot; said Stofile. &quot;Our victory during the 1995 World Cup offered us a window to see what South Africa can be. We did not build on that. May we not commit the same error after this second chance.&quot;

The debate about so-called racial quotas has been raging ever since 1995. The national rugby team has made considerably less progress towards what the government calls transformation than cricket, while Super 14 teams rarely feature more than four players of colour.

At one stage, the head of Parliament's sports committee even suggested the Boks' passports be impounded unless they became more representative.

Although the government bit its lip during the tournament, it would not have gone unnoticed by President Thabo Mbeki as he shook the hands of the winners and losers that England had as many players of colour as South Africa, a nation with an 85% black population.

Before flying to Paris, Mbeki said comments by skipper John Smit on the team's role in forging national reconciliation were only a start.

&quot;We would be greatly mistaken if we took this immensely positive development as signifying that the rugby administrators, the players and the nation have accomplished the shared goal of building rugby as a non-racial sport at all levels, on a sustainable basis,&quot; he wrote in his weekly newsletter.

'Unspoken motivation'
Coach Jake White, who is set to step down, said the prospect of renewed political pressure had been &quot;a huge unspoken motivation for [his players] -- to show that they deserve to keep their team&quot;.

Nick Mallett, the former Springboks coach who is taking charge of the Italians, said the best way to encourage more black players to take up the game is by having a successful national side rather than forcing the process. &quot;The more people who see a successful team, the more people from all cultures will want to play rugby,&quot; he said.

Helen Zille, leader of the Democratic Alliance, said the government should limit itself to a &quot;facilitative role&quot;.

&quot;Instead of imposing race quotas in rugby, government should be nurturing young black talent by creating opportunities through bursaries, talent-scouting and better training and facilities,&quot; she said.

The few rugby clubs in black townships often lack the kit and equipment that counterparts in wealthy white suburbs take for granted.

But with all eyes on raising standards in soccer ahead of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, rugby is not a priority.

&quot;They [politicians] stand on their soapboxes and whinge because rugby is an easy target,&quot; wrote Clinton van der Berg in the Sunday Times. &quot;But they don't develop fields in townships, underwrite coaching classes or supply the nutrition needed to turn 75kg weaklings into 115kg tighthead props.&quot;

However, writing in Friday's Mail &amp; Guardian, Chris Waldberger said rugby had been too focused on sidestepping transformation.

&quot;The thinking seems to be that as long as the Springboks are successful, politics can be kept on the periphery as an awkward sideshow. But this only goes to show that the intent and heart of transformation has been lost.&quot;

Habana the champion
Meanwhile, Springbok wing Bryan Habana was on Sunday named the International Rugby Board player of the year, the day after helping the Springboks clinch the World Cup title.

Habana (24) scored eight tries to finish as the tournament's top scorer, equalling the record set by New Zealand's Jonah Lomu at the 1999 edition.

Jake White was named coach of the year and the Springboks also won team of the year after going unbeaten in the tournament in which they clinched victory with a 15-6 win over England in the final.

The title caps a golden year for Habana, who also won the Super 14 championship title with the Blue Bulls. He succeeds previous winners Richie McCaw (2006) and Dan Carter (2005) of New Zealand.

France's Yannick Jauzion, Argentinian duo Juan Martin Hernandez and Felipe Contepomi and McCaw had been among the nominees selected by a jury made up of former internationals. -- Sapa-AFP

2.5 Actual IMF vote change will be tough - Manuel

Reuters, 22 October 2007, Business Day

WASHINGTON - Monumental persuasion is needed to convince the US and western Europe to give up their dominance of global institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said.

Manuel said there was overall agreement that voting power in the IMF needed to be adjusted to reflect the rising influence of countries such as China and India. But making the changes was tougher, he said.

Manuel said it was bizarre that the US would want to retain the lion's share of decision-making power in an institution it has never had to use.

&quot;Nobody can quite take the big steps necessary and sometimes it's because finance ministers and central bank governors need political air cover which isn't forthcoming,&quot; Manuel said on the sidelines of an IMF and World Bank meeting in Washington yesterday.

&quot;You're telling these countries that have acquired these rights that in the interests of broader democracy they got to give it up, and that's a problem we run into, which is why it will require monumental persuasion,&quot; he said.

As chair this year of the Group of 20 (G-20) industrialised and developing countries, SA had to &quot;drive this thing with the understanding that changes will be incremental but holding out for the maximum,&quot; Manuel said.

&quot;We have to maintain the pressure,&quot; said Manuel ahead of the meeting of the next G-20 in Cape Town next month, where IMF reforms will be high on the agenda.

However, he said even among developing countries ,which would benefit the most from an overhaul of the IMF's voting structure, there was also no agreement on the steps needed for change.

&quot;Some would hold out until there is a greater sense of victory and others would ask that we take a more incremental approach,&quot; he said.

IMF members have struggled for more than a year to agree on a new formula for distributing voting power more equally.

The IMF, which was central in fighting global financial crises in the 1980s and 1990s, is now gearing itself more towards policing the world's economies since fewer countries are turning to it for emergency loans.

Manuel agreed there was a need to rethink the role of the IMF but said strong economic growth in the developing world did not mean financial crises requiring IMF emergency loans could never happen again. &quot;It would be crazy to burn your umbrella because the sun is shining,&quot; he said.

Manuel said IMF monitoring of members' economies was important, but it needed to be applied even-handedly. He said that criticism that the IMF did not sound the warning bells loud enough over the crisis that developed in the US subprime mortgage market, which sparked turmoil in credit markets.
&quot;The United States shouldn't be able to cock a snook at the IMF,&quot; Manuel said, adding that the United States' refusal to accept advice from the IMF in itself threw into question the fund's relevance.

Last fall, the IMF's 185 member countries endorsed a plan that increased the voting power of China, Mexico, Turkey and South Korea with promises of a second round of reforms to be completed in 2008 based on a new voting formula.Together with Australia and Brazil, SA helped craft a proposal for discussion at the IMF meetings this weekend, which raised the voting power of under-represented emerging economies, while also strengthening positions of poor countries.

2.6 Finance MEC must account for R9m

Sibongakonke Shoba, 22 October 2007, Business Day

General Reporter

GAUTENG African National Congress (ANC) chairman and finance MEC Paul Mashatile must explain to the province's standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) why his department failed to document expenditure of more than R9m in its 2006-07 financial report.

Mashatile's was the only provincial department to receive a qualified audit opinion from the auditor-general, committee chairman Mike Seloane said on Friday. He was briefing reporters on a preliminary analysis of the departments' audit reports.

Seloane said either Mashatile or his department's director-general would have to explain to Scopa how the R9m was spent. He said if they could not account for the money, internal disciplinary procedures would be followed, or the matter could be referred to the police.

As ANC chairman in the province, Mashatile is seen as an obvious choice to succeed Premier Mbhazima Shilowa, but this news is unlikely to affect his chances of winning the post.

However, he is not new to controversy. Last year, using a government credit card, he spent R96000 entertaining colleagues from the economics and treasury departments and Gauteng Shared Services Centre at a post-budget speech dinner at the Auberge Michel restaurant in Sandton.

Mashatile is also a proponent of the controversial plan to link Soweto with central Johannesburg by a monorail.

Addressing the legislature when presenting the budget in June, Mashatile said the province had set aside R44,4m for the Gauteng government precinct for the 2007-08 financial year.

He went on to say: &quot;The monorail is being pursued, not will be pursued. It's going ahead.&quot;
A week later, the national transport department's director-general Mpumi Mpofu said the proposal was &quot;not logical.&quot;

Political analyst Steven Friedman said the auditor-general's report would not prevent Mashatile's becoming premier when Shilowa leaves in 2009.

Unless Mashatile was personally accused of misappropriating funds, the report would not have any effect on the succession.

&quot;It is rather a technical issue and would not have an effect on who the next premier will be.&quot;
Friedman said, however, Mashatile still had to explain how the money was spent.
Another MEC who will have to explain to Scopa on his department's expenditures is Health MEC Brian Hlongwa.

Although his department received an unqualified audit opinion, it overspent by more than R500m in the 2006-07 financial year.

&quot;If we are not satisfied with the reasons given for the spending, money will have to be recovered from individuals,&quot; Seloane said.

Seloane said that there had been a significant improvement in financial management as 13 departments received unqualified audit opinions, up from seven last year.

Seloane said out of 17 government entities 15 submitted audited statements, including the Blue IQ project, which submitted its first report since it was established in 2003.

The departments appear before Scopa from today to November 15.

3.1 Cosatu, ANCYL dismiss talk of succession deal

Sipho Khumalo, 22 October 2007

Key backers of ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma have rejected the idea of a compromise candidate for the ANC presidency, saying he was a tried and tested leader to head the party after the December conference in Limpopo.

The idea of a compromise candidate is being touted within ANC circles as a way of avoiding a divisive battle for the top post between President Thabo Mbeki and Zuma.

Addressing a rally in Nkandla, KZN, yesterday to celebrate the 63rd anniversary of the founding of the ANC Youth League (ANCYL), the youth wing's secretary-general, Sihle Zikalala, and his Cosatu counterpart, Zwelinzima Vavi, told the crowd that a compromise candidate wasn't an option.

This came amid weekend reports that another presidential hopeful, Tokyo Sexwale, was holding informal talks with both Mbeki and Zuma backers to find a compromise candidate

3.2 Youth League members boast '100% Zuma' shirts

Quinton Mtyala, 22 October 2007

African National Congress chairperson Mosiuoa Lekota slammed members of the ANC Youth League who openly wore &quot;100-percent JZ&quot; T-shirts at the fourth conference of the party's Dullah Omar Region held in Kraaifontein on Sunday and said the T-shirts were divisive.

He demanded to know who had paid for them.

&quot;We should not allow T-shirts bearing messages that have not been approved by ANC structures,&quot; he said

He also lashed out at the ANC's alliance partners - the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) for suggesting who should lead the party.

Lekota said the ANC needed to foster tolerance of opposing views.

&quot;You cannot have democracy if you suppress news you don't like.
&quot;On the other hand, this tolerance should not allow permissiveness,&quot; said Lekota.

He was referring to the welcoming note by the ANC Youth League's Thandi Mahambehlala who criticised him. It was greeted with boos from most delegates.

Provincial secretary James Ngculu said the &quot;ultra left&quot;, which had organised service delivery and anti-eviction protests, was driven by its opposition to the government.

He acknowledged that divisions within the party had allowed forces from the &quot;ultra left&quot; and right to stake claims on the party's electoral base.

&quot;Today, it's a different ball game, the enemy can hide behind many veils ... the challenges that confront us are more difficult,&quot; said Ngculu.

He was reflecting on the difficulties the party had to endure since it was ousted from power in Cape Town by a Democratic Alliance-led coalition.

Ngculu said one way in which the ANC could regroup would be through &quot;political education&quot; among its membership, which would &quot;boost the ideological renewal&quot; of the party's agenda. If the party did not remedy problems at its national conference it would continue on a &quot;zigzag trajectory&quot;.

3.3 Raging passions will divide ANC, warns Zuma

Moshoeshoe Monare, 22 October 2007

It took African National Congress deputy president Jacob Zuma to calm a rowdy crowd bent on preventing Limpopo premier Sello Moloto - regarded as a Mbeki sympathiser - from speaking at the funeral of former ambassador Norman Mashabane at the stadium in Phalaborwa at the weekend.

One group of hecklers targeted Moloto, who is the provincial ANC chairperson, and another group tried to prevent ANC Youth League president and Zuma supporter Fikile Mbalula from speaking.

ANC leaders, including presidential hopeful Tokyo Sexwale and four premiers, attended the funeral of the former Limpopo MPL.

Zuma warned the mourners that raging passions in the ANC would affect the country.

&quot;If things go wrong in the ANC, things go wrong in the country. That is why the unity of the ANC and the unity of the alliance is critical in the life of politics in this country. Because if we are disunited... this country will be disunited,&quot; Zuma said.

His comments came against a backdrop of ugly tensions at the funeral between the rival succession camps, raising concerns about what would happen come the ANC national conference in the same province this December.

One person was assaulted and several were thrown out of the stadium.

3.4 Mbeki, Zuma urged to quit

Citizen Reporter, 22 October 2007, Citizen

JOHANNESBURG - President Thabo Mbeki and ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma have both been urged to stand down in the race for the party's presidency.

The Sunday Times reported that senior ANC leaders and interest groups are bringing pressure to bear on the duo to withdraw from the succession race.

More than 4 000 ANC delegates will choose new leaders at the organisation's 52nd national conference in December at the University of Limpopo, Polokwane.

Politicians-turned-businessmen Tokyo Sexwale and Cyril Ramaphosa have both been suggested as alternatives. Sexwale has already indicated his interest in the job, while Ramaphosa is still to say where he stands.

The paper also disclosed that the ANC Women's League had thrown its weight behind Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as candidate for the party's presidency.

It is understood the league has also been working behind the scenes in trying to persuade Mbeki and Zuma to abandon their ambitions.

&quot;Over the past six months there has been a lot of discontent among some ANC veterans,&quot; an unnamed source was quoted as saying.
&quot;Both of them must do the honourable thing and pull out,&quot; the source said.

4.1 SA govt against apartheid lawsuit in US

19 October 2007, Mail and Guardian

The responsibility of addressing South Africa's apartheid past lies within the country itself and not the United States courts, Justice and Constitutional Development Minister Brigitte Mabandla said on Friday.

In a statement issued by her office, she reiterated the government's stance against the case brought by a group of apartheid victims in US courts.

&quot;We submit that another country's courts should not determine how ongoing political processes in South Africa should be resolved,&quot; Mabandla said.

She said the country's apartheid legacy should be resolved through the democratic process inside the country.

&quot;The responsibility to address the country's apartheid past, the development of policies addressing this past and the rehabilitation and improvement of the lives of the people of South Africa lie with the South African government and not foreign courts,&quot; Mabandla said.

This comes after the Manhattan Federal Court in New York last Friday ruled that a district court judge -- who had thrown out a suit by a group of apartheid victims -- had to review the decision.

Victims filed suit for $400-billion against US businesses allegedly complicit with the former apartheid regime.

It accuses about 50 US, European and Canadian corporations such as Barclays, JP Morgan Chase, General Electric, IBM, General Motors and Exxon of &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; the former South African regime.

&quot;The government is of the view that the case is directly related to the sovereignty of the South African state and should be resolved through South Africa's own democratic processes,&quot; Mabandla's statement said. -- Sapa

5.1 Mbeki-bashing media in hands of angry dissidents

20 October 2007, City Press

EACH time I read stories and columns in some of our country's newspapers, I wonder if the media has not been infiltrated by right- wing fundamentalists who are still resentful at being dispossessed of their exclusive power and influence to determine the political and economic future of South Africa.

As we know, the advent of democracy and the subsequent clean-up of systematic and institutional racism uprooted them from power. It appears some of them have found refuge in other conservative platforms of our society, including the media.

The journalism in some newspapers today is incredibly politicised and downright disrespectful of black leadership.

I struggle to find reasons why President Thabo Mbeki is under such blatant, vicious attack from some newspapers. What did he or his government do to warrant such shameless and disgusting daily and weekly beatings?

From Monday to Sunday we are subjected to consistent unprovoked, malicious opinion pieces and hogwash stories which are sustained by faceless sources, all screaming about some imaginary end of our democratic society.

They boldly tell us that this is all because of one man - Mbeki.

The irony of this mischievous journalism is that all the issues they raise  as a basis to vilify President Mbeki, such as HIV, crime, centralisation of power, abuse of state resources, Zimbabwe, Zuma, Pikoli, Manto, Madlala-Routledge etc, are in fact agenda items of the opposition parties and Cosatu.

You would expect that from those parties because naturally it is in the nature of their jobs to score political points. The media must report on those unfolding developments to help the public to know and make up their minds.

But for newspapers to metamorphose into active participants in the political terrain and embrace these issues as their own agenda, and as such become so vicious in pushing them to achieve certain political outcomes, really threatens the credibility and independence of the media. The sad thing is that they are introducing a new paradigm where every journalist who joins in this sinister rage of criminalising the president is praised as being courageous and fearless of speaking truth to power.
And those who opt to stick to the conventional principles of journalism - which are to report fairly and accurately without taking sides - are dismissed as apologists and brainwashed ANC loyalists.

In such a scenario, even the breaking of the law to steal people's confidential records in advancement of their wanton agenda is hailed as brave journalism. And yet on the next page of their newspapers they crucify those who steal and claim poverty to justify their criminal acts. How double-faced.

One is not advocating that the president or government should not be challenged and engaged on issues affecting the country. But for the media to assume the role of political opposition parties is really disingenuous.

But then again, maybe that's what you get when the means of knowledge production are in the hands of the few, angry dissidents and enemies of the state.
