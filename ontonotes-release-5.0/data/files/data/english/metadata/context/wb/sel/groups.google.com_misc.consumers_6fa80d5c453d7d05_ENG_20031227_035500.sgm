My wife was inching out of a parking lot onto a street to try and look past
an obstruction, a big SUV. (Obstruction stated *twice* on police report).
Prior to the parking lot the street has a slight curve, so it's hard to see
cars. She got hit by someone going about 40-45 (her estimation), in a 30 Mph
zone. Damage on other person's car was back door was dented in. (Impact was
broadside.) Damage to our car was, bumper was completely ripped off, and was
hanging by small section, cop twisted last section off. (Over 5 grand in
repairs.)

Here's the deal, on the police report, speed limit on that street is 30 mph.
Adjuster put us 100 percent at fault. How do you rip off a fender going only
30 miles an hour. Clearly she was speeding. If she was speeding, she
violated the speed law. My wife was partly at fault for pulling into
oncoming traffic. But what about the obstructioins, is'nt that something the
State is liabel for, no red zones??

Monday I'm gonna call her, but get the feeling she's not gonna budge.

If she doenst budge what's the next step? We're located in Alameda County,
California. Don't have the money for accident attorney.

(Oh and of course we're being sued by the other party.)

Ok. Curious to hear what other people have to say. I would agree 100 percent
with you.......except for the speeding. The speed limit is 30 mph for
reason. She was breaking the law. If she was obeying the 30 mph speed limit,
obviously she would have time to stop or swerve. I've done it a thousand
times. There's a possiblity she was going close to 1 1/2 times the speed
limit, judging by the damage done to the vehicle.

Your wife was fully at fault *because* she pulled &quot;into oncoming traffic.&quot;
If your wife wishes to sue the state for the dangerous intersection, she
is presumably free to do so but that has no bearing on your wife's standing
in the accident. I've been through this with my son--his first car and he
had it less than
two weeks. He pulled out from a blind intersection and was hit by a speeding
motorist. My son's car was totally spun around by the impact (speed limit
was 25 mph
in town) who clipped the rear of my son's car. It was totaled. He almost
made it through the intersection,
said the officer, and no one was charged. The cop said if he charged anyone,
he would charge both.
He charged neither. The insurance co. didn't care. My son was totally at
fault for insurance purposes.
He is also a very very careful driver now ;-)

"/> Let's see, you want to sue the STATE because they allow on street
parking???

Could your wife see the car coming or not? If she could she should have
stopped. If she couldn't see the other car she has no way of telling how
fast it was going.

A bumper can be completely torn off by a car going 5 MPH. Have doubts?
Then look for copies of the most recent 5 MPH accident test results on
SUVs. The damages were $500 to $3500 when backing into a post. A car
going 5 to 10 MPH would easily peel off the rear bumper.

If the other driver was indeed going 30, you are lucky the car only grazed
the bumper of your car. Had it hit the rear quarter panel or rear wheel
of your car broadside your car would likely have been totaled.

I notice you cite the use of the word obstruction in the police report,
but you don't cite the report of the other driver's speed.

You wife moved into the right of way of another car. Based on your
story, your wife is at fault.

(Note that you use the feminine pronoun so frequently it is impossible to
tell who you are talking about.)

There is no way YOU can look a the damage done to your vehicle and judge

investigator or claims adjustor can.

Bumpers are designed to reduce straight on impact. They are often not
much more than vinyl clad foam with collapsible mounting members. A very
slight sheer force will rip off the bumper.

"/> Unfortunately for you, I have to agree with the other posters. Your
wife was at fault because she &quot;initiated&quot; the contact which resulted
in the accident. I won't say she wasn't trying to be careful and I
believe you that the other vehicle was speeding. The problem is that
due to your wife's judgement, she inched up and made the &quot;initial&quot;
contact so it could be said she was wrong &quot;first&quot;.

Sorry to say this as I know how much it must hurt when you try to be
careful and make one mistake. Just be glad that your wife is still
alive. Good luck.

It really doesn't matter if the other party was travelling 90mph and hit her on
purpose. She CAUSED the hazard, so therefore, it's 100% her fault.

It's no different than rear-ending someone. A guy in front of you could slam on
his brakes for no reason and if you rear end him, it's YOUR fault. It's YOUR

little in comparison. Traffic routinely moves 10 to 15 over in most of
California, and drivers have to be prepared for it.

&gt;&gt; completely ripped off, and was hanging by small section, cop twisted
last
&gt;&gt; section off. (Over 5 grand in repairs.)

&gt;&gt; Here's the deal, on the police report, speed limit on that street is 30
&gt;&gt; mph. Adjuster put us 100 percent at fault. How do you rip off a fender
&gt;&gt; going only 30 miles an hour. Clearly she was speeding. If she was
&gt;&gt; speeding, she violated the speed law. My wife was partly at fault for
&gt;&gt; pulling into oncoming traffic. But what about the obstructioins, is'nt
&gt;&gt; that something the State is liabel for, no red zones??

&gt;&gt; Monday I'm gonna call her, but get the feeling she's not gonna budge.

&gt;&gt; If she doenst budge what's the next step? We're located in Alameda
&gt;&gt; County, California. Don't have the money for accident attorney.

&gt;&gt; (Oh and of course we're being sued by the other party.)

&gt; Sounds to me like your wife is at fault from the description of the
damage.
&gt; Had she been hit as she described, the grill of the oncoming car would be
in
&gt; her back door.
&gt; It sounds more like your wife just backed out without checking at all.
&gt; Since the damage was done beyond the other driver's vision.
&gt; If the other driver was moving that fast, if at all, chances are your wife
&gt; would be seriously injured.

&gt; A 45 mph broadisde collision in the rear of the vehicle, causes the
impacted
&gt; vehicle to spin.
&gt; Even a little bit.

&gt; My layman's review says that what probably happened was, the moving
vehicle
&gt; was approaching the parking area and slowing down possibly looking for a
&gt; space. Your wife, unable to see through the SUV, begins to back out
anyway.
&gt; Without checking the rear view mirror. Since she saw no vehicle by turning

"/> This is a common (and annoying) misconception. The job of someone
backing (or fronting) out from a parking space is not to do it so
that oncoming traffic has time to stop. The job of the person
leaving a parking space is to do it so that oncoming traffic doesn't
need to stop, not even to slow down.

In legal terms, you must yield the right of way when leaving a
parking space. That means you must not interfere IN ANY WAY with
vehicles already in the road.

That's what I always thought.

Then DFW airport had to remove flight information signs from the roads
leading to the airport terminals within the airport. Why? Because
someone stopped on the road to read the signs and got rear-ended.

The people who hit the stopped car from behind sued the driver and the
airport and won. As part of the settlement, DFW airport had to remove
the signs.

Marcel,

If you want to go the cheap route, talk to your insurance company and
listen to them. They are not always right, but it makes life easier.

If you want to go an expensive route, talk to a lawyer. BTW, when you
buy liability insurance, part of the insurance company's obligation is
to provide a defense for you if you are sued. The insurance company
will do this by hiring and paying for an experienced attorney to
represent you in court. Even though the insurance company selects the
lawyer and must approve the payment of all legal fees and other
expenses of the lawsuit, the lawyer represents you.

I have friends who are attorneys and insurance claims adjustors. It'll
be interesting to hear what they say.

BTW, the absolute rudness and venom with which you have been attacked
in some of these posts are amazing. What happend to all the holiday
spirit? What happened to disagreeing without being disagreeable?

The way some people attacked you, it looks like you poured a bucket of
blood in a shark tank.

Maybe. Damages are a civil matter, after all.

The problem the OP has is that he apparently doesn't have evidence to
support is claim that the other guy was speeding.

Yes, Marcel, the bumper can ripped off the face of your car by another
car going only 30 mph. 30 mph is pretty good clip. If that guy had
hit your wife's door going just that fast, it could have easily killed
her. So the damage you describe doesn't prove much.

The question &quot;could be asked&quot; but the answer is not relevent to the
liability of this accident.
If through traffic must take evasive action to avoid collision with
a vehicle entering traffic, the person causing the evasive action is
at fault. No collision need occur. Unfortunately, the OP's wife is at fault
no matter how one looks at it and he would be wise to settle out of court if
necessary.
I am well aware of how hard this is to accept, having been in the same
situation
with my young son. His car was totaled just after purchase by a speeding
driver (and that
was in the police report), when he pulled into traffic from a blind corner.
The other car
clipped his rear quarter panel hitting with enough impact to send my son's
car spinning around and
stopping on the sidewalk in the opposite direction. My son would have
cleared the intersection if the other
guy hadn't been speeding (told to me by the officer). But, my
son was still at fault for insurance purposes. We were sick over it but
there wasn't a darned thing we could do about it
but move on. I once had a young girl pull out in front of me. I wasn't
speeding (the roads were snowy) but her dad
came on the scene and started yelling at me for not &quot;avoiding&quot; her and tried
to claim I was at fault. He pushed the
investigating officer so far that he was told to keep quiet or face
citation. Whether I could have avoided her was not
at issue. She was wrong and was cited for the accident.

&gt;&gt; The driver entering a roadway must always yield the right of way.
&gt;&gt; Always.

&gt;Right of way is not absolute.

"/> Apparently you still don't get it. NO ONE _has_ the right of way
absolutely; the laws are written in terms of _yielding_ the right of
way under various circumstances.

&gt; All drivers have a responsibility to
&gt;avoid accidents whenever possible. In other words, if someone pulls
&gt;out in front of you, you don't have a right to plow into them *just
&gt;because* you have the &quot;right of way&quot;. If you are able to avoid the
&gt;accident, you have obligation to do so.

"/> As I have said, at least once, in this very thread.

Sheesh! I don't know whether the problem is your legal knowledge or
your reading comprehension. Could be both, I suppose.

"/> Point one: The accident happened in California. There are MANY posters
familiar with the CA vehicle code. For those who aren't, they are posted
on the WWW.

Point two: The OP has insurance which will pay for the other party's
damages. They will also pay to defend any suit in the unlikely event it
comes to that. The OP never discussed his insurance coverage on his own
vehicle but most likely he has collision with a $500 or $1000 deductible.
Because it is an at fault accident his insurance rates will go up. It is
not very cost effective to hire an lawyer to recoup the cost of the
deductible and the increased insurance premiums.

Based on the various posts of the OP, I would argue the suggest to retain
a lawyer is bad advice.

If the OP did not have insurance and there were personal injuries to
either party use of a lawyer would be prudent.

"/> Perhaps I've missed a discussion in his long thread, but what are the
ramifications of disagreeing with your own insurance co? If their
evaluation of the facts convinces them that you're 100% at fault and
want to settle while you believe the opposite, aren't you on your own
for the legal fees and perhaps even the settlement if you fail to prove
your case? I can't see the insurance co. picking up the tab to fight
what they believe is a lost cause. Then again, I guess that's why we
have attorneys.
