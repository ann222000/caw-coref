Since Rimadyl's 1997 launch, the FDA has received reports of
about 1,000 dogs that died or were put to sleep and 7,000 more
that had bad reactions after taking the drug, records and official
estimates indicate.

The FDA says such events are significantly underreported.

My 9 year old female Samoyed was put on the poison
Rimadyl for about 2 weeks for arthritic knee. I read
posts to this group discussing the horrors of the drug.

She was in such pain, I decided to give her a few more
dosages. I should have listened to you wise posters.

For three days my dog had weird yellow urine and yesterday
and today wouldn't eat. I took her to the vet and found out
she now has liver damage and will be in the hospital for as
long as it takes to reverse the damage--IF  they are able to.

Cady, our Sammy, was a pretty healthy dog until the Rimadyl.

Now she's on the critical list. The makers of Rimadyl should
be put out of business. They are marketing poison and should
be forced to take it themselves.

His name was George - he was on Rimadyl less than
30 days before his collapse and subsequent death.

Make up your own minds about this drug.  I would
never use it for any of my animals again, ever!

Please let me know how you dog is doing !  I pray he does
not die like my dog (a chocolate lab, named George) did.

I am  praying for the safe recovery of your dog.

There are too many people who have lost pets to Rimadyl,
myself included, for you to defend in ANY way the drug
company who produces it!

I challenge you to have the same feelings about
Rimadyl once you have suffered a loss because of it.

Our dog died an agonizing death, and I wouldn't
wish it on _any_ other dog.

I sincerely hope your dog will survive.  This drug
has been on the market for over a year now - the
Pfizer Co. that makes this drug has been allowing the
deaths of hundreds of dogs to occur because they will
not make public the many serious and deadly side effects.

The drug was never tested properly - it was not tested
long enough - the dosage prescribed in the U.S. is higher
than that prescribed in England where Rimadyl has been
used for a much longer time.

There are many people who have owned older dogs and put
them on Rimadyl as a last resort to help ease the pain
of arthritis.  When the poor dog dies, does the owner
question the use of Rimadyl?

Probably not.  They just think their dog died of old age.

Pfizer does not care - they care about the money they make
from the drug!  Vets don't care - they care about keeping
the drug manufacturers happy and looking out for each other.

The drug reps don't care - they tell the vets what the
vets want to hear so the vets will buy the drugs that
they sell at an incredible markup

Only the dogs suffer - if your dog is on Rimadyl you had
better make your vet do blood workups, etc. - or your dog
may join the other poor animals who have suffered liver
problems, severe hemorrhaging, perforate ulcers and god
knows what other effects from this drug.

Subject: RIMADYL - LACK OF INFORMATION FROM
PFIZER AND ALL DOGS CAN BE AFFECTED SEVERELY.

From: Jason J Hamilton (wild ... @stargate.net) Subject:
Arthritis Drug "Rimadyl" Kills Dogs! Please read on ...
Date: 2000/03/13

Read the article on the front page of today's Wall Street
Journal. It states that Rimadyl is toxic and creates deadly
liver complications in dogs. Vets new this as early as 1998
as have not properly informed dog owners.

My Golden just died of Liver Cancer and he was on a strong
dose of Rimadyl.

Please warn owners and friends of these risks.  Vets are
supposed to warn owners of the side-effects but they have not!

My former vet (Bradford Hills Vet in Pittsburgh PA)
certtainly did not!  They stated that Rimadyl was like a
prescription aspirin and handed me a bottle for my dog's
first treatment. I would not have treated my dog had I
known otherwise.

Also, these Vets receive perks from the drug manufacturer
Pfizer when they buy Rimadyl to sell to animal owners.  Vets
could get points from Pfizer for each Rimadyl purchase they
made; points were redeemable for PalmPilots, Zip Drives, and
other equiptment!

Please reference today's Wall Street Journal for additional
details, and please, pass this information on to other animal
owners.

Thank you. Jason Hamilton

Post Script: Rimadyl is a frequently prescribed anti-
inflammatory used to treat dogs with arthritis.  Pfizer
studies as far back as 1997 show deaths as a result of
ingesting Rimadyl.  Being that the drug is very profitable
to vets and the drug manufacturer, many vets and Pfizer
have not communicated the drug's deadly risk to the public
as originally requested by the FDA. The FDA had asked Pfizer
to state one of the drugs side -effects as, "death".  Pfizer
chose to withdrawal their commercials rather than state
"death" as a side-effect.

LAWSUIT OVER VETERINARY DRUG SETTLED FOR
IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Johns Island South Carolina -
August 18, 2004

Jean Townsend of Johns Island, South Carolina announced
today that a settlement has been reached with Pfizer, Inc.
in what appears to be the first lawsuit of its kind in this
country - a lawsuit over injuries that led to the death of
Ms. Townsend's chocolate lab, George.

Ms. Townsend originally brought a class action lawsuit against
Pfizer in October of 1999, two years after the tragic death of
George. The lawsuit alleged that after initial approval by the
FDA, the drug RimadylR, which was the subject of an unprecedented
multi-million dollar advertising campaign, was marketed without a
complete understanding of the serious side-effects that could
result from the drug.

Ms. Townsend also alleged that neither she nor her vet
were adequately warned of the potential side-effects.

After administering the drug for only 14 days, George developed
severe internal bleeding and ultimately liver failure. George was
euthanized on October 13, 1997. In reaching the settlement, Pfizer
has admitted no wrong- doing.

"It was truly horrible," said Townsend of the experience.

"But the most troubling aspect of the ordeal was when I later

pills because they were supposed to make him feel better. I had
no idea that he was suffering from the side-effects of RimadylR.

It is devastating to live with the realization that I gave my
beloved pet medicine to help him when, in fact, it was killing
him." After reporting George's death to Pfizer, Ms. Townsend
was offered a $249.33 settlement, but the offer came with the
condition that the settlement remain confidential.

Ms. Townsend refused. In the months following George's death,
Ms. Townsend began researching this drug on the internet and
soon discovered dozens of other pet owners who had similar
experiences with RimadylR.

Fueled by the growing number of people whose dogs had become
sick or died after taking the drug, Ms. Townsend, along with
other concerned pet owners, started a campaign to raise awareness
of the potential for serious side- effects with this and other
veterinary medicines.  As part of that campaign, Ms. Townsend
and others met with FDA officials as well as Pfizer veterinarians,
urging them to step-up efforts to more thoroughly inform pet
owners of the potential for serious side-effects with veterinary
medicines. Unsatisfied with the response of the FDA and Pfizer,
Ms. Townsend turned to the legal system and filed a class-action
lawsuit.

In her suit, Ms. Townsend sought reimbursement of the $734.00
in veterinary expenses she had incurred trying to save George,
as well as establishing a class action on behalf of the hundreds
of other dog owners whose pets had become ill or died.

In the meantime, reports of adverse reactions to Rimadyl
continued to rise, and in 1998, RimadylR accounted for
almost 39% of all Adverse Drug Experience Reports received
by the FDA.

The reports were so numerous that in December of 1999, the
FDA took the extraordinary step of issuing a public statement
on the drug.

Within months of Ms. Townsend's suit and the "Update on
RimadylR" issued by the FDA, Pfizer announced significant
changes in packaging, and that it would begin dispensing
a Client Information Sheet to be included with veterinary
prescriptions of RimadylR.

The Client Information Sheet, modeled after similar drug
information sheets included with many human drugs, was
to provide pet owners with easily understandable information
about the potential side-effects and what to do if side-effects
occur.

Ms. Townsend reports that as part of the settlement,Pfizer
made cash offers to over 300 other dog owners across the
country to settle claims for death or injury to the dog,
veterinary expenses, property damage, emotional distress
and punitive damages.

These individual offers averaged over $1000.00 per animal
and did not include a confidentiality provision. Speaking
about the lawsuit and the settlement, Ms. Townsend said,
"I am pleased that through this suit, hundreds of other
pet owners will be reimbursed for veterinary expenses and
the loss of their pets.

Of course, no amount of money would ever replace the loss
of my friend George,and the loss of so many other beloved
companions." But to Ms. Townsend, (who donated her settlement
proceeds to a local veterinarian to perform surgery on a pet
whose owners could not afford the surgery) the issue is far
more than the money paid by Pfizer.

It is the growing public awareness that the medications we
give our pets can have serious side-effects. "We, as pet
owners, have the right to know as much about the good and
bad sides of veterinary medicines as we do the medicines
we give ourselves."

Ibuprofen DOES work for arthritis--my wolf/shepherd
12 yr old female is dysplastic, and if she gets really
bad the stuff helps her a great deal.

Per my vet, it works best on a regular program, where
it has time to get into the system and build up a residual.

I don't know about liver damage (never heard that one)
BUT-- make sure you give it with food.

It can cause stomach bleeding!

It happened with Amber, but we then made sure to give it
with food (she loves yogurt), and we haven't had any problems
since.

When I had my dog spayed about four months ago, she experienced

Fine. That's because dogs learn on the basis of
four repetitions. That's not to say they can't learn
some things faster, but for breaking habits, it
usually happens the fourth time we repeat a lesson.

Then we need to repeat the lesson at three more
locations our time in each to generalize the idea.
Let's say your dog gets excited when you take her
lead and go to the front door. She would probably
do the same at the back door, but to not such a degree.

Likewise for any other door.

It would behoove you to repeat the exercise with
several other doors and it would be easiest to
start with a door that had less excitement involved
with it.

Yes, those habits are hard to break. It's easier for
me to train a person who has no experience at all

forcing control.

&gt; I feel so awful! We have only been working

&gt; a fight.
">

You know that working the dog in the back
yard is not preferable, because that causes
them some anxiety because it's their free area.
But with your dog and with the difficulty he is
to handle, I don't see any reason you shouldn't
do the Family Leadership Exercise and the come
command several times out there, and then you'll
have the control to do it in a more neutral area.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The upside is, when I take the leash off it's
&gt; hook and don't take the pinch collar, her
&gt; excitement to go for a walk is NO LONGER
&gt; combined with the intense fear I used to see
&gt; in her eyes at the sight of the pinch!
">

Our group likes to think that is EXCITEMENT and
eagerness to work. It is sheer terror. The pinch
collar works by overriding the opposition reflex
through fear and that cause tremendous stress
and anxiety that must be released through anxiety
relief mechanisms like barking, digging, whining,
chewing, self mutilation and aggression.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That does it for me. I can't believe I instilled
&gt; fear in my beautiful dog just for the  sake that
&gt; I didn't know how to train. Well, I still don't

That's where I was three dozen years ago. I was
ready to just quit. I wasn't going to sour any more
dogs to make them work.

I was thinking about your difficulties with
your dog. Just getting the Hot And Cold
Exercise and the Family Leadership Exercise
and the come command installed will solve
most of your difficulty with him.

I presume you've got msn messenger. We
can speak over that if you are set up for it,
and I can demonstrate the timing and tone
and tempo for using sound distractions
and praise, or we could speak on the phone.

The most important thing to remember is to
pick up and handle the lead in a relaxed manner,
no white knuckles, keep your elbow relaxed and
your arm down at your side with the length of the
lead breaking just below the knee.

Let me know if you need further help.

Jerry.

Dear Jerry,

It's Kay here. I don't know who these people are that
maligning you and your training manual but tell them
from me that it does work.

Hunter is just doing so well even the people who advocated
putting him down are impressed with him.

I even started using it with the neighbor's dog. I went over
there to help her cut his nails. She started yelling at him
for growling at me. I told her to tell him what a good boy he
is instead. Lo and behold he stopped growling and I could
do his nails. All 4 feet.

My dog Hunter was trained with the old jerk and pull method
and my other dog was trained with treats. Hunter has gotten
his enthusiasm back for his training and I couldn't be more
pleased.

He even tried to kiss a child the other day.

Major break through.

This is the dog that a few months ago tried to eat the kids
through the fence. I can now take him in the car with me
again without him trying to chase cars through the windshield.

So Jerry tell these people that the first rule of dog training
is Do No Harm.

The 2nd rule is whatever works without breaking the first
rule.

Aggressive dogs don't need to be put down. Hunter was
diagnosed aggressive and he is going to stay alive and by my
side where he belongs.

Thank you so much.

Dear Jerry,

Just thought I would write to let you know how well Hunter
is doing. He had been trained using the conventional methods
for obedience. He had gotten used to a choker and a pinch
collar.

Alot of pain and a lot of jerking around.  I had also tried
using positive reinforcement methods that I had been trained
in. He was so busy looking for the treat that he didn't
really want to work.

So I went back to using the pinch collar on him and also a
gentle leader when we were in public.

Slowly by degrees his behavior got worse and he did deserve
his reputation as a vicious dog. The vet had recommended
that he be put down. I was in a panic when I found your web
site.

Thanks!

He is now the happy dog that I first started out  with 5
years ago. I am a professional trainer and it was
distressing to me that I could not help my own dog. I
had  been told that some dogs don't respond to any kind
of  training and that a vicious dog can never be trusted again.

I disagree!

Hunter is a sight hound and now I can take him with me and
he doesn't chase cars as much anymore which is one of his
main problems.

We are working on the dog aggression thing. And I am
confident that will be successful too. I also have your
BIOSOUND machine and that too is working good. I know of
several rescue groups that would benefit from it.

This is rather long I know but it comes from the heart. My
Head Hunter Green and I have together along time and have
been through so much together.

Thank you for helping me save his life.

Jerry,

I started Hunter on his training using your manual
and training method.

What a marked difference in just a few hours.
I had him in my van and just using the sound with
his remote trainer and telling him he's a good dog
when he started looking like he was going to bark
at a car worked great.

He only barked 2 or 3 times. Then I took him to a
spot that we had used years ago to train, Jerry I
have hope that I can have my happy dog back soon.
And  not this tense unhappy creature I live with now.
He was so happy today. I am looking forward to getting
the machine so that he can stay that way.

Thank you,

I have to strongly disagree that Jerry is a jerk. I am a
dog trainer and I have been for almost 30 years. I
believe strongly in positive reinforcement. My youngest
was trained using treats and praise.

My oldest how ever was not trained that way I am ashamed
to say. The result a very dangerous dog. He has problems
with barrier and dominance aggression. A year ago he put
a hole in my leg that took weeks to heal.

When the vet and all of my friends advocated putting him
down I found Jerry's website. I was looking for a natural
way to calm my dog and train him all over again as well.

You say Jerry is a jerk well I have talked to him on the
phone and consulted him about his training methods.
I really grilled him before I even considered using his
methods.

He loves dogs. Using his methods my Head Hunter is
now a very sweet dog. I get kisses instead of growls.
When he growls or even looks like he is going to bark
I tell him what a good dog he is and right away he shuts
up, looks at me like I'm nuts. But doesn't try to eat anyone.

I am happy to say that the vet thinks I have him on major
drugs. I don't! I still use a muzzle on him when I have to
take him to iffy places. But hey I know he in now a sugar.
And the most important thing he is happy again.

It's a free country and you are entitled to your opinion. I
have mine.

HOWEDY Group,

Here some SUCCESS STORIES ive had
using JERRY'S MANUAL

1) My dogz, two bitches - Vicious, barking, aggressive,
pulled on leash, wanted to kill any dogs they saw, fought
between each other. TWO WEEKS using Jerry's manual,
they were calm, friends, my companions.

2) ADDED A BEAGLE PUPPY (male) to my "PACK", the
girls had -NO PROBLEMS- with him from the moment I
dropped him by their noses.

3) My FRIENDS dogs  2 MALES barking and jumping
at the fence all night 3 DAYS TRAINING WITH JERRY'S
MANUAL they were CALMED AND HAVEN'T BARKED ONCE!

Added a NEW MALE DOG (2 yrs old) AND
WELCOMED HIM WITH NO WUCKAS !

4) POODLE that ATE food from the KITCHEN BENCH -
lock him in a box? NO! USE JERRYS MANUAL! 4 DAYS
AND HES NEVER DONE IT SINCE!

5) ABUSED DOGS AT THE SHELTER I WORK AT -
HAD TO BE FED WITH A BUCKET ON  A STICK -
ONE WEEK ON JERRYS MANUAL, THE SUPERVISOR
TOLD ME TO PUT THEM IN THE PUBLIC KENNELS
FOR SALE !

Quite amazing to - I thought they were just dull coloured
dogs, but after I had removed the fear and anxiety their
hairs coloured up amazingly.

6) STAFFY FEMALE who would NOT DROP HER
BALL! She carried it around all day and night - 3
DAYS on jerrys MANUAL and she now DROPS
it when u ASK her to!

THAT'S JUST HOWE IT IS.

Here's HOWE it WAS:

Here's Nevyn's PRYOR case history. Nevyn is
NHOWE working as a professional trainer:

From: Nevyn (ali ... @wasp.net.au)
Subject: Newsgroups: rec. pets. dogs. behavior
Date: 2002-03-01 03:15:50 PST

Hello

I have two mungrel females; the breeds exactly
are Blue Heeler spots) x Kelpi (dominant genes)
x American Pitbull  (behavioural) x Pug (don't laugh!).

They are gentle loving dogs when I'm at home with
them, and they are friendly with unknown people.
They are sisters. One is obviously dominant over
the other, and I don't have a problem with that, however;

Their behaviour is very odd. Some days they
are very good whilst I'm walking them, some
days they are not. They are 3 years old and
have only been walking for about 12 months
because my mom didn't walk them and now
I'm home so I walk them for about an hour
and half every afternoon. I take them to the
park where they chase birds and swim in the lake.

This is my problem :

The less-dominant dog viscously barks at every
other dog we walk past; I have tried using a stick
and giving her a tap when she does it, and treating
her with treats when she doesn't, using a choke
chain, a muzzle and a thing that sprays stuff in her
mouth when she barks.

She won't stop! Does anyone know how I can stop her? ]

Also, the more-dominant dog seems to know
this is WRONG, when the other dog barks,
she doesn't bark, but she nips at the other
dog as if telling her to cut it out, and then the
barking one attacks the more-dominant one
and they fight on the leash... it is quite
disturbing to the people walking past.

And also the more-dominant one is okay around
other dogs... SOMETIMES... sometimes she
completely ignores them, and yet other times she
will attack them, like yesterday. The less dominant
one I must keep on a leash if a person brings there
dog to the park.

How do I stop them attacking other dogs? I have
tried all the methods I have used above for 10
months every afternoon.

Is it just a pack-behaviour thing?

It can really be quite embarrassing when your
dogs attack some old lady's or little girl's dog.

They are good dogs, when at home or when there
are no other dogs around. Today there were hundreds
of sparrows flying around the park and they were chasing
them and jumping up trying to catch them for more than
90 minutes (They went straight to bed when I bought them home!).

Can anyone help me?

Email me at my emails address, ali ... @wasp.net.au
coz this list is tooo crowded.

Nevyn

Hi There Jerry
Its Nevyn. Sorry Ive not been posting, but these lying
scum buckets like Alphuck Sweeny and such really
piss me off; And Ive been working weekend work at
the tracks with the greyhounds (thanks to you!).

Well my dogs are the envy of all on my street. I can
have them out in the yard with me, take them walking
without a leash, they will do any command with no
hesitation. And they don't bark anymore! Thanks to
your machine!

Oh yeah, I loaned your machine to several friends
and family -- Here are some reports:

"I would say my dogs are well trained, but they suffer
severe anxiety when no body is home. This machine
quietened them almost instantly - still they barked,
in the beginning, but just one or two barks. Then
slowly they just stopped... beginning to bark, then
instantly stopping.

It took only 2 weeks, and we did nothing.

Truly amazing;

I have recommomeded it to my family, and perhaps
they will buy one. Its a shame you don't sell them publicly".
-- Kylie, 30, on dogs Lili (11 yr mutt bitch) and Sheeba (4 yr
Rotty X)

"My two dogs barked insanely when someone would
go past. With this little machine they quietened right
down, and even became partly obedient, and we did
nothing!

Great stuff.

We ran it only on the lowest setting, too!"
- Ed, 65, on his two male Dobermans, 5 yrs old.

Well I have some more, and am collecting more,
but I only have one machine so its a slow process.
Once again I say thankyou Jerry! My family was
on the verge of giving them up! :(

But no longer :)
