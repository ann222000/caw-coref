I applied last week and have been ignored - 'dem jobs is only for 'de
brudders! (this is the Poverty Business remember?) - I had applied for
an &quot;Administrative Assistant&quot; at Mercy Lakefront two months ago as
well (which would have been great since it is right around the corner
from RU) and was also ignored! But 'de brudders needs 'dem jobs at
Mercy Lakefront (has you seen the price of watermelon lately bro?) -
they'll continue to ignore it and since I was once again threatened
with physical violence just last night I'd better shut up - but they
now have some real legal problems - to add to these:

Mercy Housing Criminals
Friday, August 03, 2007

To whom it May Concern:

To compound the law breaking of Mercy Lakefront SRO I have also been
denied any access to Internet and Phone Services though I have applied
for FOUR AMERICORPS Positions and need to stay in touch - two are in
the Uptown area and I am denied any communication! And this is a
Program SPONSORED BY YOUR TAX DOLLARS!

It's even better - I received a letter from the Chicago Department of
Aging on July 26, 2007 informing me of a part time job with the Senior
Community Employment Program (for those over 55) - I had to respond by
July 27, 2007 (The same date that the Paralegal Essays were due at RU)
- I WAS ALSO DENIED ANY ACCESS TO PHONE OR INTERNET AT THE MERCY
LAKEFRONT EMPLOYMENT, TRAINING and EDUCATION CENTER and the JOB IS NOW
GONE!!!

THIS IS TRULY UNBELIEVABLE!!!
This is Unbelievable!

This morning, Wednesday, July 25, 2007 I entered the Mercy Lakefront
ETE Center and tried to complete the research I must finish to enter
into a Roosevelt University Scholarship Competition - Details are
below.

Once Again, I WAS NOT ONLY DENIED ENTRY and THE SIMPLE ABILITY TO
COMPLETE THE RESEARCH I MUST FOR THIS SCHOLARSHIP COMPETITION THAT IS
DUE FRIDAY, July 27, 2007 but THREATENED WITH ARREST ONCE MORE! (by
some unknown ignorant African)

I showed the Head Hippe/Commie/Queer/Muslim Sucker and American Hater
Shawn Lee Stephenson the Essay Entry Form from Roosevelt University's
Paralegal Program, my RU Registration Forms and Promisory note and his
only reply was &quot;I don't want to see it!&quot; _ gee, I wonder why?

So NOW I AM FORCED TO WALK ANOTHER SEVEN MILES AND MY LEFT LEG IS IN
AGONY AND MERCY LAKEFRONT IS BEING PAID TO PERPETUATE THIS CRUEL AND
UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT, Racial Discrimination, Elder Abuse, support for
Islamofascist Terrorism and Embezzlement of Government Funds!

What the HELL IS GOING HERE ANYWAY?

This 56 year old Devout Catholic is being DENIED ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO
a.) Enter this Essay Competition, b.) Do any research at all necessary
for same, c.) Complete Required forms needed for financial Aid, d.)
Begin the On Line Courses he has already registered for as well as ANY
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES!

And the Goons at Mercy Lakefront believer that they should be PAID FOR
THIS LAWBREAKING?

Details follow so why not ask:

Sunday, July 22, 2007

Dear Sir,

In order to send this email, I have been forced to talk the seven
miles to De Paul University and my left leg is causing me great pain -
thanks a lot! As you already know I am a 56 year old Devout Roman
Catholic and a graduate student in the Roosevelt University Paralegal
Program.

· I am currently registered for LAWA LO1 98, Legal Ethics and
Professionalism and LAWA LO2 98, Legal Research which are both being
taught on line - consequently Internet Access is an absolute
necessity. Classed Begin Sept 5, 2007 - you were informed of this over
six weeks ago but instead of simply allowing this quiet scholar to do
his work, you chose to once again threaten this Devout Catholic and
have wasted time but using Federal Funds to do Political Organizing
for Hussein Obama takes precedence so it's important to conceal your
crimes - right?

· I am also trying locate loans-financial assistance to cover
$3,105.00 for the Fall, 2007 term which also requires on line access.
Since this was made known nearly over two months ago, no one in the
Mercy Lakefront cabal has offered any help at all and &quot;Management&quot; has
had the unmitigated nerve to initiate another ILLEGAL EVICTION ATTEMPT
- Is this just a coincidence?

Roosevelt University is sponsoring a $3,000 scholarship competition,
based on essays that are due Friday, July 27, 2007 - I must complete
my research, print out the results and mail it in by midnight of that
same date so I'll be back at ETE to complete my work Monday morning.
If your &quot;Director&quot; (the one with the PHD Remember?) plans to stop me
or limit my timeyou will need to resort to the thuggish force that has
epitomized &quot;Mercy&quot; Housing in the past - this whole matter is
disgraceful! Two of the courses that I registered for are taught on
line - I took these actions since ETE is right downstairs and trusted
that the ignorant gangsterism of past years could be ameliorated and
all things forgotten.

The author, a 56 year old American patriot and Devout Roman Catholic
has been the victim of heinous and abusive Civil Rights Violations,
Threats of violence and retribution, Employment Discrimination, Denial
of Educational Opportunities, Elder abuse and subjected to a life or
Terror plus Cruel and Unusual Punishments at the hands of the Inhuman
&quot;Management: of Mercy Lakefront Housing. These crimes have gone on for
the last three years and the corpus delecti of the ETE Center is
absolutely shameful!

If &quot;Management&quot; of Mercy Housing's ETE Center does not lift their
illegal, abusive and racist obstruction of my hard won efforts to work
my way out of poverty serious litigation shall commence- I have no
more time to waste on your heinous crimes against humanity perpetuated
in the name of &quot;Political Correctness' - I simple need to be left
alone and be allowed to do my legal work which includes seeking
employment in addition to research; If this plea, like all the others
is ignored by you and &quot;Management&quot; of the ETE Center legal actions
shall commence immediately [11] and I shall call in all resources of
Federal Government investigators, [12] Roosevelt [13] and De Paul
University [14] that I can muster - if 'Management&quot; of this Center
wishes to continue their abuse, misuse and theft of government funds
and support of Islamofascist Terror they will be held to account for
their continuing crimes and I intend to recover significant awards due
to over three years of this racist discrimination, denial of basic
human rights and deplorable elder abuse. With a Deadline of Friday for
this essay contest I don't have any more time for childish games and
illegal abuse so I'll you Tuesday morning!

Since our marginally educated &quot;Management&quot; is too cowardly to
communicate with this quiet scholar directly, the onus probandi falls
on you to decide if you wish to continue the lawbreaking, abuse and
grand theft of government funds and accept the consequences [15] or
allow this Graduate Legal student and devout Catholic scholar to do
his work- I also am seeking employment to support this effort so you
are violating employment discrimination laws as well - but since when
do the (mostly illiterate and all of questionable erudition) [16]
Hiippie/Commie/Queer/Muslim sucking/American haters employed by Mercy
Lakefront care about the law? [17]

Let me spell it out for you:

· I have been the victim of racial, religiously and politically
motivated discrimination and abuse for over three years and though
both the Department of Human Services and Asian Human Services have
provided services that the ETE Center is obligated to by law, the time
for this law breaking to end has arrived. The same law forbids the use
of government funds to do the Political Organizing for Hussein Obama
that you and your tribe of ignorant Africans [18] are engaged in.
· Though Mercy Lakefront personnel [19] have been aware of my hard won
efforts to enter the Paralegal Profession and my quest for employment
in this field, no one has offered any help or encouragement but only
placed obstacles in my path - that is Illegal when half your salary is
being paid for by US Tax dollars. [20]
· I have a.) an opportunity to secure funding for my education and b.)
a need to research material for same and c) an ongoing need to
complete research for the courses I am registered for - I am quite
serious about completing my education [21] and entering the Paralegal
Profession and shall do whatever is required to complete it [22] - it
that means bringing additional legal actions any who stand in my way
(Legally and professionally of course) and ensuring that the entire
world becomes aware of your cowardly and despicable actions that can
be and shall be done! [23]

Three years [24] is enough of this nonsense and now I simply need to
be allowed to do my work - See you Tuesday!

For the Sake of His sorrowful Passion, have Mercy on us and on the
Whole World - [25]

Praise the Lord and God Bless America,
George M Weinert V

Ps - see the attachments for some shocking facts about Homosexual
Black Muslim Terrorists using the facilities of your Employment,
Training and Education Center while this Devout Roman Catholic,
American Patriot and Graduate Student is denied employment
opportunities and even the simple means to do coursework for classes
he is already registered for - the FBI, Homeland Security and the
Chicago Police are aware of these facts as well - this is no game but
a duel to the death [26] that is going on right under your nose and
rest assured, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DOES NOT INTEND TO LOSE!
[27]

[1] With the remnants of a gun shot wound suffered in 1985 and a badly
damaged nerve causing a noticeable painful limp
[2] I am also an alumnus, Master of Music Composition, Chicago Musical
College or Roosevelt University, 1981
[3] Things that Mercy Lakefront personnel know nothing about
[4] Which is exactly what I was doing when thrown out into the street
[5] The Mercy Lakefront ETE Center is using Federal Funds and the
phone, internet and fax that they pay for to do political organizing
for the Barak Hussein Obama campaign - with Homosexual Black Muslim
Terrorist Agnin Mumin heading up this illegal effort and using
Terrorism to silence any opposition
[6] Details can be found at http://www.roosevelt.edu/paralegal/
[7] Perhaps the dummies that work for Mercy Lakefront can do serious
research in 45 minutes, but as any serious scholar would only laugh at
such buffoonery
[8] Criminal and Civil Rights actions are just the start for years of
tort and personal injury lawsuits shall follow
[9] Beginning with Federal, State and Local Regulatory agencies - many
of which you have never even heard of - remember that I am 56 years
old and not some ignorant punk which brings elder abuse into play
[10] And egged on by Homosexual Black Muslim Terrorist Agnin Mumin who
is on an FBI Terrorism Watch list thanks to the efforts of this
American Patriot - perhaps you should join him?
[11] This means Monday July 23, 2007
[12] Using Federal funds to organize for Barak Hussein Obama violates
federal laws as does allows Black Muslim Terrorist access to all
communications in order to plan future attacks on Chicago
[13] I am also a Roosevelt University Alumni, Master of Music
Composition, 1981
[14] Ms Christine Farrell of Cabrini Legal Services, who helped to
defeat Lakefront SRO on Nov 16, 1985, one of my attorneys is a De Paul
Graduate as is the writer - Bachelor of Music Composition, 1976
[15] The attachment is just the start - there's a lot more where that
came from and torts have already been discussed with a number of
attorneys interested in this case which involves crime, abuse and
support for Islamofascist Terrorism over a period of over three years
[16] Mercy Lakefront considers a GED Certificate Higher Education -
the stupidity here is phenomenal
[17] Other than the law of the jungle and the Islamofascsits
Terrorists that they gladly support?
[18] 95% of Mercy Lakefront's Negro Residents are illiterate and many
are dumber than a doornail!
[19] Most employees of Mercy Lakefront are ignorant clowns that can't
even read and write - but 'de brudders needs 'dem jobs! (has you seen
'de price of watermelon lately?)
[20] Shameful is the right word but employees of Mercy Lakefront have
no shame or honor and are only motivated by greed - it's WHITEYS
MONEY!
[21] Abraham Lincoln walked tem miles a day to go to shool but why do
that when you can get WHITEY to pay the bills?
[22] Normal individuals find these traits admirable but the ignorant
baboons at Lakerfront SRO view education only with jealously and
suspicion since almost all of them are functionally illiterate and
only have jobs due to racist affirmative action policies and vile
racist policies
[23] It was, after Lakefront SRO that taught me how to do it and
[24] During which I've been forced to walk hundreds of miles, often in
the rain and snow and in great pain due to a gun shot wound in my left
leg and a badly mangled ankle in my right - but the cruel and inhuman
employees of Mercy Lakefront SRO could care less - as long as they get
more of WHITEY'S MONEY!
[25] If that one still has you stumped, Google Sister Katrina
[26] And illegal political organizing for Hussein Obama that puts the
ETE Center in serious danger of losing Federal funding - the law
prohibits the use of these monies for the political campaigning that
is now going on
[27] And neither do I

To Whom It May Concern:

The Plaintiff, a 53 year old American patriot and Devout Roman
Catholic has been the victim of heinous and abusive Civil Rights
Violations, Threats of violence and retribution, Employment
Discrimination, Denial of Educational Opportunities, Elder abuse and
subjected to a life or Terror plus Cruel and Unusual Punishments at
the hands of the Inhuman &quot;Management: of Mercy Lakefront Housing.

· The Plaintiff, a 56 year old Devout Roman Catholic is a graduate
student in the Roosevelt University Paralegal Program.

· The Plaintiff is currently registered for LAWA LO1 98, Legal Ethics
and Professionalism and LAWA LO2 98, Legal Research which are both
being taught on line - consequently Internet Access is an absolute
necessity.

· The Plaintiff also has to somehow locate loans-financial assistance
to cover $3,105.00 for the Fall, 2007 and is in need of employment
which also requires on line access.

Though the Defendant, Mercy Lakefront SRO dares to embezzle over a
million and half dollars per year in Federal, State and Local grants
these constitutional violations have been ongoing for nearly four
years and include:

Amendment 1 - Freedom of Religion - the Plaintiff has been persecuted
for over three years due to his pronounced Fundamental Christian
beliefs which include repeated denunciations of Islamofascist
Terrorism and praise of the Power of God and Christian prayer but is
thrown out, barred from meetings areas and forced to suffer intense
physical pain when trying to do his work and even threatened with
physical violence
Freedom of the Press and Expression - Beginning in 2004 during the
Failed political campaign of Senator John Kerry, all Christian-
Conservative flyers and publications were (and are) ruthlessly torn
down and destroyed - the Plaintiff has also been threatened with
physical violence is he continues to publicize Christian and
Conservative ideals while Radical and Violent Islamic Terrorist are
given preferential treatment and the freedom to spread Islamic
Propaganda at will
Amendment 4 - Utilizing what are termed &quot;Unit Inspections&quot;, Management
of Mercy Lakefront SRO has conducted illegal Searches that are used,
inter alia to keep this resident in a state of Terror (i.e. fear of
eviction and being cast out into the street) in order to shut him up
so Mercy Lakefront's law breaking and embezzlement of government funds
can continue
Amendment 5 - Though the Plantiff has been subjected to intense
suffering and emotional distress due to Mercy Lakefront's crimes, he
has never even been afforded the opportunity of a hearing and threats
of physical violence are used to shut him up
Amendment 6 - There is no Right to speedy trial and no confrontation
of witnesses - Mercy Lakefront's ETE Center polices are simple Fascism
Amendment 7 - Trial by jury in civil cases - Mercy Lakefront SRO does
not believe in the law nor tenants rights and, after a shameful year
long attempt to evict this Quite Christian Scholar, A jury found
Against Lakefront SRO and FOR THE DEFENDANT on November 16, 2005 in
the Circuit Court of Cook County
Amendment 8 - Cruel and Unusual punishment is normal for Mercy
Lakefront SRO - the Islamofascist head choppers and their helpers at
the Mercy Lakefront ETE center have forced this 56 year scholar with a
gun shot wound in his left leg and a badly injured ankle in his right
to walk hundreds of miles to De Paul University simply to continue my
job searching and legal research in the last three years - when
informed of the genuine torture this has caused the defendant they
just laugh in a cruel fashion and ignore my continuing pain that often
results in an agonizing limp
Amendment 14 - Due Process of Law is non-existent in Mercy Lakefront
SRO - they're glad take your tax dollars and slip a good deal into
their pockets but have no regard at all for the laws of the land and
use Thuggish coercion, threats and Terror to keep poor and elder
residents in line.

Operators of the Mercy Lakefront Employment, Training and Education
Center are illegally denying the Plaintiff all access to federally
funded facilities that can provide solutions to the stated dilemmas
and asking the United States Government to fund their illegal
discrimination and continuing support of Islamofascist Terrorism.
The Denial of all access to Educational Opportunities began over three
years ago when the plaintiff discovered that Black Muslim Terrorists
were using the Lakefront SRO Employment, Training and Education Center
to spread Jihadist propaganda and (working in cooperation with a Hamas
funded Terrorist Group using the acronym UMMA - the incident was
reported to the FBI. They investigated and the plaintiff was
consequently threatened with arrest, physical violence and then
'banned' by the Terrorist sponsors who were operating this federally
funded Employment, Training and Education Center); this deplorable
discrimination is in violation of
section 706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5)
- the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages
as allowed in subsection (b), in addition to any relief of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, from the respondent.

The plaintiff has also stated that he is seeking part time employment
to assist in the pursuit of a Paralegal Certificate (which is intended
to allow him to enter this field on a full time basis) which makes
Mercy Lakefront's Denial of Equal Access also in violation of Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352)

UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

SEC. 2000e-2. [Section 703]

(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer -

(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or
otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his
compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because
of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;
or

(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for
employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any
individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect
his
status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin.

(b) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employment
agency to fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to
discriminate against, any individual because of his race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin, or to classify or refer for
employment any individual on the basis of his race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin.

(c) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for a labor
organization-

(1) to exclude or to expel from its membership, or otherwise to
discriminate against, any individual because of his race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin;

(2) to limit, segregate, or classify its membership or applicants for
membership, or to classify or fail or refuse to refer for employment
any individual, in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any
individual of employment opportunities, or would limit such employment
opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee
or as an applicant for employment, because of such individual's race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin; or

(3) to cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against
an individual in violation of this section.

(d) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for any employer,
labor organization, or joint labor¬management committee controlling
apprenticeship or other training or retraining, including on¬the¬job
training programs to discriminate against any individual because of
his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in admission to, or
employment in, any program established to provide apprenticeship or
other training.

Title IX applies, with a few specific exceptions, to all aspects of
federally funded education programs or activities. In addition to
traditional educational institutions such as colleges, universities,
and elementary and secondary schools, Title IX also
applies to any education or training program operated by a recipient
of federal financial assistance.

Mercy Lakefront Employment, Training and Education Center also stands
in Violation of Chicago Municipal Code Section:
8-4-085 Hate crimes.
(a) No person shall, by reason of any motive or intent relating to, or
any antipathy, animosity or hostility based upon, the actual or
perceived race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, ancestry,
sexual orientation or
mental or physical disability of another individual or group of
individuals: (1)
Commit assault as defined in Section 12-1 of the Illinois Criminal
Code of 1961
(Illinois Revised Statutes Chapter 38. paragraph 12-1); or (2) (b) Any
person who violates this section shall be subject to a fine of $500.00
or may be imprisoned for not more than six months, or may be subject
to both such fine and
imprisonment. In addition to such penalty, any person found guilty of
violating this section may be ordered to pay restitution to the
aggrieved party, and may be ordered to perform community service
pursuant to Section 1-4-120 of this
code. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any
conduct in violation of this section that is punishable under state or
federal law by a term of imprisonment in excess of six months shall
not be prosecuted under this
section

The Plaintiff is an American Patriot that proudly displays the Flag
but these same flags have been shamefully ripped from my apartment
door and from our Community Bulletin boards and viciously cast into
the trash can - American Hating Management of Mercy Lakefront SRO is
thus also in violation of Chicago Municipal Code Section:
8-4-230 Use of flag--Misdemeanor.
Any person who (a) for exhibition or display, places or causes to be
placed any word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawing, or any
advertisement of any nature, upon any flag, standard, color or ensign
of the United States, or any
foreign flag of any nation or ensign, or state flag of this state or
ensign, or city flag of this city or ensign, (b) exposes or causes to
be exposed to public
view any such flag, standard, color or ensign, upon which has been
printed, painted or otherwise placed, or to which has been attached,
appended, affixed,
or annexed, any word, figure, mark, picture, design or drawing or any
advertisement of any nature, (c) exposes to public view, manufactures,
sells, exposes for sale, gives away, or has in possession for sale or
to give away or for use for any purpose, any article of substance,
being and article of merchandise, or a receptacle of merchandise or
article or thing for carrying or
transporting merchandise upon which has been printed, painted,
attached, or otherwise placed a representation of any such flag,
standard, color, or ensign,
to advertise, call attention to, decorate, mark or distinguish the
article or substance on which so placed, or (d) shall knowingly
mutilate, deface, defile or defy, trample or cast contempt upon by
offensive touching or laying upon the ground or floor, any such flag,
standard, color or ensign shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject
to imprisonment not to exceed six months and a fine not to exceed
$250.00 for each offense. (Prior code 193-16; Added. Coun. J.
3-16-89,p. 25723)

The Plaintiff is a 56 year old Devout Roman Catholic who is faced with
the task of locating $3,105.00 in tuition aid and/or loans to cover
the tuition costs in the Roosevelt University Paralegal Program that
he is already registered for; two of these courses are taught via the
Internet though I was forced (under coercion) to sign an &quot;agreement&quot;
at the Mercy Lakefront ETE Center that limits my access to only 45
minutes PER MONTH. As anyone can easily see, my burdens are great
which makes the current persecution of this quiet scholar absolutely
disgraceful.

The Details of new Harassment follow:

On June Friday, June 22, 2007 The writer, a five year resident of the
above address was presented with a &quot;Notice of Termination of Tenancy&quot;
Back dated to June 21, 2007 - a truly Merciful Manuever! The five Day
notice demands payment of a $33.00 &quot;Debt&quot; that the Lease signed
between this scholar and Mercy Lakefront on March 23, 2007 states
clearly on Page 3 had already been paid - this is an error that has
been discussed verbally with Mr Larry Mayes and has been pointed out
In the attached letters sent to Mr Nikita Martin-Burt, Mercy
Lakefront, Mr Mayes, Mercy Housing HQ and Mr Andrew Dougherty of
Cabrini Legal Services on Marcy 27, 2007, May 31, 2007 and June 23,
2007.

Coming so soon on the heels of November 16, 2005 this is disgraceful
and considering the difficulties this creates for a 56 year old Devout
Catholic who is currently registered in the Graduate Paralegal Program
at Roosevelt University and diligently attempting to clime out of the
dire web of poverty it creates major problems - perhaps Shawn Mintz
has been consulted for direction?

I most sincerely trust that this matter can be resolved without the
need for additional litigation that shall prove costly for all parties
concerned. Why you have chosen this time for this type of persecution
is a mystery but The Good Lord shall be the ultimate judge and I know
I can trust your office to do the truly Merciful Thing.

Like MacArthur I shall return on Monday morning to do the legal
research for the on line courses that begin soon - I trust you will do
the MERCIFUL THING AND HAVE ME REMOVED BY THE CHICAGO POLICE
DEPARTMENT AND ARRESTED FOR DOING MY WORK AND SEEKING EMPLOYMENT?

Perhaps this is merely an attempt to conceal your ILLEGAL BANNING OF
THIS DEVOUT CATHOLIC FOR THREE YEARS FROM THE MERCY LAKEFRONT ETE
CENTER that has PREVENTED HIM FROM GETTING A JOB AND NOW PREVENTS FROM
SEEKING MONIES FOR HIS SCHOOLING AND EVEN DOING THE ON LINE COURSE
WORK THAT HE IS ALREADY REGISTERED FOR?

PERHAPS YOU WISH TO CONCEAL CONTINUING ELDER ABUSE AND CIVIL RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS AND YOUR OWN MARGINAL JOB QUALIFICATIONS?

It's time to find out so let the game begin.

For the sake of His Sorrowful Passion, have Mercy on us and on the
whole world.

Praise the Lord and God Bless America,

Ps - do you think it would be possible to send one of our janitors to
room #309 of this same address to get my kitchen sink un-clogged? This
is the third time (twice here in #309 and once in #310) that this
denial or services has occurred - a truly Merciful way to do things

SHAME ON YOU MERCY HOUSING!!!

The Plaintiff, Mr George M Weinert V is a 56 year old devout Roman
Catholic and resident of the above address. Despite a three year long
persecution at the hands of &quot;Management&quot; that included a disgraceful
attempt on your part to evict this Devout Scholar (That resulted in a
Jury deciding against Lakefront SRO and FOR the defendant on
11-16-2005 and costing you a real bundle ) this illegally obstructed
my hard won efforts - (to enter into advanced education), I
successfully applied for and was accepted by The Graduate School of
Roosevelt University. I am now registered and scheduled to begin
classes in late August - two of the classes I registered for are Legal
Research and Legal Writing - both are online classes that are taught
via the Internet. Since Mercy-Lakefront houses the ETE Center I opted
to register for two courses taught on line and completed the process
on May 21, 2007. NO ONE AT MERCY LAKEFRONT HELPED ME OR EVEN OFFERED -
that is DISGRACEFUL but quite understandable, considering the vile
hypocrisy, abysmal ignorance and racism that is so frequent here -

Sadly I have been the victim of a racist, abusive and inhuman policy
that has forced me to conduct my legal research and efforts to escape
from the dire web of poverty and unemployment for the last three years
at other sites - including De Paul University (Bachelor of Music
Composition, 1976), my alma mater despite the fact that I am forced to
walk as far as seven miles a day. I have the remnants of a gun shot
wound in my left leg and a badly malformed ankle in my right that
makes this process often quite painful but God has given me the
strength to continue the fight in His Holy name.

When I completed my registration for the ParaLegal Classes at
Roosevelt University (also an alma mater, Master of Music Composition,
1981), I spoke with Mr Shawn Lee Stephenson and informed him of my
needs for educational access - I also presented him with a complaint
form from the Chicago Department of Human Rights and asked if the ETC
Center would rather just forget events of past years or proceed to
what can be lengthy and quite expensive litigation - the &quot;Manager&quot; of
this ETE Center (whose Identity has never been revealed to this
Paralegal Student) agreed to forget it all and begin anew (Yeah,
sure!) - Mr Shawn Lee Stephenson was very helpful and things went well
for the first week - I was able to get a lot of my legal work
accomplished.

After three quite normal days, a grossly obese Negro woman of short
stature verbally assaulted me while quietly doing my legal research
screaming, &quot;YOU is been BANNED! You gotsa ged oudda here!&quot; - I
responded, in an understandably loud and rather irritated voice, &quot;That
matter has already been adjudicated, please go away and let me do my
work - OR CALL THE CHICAGO POLICE AND HAVE ME REMOVED - MAKE MY DAY-
that is your only option since I am simply DOING THE SCHOOL WORK FOR
COURSES I AM ALREADY TAKING! PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE!&quot;

The LEGAL RESEARCH I was doing is CRUCIAL TO MY EDUCATION SINCE
PARALEGALS DO EVERYTHING THAT LAWYERS DO (but do not represent clients
in court, solicit business and do not make $300 PH) and RESEARCH PLAYS
A LARGE PART OF THEIR JOB - why YOU WANT TO PREVENT ME FROM DOING
RESEARCH THAT GIVES ME AN EDGE NOT ONLY AT ROOSEVELT BUT IN THE
PARALEGAL FIELD IS A MYSTERY - BUT DENYING ANYONE AND ESPECIALLY A 56
YEAR OLD PENNILESS MAN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IS A FEDERAL CRIME ;
charges have already been filed with the UNITED STATES JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT regarding YOUR LAWBREAKING and INHUMANITY which ALSO PUTS
YOUR CONTINUED (and retroactively past) FEDERAL FUNDING IN SERIOUS
JEOPARDY:

If you'd like to ask the cowardly and pony-tailed &quot;Learning Program
Assistant&quot; why he believes your tax dollars should continue to pay his
salary and help him enforce these abuses, you can Email him at
sstephen ... @mercyhousing.org or reach Mr (so he says) Shawn Lee
Stephenson at 312-447-4601 -

Dear Ms Martin-Burt:

First I wish to thank you and HWA personnel for your assistance in
moving from #310 to #309 - it's wonderful and I am grateful for all
your help and plan on seeking the full range of services available
since my primary focus now is entering Roosevelt University's
Paralegal Program in the fall since I have been already accepted. I am
writing you on a related legal issue that should be resolved
immediately.

As you are aware, a new lease was signed on Mary 23, 2007 that is
valid to March 31, 2008. On Page 3 of that HUD Lease, Renter
acknowledges that Tenant &quot;has deposited $33 with the landlord&quot; as this
was part of my original security deposit which is sill held by Mercy
Lakefront. The Afore-mentioned HUD lease was signed on the date above
by all parties and is currently in effect.

If things went normally this would not be Mercy Housing so I was not
all surprised to find a $33 charge listed under the &quot;Amount Due&quot;
Column on a Rent statement dated April 1, 2007. Ipso facto this is
erroneous - Mercy Lakefront a) Has the amount (security deposit) in
question and b) has acknowledged on HUD lease mentioned above that the
amount is in their posession - subsequently nothing is owed. It's a
silly oversight but nothing at all compared to the inexplicable $3,136
dollars (in parenthesis) that appeared on a statement dated March 1,
2007 and a whopping 90 cents that appeared the month before. Consider
it a great blessing that HWA personnel never must deal with the
intricacies of Proper Legal Citation or be forced to add two and two!

I sincerely trust that this oversight can be rectified shortly since a
$47 error that occurred in 2004 cost this scholar 18 months of grief
and cost Mercy Housing many thousands in wasted legal fees when they
suffered an ignominious defeat on November 16, 2005 as a Jury found
AGAINST LAKEFRONT SRO and FOR THE DEFENDANT - ending an abusive and
wasteful &quot;eviction' suit. 1 But GOD IS GOOD and it was this painful
but highly educational experience and the wonderful aid of my
attorneys at Cabrini Legal that led me to the Paralegal field which is
now my primary goal.

Trust this small oversight can be adjudicated with due dispatch and
please accept my thanks again for all of your help.

Praise the Lord and God Bless America,

George M Weinert V, Meow and Josephine,

Ps - this is business correspondence and will not appear at the
MercyLakefront Blog - I trust such drastic actions will no longer be
required.

Pps - I was verbally abused and threatened with physical violence once
again by former &quot;Bathmate&quot; Marcus Johnson (the resident of #308) a
short time ago in front of this building. The party in question is non
compus mentis and any additional incidents shall bring the return of
the Chicago Police Department - the thuggish convict is very dangerous
and spells future trouble for all of our residents

Dear Friend in Christ,

We've covered the end of the 21 month long persecution a the hands of
a miserable little bastard named &quot;Property Manager&quot; Shawn Mintz of
2004-2005 but the true tale remains to be told. Thanks to my two
brilliant attorneys, Mr. Andrew Dougherty and Ms. Christine Farrell of
Cabrini Legal the forces of Evil running Lakefront SRO were defeated
on November 16, 2005 and the laws of the USA and God prevailed over
the law of the jungle that these miserable and unschooled baboons try
to impose on many.

By September of 2003 the persistent attacks of the Muslim and Queer
lovers had effectively 'blackballed' my new career as a Substitute
Teacher with the Chicago Public Schools. The full story has already
been told and is available at http://valleyofdeath.blogspot.com/Chapter
13:Attack of the Cowards.

Faced with the prospect of no work for the summer of 2004, I had my
Case Manager at Chicago Health Outreach Josh Bougie contact our
current &quot;Property Manager&quot;, Shawn Mintz in order to have my rent re-
adjusted to $0.00 for the summer at least since this is permitted
through the wonderful auspices of Mercy Lakefront Housing. In a
typical display of ghetto refugee wisdom, Mintz then raised my rent to
$80.00 at the time the new lease was signed. Though he already knew
that this Catholic Savant was and would be penniless for at least the
next four months the increase went through anyway and I prayed to
Jesus for the best. Mathematics is difficult for some of these folks
once they run out of fingers and toes.

In June of 2004, I got a cashiers check for $33.00 in order to pay my
rent promptly which was my usual habit. Surprisingly, this resulted in
a $47.00 differential since the rent had already been raised. When I
understood that there was still $47.00 outstanding, I offered to pay
it in cash immediately since I had managed to save a small portion of
my previous earnings, but the lying bastard Mintz told me &quot;Don't worry
about it&quot; so I did not - however, this $47.00 remained on the
statement, though the rent by this time had been adjusted down to
$0.00.

For the next 7 months, I had Josh, my case manager try to have this
error erased many times but all his calls were either ignored and
Lakefront personnel assured him that it would be removed or was an
'accounting error&quot;. They lied and the error was never rectified so
this non-existent 'debt' continued to accumulate.

In late November of 2004 this Roman Catholic was served with a five
day notice demanding payment of this accumulated 'debt'. Despite
dedicated attempts to pay this non-existent debt well within the five
day period, &quot;Property Manager&quot; Mintz never faxed back the required
documents for payment so the period elapsed giving him the chance to
do what this dumb monkey had really wanted all along - to throw this
scholar and author out into the street. The &quot;Five Day Notice&quot; was
presented on a Thursday, but since Saturday and Sunday are not counted
their initial attempt at eviction failed and I did what had to be
done. I suddenly understood that I had been framed and was facing
genuine persecution.

A summons to Eviction Court was issued and delivered in mid November
of 2004. I'll never forget the Cook County Sheriff banging loudly on
my door and realized that I was in a fight for my life with the dark
forces of Evil. (the pun is not unintentional at all)

What really stunned me was that everyone here was convinced that I was
gonna be thrown out into the street. Black Muslim Terrorist Pig Agnin
Mumin was heard telling a fellow resident &quot;He'll be gone in a few
weeks&quot; and our resident laughing orangutan and failed basketball
player, Sr. Case Manager Deon Jackson even had the gall to call me
into a 'conference' in the first week of December, 2004 and ask me
&quot;What are you going to do when you get evicted?&quot; - incredible but
true. I would discover late that this sort of injustice was common and
my friend Steve Samar is being persecuted right now since, like
myself, he's exposed the evil of some of these ignorant monkeys. (more
to come on this and other shocking stories in the weeks to come)

BUT GOD INDEED IS GOOD MY FRIENDS!

The first Court Appearance was in mid December and I vividly recall
kneeling in front of the Christmas manger in Daily Plaza in a light
snow and praying that I would not be cast out into the street once
more that very night.

Thanks to the brilliance and expert legal representation of my two
attorneys, Ms. Christine Farrell and Mr. Andrew Dougherty of Cabrini
Legal Services the ultimate silliness of the case was exposed and we
had proof that this Scholar had indeed made every attempt humanly
possible to pay within the five day period. Lakefront's attorneys are
in the business of evicting folks, however so this evidence was
excluded on a technicality - I was stunned. It looked really desperate
by the fourth court date and Lakefront's attorney's moved for a
Summary Judgement which meant I would have been evicted that very day
but Ms. Christine Farrell presented my excellent record of payments,
as well as Lakefront's sloppy record keeping and the motion was
denied.

At this point, my superb counsel opted for a Jury Trial and changed
our defense strategy - thanks to Mr. Andrew Dougherty - a Loyala
graduate, but a truly great guy and great attorney! (just kidding guys
- I'm from De Paul's old school and even went to the Academy). The
$47.00 'debt' at the nexus of this silly 'case' was not really a debt
at all - since our rent is calculated as 33% of our current income and
during the period in question mine was $0.00. Correspondingly, the
rent that had been set at $80.00 should have been set down to zero -
the error was Lakefront's not mine yet they were trying to evict me on
the basis of false evidence. I'd discover later that this was a common
trick, and my friend and fellow Catholic, Steve Samar is going through
the same thing right now - Mercy Lakefront's accounting office is
claiming he 'owes' them $119.00 based on a lie! (more details to
follow on this)

THIS IS MERCY HOUSING - REMEMBER?

Two more months and November 15,2005 rolled around - THE TRIAL DATE&gt;.
The first day was taken up with jury selection and with our three
preemptory challenges the big show had to take place the next day.
Mintz had polished his shaved empty head and seemed disappointed but
resolute.

On November 16, 2005 I got back on the Red Line using the bus pass
that Christine Farrell had given me - I was flat broke and had no way
to even get downtown, so my attorneys were kind enough to help out on
that as well. I did not even bother to ask Case Manager Deon Jackson
since he had already denied my requests for Transportation Assistance
four times in the last same months so why waste time?

THIS IS MERCY HOUSING REMEMBER?

I met Christine and Andy and we entered the courtroom. Mintz had
buffed his head and looked confident of a great martial arts victory.
The games began.

The Prosecution went first, and Mintz presented his 'professional
credentials' - my jaw dropped and I had to refrain from laughing out
loud. He proudly listed three &quot;Real Estate Management&quot; Training
workshops 1 - no undergraduate school, no graduate school and not even
a high school. I knew these monkeys were pretty dumb, but I did not
know how bad it really was until this point.

When I took the stand I blessed the judge and jury and stated the
facts - which were that 33% of $0.00 is $0.00 and every effort had
been made, within the time allotted to pay even this fraudulent debt.
When the jury learned that it was Mintz himself who told me it was not
necessary their case was lost.

A brief re-statement by the Prosecution of their case was for naught,
but it was a lot of fun to watch Mintz begin to squirm. After the
thousands he had wasted on this case, a loss could mean a loss of his
job and he knew it. After only 55 minutes,, a jury of my peers found
AGAINST LAKEFRONT SRO and FOR GEORGE M WEINERT V - throwing the
eviction out and stating once and for all that there WAS AND IS NO
DEBT.

One of the funniest moments of my life was watching this bald headed
clown leave the courtroom as a defeated and broken excuse for a man -
he actually was so ashamed that he tried to hide his face in his coat
as he left but I went to him and extended my hand in friendship. Jesus
tells to forgive and forget and I was even congratulated by the judge
for a fine victory that I owe to Cabrini Legal Services and faith in
Christ Jesus..

WHY DON'T THE GOONS EMPLOYED BY MERCY HOUSING UNDERSTAND THIS?

Mints abruptly left our unit two days later in total shame but Shawn
Mintz WAS ONLY TRANSFERRED AND STILL IS EMPLOYED BY LAKEFRONT MERCY
HOUSING so he shall REPEAT THIS ATROCITY WITH OTHER TENANTS AND COST
LAKEFRONT SRO EVEN MORE MONEY IN WASTED LEGAL FEES and THE BLACK
MUSLIM TERRORIST PIG known as AGNIN MUMIN is STILL SPEAKING OF BOMBS
AND HOLY JIHAD although he has been moved as well . From a business
and legal standpoint this is sheer stupidity --but 'de brudders really
need 'dem jobs (has you seen 'de price of watermelon lately?)

And from a Christian and Moral standpoint, IS THIS MERCY?

I can't find words to express my heartfelt thanks to Ms. Christine
Farrell and Mr. Andrew Dougherty of Cabrini Legal Services - SO THANK
YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALWAYS!

THANK YOU JESUS - THANK YOU JESUS!

Sadly, we have an environment in some of our units where threats
(including death threats) are common and, though reported, they are
largely ignored since the mostly incompetent boobs that runs this
place have been successful in using coercion and violence to keep our
mostly older and always poor residents in line.
To date, other residents aware of this web site have stated &quot;I am
afraid of getting thrown out&quot; so are reticent to tell their stories -
at least using their real names for now. We may relate other stories
using anonymous sources nonetheless - stay tuned for more.

Is This how the Sisters of Mercy want to see MERCY HOUSING UNITS RUN?

In my nine months at Lincoln Park Community Shelter here in Chicago I
was helped many times by Sister Marie Orff (who is now in St. Louis)
via the St. Vincent De Paul Society's Breakfast &quot;Window&quot; and Blessed
Brother Leo via the St. Vincent De Paul rectory. I had the good
fortune to attend mass often in the morning at St. Vincents's Church
as well and am also a graduate of De Paul Academy (when it was right
next to St. Vincent's on Kenmore) and De Paul University, School of
Music, 1976. In 2003-2004 I recorded the entire story of Faith, Hope
and Salvation and if you wish to view this short book it was published
on line (at the Lakefront SRO ETE Center they banned me from) and is
available at.
http://valleyofdeath.blogspot.com/ .(a book detailing the Nightmare of
Homeless and Salvation through Faith in the Lord that was entirely
written here in - with the editorial assistance of my kitty Felicia -
presented to our resident clown and &quot;Sr Case Manager&quot; over a year and
a half ago who promptly buried it under some files and made certain
that no one found out about - is something wrong with that picture?)

St. Paul gives us solace in Phillipians 1:28 &quot;Don't be afraid of your
enemies; always be courageous and this will prove to them that they
will lose and you shall win, because it is God who gives you the
victory.&quot;

Thanks to the School Sisters of St. Francis, the Vincentian Fathers at
De Paul, the Care and Protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the
Wonders of the Holy Rosary, and a few wonderful Pentecostal minister
friends this Catholic can find comfort in the words of our Lord.

DOES MERCY HOUSING APPROVE OF THE WAY THIS PLACE IS BRING OPERATED?
Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ had words for folks like Shawn Mintz
and Deon Jackass (er Jackson) when he stated in:

Matthew 23

7 &quot;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You lock the
kingdom of
heaven 8 before human beings. You do not enter yourselves, nor do you
allow
entrance to those trying to enter.
10 &quot;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You traverse
sea and land
to make one convert, and when that happens you make him a child of
Gehenna twice
as much as yourselves.
11 &quot;Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If one swears by the temple,
it means
nothing, but if one swears by the gold of the temple, one is
obligated.'
Blind fools, which is greater, the gold, or the temple that made the
gold
sacred?
You blind ones, which is greater, the gift, or the altar that makes
the gift
sacred?
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WE MUST EXPOSE AND EXPEL THESE DEVILS!

This is Mercy Housing?

Oh,

June 26, 2007
Dear Sirs or Madams:
On March 27 of 2007 I received a rent statement stating that my owed
is $33 - since my income is $0 and has not changed this is another
dumb mistake - a statement dated 05-31-07 continues the error and
claims a net debt of the same amount of 60 days. Pursuant to a
2007-2008 Lease that went into effect on 03-23-2007 between the writer
and your corporation, my rent is set a $0 since my incomes is $0 -
that has not changed so you would be well advised to find the source
of this bothersome and stupid error. When the first statement was
presented, barely four days after signing the new lease eluded to
supra, I advised &quot;Management&quot; of same and was assured it would be
attended to - it has not and remains on the statement - why?
This accounting error remains on the books as did a non-existent $47
fee in 2005 that cost me 18 months of angst and cost you 10 grand -
won't you folks ever learn?
Please be kind enough to fix this bothersome error to avoid future
difficulties and wasted time, which I don't' have since I am busy
pursuing my paralegal studies on line and at Roosevelt University.
Sincerely,
George M Weinert

To Whom It May Concern:

This letter is meant to alert the appropriate government agencies and
the American Public of serious Civil Rights Violations, Support for
Islaamofascist Terror as well as Continuing Elder abuse committed by
employees of Mercy Lakefront Housing at the above address. It is also
intended to alert the appropriate authorities that, while Mercy
Lakefront SRO Housing is happy to derive half of its operating budget
from government grants, it does not intend to obey basic laws of the
federal, state and local governments that supply those monies. While
serious legal violations have existed in this organizations for years,
nothing or substance has been done internally and serious fraud,
misuse of government funds, abuses and possible tax fraud are rampant.
The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees everyone in the United States the
right to &quot;due process of law.&quot; This fundamental Rights of all citizens
has also been ignored.

After a three year period of unemployment and persecution, the writer
has been accepted into the Paralegal Certificate Program at Roosevelt
University and needs to do a great deal research - but I AM DENIED
THIS BASIC RIGHT OF ALL TENANTS IN VIOLATION OF EQUAL ACCESS AND CIVIL
RIGHTS LAWS BY AN ORGANIZATION THAT DERIVES HALF OF IT OPERATING
BUDGET FROM GOVERNMENT GRANTS! The writer is a resident of Lakefront/
Mercy Housing of five years, a Roman Catholic of 55 years, who attends
Daily Mass and prays all the mysteries of the Holy Rosary. I am also a
former teacher for the Chicago Public Schools, Scholar and Author with
a Masters Degree so well area of what is going on here. Details

Through the grace of God I was led to Franciscan Outreach after nearly
three years of the nightmare of homelessness that included a brief
stint at Franciscan Shelter on Harrison Street who in turn led me to
Lincoln Park Community Shelter.

Over two years ago, a new 'intern' known only as &quot;Eric&quot; (he would not
reveal his late name) began conducting 'workshops' in our facilities,
allegedly under the harmless sounding banner of 'poetry' classes.
Since the writer is also an author and always interested in creative
writing I attended a number of these &quot;poetry&quot; sessions and was quite
shocked at what I heard:

At this point, the gentlemen known only as &quot;Eric&quot; revealed that he was
&quot;a Muslim&quot; and expressed support for Hamas Palestinian Terrorists,
causing considerable concern since this is one of the groups that has
urged that &quot;American kufir&quot; are the enemy and should be killed
whenever possible. At this point, since the writer is a (temporarily
unemployed) Substitute Teacher for the Chicago Public Schools and
government employee, I began to suspect possible involvement with anti-
American radical groups.

In a casual conservation in our Employment and Training Center, I
asked the gentleman known only as &quot;Eric&quot; if he was aware of the truly
barbaric nature of the Islamic Terrorists and offered to show him an
on line video clip of the beheading of Mr. Eugene Armstrong. This new
'intern' watched this brutal murder with casual acceptance and only
comments that it was &quot;No big deal&quot;, causing this American patriot
additional angst at such a callous comment about this heinous crime by
an individual with an obviously pro-Terrorist agenda. These shocking
and brutal videos can be viewed at http://terrorwebs.blogspot.com/
which is one of the Counter Terrorism web sites the writer has
maintained since the terrible attack of 09/11/2001. (WARNING - this
site contains GRAPHIC VIOLENCE)

I emailed the gentleman known only as &quot;Eric&quot; accounts of some quite
serious incidents of Islamic Terrorism in America, and was greeted
with a suggestion that I be &quot;Banned&quot; from any computer use at all,
obviously in an attempt to silence me and possibly conceal something.
This passed, so I emailed the gentleman known only as &quot;Eric&quot; the
following, which we must ask of Muslims in America espousing radical
political agendas:

Violence:
Modernity:
Secularism:
Islamic pluralism:
Self-criticism:
Defense against militant Islam:
Goals in the West:

Since the gentleman known only as &quot;Eric&quot; had already expressed support
for Palestinian Terrorists and Revolutionary Militants which is
indicative of non-support and outright hatred for the government of
the United States, had forwarded this teacher a short radical and very
alarming paper that claimed that the 09/11/2001 attacks were actually
a US Government Conspiracy and NOT ISLAMIC TERRORISM, and was
obviously interested in getting this resident &quot;Banned&quot; my suspicions
grew and my level of observation increased. Sadly, there was no
response to any of the questions above, so my level of suspicion was
understandably elevated.

Since our Employment and Training Lab has moved I have been a regular,
pursuing many job leads and considerable research to aid in my
knowledge of my chosen fields of work - Social Work and Writing on
Social Issues (I do a lot on Terrorism and its nefarious connection to
the illegal drug trade that claims so many lives amongst the homeless
since this issue plays a vital role in social work with the
population). Though I have diligently attempted to stay our of
anyone's way, and require no help, since I am a former Computer
Consultant of 20 years (Computer Consulting resume attached) I sensed
a great deal of hostility and began to suspect that my observations of
the gentleman known only as &quot;Eric&quot; were at the nexus of this dilemma.

The writer had just completed the superb two week &quot;Job Readiness&quot;
Class taught my Ms. Sheila Jackson and was impressed by the superb and
professional job that she does - as a teacher, my only suggestion is
for a bit more emphasis on the availability of training and education
available in the Uptown Area. (this is through the department of
Employment and TRAINING right?) All things considering, Ms Jackson
provides a wealth of information and should be highly rewarded for her
excellent class with a big raise.

The writer is now pursuing a new career in the paralegal profession
and could benefit greatly from additional course work that in only
four and half months can result in a Certified Paralegal Certificate,
funding for which is available through the Mayor's Office of
Employment. Upon starting this program, this would also greatly
enhance my chances of gaining permanent employment as well. Though the
writer independently investigated this possibility via Chicago City
Colleges (where I applied and was accepted thanks to the on line
services available to us now) Ms. Jackson painted a very dismal
attitude on the part of Lakefront towards this approach, and since we
can pick only one sponsoring agency, the selection of Lakefront now
seems like a very bad idea - a true pity, but my 20 years of sobriety
and volunteer work in AA, 4 years of S.T.A.I.R.S. (a program of
Chicago Health Outreach for the Homeless), and advanced degrees have
only been ridiculed and never taken seriously here so why waste time
and effort? This attitude seems a rather odd way to regard &quot;Education&quot;
and &quot;Training&quot;.

Upon completion of the &quot;Employment Readiness&quot; course this morning, the
writer was greeted by a three panel inquisition (including someone
that I did not even know) and was summarily informed that I would be
&quot;Banned&quot; from our Employment and Training facility for a week - with
the tired old &quot;Hygiene&quot; paradigm being employed as a justification -
rest assured, being in such close proximity to women for half the day,
the writer makes certain that his &quot;Hygiene&quot; is kept just fine.

Upon hearing of this, and understanding the real reason for it this
teacher unfortunately left in anger since this seemed a truly
insulting reward for my two weeks of effort and additional weeks of
job related research. Since I had earlier this morning filed eight job
applications at http://careercenter.com along with another in reply to
the &quot;Case Manager - South Loop&quot; position at Lakefront but since Email
is my only way of contact at the moment (my community voice mail was
disconnected last month) the writer trusts you can understand my anger
at being treated in such a deplorable and highly unprofessional
fashion, particularly by a group of people half my age.

Leaving our Center, I spied the gentleman known only as &quot;Eric&quot; and
unfortunately called him a &quot;Filthy Muslim Pig&quot; - since I am quite
certain he was at the cause of all of this. I acted in anger and haste
and after regretting this insensitive choice of words, went back into
the Employment Training Center to 1.) Apologize and 2.) find out his
last name since this matter is being brought to the attention of the
FBI, Homeland Security, the Chicago Police Counter Terrorism Unit and
other agencies that are entrusted with anti-Terrorism activities and
our vital security. Sadly, the writer was angrily chased out before
any of these objectives could be met.

At the time that these events took place, Lakefront SRO (now Mercy
Lakefront) was attempting to evict this resident on a trumped up and
false charge so I did nothing and hope that time would heal all. On
November 16, 2005 a Jury found Against Lakefront SRO and For George M
Weinert V so though this abusive two year persecution had ended I have
been 'banned' every since. These events occurred in Feb of 2004 and
Mercy Lakefront Housing has been violating the laws while taking large
financial grants from our government whose statures they consistently
refuse to obey.

Sadly Elder Abuse also plays a role as detailed in this email of:

Sunday, July 23, 2006

Dear Friend in Christ,

The Elder Abuse at Mercy Lakefront Housing in Chicago is continuing
and as of this date, Pursuant to (320 ILCS 20/) Elder Abuse and
Neglect Act. (320 ILCS 20/1) (from Ch. 23, par. 6601) Sec. 1. Short
title. This Act shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;Elder Abuse
and Neglect Act&quot;. (Source: P.A. 85-1184.) Report Number HM403699 has
been filed with the Chicago Police Department detailing the abuse and
danger to tenants posed by Sr. Case Manager Deon Jackson

The National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) defines these categories of
Elder Abuse:

Emotional or Psychological Abuse

Emotional or psychological abuse is defined as the infliction of
anguish,
pain, or distress through verbal or nonverbal acts.
Emotional/psychological abuse includes but is not limited to verbal
assaults, insults, threats, intimidation, humiliation, and harassment.
In
addition, treating an older person like an infant; isolating an
elderly
person from his/her family, friends, or regular activities; giving an
older person the &quot;silent treatment;&quot; and enforced social isolation are
examples of emotional/psychological abuse.

Signs and symptoms of emotional/psychological abuse include but are
not limited to:

* being emotionally upset or agitated;

* being extremely withdrawn and non communicative or non responsive;

* unusual behavior usually attributed to dementia (e.g., sucking,
biting,rocking); and

* an elder's report of being verbally or emotionally mistreated.

* Emotional or Psychological Abuse is a specialty of (Former) Sr. Case
Manager Deon Jackson and has gone on far too long. When the CHICAGO
POLICE DEPARTMENT has to be called on for intervention to PREVENT
ADDITIONAL ABUSE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR PHYSICAL VIOLENCE WE HAVE A
REAL PROBLEM.

Elder Abuse and Accused Rapist Deon Jackson is also fond of Neglect

Neglect is defined as the refusal or failure to fulfill any part of a
person's obligations or duties to an elder. Neglect may also include
failure of a person who has fiduciary responsibilities to provide care
for
an elder (e.g., pay for necessary home care services) or the failure
on the part of an in-home service provider to provide necessary care.

Neglect typically means the refusal or failure to provide an elderly
person with such life necessities as food, water, clothing, shelter,
personal hygiene, medicine, comfort, personal safety, and other
essentials
included in an implied or agreed-upon responsibility to an elder.

The &quot;Banning&quot; of individuals from the lounge areas, and the
Employment, Training and Education Center (that works in cooperation
with the De Paul University School of Education constitutes not only
neglect but also puts the managers of the facility in question in
violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Title VII, Federal Equal
Access Act and Elder Abuse Acts.

Mercy Housing is owned by the Sisters of Charity who can be reached at
my alma mater: De Paul University (if the Terrorists at
http://condor.depaul.edu/~umma/ - DPU's United Mujahideen (re,
Muslims) Moving Ahead have not started a new jihad and chopped of
their heads)

Contact
National Director of Communications
Tel: 303-830-3350
Cell: 303-594-1162
Fax: 303-830-3301
And ask if the Sisters of Charity condone this continued law
breaking.

You can reach Mercy Lakefront SRO and ask if they approve of this
abuse and continued law breaking on the part of employees?

247 South State St, Suite 810
Chicago, IL 60604-2053
Phone: 312-447-4500
Fax: 312-447-4750

To add to the violations, personnel of Lakefront's ETE Center, &quot;Sr.
Case Manager Deon Jackson&quot;, and another part-time employee of ETE,
Black Muslim Terrorist Agnin Mumin continue to conspire to deny this
tenant his basic civil rights and use threats of violence and coercion
in order to continue their abuse.

Lakefront Mercy SRO Housing continues to violate the laws and abuse
the basic rights of residents like this one but is glad to continue to
accept funds from a government whose laws they do not wish to obey.

The writer humbly requests a full investigation of these heinous
abuses pursuant to:

US CODE: Title 42,SUBCHAPTER V-FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS
TITLE 42 &gt; CHAPTER 21 &gt; SUBCHAPTER V
SUBCHAPTER V-FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS
§ 2000d. Prohibition against exclusion from participation in, denial
of
benefits of, and discrimination under federally assisted programs on
ground of race, color, or national origin
§ 2000d-1. Federal authority and financial assistance to programs or
activities by way of grant, loan, or contract other than contract of
insurance or guaranty; rules and regulations; approval by President;
compliance with requirements; reports to Congressional committees;
effective date of administrative action
§ 2000d-2. Judicial review; administrative procedure provisions

775 ILCS 5/ Illinois Human Rights Act.
(A) Freedom from Unlawful Discrimination. To secure for all
individuals within Illinois the freedom from discrimination against
any individual because of his or her race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, ancestry, age, marital status,physical or mental
handicap, military status, sexual orientation, or unfavorable
discharge from military service in
connection with employment, real estate transactions, access to
financial credit, and the availability of public accommodations.

Mercy Housing's own policy states:

Tenant Rights

In keeping with Mercy Housing Lakefront's mission, Vision and Values
to create a more humane world where poverty is alleviated, communities
are healthy and all people can develop their potential, you are
encourage as a tenant to exercise the following rights and
responsibilities:

Rights:

1. RESPECT: to be treated by staff and neighbors with consideration
and regard for your inherent dignity as a human being, free from
intimidation, harassment, or violence
2. NONDISCRIMINATION: to fair and impartial treatment by staff
regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, national origin, disability,
religion, sexual orientation, or political affiliation
3. JUSTICE: access to the Grievance/Complaint Process; and prompt
consideration from management to all valid grievances/complaints for
resolution as quickly as possible
4. CONFIDENTIALITY: to discretion and respect for your privacy as long
as it does not interfere with the rights, health and safety of others
5. COMMUNITY AFFILIATION - when all notices are tightly controlled and
American Flags and Crosses and thrown into the trash can?
6. SAFETY: to safe, decent and sanity living conditions
7. MAINTENANCE: to have unit repairs performed in a timely manner upon
completion of proper work order request forms
8. NOTICE: to be given reasonable notice of any non-emergency
inspection or entry into your apartment

Chicago Municipal Code S-12-050 states &quot;A tenant shall permit
reasonable access to a landlord upon receiving two days notice by
mail, telephone, written:notice or other means designed in good faith
to provide reasonable notice.&quot;

A Notice given 24 hours before is NOT TWO DAYS NOTICE so I returned
the notice and told the &quot;Desk Clerk&quot; to tell (former) Property Manager
Laurance Floyd and/or Failed Basketball Player and Accused Rapist Deon
Jackson to SHOVE IT UP THEIR ARSE!

Another 'notice' was placed in my mailbox at later 4:00 PM on December
20, back-dated to December 19, 2006! Incredible -

Meanwhile, back at the old shared bathroom, Jailbird Marcus Johnson of
&quot;You gonna Die White Honkey Motherf**ker&quot; fame continues to leave the
entire bathroom floor wet daily, creating a serious health hazard to
this older resident. Though it has been reported many times,
&quot;Management&quot; does nothing to stop it.

Black Muslim Terrorist Agnin Mumin has once again been overheard
talking about planting bombs, prompting yet more FBI actions so 2007
ought to be great fun.

AND NOW MANAGEMENT FORCES THEIR WAY IN AND ASSAULTS OUR RESIDENTS!!!

WHERE DOES MERCY HOUSING THEY FIND THESE VIOLENT THUGS?

Since when does MERCY HOUSING approve of DRUG USE and VIOLENCE in
their units?

What are they trying to hide?

Are the Sisters of Mercy Muzzling the Truth?

It seems that our MSN Community at http://groups.msn.com/Mercylakefront/
Mercy Lakefront has someone very upset. We can no longer post anything
there at all - why would that happen?

Who could be responsible and why?

The why is easy - a lot of folks in the Mercy Lakefront Housing
Organization do not want the general public to find out about the
continuing civil, human rights and elder abuses and the molly coddling
of Negro criminals, crack whores and Black Muslim Terrorists under the
odious aegis of diversity. Even more folks at Mercy Housing don't want
people to know JUST HOW MANY FEDERAL LAWS they are VIOLATING since
THIS CAN COST A LOT OF MONEY IN LOST FEDERAL GRANTS and EVEN MORE IN
LOST CONTRIBUTIONS.

Who would want to do something like that and conceal these abuses,
illegality, prostitution and support for Islamofascist Terror groups?

The Sisters of Mercy have NEVER ONCE responded to ANY OF OUR LETTERS
and THOUGH A ONE PAGE &quot;TENANTS RIGHTS&quot; document was produced NOTHING
HAS CHANGED AND THEY KNOW IT -

Why is that GOOD SISTERS Of Charity?

Our Lord and Savior Taught us to THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE -

* WHY DO THE SISTERS OF CHARITY WISH TO HIDE IT?

* WHY DO THE SISTER OF MERCY ALLOW JESUS TO BE CAST INTO THE TRASH AND
PROTECT THE PEDOPHILE PROPHET MOHAMMED?

* WHY DO THE SISTERS OF MERCY THROW THE AMERICAN FLAG INTO THE GARBAGE
CAN AND TOLERATE VIOLENT DRUG USERS, CRACK HOS AND ISLAMOFASCIST
TERRORISTS?

I'll tell you boys and girls since THE PARISH I LIVED IN FOR 49 YEARS
and my PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS LIVE IN FOR 98 YEARS THREW ME OUT OF
CHURCH AND ALMOST HAD ME ARRESTED (see http://valleyofdeath.blogspot.com/ )
- SO I SPEAK THE TRUTH - WHEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SEES THEIR MONETARY
INTERESTS THREATENED THEY CAN GET VERY Un-CHRISTIAN - and in THIS CASE
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON. 1

The other reason is that many of the ignorant libs running these
places actually IDENTIFY WITH AND SUPPORT THE ISLAMOFASCISTS - (in the
same fashion that they supported the Commies like Castro and Che
Guevera), despise American ideals and HATE GEORGE W BUSH MORE THAN
THEY LOVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
It's really sick but they see the MUSLIM TERRORIST as the HERO and SEE
AMERICANS AND CHRISTIANS AS THE ENEMY! (this is why Crosses, Jesus and
flags are torn down and cast into the trash and Christmas is held with
PRAYERS FORBIDDEN)

I can't speak for the Sisters of Mercy but I can tell you about the
VINCENTIAN FATHERS AT DE PAUL UNIVERSITY THAT SUPPORT AND EVEN TEACH
THE GLOBAL JIHAD!!!

My two great aunts, Sisters Adonella (SSF) and Sr. Clodicinda (Poor
Handmaid of Mary) clued me in when I was very young - A LOT OF
'RELIGIOUS' ARE NOT QUITE WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE.

We'll contact MSN Groups and see if this can be reversed but it this
CENSORSHIP CONTINUES that's ok too - we'll JUST START MERCYLAKEFRONT
GROUPS at YAHOO and GOOGLE TOO! (and when they block those, we'll
start MERCYHOUSING groups, etc, etc, etc)

I've fully documented a long string of abuses at Mercy Lakefront SRO
Housing and have been doing so since their ignominious defeat in Court
on November 16, 2005 when a jury found against Lakefront SRO and for
George M Weinert V in an abusive and fraudulent two year long attempt
at 'eviction'.

1.) Elder Abuse has reached a critical stage with death threats and
continuing violent actions, coupled with profanity laden fulminations
by the latest abusive gansta, Mr. Marcus Johnson. &quot;Management&quot; appears
to feel that this is permissible and though advised many times the
danger remains requiring Chicago Police Report #HM716423 on 10/12/06
and Report #HM749946 on December 2, 2006 1

2.) Concurrent with this abuse the denial of services continue,
leaving this 55 year old peaceful Man of God penniless and without
anyone to turn to for help in securing training and employment. This
is exactly what &quot;Management&quot; at this facility wants. In addition to
denial of communication facilities, (Phone, fax and internet that are
a part of this &quot;Employment, Training and Education Center&quot; that ALL
OTHER MERCY LAKEFRONT RESIDENTS are allowed to use), all
transportation assistance (also a part of this center as well as this
Mercy Lakefront facility and crucial this 55 year old man with a gun
shot wound in his left let that creates great pain when walking any
long distance) and all counseling (which is impossible since this
resident is Illegally &quot;:Banned&quot; from this Center and the only option
is abusive &quot;Sr. Case Manager&quot; Deon Jackson who screams at our
residents and has called this Conservative Catholic a &quot;Dirty Stinking
Bastard&quot; an concerted attempt has been made to totally ostracize and
isolate this scholar with the effect of creating great pain from
walking daily and frequent spells of depression since there has seen
no way out. 2

3.) Despite a two year logs abusive and illegal attempt at &quot;Eviction&quot;
of this Quiet (and WHITE) Resident that ended on November 16, 2005
when A Jury found Against Lakefront SRO and for George M Weinert V and
ordered all harassment ended, the silly cause of the action (a $47.00
'debt' that never existed) remained on my rent statement for an
additional four months, requiring Cabrini Legal Services to file a
COURT ACTION DEMANDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDER. Though that action
ended, the ILLEGAL SEARCHES and THUGGISH STYLE of new &quot;Property
Manager&quot; Laurence Floyd continue to threatened this elderly resident
with EVICTION based on the results of ILLEGAL SEARCHES THAT NEVER EVEN
OCCURRED so the continuing threats of homelessness which effect the
serenity and mental health of this bookish man of God continue. 3
Though these illegal &quot;Inspections&quot; require at least 48 hours notice,
two have been attempted with NO NOTICE AT ALL on 10/19/02 and 11/16/06
- on both days ENTRANCE WAS DENIED since NOTICE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN and
the response of &quot;Management&quot; was to provide a notice indicating that
this unit resident FAILED TWO &quot;INSPECTIONS&quot; THAT NEVER EVEN TOOK
PLACE! Since &quot;Property Manager&quot; Laurence Floyd Threatened to &quot;Start
Evictions&quot; of anyone who failed THREE of these ILLEGAL SEARCHES this
is yet another ATTEMPT AT COERCION that is ELDER ABUSE.

This pattern of abuse began in 2003 and I was powerless to do
anything. I turned 55 on June 15, 2006 and though I have made a
dedicated attempt to get into the Senior Community Service and
Employment Program, along with the Mayor's Workforce Investment Act
Program to secure funds for Paralegal Training to enter a booming
field I have been stymied at every turn by &quot;Management&quot;. Since said
&quot;Management' CANNOT EVEN SPELL AT A FOURTH GRADE LEVEL and the only
'professional&quot; in this unit is Elder Abuser Deon Jackson (a failed
basketball player with a Bachelors in Physical Education) the fact
that I HOLD A MASTERS DEGREE IN MUSIC COMPOSITION AND HALF OF ANOTHER
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE had been met ONLY WITH JEALOUSLY AND HOSTILITY
that has LED TO THIS CONTINUING ABUSE.

The presence of bi-sexual abusive &quot;Sr. Case Manager&quot; Mr. Deon Jackson
(who is still here and intimidating our elderly residents by screaming
at them and using his 6&quot;5&quot; stature to terrorize), illiterate &quot;Property
Manager&quot; Laurence Floyd, bald headed little bastard and former
&quot;Property Manager&quot; Shawn Mintz (who initiated the action and has been
&quot;moved&quot; to another &quot;Management&quot; Position as a result) and Black Muslim
Terrorist Agnin Mumin (who was sad that the 'blessed event&quot; in Joliet
has been foiled but promises 'More for 'dem White Honky
mudderf**kers&quot;) continue. The real physical dangers presented to this
55 year old Devout Roman Catholic and other older residents has been
fully documented at http://mercylakefront.blogspot.com/ and is

Is there a connection with the Palestinian Islamofascist Terror Groups
that have infested Chicago's De Paul University? Yes there may be. The
Employment, Training and Education Center of Mercy Lakefront works
closely with the De Paul University School of Education that provides
tutors and other resources. Many of those personnel are Terrorist
sympathizers if not sleeper Islamic Terrorists who have ties to
Radical Student Organizations based at De Paul University like the
United Muslims Moving Ahead at http://condor.depaul.edu/~umma/ who are
connected with the Muslim Students Association who are connected with
HAMAS! Their presence at Mercy Lakefront allows them to operate under
the guise of &quot;Charity&quot;, secure access to large government grants,
portions of which in turn can then be channeled to groups like the
Muslim Student Association (Via the De Paul students and grads) and
then funneled to HAMAS TO SUPPORT PLANNED ISLAMIC TERRORIST OPERATIONS
in CHICAGO! Chicago's Islamofascists are masters at this sort of thing
as we learned with the Holy Land Foundation and KindHearts who are
both on trial at the Dirksen Federal Building now for Terror
Financing. We've just begun to make these connections and experts at
the Anti-Terrorism Coalition, Anti-Terrorism Blog and Homeland
Security are also involved so look for a lot more on this
ISLAMOFASCIST TERROR FINANCING At Mercy Lakefront SRO in the coming
year. Mercy Housing's ETE Center is also in violation of The US
Patriot Act and should be investigated using the following statute:

SEC. 201. AUTHORITY TO INTERCEPT WIRE, ORAL, AND ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATIONS
RELATING TO TERRORISM.
Section 2516(1) of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
(1) by redesignating paragraph (p), as so redesignated by section
434(2) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(Public Law 104-132; 110 Stat. 1274), as paragraph (r); and
(2) by inserting after paragraph (p), as so redesignated by section
201(3) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act of 1996(division C of Public Law 104-208; 110 Stat. 3009-565), the
following new paragraph:
`(q) any criminal violation of section 229 (relating to chemical
weapons); or sections 2332, 2332a, 2332b, 2332d, 2339A, or 2339B of
this title (relating to terrorism); or'.
SEC. 202. AUTHORITY TO INTERCEPT WIRE, ORAL, AND ELECTRONIC

striking and section 1341 (relating to mail fraud),' and inserting
section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), a felony violation of section
1030 (relating to computer fraud and abuse),'.

If USING THE WEB SITE OF OUR TERRORIST ENEMIES TO INTIMIDATE and
THREATEN THE OPERATOR OF http://americanjihad.blogspot.com/ does not
constitute COMPUTER ABUSE THEN JUST WHAT THE HELL DOES? What else do
Mercy Lakefront's Black Muslim Terrorists have planned?

If there are some logical explanations for these continuing abuses,
legal violations and physical dangers why not just respond and explain
them?

IS MERCY LAKEFRONT TRYING TO HIDE THESE CONTINUING CRIMES and their
blatant SUPPORT OF BLACK MUSLIM TERRORISM?

* Yes they are and they are Defrauding the United States, State and
Local governments.

* Yes they are and are also involved in serious Violations of Title VI
of the 1964 Civil Rights Act: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.
Overview of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., was enacted as part of the
landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. It prohibits discrimination on
the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and
activities receiving federal financial assistance. As President John
F. Kennedy said in 1963:
Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all
taxpayers of all races [colors, and national origins]
contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages,
entrenches, subsidizes or results in racial [color or national
origin] discrimination..

Why don't you write to The Director of Mercy Housing and ask why they
believe they can take YOUR TAX DOLLARS AND continue these abuses while
BREAKING MANY LAWS OF THE LAND?

National Director of Communications - Mercy Housing
Tel: 303-830-3350
Cell: 303-594-1162
Fax: 303-830-3301

Why not ask the Director why this racial discrimination, serious crime
and abuse to continue?

lakefr ... @mercyhousing.org - Mercy Lakefront Public Relations but they
appear to be more interested in protecting the abusers, criminals,
crack hos and Islamofascist Terrorists since nothing has improved and
in fact things seem to be getting even worse with real physical
dangers that require the frequent intervention of the Chicago Police
and the new attempt to just shut us all up. (threats of physical
violence will be next and physical assaults)

The writer has been denied access to training and employment
opportunities for over three years and is reduced to a bare income of
only $159 per month in food stamps on a link card. Since I have been
accepted into the Roosevelt University Paralegal Certificate Program
for Fall of 2008 I am desperately in need of part time employment and
the regular internet access that all other residents are entitled to -
but the Racism, concealment of Islamofascist Terrorism and elder abuse
are used to deny me the opportunity to advance my position and work my
way out of poverty - Why is Mercy Housing allowed to continue these
CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, USE THUGGISH CRIMINALS TO INTIMIDATE THIS 56
YEAR OLD RESIDENT BREAK THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND RECEIVE MILLIONS IN
GOVERNMENT GRANTS?
