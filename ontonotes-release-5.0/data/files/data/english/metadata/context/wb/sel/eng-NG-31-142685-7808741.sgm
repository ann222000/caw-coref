MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Archeologists have discovered what they think
are ruins of an Aztec pyramid razed by vengeful Spanish conquerors in
what is now one of Mexico City's most crime-ridden districts.

Construction workers unearthed ancient walls in the busy Iztapalapa
neighborhood in June, and government archeologists said on Wednesday
they believe they may be part of the main pyramid of the Aztec city,
destroyed by conquistador Hernan Cortes in the 16th century.

Iztapalapa, now infamous for violent crime and drug dealing, has grown
into a sprawling, poor district of the capital, obscuring the ruins.

&quot;We knew the general location but couldn't explore because it's a big
urban area,&quot; said government archeologist Jesus Sanchez, who is
director of the site.

Iztapalapa's ruler, Cuitlahuac, nearly annihilated Cortes and his
Spanish troops in 1520 in what became known as the Sad Night. After
eventual victory, Cortes destroyed the city.

Sanchez hopes he has found the city's main pyramid just below the
neighborhood's central plaza and garden. He and his team will spend
more than a year investigating before deciding whether to excavate.

Mexico City is littered with pre-Hispanic ruins. In October,
archeologists in the city's central Zocalo square unearthed a 15th
century Aztec altar and a 12-ton stone idol just yards from choking
downtown traffic.
