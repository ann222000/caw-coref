Of Contracts and Constitutions
by David Dieteman

Harry Jaffa has taken a swipe at Joe Sobran over the issue of the
secession of various Southern states. In doing so,
Jaffa commits a number of errors.

First, Jaffa misconstrues the nature of contract law. Jaffa writes that Under the law of contracts, obligations freely undertaken can
never be disavowed unilaterally.  That the Constitution would by
granting a right of secession provide for its own demise  assisted
suicide so to speak  is absurd. Hardly.

There is no reason why a contract cannot be broken by one party to the
contract. In legal terms, this is known as a breach, or a unilateral
breach. But, of course, the mere fact that one can breach a contract does
not mean that such a breach has no consequences. Depending on the facts,
you may be liable for damages for breaching your contract.

If the other party to the contract relied on you to do your part, or will
now lose other valuable opportunities, you might have to pay him money
damages to put him in the same financial state he would have been in had
you performed your part of the deal.

There is a related concept of an &quot;efficient breach,&quot; in which
it is a more sensible decision to breach a contract and pay damages than
to perform the contract. In Pennsylvania, this happened en masse over the
past year, as natural gas supply companies repudiated supply contracts
due to the fact that they would have been forced into bankruptcy if they
had been compelled to supply natural gas at the contract prices, given
the massive increase in the costs of natural gas.

Courts, at least in Pennsylvania, recognize that such dire economic
consequences may sometimes excuse a party from
following through on a contract.

Which brings me to Jaffa's second gaffe: contract law is a matter of
state law.

In the fifty states which make up the United States of America, the
everyday laws which we encounter vary from state to state. This is
because such laws, specifically, the areas of law broadly known
as:

o Contracts
o Torts (personal injuries)
o Property (real estate)

are part of what is known as the &quot;common law.&quot; No legislature
ever sat down and passed a law which declared what the common law should
be. Instead, the common law in the American states is made by judges,
based upon cases already decided, which in turn are based upon what
people in their communities actually do.

Rather than law imposed from on high by social engineers, the common law
functions as an engine of justice by enforcing
what F.A. Hayek defines in the three volumes of Law, Legislation and
Liberty as &quot;the rules of just conduct.&quot; As opposed to OSHA
regulations which govern the amount of water you can have in your toilet
tank, &quot;the rules of just conduct&quot; are concerned with the type
of behavior which will be tolerated in a society.

The rules of just conduct, then, are the basis of societies. Societies
are not formed by large groups of people coming
together and only then deciding at gunpoint what their ground rules will
be. Instead, Hayek notes, societies form because people in a geographic
area share certain beliefs, namely, the rules of just conduct.

As examples of the rules of just conduct, Hayek points to contracts,
torts, and property law. From the law of contracts, Hayek points out that
a rule of just conduct (roughly stated) is that &quot;you should honor
your obligations&quot; (this would appear
to be what Jaffa is getting at). From the law of torts, one can discern
the rule of just conduct that &quot;if you injure your neighbor, you must
make him whole.&quot; Thus, if you trespass across your neighbor's land
(i.e., enter his land without permission and cause damage), you may be
required to pay him for the damages caused. In the law of property, we
find the prohibition against theft. In other words, the rules of just
conduct include the concept of ownership.

Returning to Jaffa, he is incorrect to state that &quot;obligations
freely undertaken can never be disavowed unilaterally.&quot; First, they
most certainly can. Whether the breaching party must then pay damages is
a separate question. Second, Jaffa wrongly implies that there is asingle
law of contracts which has been adopted by every state in the forcible
Union. Although much of the law of contracts is shared  precisely
because of its common law origins in England, such origins being shared
by the fifty states  it is not the case that there is any single
authority which dictates the law of contracts in the United States. And,
it must be noted, there are indeed state-to-state differences in the
particulars of contract law.

Third, Jaffa is also wrong to argue that it is &quot;absurd&quot; that a
contract might provide for its own demise. Quite to the contrary, it is
not at all uncommon for commercial contracts to include provisions
detailing how it is that one side (or both) may amend or terminate the
contractual arrangement. This, after all, is the essence of a free and
voluntary contract  it is not forcible slavery, but rather a
voluntary and hence beneficial undertaking. The businessman who spends
his life forcing business partners to perform contracts or pay damages
rather than showing a willingness to &quot;do business&quot; and be
reasonable will
quickly find himself shunned in the business community  precisely
for seeking to use the courts to enforce at the point of a gun a private
deal which was meant to be for mutual gain.

Which is, of course, why many libertarians shy away from the worship of
Abraham Lincoln.

Finally, note that Jaffa sticks to a main point also advanced by other
Lincoln scholars at the Claremont Institute. Jaffa writes that In some of his writings, Sobran has asserted that three of the
original thirteen states, in their instruments of ratification, reserved
the right to secede from the Union. But Sobran has misread those
documents. What the states reserved was the right of revolution, as set
forth in the Declaration of Independence. But that is a natural right,
under the laws of nature, and not a constitutional right. The seceders
were careful not to appeal to the right of revolution, since that would
be a right to which their slaves might appeal not less than
themselves. As I have previously argued, in Contra Claremont, in Three Views of
the Constitution  this is an exceedingly formalistic
and weak argument.

Consider this: for Jaffa, even though the Southerners had a natural right
to secede (call it the right to revolt if it is a more comfortable word),
they wrongly claimed to have a legal right to secede under the
Constitution of 1789, and therefore their secession was
unlawful.

No. Sorry. Utterly unconvincing.

If the South had a natural right to revolt (which it undeniably did, or
else the Declaration of Independence must be denied), then the South was
very much justified in seceding. Jaffa argues that the South could not
have believed in such a natural right of revolt, as this would have
justified slave rebellions. Yes, it would have. Such a natural right of
revolution as articulated in the Declaration of Independence also
justified slave rebellions in the American colonies when they seceded
from England  and yet Jaffa does not contend that the American
Revolution was &quot;illegal.&quot;

By the way, did the unwritten English constitution make the American
Revolution &quot;illegal?&quot;

In addition, the South certainly had a constitutional right to secede,
based on the 9th and 10th Amendments, and the nature of the Constitution
as an enumerated document  not to mention the fact that the federal
government created by the Constitution was itself the child of secession
twice over  first from England, and second from the Articles of
Confederation (see my articles linked above for the longer version of
these arguments).

Finally, consider the following passages from Jaffa: Who fired on Fort Sumter? Sobran might as well blame Lincoln for
Pearl Harbor.  The Constitution that Lincoln had sworn to uphold
enjoined him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. How could
he execute the laws in states that claimed to have seceded, and which had
seized all the federal property within their boundaries?
Lincoln’s defense of the Union was therefore a defense of the
principle of constitutional majority rule, a principle not recognized
anywhere else in the world of that time. There is, of course, no need to blame Lincoln for Pearl Harbor. We
can blame FDR, thanks to such writers as Edward
Beach and Robert Stinnett. And yet, the Pearl Harbor reference is
well-placed: Lincoln paved the way which FDR later followed. Lincoln
maneuvered the CSA into firing the first shots of the war so that Lincoln
could then prosecute an unconstitutional war (see John V. Denson's
chapters in The Costs of War,2nd ed., and Reassessing the
Presidency).

Jaffa, by the way, ignores that numerous federal properties and forts had
been seized by the Southern states after secession  and seized with
very good reason. After all, if your state is no longer part of the USA,
by what right does the federal government of the USA continue to claim
such properties?

Should various forts on the eastern seaboard continue to be regarded as
British?

Worse, Jaffa ignores that the South offered to pay compensation for the
properties which were taken. Remember
the efficient breach theory of contracts? Lincoln, of course, refused
such offers.

Worst of all, Jaffa ignores the fundamental issue at stake in arguing
over secession by wondering

And their &quot;damages&quot; became the &quot;War&quot; they forced upon the Government.

Those Elected were elected to uphold the &quot;Union&quot;, and as Lincoln so
pointed out he had sworn an Oath to uphold it, and those opposing him
had sworn no such Oath to destroy it.

So the War came, and we SHOWED in the starkest of terms why this type
of secession would not be tolerated by the Body as a whole.

Again, not sure what you don't understand about that?

They attempted to forcibly remove themselves, and we forcibly told
them they cannot.
