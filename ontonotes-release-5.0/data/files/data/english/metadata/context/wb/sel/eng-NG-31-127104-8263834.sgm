Well, I did think that I only needed a new torso. Now it appears that I need
a new head as well.

I woke up this morning feeling as rough as ever (but we will gloss over
that) and, in addition the right side of my head below my ear on the neck
and cheek felt slightly swollen (not the lymph gland). I didn't think too
much about it as the associated pain was minimal - then I ate breakfast and
my RHS face ballooned up. I rang up the docs to make an acute appointment
and was given an appointment a couple of hours later. In the meantime, I
eliminated tumour, embolism and, as my brain (to my knowledge) has not
slipped to below my ear, I eliminated cerebral haemorrhage as possible
causes.

Anyway, it looks as though I have a stone(s) in the most likely in the
parotid gland http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/23069166/ , which is one of
the 3 salivary glands.
If you would like to donate to my PayMe(LOTS) account No. EVENMORELOOTFORME,
then you would help me to buy a salivary gland stone for my LHS parotid
gland :-) At the moment I look as though I am on 40 mg Pred., but only have
the symptoms on the RHS of my face. The swelling and the pain do go down
inbetween meals and the size of the swelling is in line with the size of the
parotid gland (see internet link above), but I am not without considerable
pain when I eat and for an hour or so afterwards. A coldpack is helping.

It was amongst the fastest diagnoses I have ever received. (In march my last
internist diagnosed my chronic earache from Dec to March as jaw problems
also within a few seconds). I will probably have to go to the ENT doc. and
have it cut out if the doc. can't coax it out. If it recurrs then they will
excise the whole gland on the RHS of my face.

I hear they are making diamonds out of peoples cremated remains these
days ( I can get the website if someone is interested),  maybe they
can make a precious gem out of your salivary gland stones- then at
least you would have some bling to wear in the hospital while you are
recovering.   You have such a wonderful sense of humor,  best of luck
with this newest adventure.

Oh, Vanny...that sounds terrible.  Do whatever it takes to get some
relief, and I'll send good vibes that you can pass this thing without
surgery.  Make those docs do their job...if anyone has the know-how, you do.

Thanks everybody.

Like yourselves I was completely astounded that this could happen to one.
Salivary gland stones - what the ....?

Just to let you know that I am feeling significantly better today. I have
been able to eat without my RHS face ballooning up, although the
inflammation has spread down my neck. Either the stone(s) has shifted and is
no longer blocking the duct or it has been expelled. They are usually less
than a couple of millimetres in size. However, the residual inflammation
might indicate that I now have infection in the gland and/or an abscess. I
have an appointment with the ENT doc. tomorrow afternoon and I reckon that I
will last out until then. Yesterday I was convinced that I would be ready to
be packed in a box today, but I have a vivid imagination - fueled by the
realities of Crohn's.

Well... &lt;&lt;It wasn't the cough that carried her off. It was the coffin they
carried her off in.&gt;&gt;

LMAO! I love that quote, I often use it &quot;it wasn't the cough that
carried her off, it was the coffin that carried her off in&quot;.

Glad you're doing a bit better today. I can imagine it's not the most
comfortable thing because you cannot stop your saliva flowing!

I'm going to add to the moan if that's ok. Not that I'm too worried,
but I like sharing war wounds lol! Before I went away, I was doing the
vacuuming. I had the vacuum (btw, I'm using vacuum and not hoover for
our American friends) at the top of the stairs, and I was half way
down the stairs using the attachment. The next thing I know the vacuum
comes tumbling down the stairs and whams straight into my arm. It was
amazingly painful, and on top of that I had to hold the vacuum up by
that part of my arm that it smashed into, whilst screaming to my Mum
&quot;get it off me, get it off me!&quot; When she did get it off me, I ran down
to the bottom of the stairs, sat on the floor and held my arm, rocking
in agony. I couldn't move it. A few minutes later though it eased up
and I could move everything, which was a sign for me it wasn't broken.
I couldn't bare to touch it though and I had this pain shooting down
my whole arm into my hand. I couldn't even put ice on it because it
was that tender. Anyway, it bruised up beautifully! And also form a
lump in the 'hit' area. I also had muscle ache along the whole arm the
next day. It's not too bad now, but I still can't touch that area and
there's still bruising and a lump. I've tried massaging the lump
through gritting my teeth, but nothing comes of it. I should have
listened to Mum and kept putting Arnica cream on it!

I understand the bruising and pain etc, but what the hell is that
lump? It's rock solid and doesn't move. I am slightly worried it may
be bone. What do you think? (I love asking your opinion about my war
wounds because you put my mind at ease, even if it was, say, broken,
at least I'd trust you and know! lol!)

Ugh, that sounds nasty. From what you describe it sounds as though you have
chipped the bone and damaged the surrounding muscle. That would potentially
explain the painful lump. You might also find that you have a hairline
fracture (either complete or partial - probably partial). It really does
sound as though you need it X-rayed. Small chips of bone or anything can
migrate around the body and potentially cause further problems. They might
have to clean it up or they might leave it alone depending on how the bone
damage looks. They can't do much with a hairline fracture if you do have
one. I know that it will be a pain dealing with the doctors again, but if
the damage is not repaired properly at this stage it will cause you problems
down the road - whether it is 10 years from now or 30 or 40. Just remember
that bone damage heals within a matter of weeks, whereas muscle damage can
take months if not years in the worst case scenario. I am assuming that it
was in the middle of your upper arm and not at the joints so there will be
no or minimal ligament damage.

It might also be a good time to have your bones checked for osteoporosis and
your spine checked - if you visit the orthopaedist.

I don't have to tell you that I am not a doctor and the above is just an
educated guess ;-)

&gt; but I like sharing war wounds lol! Before I went away, I was doing the
&gt; vacuuming. I had the vacuum (btw, I'm using vacuum and not hoover for
&gt; our American friends) at the top of the stairs, and I was half way
&gt; down the stairs using the attachment. The next thing I know the vacuum
&gt; comes tumbling down the stairs and whams straight into my arm. It was
&gt; amazingly painful, and on top of that I had to hold the vacuum up by
&gt; that part of my arm that it smashed into, whilst screaming to my Mum
&gt; &quot;get it off me, get it off me!&quot; When she did get it off me, I ran down
&gt; to the bottom of the stairs, sat on the floor and held my arm, rocking
&gt; in agony. I couldn't move it. A few minutes later though it eased up
&gt; and I could move everything, which was a sign for me it wasn't broken.
&gt; I couldn't bare to touch it though and I had this pain shooting down
&gt; my whole arm into my hand. I couldn't even put ice on it because it
&gt; was that tender. Anyway, it bruised up beautifully! And also form a
&gt; lump in the 'hit' area. I also had muscle ache along the whole arm the
&gt; next day. It's not too bad now, but I still can't touch that area and
&gt; there's still bruising and a lump. I've tried massaging the lump
&gt; through gritting my teeth, but nothing comes of it. I should have
&gt; listened to Mum and kept putting Arnica cream on it!

&gt; I understand the bruising and pain etc, but what the hell is that
&gt; lump? It's rock solid and doesn't move. I am slightly worried it may
&gt; be bone. What do you think? (I love asking your opinion about my war
&gt; wounds because you put my mind at ease, even if it was, say, broken,
&gt; at least I'd trust you and know! lol!)

&gt;&gt; Just to let you know that I am feeling significantly better today. I have
&gt;&gt; been able to eat without my RHS face ballooning up, although the
&gt;&gt; inflammation has spread down my neck. Either the stone(s) has shifted and
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; no longer blocking the duct or it has been expelled. They are usually
&gt;&gt; less
&gt;&gt; than a couple of millimetres in size. However, the residual inflammation
&gt;&gt; might indicate that I now have infection in the gland and/or an abscess.
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; have an appointment with the ENT doc. tomorrow afternoon and I reckon
&gt;&gt; that I
&gt;&gt; will last out until then. Yesterday I was convinced that I would be ready
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; be packed in a box today, but I have a vivid imagination - fueled by the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I woke up this morning feeling as rough as ever (but we will gloss

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, it looks as though I have a stone(s) in the most likely in the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; parotid gland (see internet link above), but I am not without
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; considerable
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain when I eat and for an hour or so afterwards. A coldpack is

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It was amongst the fastest diagnoses I have ever received. (In march

Ah I thought as much. I better get it x-rayed then just to be sure. I
don't think I'll go to my usual hospital though because they're
rubbish in emergency. My Mum really hurt her ankle once, she was
stepping of a style and slipped and her ankle went and we all heard a
snap. It swelled up bad. So I took her to emergency and they just felt
it and said it was sprained and didn't even do an x-ray to make sure.
It could have been broken. You'd think they'd x-ray just to cover
themselves at least! So, I get along to emergency when I can. I wish I
would have gone in Scotland because that's when it looked really
nasty. The bruising is going away nicely now and doesn't look horrid
anymore. But the lump is still there, and I still can't touch it. I
can't even dry my arm with the towel after a shower!

No it wasn't my upper arm, it's the outer side of my left forearm.
Where you use to block a punch in martial arts lol! So, even still,
not near a joint. It's about 3 inches up from my wrist.

Anyway, thanks for your advice. I just didn't want to be one of those
people that go along to emergency and waste their time and budget, and
take away time from really serious cases. It irritates me, those
people who go in because they've stubbed their toe or something lol!
In fact, not so long ago (I'm accident prone) I stubbed my toe so bad
that I think I broke it. It was my little toe. I took the nail off
too. I was at my desk (bare feet) and sneezed, and as I sneezed my
foot kicked out and whammed into the leg of my desk, bending the toe
outwards. It blew up nice and purple!

&gt; Ugh, that sounds nasty. From what you describe it sounds as though you have
&gt; chipped the bone and damaged the surrounding muscle. That would potentially
&gt; explain the painful lump. You might also find that you have a hairline
&gt; fracture (either complete or partial - probably partial). It really does
&gt; sound as though you need it X-rayed. Small chips of bone or anything can
&gt; migrate around the body and potentially cause further problems. They might
&gt; have to clean it up or they might leave it alone depending on how the bone
&gt; damage looks. They can't do much with a hairline fracture if you do have
&gt; one. I know that it will be a pain dealing with the doctors again, but if
&gt; the damage is not repaired properly at this stage it will cause you problems
&gt; down the road - whether it is 10 years from now or 30 or 40. Just remember
&gt; that bone damage heals within a matter of weeks, whereas muscle damage can
&gt; take months if not years in the worst case scenario. I am assuming that it
&gt; was in the middle of your upper arm and not at the joints so there will be
&gt; no or minimal ligament damage.

&gt; It might also be a good time to have your bones checked for osteoporosis and
&gt; your spine checked - if you visit the orthopaedist.

&gt; I don't have to tell you that I am not a doctor and the above is just an
&gt; educated guess ;-)

Doctors are good at 'diagnosing' problems.
(and coming up with new names for them)

But they SUCK at finding the root cause.
(or prefer not to, b/c it's not as profitable)

Have these 'doctors' ever tried to find an

Have they checked for an amino-acid or

Or even a pH and/or mineral imbalance?

I was talking to my dentist this week and asked about this  (I have
gotten alot of oral/esophagael manifestation of my UC in my salivary
glands in the past, and he was the only doctor who picked up on it and
forced my GI to look at the connection).  He thought that crohns might
be the cause for such a stone or at least increase the risk for
someone with generalized compromised health or smouldering crohns.
Just fyi.
Hope you are feeling better

With respect to salivary gland stone(s) anything and everything you eat will
cause pain and inflammation of the gland because the saliva produced in the
salivary gland cannot exit due to the stone blocking the duct. This subsides
after eating as the saliva gets slowly reabsorbed.

There are foods such as citrus, which superstimulate saliva production,
which I can't eat because of my GERD.
