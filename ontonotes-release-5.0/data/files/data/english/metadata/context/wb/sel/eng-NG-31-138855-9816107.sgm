Hi SB Surf Grls - I just got a surfboard for Xmas so I'm super
stoked.  Total rookie, don't know how to surf but ready to find out.
Found you on the internet and am very excited about it.  I live in SB
(on the Mesa).  I was wondering if anyone had any advice or comments
about which surf schools or instructors they would recommend or which
ones they may like better than others.  Any input would be really
appreciated!  Thanks and look forward to surfing with you all!  Robin

Hi Robin!
Welcome new Surfgrl!  A lot of the girls have had lessons from Rob at A
Frame in Carpinteria and loved it.  I'm out here in Goleta and really like
Doug at Surf Country.
There's a group of us who surf Campus Point on Tuesday/Thursday mornings.
Don't know what your schedule is like, but you're more than welcome to come
on out with us anytime!
What kind of board did you get?  Lucky girl!

Kathy

Hi Robin!

I am glad you found us!  I took a lesson with Rob at A-Frame and liked
it a lot and I also had one with Greg from Santa Barbara Surf School.  I
liked them both a lot.  One thing that Rob said after the lesson was
that I didn't need any more lessons for a while, I just needed to keep
getting out there, and I think that is one of the best pieces of advice
I ever got for surfing.

There is some info on local beginner beaches listed here:
http://www.sbsurfgrls.com/pages/beaches.php

If you live on the Mesa you are pretty close to Leadbetter, but also not
too far from Campus Point/Poles!  And you should definitely check out
Mondos, down south.  I think Poles and Mondos are my favorites.

Rob... hubba hubba.. hubba... Too bad he's married. haha.

He's cool and once you take a lesson with him, he's your bud for life. He'll give you discounts on stuff and surf tips well after the lesson.

Welcome all newbies!

Wow that's so great!  Thank you so much for the hot tips!  You girls
are making me laugh already!  Thanks for welcoming me, I'm gonna get
some lessons under my belt and hopefully see you out there real soon!
I work M-F 8:30-5:00 so I may not be able to make Tue-Thurs but I will
make other days.  I just got a Doyle soft top long board - total
beginner board but i'm hoping to move up and off that thing quick!

I work 8-5pm too.  When the days were longer I was hopping over to
Campus Point after work and that seemed to work well, but right now I am
just trying to get in a Sat or Sun session.  Tomorrow I'd like to go out
to Campus Point in the morning around 8-ish.  I hear there are waves
right now!

And last Sunday I got some of the best waves of my surfing life at
Poles.  There was one wave that I paddled really hard for but at the end
stopped because I didn't think I had it, and then, a voice in my head
said &quot;Just stand up, just stand up!&quot;  so I stood up and got to go down
the face of a pretty decent sized wave and I didn't wipe out at the
bottom!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!  That was FUN!   I am still trying to stick to
my New Year's resolution of being happy with whatever progress I make,
but it's really, really hard not to want more rides like that one!
