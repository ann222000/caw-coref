Breastfeeding My Baby, Where Do I Start?
Copyright Â© 2006 Melida Cohen
Author of &quot;Baby's First Year: Everything You Should Know but Probably Don't&quot;
http://www.careformybaby.com/

Congratulations you have a new baby! Having a new baby is hard
enough but when you choose to breastfeed you sometimes feel as
though you made this experience even harder. Breastfeeding is not
as difficult as it looks or as you may have heard from others. It
is actually pretty easy and a very fulfilling way to nourish your
newborn once you get the hang of it. Remember as with most things
practice makes perfect! Breastfeeding is new to you and to your
little one but with a little practice you two will become pros
in no time!

During the first week of your baby's life, your breasts will
produce colostrum for your baby to drink. Colostrum is rich in
antibodies and aids the baby's immune system. It also helps him
pass his first bowel movement, which is called meconium. Meconium
is black and tarry looking and is in the first few diapers after
birth. Then he begins to transition to a brown substance and
after your milk comes in, it becomes a yellow, mustardy stool
that is loose and watery. Bottle-fed babies pass firmer, tannish
stools than breastfed babies.

After 24-48 hours after birth, your baby will start having wet
diapers that will increase to two or three a day.

Your technique and positioning is a very important factor in
ensuring that your breastfeeding experience is a great one.
There are a few different positions that can be used to make
the experience more comfortable for you and baby. Some of these
positions include:

* Laying down - Lay down on you side with pillows behind you
to support your back. Lay baby facing you with her head on
a pillow your breast should be level with baby's mouth.
Bend your legs with a pillow between your knees and then
have baby latch on.

* Sitting Up - Sit up either in bed or a comfortable chair
or couch with pillows supporting your back and head. Place
a pillow on your lap and put baby on top of the pillow in
your arms, you can rest your arms on the pillow to make it
easier to bring baby up to your breast. Bend your knees to
make this even easier have baby latch on.

* The Clutch Hold - This is also known as the football hold.
This position is also good when nursing twins as it allows
mom to have a baby on each side. Sit down and tuck your
baby under your arm almost like a handbag. Rest baby's
head on a firm pillow on your lap. Ensure that baby's feet
are behind your back. Your hand is at the back of baby's
neck, not on baby's head. Your arm will extend down baby's
back, guide baby to latch on.

These are just a few of the positions that you can use there is
also the cradle hold, clutch hold, and the transition position.
Do some research to learn these other positions to nurse your
baby if you find the above positions uncomfortable.

While your baby drinks colostrum and then milk, you should listen
for a pattern of &quot;suck, suck, suck, swallow.&quot; This pattern will
be rhythmic and there should be no &quot;clicking&quot; noises. The
&quot;clicking&quot; sound can indicate that your baby is not properly
latched on and may not be getting enough milk from you. If you
start to hear this, you need to unlatch him and then reattach
him. If you continue to hear this sound after reattaching him
several times, then you may want to consult a lactation
consultant or your pediatrician.

After the first week of life, you should see 6-8 wet diapers each
day and at least 3 bowel movements a day. His urine should be
clear and he should become more alert with each passing day. Your
baby should also be gaining weight and growing, as this is the
surest way to tell that they are getting enough nutrition. If you
have two days in a row that deviates from the above indicators,
then you should call your pediatrician immediately.

Breastfeeding problems, such as milk production difficulties,
are not as common when using the PDF feeding method, but they do
occur. Even if you are well rested, eating healthy, have a pretty
routine life, and your baby is growing and getting enough food,
you still may experience a milk production issue. Many things can
cause production problems. Here are just a few.

Some things that can affect your milk supply are:

* What mom eats
* How much mom rests and sleeps
* Her state of mind
* The age of the mom
* How many children you have
* Your desire to breastfeed
* Your nursing capabilities
* Your nursing techniques
* Baby's latch on abilities

If you choose to breastfeed, it is very important that you take
your baby for their check-ups as needed. If you don't, how will
you know if he is getting enough milk and growing at the correct
rate? There is no way for you to tell that your child is getting
enough nutrition for sure without your child being weighed.
