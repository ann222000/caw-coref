a friend and i were at a yard sale in june and we came across an old
parchment document in a generic '60's frame. we paid the old gentleman
twice his ten dollar asking price and, after bringing it home and
unframing, found a deed dated 1781 ceding mackinac island
[michilimakinak] from the ojibwe to the british government.

http://home.pacbell.net/pwrbus/deed.gif
http://home.pacbell.net/pwrbus/more-marks-and-signatures.gif
http://home.pacbell.net/pwrbus/more-signers.gif
http://home.pacbell.net/pwrbus/deed-back.gif

it had been trimmed right to the edges of the ink and folded over at the
bottom to fit into the 11 x 14 inch frame, but at some point it had been
folded in half and again in thirds and probably kept in an envelope
which left its mark on the parchment.

researching online i did find one copy, made in 1794, at the michigan
state museum site.

http://www.mackinacparks.com/parks/deed-to-mackinac-island_566/

i emailed the museum's research dept. and asked about the deed, but i've
received no reply as of yet. so i was wondering, how do i go about
authenticating this?  i am most intrigued by the black smears next to
the totem marks...could they be thumbprints?  and, if it is one of the
two originals, how did it end up in a yard sale in california?  i've had
more than 20 dollars worth of entertainment from it already [i'm easily
amused].

Back in the 1950s, parchment copies of various deeds, the Declaration of
Independence, etc, were popular tourist and marketing items.

Yes, those would be representational thumbprints.   What makes me think
yours is a copy, is that the handwriting, signatures and fingerprints are
all dark black, the same color.   Like it's printed.

Notice the 1796 copy you found, where the writing flows over the  crease
book, parts are faded (especially the fingerprints) and the paper is foxed.

Of course, not having copiers around in those days, someone had to write out
the copies....but each one would be certified.     But by now, the inks
would have started to degrade right through the paper.    (That's why Mark
Hofmann's copies were so good....little details like ink making holes in
paper, etc)   Yours is very clean on the back.

You might as about this on rec.collecting.books -- they may know a source
for info on it.

Ah, Rhi, me too; being easily amused is a gift from God.

In theory, this should be pretty easy. Is it period paper or new paper
made to look like parchment?

thanx t. and kris.  i guess the question to ask now is whether any
copies of this particular deed were made and sold.  my friend, who has
been studying calligraphy for over 25 years, is convinced that it's hand
inked but that could be wishful thinking.  anyway, the search is the fun.

Oh, definitely!

You could always email these people, and ask if they know
anyone who could authenticate the document for you:

If it were parchment it wouldn't be that brittle, rag based papers can
remain in good condition for hundreds of years.
Modern acid wood pulp papers fall apart and become brittle in less than
50 years.

Depends on the manufacturing process.

If they get the chemical balance right the stuff is as durable as the rag
based stuff.

For cheap books they don't bother.

Which is why old paperbacks fall to bits.

For more expensive books,  and especially the sort of reference books bought
by large libraries,  they do.

If you look at the publication details for a modern book of high quality
prints you'll find that the paper used is usually defined in some detail.

In terms of &quot;modern&quot; I'm referring to wood pulp paper made prior to the
introduction of acid free paper, which this
piece is most likely made of.

Much of today's stuff is acid free, this because they now use chalk as
the main filler material in the pulp
chalk reacts with acids and neutralizes it.

Archival paper ( ISO9706 ) is used for legal, Art, or historical
documents. Some books are published using it ,
but not very many.

I thought that parchment was the skin of a goat or sheep. Are you
including imitation parchment under that heading? (Anything made from
plant fiber would be imitation.) When is parchment parchment?

no, i meant animal skin parchment. it's the one thing that my friend is
quite sure of.  he said the ink seems to be an india ink, as opposed to
a gall-based ink, which wouldn't be as destructive to the medium. he is
concerned about the [good] condition, though, and was wondering if
repros are sometimes printed on real parchment?  anyway, i'll keep you
posted as we find any more info and, now that i finally have a camera
again, i'll be posting more often.
