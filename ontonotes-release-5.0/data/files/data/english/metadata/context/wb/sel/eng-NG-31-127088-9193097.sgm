Hi,

A new question for a new situation.  My 30-year wonderful marriage to
a wonderful
man has been abruptly gone haywire.  My husband swears that he is
devoted and
loves me dearly, but as of five years ago, he worked daily with what
he calls his *soulmate*,
*the most beautiful woman in the world*, and *his very best friend*.
On my last birthday
he slept in the same apartment with her (not ours), and this coming
Christmas holidays
he is leaving to travel 3,000 miles to see her (and her husband),
dumping me with my
children alone.  Since that collaboration with her, he has ignored me,
criticized and
become a completely different person.  To his credit, he has dropped
all his medication
for the serious Major Clinical Depression (because she told him to)
and this has
been the ONLY major bone of contention between us-- that he should
take his meds
as his dr. has advised, and as he has tried to commit suicide without
them.

He wants me to believe that this is just a friend, and told my doctor
I was schizophrenic
and needed new drugs.  He says I am delusionally jealous. Maybe he's
trying to put me in mental hospital.  I am fine,
just pissed an heart-broken.  I have recommended a separation until he
gets
his head straight, and my doctor agrees that is a good idea.

So, here is the question: What is the problem, completely withdrawing
from
antidepressants and losing 80 pounds, and his mind, or &quot;true love&quot;?
Maybe
both?  I have not idea what direction this is going to take, or WHY
the doctor
allowed this, for heaven's sake.

Thanks for reading.  The withdrawal took a year, and he is just
getting
worse.  I am heart-broken.  But I will not allow this ****** to take a
place
in my house, physically on the daily-basis e-mails they have.

Thanks

Answer:  The person you describe is not a wonderful person
who is devoted and loves you, but rather a self-indulgent clod.
You have decision to make:  Do you live this, 'cuz /this/ is your
future, or do you see a divorce lawyer? The ball is in your court.

Erin,

I know where you're coming from.  If you've done any lurking, you may
have read that my husband has similar medical issues.  I've gotten to
the point where the meds issue may very well be the &quot;deal breaker.&quot;

You *can't* live your life with the unpredictability that comes with
someone with a serious illness refusing to care for himself and to
manage his illness.  Either he manages it, or ...

Thanks Rog and Kitten,

I will wait for a year, in case this is a matter of hypomania and
withdrawal-induced depression; i know how these ADs can affect
behaviour.  This is a tough test to put me through though, and i
blame the doctor and therapist who do not have the good sense
to give a referral to a psychiatrist.  Surely, they must know of the
effects of hard core medications.

I appreciate the feedback.  I read some of your post Kitten; i will
read more.

Subject: Words For Today - Oct. 30, 2007

We all have difficulties.  I could list specific difficulties I know
about for pretty much every person who posts to this group (other than
having &lt;snipped&gt;, that is.)  I've had several of my own lately.
Specifically, I've had a seizure (or two) every evening for the past
five days.  It's getting tiring and difficult to handle.

The Word for Today is Difficulties.

------------------------------------

&quot;When we are working at a difficult task and strive after a good
thing, we are fighting a righteous battle, the direct reward of which
is that we are kept from much evil. As we advance in life it becomes
more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost
strength of the heart is developed. Indeed life is a have to defend
and protect ourselves, and with a cheerful and brace spirit we must
battle; we plan and calculate in order to make progress.&quot;

- Vincent van Gogh

-----------------------------------

&quot;It is surmounting difficulties that makes heroes.&quot;

- Louis Pasteur

-----------------------------------

&quot;Every great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution. It
forces us to change our thinking in order to find it.&quot;

- Niels Bohr

-----------------------------------

&quot;Give yourself an even greater challenge than the one you are trying
to master and you will develop the powers necessary to overcome the
original difficulty.&quot;

- William Bennett

-----------------------------------

&quot;To endure is greater than to dare; to tire out hostile fortune; to be
daunted by no difficulty; to keep heart when all have lost it; to go
through intrigue spotless; to forego even ambition when the end is
gained - who can say this is not greatness?&quot;

- William Makepeace Thackeray

----------------------------------

&quot;Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which
difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air.&quot;

- John Quincy Adams

----------------------------------

&quot;Real life isn't always going to be perfect or go our way, but the
recurring acknowledgement of what is working in our lives can help us
not only to survive but surmount our difficulties.&quot;

- Sarah Ban Breathnach

Thanks Caitriona and Jane-- the quotes are
inspiring; they do fall a bit flat when you don't know
the real cause of a catastrophe, but i guess patience
should be added to courage.  I'll do my best, but
i am tired of all these challenges, and due to ignorance
of the situation, i fear that worse ones may come.
Still, i *know* that the majority of the planet has it
worse.

I don't think you can diagnose what the problem is, and it doesn't

Presumably your husband makes his own decisions.  The doctor doesn't
need to allow it - if your husband decides to stop taking his
medication, he can.

It sounds to me like your husband is checking out of your marriage.
If that is _really_ what he wants, you can't stop him.  Your choices
are relatively few here, but there are two things you could do:

- offer him the choice of going to joint counseling with you if he has
any interest in working with you to repair your marriage.

- I don't know to what extent you do things for him, or help him with
the rest of life, etc., but don't let him &quot;have his cake and eat it
too.&quot;  That is, make it clear that unless he is willing to recommit
to your marriage, you don't want him around and don't want to be
doing things for him.

The goal of this second thing isn't to punish - it is to try to make
sure he understands the consequences for him of refusing to commit to
his marriage.

He went to a therapist and the therapist said after a year, that
(in his words) if i don't stop being jealous, there is no chance
for the marriage.  Seems to me, that have reason to be jealous and
to worry; furthermore my doctor thinks it's a good idea to separate
for a year after private conversations.  These private conversations
are
driving me nuts.  I speak only to him, so i don't know any other

Well, that is what i have done.  He has pleaded for a year after
he gets through this medical experiment.  He and his soulmate
are co-therapists and he wants to prove to me/himself that he
does not need any drugs; this after multiple suicide attempts and
his doctor's advice against being on heavy ADs or else.

I think he knows. But he really wants me to wait.  So i told him
i would.  But i do think he is very confused due to not taking
a very hard AD for a very hard depression.  We are very
compatible, but there is one issue on which all fights have
rested, medication for mental illness.  He is anti-psychiatry
and i am very pro-medication, especially when I witnessed the
results.

I hope his doctor plays a strong role.

Thanks for your advice.  It lets me know how others
respond to such a situation.  I think many people do
not take necessary medications because they are
the wrong ones, wrong dose, or wrong diagnosis.

But, i will wait a year as he has asked, in case a miracle
comes up.  Looks like his doctor believes in them.

Right.  And you shouldn't do it.  As I said before, your husband wants
to have his cake (pursue his affair) and eat it too (retain the

I'm suggesting you go to couples counseling.  And that you consider
making that a condition to having anything further to do with your
husband.

What your husband tells your therapist, and what your husband tells

You aren't getting what you need out of this marriage.  That is true
regardless of the medication issue.

I wouldn't make this about the medication.  I would make this about
what you want out of the relationship.  If he can give you that
without medication, great.  If he can give you that with medication,
also great.

If he can't give you that (with or without medication) then there is a
problem, and _that_ is the problem you should be identifying.

-------------
Yes, because of the law of confidentiality between dr. and patient.
Waiting for a year is not a significant matter, anyway, because
where we live the law allows for immediate divorce after that term.
But, not being a mean man, he wants to leave it at formal separation
so that i can benefit from the standard of living i need.

I'm willing to wait -- as you say -- med or not, the marriage is
tough, but it has always been tough because of mental illness;
it just became tougher now because of a really secret situation,
which has not been entirely revealed.    We have gone through
hard time through love and effort.  This is new.

Maybe, after a year it will be revealed, or a formal separation will
take place,
and i hope his health will not decline to a suicidal level; nor mine
for that matter :-).

Neither of us can cope with this kind of stress level for long,
especially as i am bipolar.  The informal separation is a good
idea.   When the time comes and things are clearer and he
is not half-crazy, that is the time to see a counsellor.  And i
thank you for the advice.  Now, he is practically half-dead from
mania and stress being off the meds.  Not ready for being pushed
off the cliff.

Did you say that *you* are in counseling? If not, get there pronto. You are

Sigh.... he seems so devoted and sincere; he says he loves me
and always will.  Everybody thinks he's the cat's pajamas.  This
is a very abrupt change of personality-- nobody recognizes him
anymore.  That's why i think it's meds.  Withdrawal after 27 yrs.
on a serious AD can do a lot of damage.  He also had a head
injury for which only his spine was examined.  This withdrawal
has been going on for 5 yrs.  I think it's the doctor's responsibility
to check into this change of mood, sleep, massive weight and
muscle loss, grey skin, memory problems, and inability to think
straight.  I mean the guy looks sick to me, why not to the
doctor?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hi,

&gt; A new question for a new situation.  My 30-year wonderful marriage
&gt; to
&gt; a wonderful
&gt; man has been abruptly gone haywire.  My husband swears that he is
&gt; devoted and
&gt; loves me dearly, but as of five years ago, he worked daily with what
&gt; he calls his *soulmate*,
&gt; *the most beautiful woman in the world*, and *his very best friend*.
&gt; On my last birthday
&gt; he slept in the same apartment with her (not ours), and this coming
&gt; Christmas holidays
&gt; he is leaving to travel 3,000 miles to see her (and her husband),
&gt; dumping me with my
&gt; children alone.  Since that collaboration with her, he has ignored
&gt; me,
&gt; criticized and
&gt; become a completely different person.  To his credit, he has dropped
&gt; all his medication
&gt; for the serious Major Clinical Depression (because she told him to)
&gt; and this has
&gt; been the ONLY major bone of contention between us-- that he should
&gt; take his meds
&gt; as his dr. has advised, and as he has tried to commit suicide
&gt; without
&gt; them.

&gt; He wants me to believe that this is just a friend, and told my
&gt; doctor
&gt; I was schizophrenic
&gt; and needed new drugs.  He says I am delusionally jealous. Maybe he's
&gt; trying to put me in mental hospital.  I am fine,
&gt; just pissed an heart-broken.  I have recommended a separation until
&gt; he
&gt; gets
&gt; his head straight, and my doctor agrees that is a good idea.

&gt; So, here is the question: What is the problem, completely
&gt; withdrawing
&gt; from
&gt; antidepressants and losing 80 pounds, and his mind, or &quot;true love&quot;?
&gt; Maybe
&gt; both?  I have not idea what direction this is going to take, or WHY
&gt; the doctor
&gt; allowed this, for heaven's sake.

&gt; Thanks for reading.  The withdrawal took a year, and he is just
&gt; getting
&gt; worse.  I am heart-broken.  But I will not allow this ****** to take
&gt; a
&gt; place
&gt; in my house, physically on the daily-basis e-mails they have.
">

You really do need to try to put some order and clarity to your
perceptions of what's going on.  For instance....

You say that he's a wonderful man, and then you talk about how he
sleeps with another woman, and &quot;dumps&quot; you to go see her.  Does that
strike you as wonderful?

You say that your wonderful relationship has gone &quot;abruptly&quot; haywire,
but that the problem has its roots with something that began five
years ago.  Does that mean it went abruptly haywire five years ago, or
that it's only gone haywire recently?

Does it make any sense to you that he'd call another woman his
*soulmate*, *the most beautiful woman in the world*, and *his very
best friend*.  You used asterisks instead of quotes, so does that mean
he's said that about her, or that you believe that's how he feels
about her?

How can you possibly believe that guy is wonderful, much less that you
even have any marriage to him if he slept in her apartment on your
birthday?

How can you believe that he's in any way committed to his family when
he's going to spend the holidays with another woman?  And what makes
you think her husband will even be there?

How is dropping his meds to his credit, and yet, you argue that he
should be taking them?

I could go on, but I hope you get the point.  IF he's really said and
done all of these things, I'm not sure you have a marriage left to
save.

I think you need to give serious thought to why a doctor, with all of
his/her training, and what I assume is full access to his medical
files, doesn't think your DH is sick, and yet, it seems to obvious to
you.  There are two possibilities, IMO.  Either the doctor's
perspective is correct, or yours is correct.

I still think you're giving him a (almost free) pass.   (One that he doesn't
deserve).

But with all the years you've had together, I guess it's not surprising -
because it's damn hard to let go - especially with SO many years together (I
know).

You cant know whether or not his doc thinks he looks sick. Your DH is in
fantasy land or something. He is not thinking right. But does that mean you
allow him to throw away all these years?

Have you discussed this dillema with your therapist? I seem to recall that
he suggested a separation. My concern is not for your H (sorry I have a hard
time calling even mentally ill wanderers &quot;dear&quot;) since he is not posting. It
is for you. Do not become a casualty, please. No matter what else you do,
keep seeing your therapist.

I wish you well. Sounds like a world class sucky situation.

I think so.  Though the drugs were both for schizophrenia and bipolar
(anti-psychotics--
which btw, are not to be mixed with lithium in case of serotonin
syndrome), and
more tranqs.  The dr. did ask, is this the worst thing happening in
your life?
Actually, no, but it is confusing.   The reason i think DH told my dr.
is because
in a rage (mania?) he was grimacing at me telling me i am not bipolar,
there is no such
thing as mental illness, and the reason his life is crap is because i
believe
in psychiatry.
He said, I am probably schizophrenic (contradiction).  So, i don't
really know why
the dr. gave me those pills, but the dr.  did not make a fuss when i
told him
i could do without them in a consequent meeting.  It may be
misunderstanding.

Anyway, I do go out, i do all the house management, i just finished
two huge
house projects, finished a university course.  I have some gastro
problems
from the lithium that keeps inside at different times during the day,
and i do
like to read a lot.  But i am not anti-social.  My illness has made me
shy,
because I am not as young and pretty and healthy as I used to be.  But
I adapt.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I could go on, but I hope you get the point.  IF he's really said and

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Have you ever gone with him to a dr's appt, to ask the dr about your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; concerns?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kitten

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, the last time we were at the dr.'s, he told him that he
&gt;&gt; &gt; suspected i was schizophrenic, did not go outside and
&gt;&gt; &gt; was hard to live with anymore (this is presumptous on my
&gt;&gt; &gt; part).  So, the dr. tried to give me drugs on top of my present
&gt;&gt; &gt; heavy load that were for schizophrenics -- how confidential
&gt;&gt; &gt; is that?  I did not take them.

&gt;&gt; Wait his doc tried to give you meds for schizophrenia after one combined
&gt;&gt; visit and your husband's word?

&gt; I think so.  Though the drugs were both for schizophrenia and bipolar
&gt; (anti-psychotics--
&gt; which btw, are not to be mixed with lithium in case of serotonin
&gt; syndrome), and
&gt; more tranqs.  The dr. did ask, is this the worst thing happening in
&gt; your life?
&gt; Actually, no, but it is confusing.   The reason i think DH told my dr.
&gt; is because
&gt; in a rage (mania?) he was grimacing at me telling me i am not bipolar,
&gt; there is no such
&gt; thing as mental illness, and the reason his life is crap is because i
&gt; believe
&gt; in psychiatry.
&gt; He said, I am probably schizophrenic (contradiction).  So, i don't
&gt; really know why
&gt; the dr. gave me those pills, but the dr.  did not make a fuss when i
&gt; told him
&gt; i could do without them in a consequent meeting.  It may be

I am confused. He gave you meds. Your husband's doc gave you meds. But you

One year-- more or less.  That will give time for the meds to show
something,
and it will be legally easy to separate formally or get a divorce.  I
am doing
this because I love him and wish to give him the benefit of the doubt.
If it turns out that without medications he is fine and considers
himself

I am giving him a chance to redeem himself, because this is a very
long

mania and depression.

I may be wrong.  So there's a limit and a condition of monogamy.

Folks, I appreciate your feedback -- how different it is from his.
That tells me quite a bit.

I'm getting pretty confused, just reading your thread.  I believe
Stephanie (and maybe Kitten) asked you whether you ever went
with him to HIS doctor, not whether he went with you to your
doctor.

You had gone into your husband's gray skin and possible head injury, and
were asked, &quot;So did you tell *his* doctor about your
perceptions.&quot;  Did you?  If you didn't go with your husband to his
last regular medical appointment (psychiatric or otherwise), you should
have, and you could always call his doctor's office and give information -
just don't expect to be given any, in return, without husband's permission.

And am I really confused or did you say that your husband's female
confidante is his co-therapist?  What does that mean?  That he has a
relationship with someone who is a therapist of his, or that he too is a
therapist or what?

Did I totally misread?

I know there's a lot to summarize, but to attribute 3-5 years of symptoms to
AD withdrawal is a bit of a stretch, really.  Many people go off them with
few or no side effects, as the brain is often more stable after years on the
drugs.

I think you're trying to avoid the rather obvious fact that your husband is
seeing someone else and plans to continue doing so, while insisting that you
have a problem.

What does your therapist say?  Or are you managing your own bipolar illness
without therapy?  And is your husband bipolar or merely unipolar?

Bipolars take anti-psychotics and lithium together quite frequently (not
that you need to, just saying).  At least the ones I know do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thank you for your patience Allyou!

&gt;&gt; You really do need to try to put some order and clarity to your
&gt;&gt; perceptions of what's going on.  For instance....

&gt;&gt; You say that he's a wonderful man, and then you talk about how he
&gt;&gt; sleeps with another woman, and &quot;dumps&quot; you to go see her.  Does that
&gt;&gt; strike you as wonderful?

&gt; He says she is a very special friend and so is her husband.  They
&gt; worked
&gt; side by side for 5 years; i think he hired her and yes it was because
&gt; of
&gt; her looks, age, and potential.  He said so to me.  I was jealous.  He
&gt; also
&gt; complained to her about me, but that was stress and he was lonely and
&gt; wanted to talk to her .  She complained about her husband, but he
&gt; brought
&gt; them together again, he said.

&gt;&gt; You say that your wonderful relationship has gone &quot;abruptly&quot; haywire,
&gt;&gt; but that the problem has its roots with something that began five
&gt;&gt; years ago.  Does that mean it went abruptly haywire five years ago, or
&gt;&gt; that it's only gone haywire recently?

&gt; He was strange for 5 yrs., and irritable, but it exploded into a war
&gt; when
&gt; i saw the e-mails, and the connection with absenteesm from home,
&gt; complaints against me (never before) constant rose bringing, etc.

&gt;&gt; Does it make any sense to you that he'd call another woman his
&gt;&gt; *soulmate*, *the most beautiful woman in the world*, and *his very
&gt;&gt; best friend*.  You used asterisks instead of quotes, so does that mean
&gt;&gt; he's said that about her, or that you believe that's how he feels
&gt;&gt; about her?

&gt; He used those words.  I was shocked.  It is not like him to even try
&gt; to hurt me-- that is why i think he is sick.

&gt;&gt; How can you possibly believe that guy is wonderful, much less that you
&gt;&gt; even have any marriage to him if he slept in her apartment on your
&gt;&gt; birthday?

&gt; He said he did not sleep with her; she came with her husband, and he
&gt; left, but did take me out when i reminded him it was my birthday - the
&gt; a.m.
&gt; she left.  He has never acted like this before.  It is not like him.
&gt; But he

You had a pretty hard time being specific in response to AY's questions,
which were good ones.

People don't withdraw from mania or depression, they withdraw from
medications.  Has been off his meds for five years?

Has he been &quot;sick&quot; for five years?  It sounds like you only recently
connected the dots about this other woman.  How long has he known her?  (Be
specific).  He hired her, right (as a co-therapist?)  When was that?

Why would you think she's pregnant?  You tend to digress quite a bit in
answering straightforward questions.  I think it would help you face what's
going on if you do construct a timeline and then discuss it with him.

I take it that your husband is still working (with this woman?)  Are you at
home most of the time?

Yeah, well, I'm not so sure, either.      But I think there are peaks in the
divorce rate both right after getting married (the short term marriages),
and the late term marriages (after the kids are grown up, and out of the
house, and ... there you are - just the two of you, and often with some
unresolved issues that have accrued over all those years, and some pent up
resentments, sad to say).

In my opinion the doctor is risking a lot -- the percentage of
suicide in tricyclic discontinuation, within 18 months is something
like 75% in males -- i researched PubMed on this -- can't recall
the exact articles.  This has worried me a lot, and i must say
i expressed my anger at whatsherface interfering with the sweating
exercises to get out the toxins.  But, to my amazement my husband
started a motion to hit me and stopped -- very unlike him.  I wondered
is he in a cult?  Or just in love?  If he wins by discontinuation and
the problem has been me all the time, then i will be glad if he finds
happiness with the menage a trois.

If that is really what will happen, then i have had the privilege of
being intimate with one of the greatest psychopaths on the planet,
for it would take exceptional talent in such  dissimulation of
passion,
devotion, and romance.

Alternatively, he really is not well because of depression and
withdrawal.  Only the future will tell.

Well, we are not together, and that is a good thing.
Nothing to suggest - just one of those car crashes
of life.  Thanks for your support.  Really, i am rather
isolated in this as there is all this secrecy on his part
and confidentiality and fear from others.  It's a hot
one. :-)

p.s. you mentioned other issues -- yes a lot of them,
but nothing in comparison to other marital problems;
mostly when he was on his med, we were happy, though
not exciting; but when you have two people trying to
keep a balance under medical challenges/blunders, deaths,
jobs, just trying to be normal, i'd say it was pretty
exceptional.

IMHO, the doctors did not do enough.  Not enough time
and the province is short of staff.  More of that to come
i fear.

&gt; wanted to talk to her .  She complained about her husband, but he
&gt; brought
&gt; them together again, he said.

I'm afraid that you have a definition of wonderful that is hugely
different than mine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You say that your wonderful relationship has gone &quot;abruptly&quot;
&gt;&gt; haywire,
&gt;&gt; but that the problem has its roots with something that began five
&gt;&gt; years ago.  Does that mean it went abruptly haywire five years ago,
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; that it's only gone haywire recently?

&gt; He was strange for 5 yrs., and irritable, but it exploded into a war
&gt; when
&gt; i saw the e-mails, and the connection with absenteesm from home,
&gt; complaints against me (never before) constant rose bringing, etc.
">

So that's an example of what I mean by clarity.  This hasn't gone
haywire *abruptly*.  It's only that you've found out more of the truth
about what's going on abruptly.  That's entirely different.  It's not
that he's changed abruptly at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Does it make any sense to you that he'd call another woman his
&gt;&gt; *soulmate*, *the most beautiful woman in the world*, and *his very
&gt;&gt; best friend*.  You used asterisks instead of quotes, so does that
&gt;&gt; mean
&gt;&gt; he's said that about her, or that you believe that's how he feels
&gt;&gt; about her?

&gt; He used those words.  I was shocked.  It is not like him to even try
&gt; to hurt me-- that is why i think he is sick.
">

But doctors have check him out, and they say that he's not sick.
Sometimes, and I'm not sure this isn't one of them, that people claim
that must be something physically or mentally wrong because someone
they know would never do what they do.  In too many cases, that's a
self-fulfilling prophesy.  They simply will not accept the evidence
that's right in front of their eyes, and so they search for some other
explanation for what they see.  Even if there are a few emotional or
mental issues going on here, unless he's so unbalanced that he needs
immediate hospitalization, he should know better than to say and do
many of the things you described.  His condition, if he has one, may
explain is desire to do and say some things, but not to have so little
control as to actually do and say them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How can you possibly believe that guy is wonderful, much less that
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt; even have any marriage to him if he slept in her apartment on your
&gt;&gt; birthday?

&gt; He said he did not sleep with her; she came with her husband, and he
&gt; left, but did take me out when i reminded him it was my birthday -
&gt; the
&gt; a.m.
&gt; she left.  He has never acted like this before.  It is not like him.
&gt; But he
&gt; insists it is not what i think it is.  I admit it's strange.

IMHO, you need to admit much more than that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How can you believe that he's in any way committed to his family
&gt;&gt; when
&gt;&gt; he's going to spend the holidays with another woman?  And what
&gt;&gt; makes
&gt;&gt; you think her husband will even be there?

&gt; Don't know; maybe she's pregnant?  I don't know really, but how can
&gt; i know?
">

It's not for you to know what he's saying is a lie.  It's for him to
make sure that you know what he's saying is the truth if the situation
makes you uncomfortable.  It's for him to stop acting this way in the
first place.  You need to understand that he has a huge physical and
emotional attraction to her.  You know this is true because he's told
you this is true.  No married man should be spending any amount of
time with a women to whom he is so profoundly attracted.  It's not
right, it's not fair, and it's not complicated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How is dropping his meds to his credit, and yet, you argue that he
&gt;&gt; should be taking them?

&gt; That is out of context-- there is another phrase following, but i
&gt; forget.
&gt; Apparently, they both being soulmates and co-therapists, as he said,
&gt; she is helping him get off his meds, and giving lessons in exercise
&gt; instead.  Puke!  What a creep.  Here is something i don't
&gt; understand,
&gt; why do she interfere in this long marriage?  I would not do that.
">

I still don't understand how *you* can think it is to his credit that
he's not doing something that *you* think is very important that he
do.  It's just another example of where you need to spend much more
time thinking things through.  I think he knows that you have a little
bit of difficulty seeing things clearly, and that he's exploiting this
weakness in you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I could go on, but I hope you get the point.  IF he's really said
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; done all of these things, I'm not sure you have a marriage left to
&gt;&gt; save.

&gt; I want to hear it from him.  Because he insists that he loves me.
&gt; Until then, i blame the withdrawal-- mania and depression.

And he knows that you do, and so he's got a blank check.  Good luck.

Why would anyone ever lie?  People tend to lie when they have a whole
lot to gain by lying.  Although I want to stress that I'm not accusing
him of lying, his motive for lying, if he were to do so, would be to
have his cake and eat it too.  Lying would afford him all of the
advantages of having a wife and a family, and yet have all of the
advantages of having a mistress.  It allows him to have you waiting in
the wings as his security blanket, while being able to do whatever he
wants with the woman who is his &quot;soulmate&quot;, &quot;the most beautiful woman
in the world&quot;, and &quot;his very best friend&quot;.

That may be it. I guess i am very naive, but as i am
exluded from every source of information and observation,
i am mostly ignorant of first-hand evidence, except for
his pleading to trust him.

So, maybe if he goes and visits her and she drops her
husband, he will decide to ask me for a divorce, and then
i'll know.  I'm not asking for a divorce as it is not
in my interest.  A separation is better.

BTW, there are a lot of referenes, including warnings
from NAMI and the FDA that antipsychotics (and
the one i was prescribed to in particular) and
lithium-- increase the risk of SS.  Granted, my dr.
only prescribed for a month at a tiny dose, but i am
glad i did not take it and happier still, that he thought
well of my situation that i could do without.  I think
his intentions were well-meaning, predicting a real
breakdown after speaking with my DH.  I do think
that the choice was questionable and appropriate
to schizophrenics, though the marketing appeals
to bipolars, unipolars, schizophrenics, Attention
Deficit Disordered, premenstrual synrome, you name
it.  Typical sloppy psychopharmacology.  The FDA
tries to cutail this crap, but like the UN, they are
white elephants.  We have the same dr. ,

me to stop the suspicious nagging.  That would be no longer an affair
problem but a chronic hiding of true feelings, whether
due to psychopathology or just a passive-aggressive
personality, now finding an oportunity to escape.  That would
be devastating, but it may be the case.  Only his therapist

OK -- assuming i get used to it.  What I want out

Money, pratical support around the house, family

Regardless of whether he is having sex with his soulmate,  I think his
behavior as you describe is selfish, plain and simple.

I don't think you need to dignify it with terms like pathological or
passive-agressive.  Many men and women have had affairs (some sexual
and some not) which have damaged their marriages badly in the past,
and they aren't generally caused by personality disorders or mental
illness.

They're generally caused by some combination of desire, selfishness,
and dissatisfaction.

_If_ the two of you had a colloborative relationship (together!) with
a mental health professional, and if that professional had said openly
to both of you that your husband's erratic behavior was due to mental
illness, then I'd feel a little bit different.  But the situation you
describe sounds to me simply like your husband trying to justify
inappropriate behavior by whatever means he can come up with (calling
you schizophrenic being a particularly absurd example, and enlisting
_his_ doctor, who doesn't have a therapeutic relationship with you in
prescribing medications being a particularly nasty example - your
posts suggest that his doctor was complicit in that.  That seems
completely unethical on the part of his doctor, and makes that
doctor's judgement suspect in every way.)

Can you change the fact that the two of you _don't_ have a
colloborative relationship with a mental health professional?  I see
joint counseling as being the only likely path you have to either a
resolution, or to understanding what your husband is really up to, and
deciding you don't _want_ a resolution.

You could try to do this now.  Or you could wait for a year and try to
do it then.  I think you are better off doing it sooner than later.

Well, I disagree with Doug's contention that it almost doesn't matter
if your DH is sleeping with another woman.  If what you want out of a
marriage is loyalty and commitment, then it certainly *does* matter
very much.

Also, I think you're exhibiting another example of a failure to think
clearly when you say &quot;What is more traumatic is the possibility
(imagined) that he actually may have tried to harm me or disable me to
stop the suspicious nagging.&quot;.  I don't even know what that means.
Does it mean that it's a real possibility?  Does it mean that you've
completely imagined it as a possibility?  Does it mean that you
imagined that he's tried it?  Does it mean that you've been told that
you're imagining it, but that you think it's possible?  Does it mean
that you've been told that you're imagining that he's actually tried
it?

Maybe you aren't clear in expressing what you mean because you don't
really know what you mean.  If so, I think you really do have to think
these things through.  I also think this lack of clarity is exhibited
in the list of things you want from your DH.  If that's not the case,
then I'm not sure that list is conducive to a strong marriage.  At
least it would not be for me.

Thank you Doug, I will do that sooner or later depending
on the RED ALERT STRESS circumstances existing now.

I am referring to the desperate plea my DH made to the doctor
about how ill I am, and how worried he is about me, and thinks
i may have been misdiagnosed 30 yrs. ago, because i am so
unreasonably jealous -- can you please give her something
for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  This looked to
like a desperate attempt to get out of a guilty situation.

Other circumstances have been cases where i was in need of
ER attention for a seizure and he did not call 911 - my mother had
to come here and do, wondering why i was being treated like a dog.
So, i have witnesses to my paranoia.  Indeed, sickness is a hassle
for him, regardless of my overbearing mothering for him.  I have
a few examples of this reaction and i have seen it in cases of his
family's illnesses as well.  That may be a personality disorder.

The lack of  clarity is that the exposure of some of these
things are very stressful for me right now.

I like Doug's advice and post very much.  I will follow it.

Thanks

Erin

">

The terms *loyalty* and *commitment* were mentioned by me, and I used
them specifically in the context of possible infidelity, and so I'm
not sure how your comment above can possibly make any sense.  My point
is that you made the assertion, with no qualifications, that whether
or not her DH is sleeping with another woman almost doesn't matter,
and I disagree with this because I think in cases where it's important
to one partner that the other remain true and loyal to a commitment of
exclusivity, whether or not the other partner violates that commitment
*is* important.

Maybe you have reason to know that such a commitment doesn't exist in
this case, but I haven't read anything to suggest this.
