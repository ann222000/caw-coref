Hurricane Felix Update
September 10, 2007

The Administration of President Daniel Ortega is preparing to ask the
Nicaraguan National Assembly to approve a supplemental budget
appropriation of US$10.7 million for immediate aid to the victims of
Hurricane Felix.  Even so, Alberto Guevara, Minister of the Treasury,
told Radio Nicaragua that this sum would not be sufficient to satisfy
the urgent needs of the estimated 150,542 people who have been affected
by the hurricane.  The government also announced that the death toll
had reached 67 although other sources said 100.  Evaluation teams are
still in the region trying to determine how many people died.

National Public Radio reported on Sept. 9 that officials suspected
they would never know the true number of fatalities because of the
isolation of many communities in the Nicaraguan rain forest.

Government sources said that the most needed items were water, food,
medicine, plastic tarps, and galvanized roofing sheets.  Groups in
many Nicaraguan cities were collecting funds and needed items to
send to their fellow countrymen and women who were suffering.  Aid
is also arriving from friendly countries, the United Nations and
the major international aid groups.

The United Nations has called the world community to a meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss coordination of donations for the
reconstruction of the areas damaged by Felix.  UN officials are
meeting with Nicaraguan national and local government officials to
try to map out the needs of the population.

Alfredo Missair, UN coordinator in Nicaragua said that among the
first priorities would be reestablishing classes for school children
in order to return them to some kind of normality.  He expected the
total of promised assistance to come out of the Geneva meeting to
total US$43 million.

Eighty-six communities in the area around the mining community of
Rosita and 31 near Bonanza were reported devastated with more than
30,000 people having lost their crops.  Little of the forest has
been left standing, according to reports, and the rivers, which are
still running over their banks, carry tree trunks and branches.

Maximo Sevilla, mayor of Bonanza, said, &quot;It is very sad;
we've lived an apocalyptic episode.&quot;  The newspaper El Nuevo Diario
reported that &quot;his hopes were revived when a Nicaraguan Army
helicopter arrived to leave off two tons of food for the 16 Mayangna
(Sumo) indigenous communities&quot; in the area.

Army Major Jose Robleto said that four loads of purified water were
being sent to Las Breqas where the people were desperate because
their wells were contaminated and the rivers were the color of
coffee with milk.

Rice and bean harvests were lost in the region which raises the
threat of hunger in the communities.

German Quezada, representative of Oxfam International in Nicaragua,
emphasized that aid programs must include a component of reviving
agricultural production.  &quot;People have to harvest in order to go
forward,&quot; he said.  Oxfam, is coordinating its aid with the Nicaraguan
National System of Disaster Prevention and Attention (SINAPRED),
as are the other major national and international organizations.

In Bilwi (Puerto Cabezas) people were injured in their collapsing
houses because they did not believe reports that the hurricane was
going to hit them.  The governor of the North Atlantic Autonomous
Region (RAAN), Reynaldo Francis Watson, said, &quot;The people thought
that it wasn't true that the hurricane was coming.&quot;  They remembered
several hurricanes in past years which were supposedly headed for
Bilwi and ended up hitting elsewhere, including Joan, which devastated
Bluefields in 1988.

&quot;We wouldn't leave our houses because thieves would have come to
take the little that we have,&quot; said Hernando Jose Webster, who owns
a little grocery store in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Bilwi.  Juan
Scott, pastor of Ebenezer Church said that about 150 people did try
to escape the hurricane by taking refuge in his church but &quot;the
roof fell in on us where there were children, babies, and old
people.&quot;
