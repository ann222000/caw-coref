On Sept 9, 2007 in MTR, in response to Carl's rejection of accepted
naming conventions on Japanese highway in lieu of his own made up
conventions, I posed the question 'who does Carl Rogers think he is?'
http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/02ba76a847687f4e

This was the same date as Carl declared &quot;I no longer find MTR and RAD a
useful medium.&quot;

However Carl sent me an email supposedly in response to my question.
Below is a c/p of the unedited email.  I'll let you form your own
conclusions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Mr Piehl:

&gt; Greetings.  Read on if you wish; discard if that suits your need.

&gt; This letter should satisfy your question.  On the newsgroups MTR and RAD,
&gt; you recently asked me &quot;who do you think you are?&quot;.  I'll begin w/ what I
&gt; am:

&gt; I am a Psychology student, whose field is not precisely similar to hard
&gt; sciences like geology, and physiology.  The Psychology field rests upon
&gt; operational definition (i.e., subjective categorisation) that summarises
&gt; the speaker's thoughts.  So in effect, every operational definition is
&gt; *unique* to the person who created it.  That's the reality of the
&gt; situation, though many others are not aware of it.  That's fine; not
&gt; everybody is aspiring to be a psychologist.  I use operational definition.

&gt; I also was born in the Midwest, where from a young age I guided my family
&gt; around suburbs by memorising roads in the area.  The intent was, and still
&gt; is, to be helpful and unique in delivery.  Each time, they got to their
&gt; destination.

&gt; I don't believe in Christianity, and it derivatives of its &quot;God&quot;.  I
&gt; believe creator(s) may exist, w/ or w/o an assigned gender.  I also
&gt; believe the term good cannot be defined in a universal sense.

&gt; Now, just who do I think I am?  I'm one who loves roads, loves the art of
&gt; human cognition, and am passionate in the fields that I participate.  This
&gt; conceptualisation runs independent of what anyone else thinks, though I do
&gt; care about people.  Even some whose viewpoints don't match mine.  More on
&gt; that in a bit.

&gt; There are large communities that accept either road discussion or
&gt; psychological operational-definition.  In terms of MTR and RAD, the
&gt; mixture did not necessarily apply.

&gt; This may contrast in other field of science where weight is predefined in
&gt; &quot;kilograms&quot; and &quot;pounds&quot;.

&gt; In terms of traveling the world and interacting w/ other people,
&gt; operational definition has worked beautifully.

&gt; Over the past few years, I've come the realisation that MTR and RAD
&gt; largely emply a &quot;hard-science&quot; approach for road components.  In effect,
&gt; that made me the &quot;minority&quot; since the usage of operational-definiton does
&gt; not apply.  I don't mind being in the minority, since I often accept the
&gt; interpretation of others.  Without unique interpretation, the field of
&gt; Psychology would not exist.  I realise MTR and RAD are not psychology
&gt; groups.

&gt; There is a limit, and rightfully so, to when I object to feedback.  This
&gt; involves attack of personal character because my realm of thought
&gt; (operational definition) is seen as &quot;objectionable&quot;.

&gt; Picture this.  You bought a new car.  Nice, red and shiny.  You drive it
&gt; home.  Your neighbour tells you to change the rims.  Seemed like a
&gt; harmless request.  Everyday, that same neighbour tells you to alter your
&gt; car in a different way, because it's out in public view.  You won't,
&gt; because it's your car.  The neighbour eventually starts making subtle jabs
&gt; at your personal character.  You're fine w/ that, and dismiss it, because
&gt; it happens once or twice.  But imagine that same person doing this every
&gt; single time you pull in your car while he's outside.  You begin to block
&gt; his phone number.  He then begins to create flyers attacking your personal
&gt; character for reasons other than what he thinks of your car.  Someone
&gt; picks up that flyer and begins to chase down your personal information
&gt; further, up to and including your private (non-disclosed) information.

&gt; I ask you, Mr Piehl, how would you feel?  Then, when you (as the
&gt; recipient) retaliate, are perceived as the enemy to the flyer-recipients
&gt; for standing up for yourself in the first place!  I hope you catch the
&gt; drift.

&gt; In terms of MTR and RAD, you're probably aware that I no longer am
&gt; participating there.  This may please you as well as others.  Frankly, it
&gt; pleases me as well.

&gt; Be that as it may, I'd like to suggest the following.  You'll come across
&gt; other people in life who perceive something completely different than
&gt; yourself...  I suggest you take time to hear their unique interpretation.
&gt; Even if it seems to be the complete antithesis of what you believe.  I do
&gt; it all the time.  If it doesn't match your approach, try to understand.
&gt; Who knows, you may have a child or grandchild one day who is independently
&gt; motivated and not attracted to hard-sciences.  Should he or she receive
&gt; the same treatment?  Would you want to see them receive harsh treatment
&gt; for engaging in his or her interest?

&gt; I've seen your contributions to viatology and have enjoyed the artwork it
&gt; presented.

&gt; The world is not about assimilation, Mr Piehl.  It would make life easier,
&gt; but life is chaotic by definition.  There is more than one way to measure
&gt; a concept, or progress towards a goal.  If there's one thing I can convey
&gt; to you, it's just that.

&gt; As you may guess, the Worldwide Highway Library will not change because
&gt; the general public has never &quot;heard&quot; something in a unique way.  I've
&gt; received pleasant feedback from several countries, including the USA.  I
&gt; will no longer focus on MTR and RAD, whose perception is counterintuitive
&gt; to the goals my website originally set.

&gt; If I don't hear back from you, I bid you farewell and wish you the best in
&gt; life's events.  That said, I have learned from our interactions and have
&gt; noted the points-of-view you've presented.

&gt; Cheers,

You're the one that made the stink about it.  Obviously in concerns you
greatly.  I've made other cross posts to r.a.d. about Carl, as have
others.  Carl has made cross posts to m.t.r. and r.a.d.  And you said
nothing about any of that.

Are you now trying to censor me?  Are you trying to tell me where I can

to tell me where to post.

Hay, Arif started his post with 'And'. You don't start a sentance w/'and'.
But it's okay. The Burkino Faso Marsupial Abatement Flying Squad will be
round to bundle his ill-tempered arse off to OZ where all the goddam
Marsupials belong, anyway. I put in a special order to ship him to
Tasmania, where some Devils would like to invite him to dinner.

I don't see it that way.  Carl Taylor (one known troll in r.a.d.) has

Probably not.  Carl doesn't read anything by anyone else.  He knows
everything already so why should he waste his time reading.

Maybe Carl should introduce you to his friend, Eric the attack mosquito,

Carl has a narcissistic personality trait bordering on disorder.  It's
not worth my time to deal with him (especially since he ignored my

unlike the majority of people participating in this thread, I have the

I'll see yr trait and raise you a disorder, krl is most def. disorder
quality. He follows the classic line of maladaptive coping to the letter.
You seem to know what's going on with him, then you surely realise how
infuriating that can be to some folks. Now yr all noble and full of Triumph
Of The Will and whatnot, and more power to you. Not everybody is you.
People deal with problems in different ways.

Krl is not going to go away until he loses interest in roads or latches onto
another band of unfortunates with a common interest. He's 'gone away'
multiple times, only to resurface again, rather like herpes. For some
people, that's fucking annoying, and they pick at the resulting lesions,
even though they shouldn't. Krl and his little chum Eric have disrespected
people on this board in a rude manner, and you can't expect all people to
just let that pass.

Then you have me, and by now, you should realise that I'll either heap abuse
or exploit people for comic material-especially people like krl, who are
such a rich source of comedy. You have to admit, to a point, it works: krl
no longer responds to me directly and only mentions me obliquely, and his
flea Eric has not said anything towards me, simply because I'll come down
on them like I'm breaking in a new pair of Docs, and not break a sweat, and
enjoy it at the same time. That may be the only way to ameliorate the
problem.

USENET is much like a co-op.  We all pay some of the bills to run

They don't just respond to him - they initiate threads bashing him (like
this one) when he has said nothing. Childish.

So, as suggested, killfile him. He produces static in this group far out of
proportion to his actual posts, because people won't exercise the common
sense approach and plonk him.

But he wanted to tell me how to post, what to post and where to post.
And questioned my heritage and parentage, my manhood and my personhood
when I disagreed with him.   That's more that suggestion.  That's usenet
cop and censorship.

And as far as the seasoned part, I probably have as much or more
experience that Arif so, if anything, he should be taking suggestions
from me.

Sorry.  He was being a jerk.

Take care,
