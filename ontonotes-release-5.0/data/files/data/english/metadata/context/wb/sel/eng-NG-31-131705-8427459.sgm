I used to use TI Bebop 11s on my Borys archtop and I didn't have any
problem setting up the intonation, but since I switched to TI Swing
flatwound 10s, to get around on the fretboard better, I have to slant
my bridge like crazy, and it still isn't that great intonation-wise.

Would it make any difference setting up the intonation if I used
another set of round wound 10s?

Unfortunately, TI doesn't make Bebop 10s.
TIA
