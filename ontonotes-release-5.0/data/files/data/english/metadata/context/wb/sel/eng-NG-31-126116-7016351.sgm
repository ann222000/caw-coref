Shrouded Stories is a new choreographic work by Andrew Skeels, a member of
Colorado Ballet, that speaks to the human cost of the U.S. war in Iraq.  The
piece discusses the suffering and destruction that the peoples of Iraq
continue to bear.  It sheds light on the unnecessary pains of unjust and
aggressive warfare.  Shrouded Stories features solos, which speaks to the
issues of vulnerability, loss, control, and the desire for peace.

The music and soundscore for the piece are taken from the works of Sussan
Deyhim.  Born in Tehran, Sussan Deyhim is a composer and vocalist who has
been at the forefront of experimental music internationally for over two
decades. Deyhim's music combines extended vocal techniques, digital
processing, and the ancient mysticism of Middle Eastern music to create a
deeply moving fusion of East and West.The piece will be performed at the
studios of Colorado Ballet on Thursday, April 12th at 7:30pm and Friday,
April 13th at 6:00pm.  For further information call 303-862-2282.
