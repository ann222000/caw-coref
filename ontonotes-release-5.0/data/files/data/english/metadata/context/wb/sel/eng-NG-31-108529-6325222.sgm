Some spiral galaxies, such as Andromeda and Milky Way, are barred. So what
is the matter distribution of such barred galaxies towards the hub,
especially with respect to dark matter, and what is the common explanation
for this phenomenon? In addition, is there a certain type of galaxies that
tend to be barred, like with respect to size or age?

There are no simple short answers to your questions. The answers
require dedicated study using books and journal literature. For all
the hype about the density wave theory, I am not sure that we really
know that much about spiral galaxies in general, and especially barred
spiral galaxies. Our understanding seems to me to be more descriptive
and heuristic than fundamental.

In 1983 I demonstrated something that I thought was quite interesting:

"A New Model For Barred Spiral Galaxies", Astrophysics and Space
Science, 92(2), 429-432, 1983.

The basic idea is: we know that the disks of spiral galaxies are often
warped. What I showed was that if you observe a warped disk from
certain angles you get quite realistic looking projection effect
"bars", i.e., there is no real bar, just an *apparent* bar. I also
demonstrated that you can get bar-within-ring projection effects in
this way. I thought this was a delightful idea that applied at least
in the case of distant, poorly-resovled galaxies. However the idea was
received with distain by the cognoscenti and silence from everyone
else. So I gave up trying to interest people in it. The computer
modelling I used was extremely primitive by today's standards. It
would be an interesting project to use advanced graphic techniques to
explore the full capability of this idea to reproduce the observed
properties of barred spiral galaxies.

I would surmise that such a theory could easily be decided by todays
standards in observations and computing power. It is an interesting
observation though, that barred galaxies are warped.

The Wikipedia says that the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies have been
found (more recently) to be barred galaxies. So this seems to go the
opposite way: galaxies that formerly was thought to be purely spiral, are
now reclassified as barred.

So I assumed this being the case. Since these are among the largest and
oldest galaxies known, I thought perhaps being barred was somehow related
to those properties. So are there a lot of small, young barred galaxies
out there?

The MWG and M31 are both warped. M31 is quite disturbed, with an inner
ring at a large angle wrt the general disk plane. Neither galaxy
appears to be strongly barred in the classical sense, but that is
still being worked out.

Galaxies that are overtly barred run the gamut: big, small, old,
young, near, far.

The one thing that correlates with "barredness" is interaction with
other galaxies, and a similar correlation is found for warping.

Neither the bar nor the spiral arms are indicative of a greatly excess
mass distribution. These are the places in a galaxy where gas gathers
and new star formation takes place. The density distribution of older
stars being much more even. In other words the bar and the arms are
brighter, but not much more massive.

In the spiral arm there are younger stars, and therefore also larger and
more luminous stars which burn out and go supernova more quickly. Gas
blown off the supernovas will disperse outside the spiral arm, because
of convex curvature. Inside the spiral arm the gas becomes more
concentrated heading toward the centre of curvature of the arm. This
creates the conditions for the formation of a shock wave, which is
required for the gas to reach sufficient density to instigate a new wave
of star formation. Thus each spiral arm generates new stars inside of
itself.

As the galaxy ages the angle of the arms becomes increasing acute. In
the centre of the galaxy the positions for the formation of new stars is
not determined from a single arm. This is where the gas from the two
arms meets, naturally forming a symmetrical bar.

I have a couple of questions relating to the standard model of spiral
arms, which you reviewed.

1. What is the fundamental origin of the two (usually 2) density waves
that are the basis for the whole model? What physical mechanism
excites the classical two-armed spirals that have such appealing
symmetry?

2. If symmetrical bars naturally form in the galaxy center where
incoming gas from the two arms intersect, how can we understand the
observed fact that strong bars often extend far away from the central
region, extending across nearly the whole optical disk?

3. Does the standard density wave model provide an understanding of
the remarkable bar-within-ring morphology that is well-documented and
not uncommon.

4. Does the standard density wave model provide an explanation for the
observed fact that barred galaxies are sometimes double-barred, i.e.,
a smaller bar is found interior to the main bar (with angles between
the two bars distributed in a reasonably random manner, including
nearly perpendicular examples)?

Do we really understand spiral galaxies all that well, or is it mostly
arm-waving, so-to-speak?

I don't know all the answers to your questions. Galaxies are modelled
using supercomputers and I don't have any such access, nor am I expert
in the literature. I do know, because I have been studying data, that
the distribution of orbital velocities of stars is sufficiently broad
that older stars will spread out to cover the disc, not just the arms,
and that the arms are the places where gas collects and new stars form.
We also know, because it is well modelled, that shock waves in the gas
are necessary to achieve sufficient gas density for star formation.
Also we know that on galactic timescales collisions between galaxies are
common, and that this has a huge impact in creating the variety of
galaxy types - in particular I read not long ago that the bar within
ring formation you mention has been modelled as a result of galaxy
collisions.

As far as galaxy evolution models are concerned, we know that CDM models
don't work at all well in creating observed galaxy profiles, and we know
that we have a problem understanding the rate of galaxy formation from
the big bang. Both of those problems are addressed by the
teleconnection, which gives much more time for this to happen, and which
does not require CDM. I fear that further answers on the state of play
there await the demise of the CDM model so that the supercomputers are
turned to studying galaxies without it.

To Dr. Francis and all.
Some years ago, Philip Plait, (Bad-Astronomy Blog)
and I discussed galaxy types, IMHO he's an expert,
and I gathered from our conversations this analysis.
(Philip is a rather modest type, and may deny his
input, but I'll acknowledge he as my source.)

We should think in terms of galactic construction
as part of a galactic superstructral formation.

The large heavy spherical galaxies occupy
the center of gravity's of the galactic clusters.

The "barring" of the galaxies revolving about that
center of mass are subject to tidal forces, with
those "tidal forces" themselves creating the bar
structure, much like tidal forces operate on Earth,
because of the moon and sun.

In "celestrial mechanics" that effect is equivalent
to the Roche Limit induction mechanism.

The "hypothesis" that the baring of galaxies
due to tidal effects is somewhat subjective,
however, an examination of the "Coma Cluster",

http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020203.html

appears to support that hypothesis, because
the "spiral" galaxy's form in a region where the
gravitational potential changes, when that potential
is calculated from the galactic cluster.

The gradient of potential in the mid part of the cluster
is fairly flat, because it is near the Center of Gravity,
however as the observations from the ref above notes,
spirals increase in prominence as one tends beyond
the C of G.

Tidal effects in GR are descibed by Weinbergs'
"Grav &amp; Cosmo" eq.(6.10.1), though I think the
Newtonian Roche Limit induction is adequate.

Why would there be a Roche Limit involved? If
I understand correctly, that's the point at
which solid bodies orbiting larger bodies are
torn to pieces by tidal forces.

But at the scales involved, galaxies aren't
solid bodies at all, they are swarms of
particles. The galaxy may well be torn apart
by tides, but surely the math is different
than "Roche Limit" math?

Please do not make unsupported ad hominem attacks on my scientific

According to evolutionary models dark matter halos should have steep
central density cusps (e.g., Navarro, Frenk, &amp; White 1997) but they
appear not to (e.g., de Blok, Bosma, &amp; McGaugh 2003; Swaters et al.
2003). In a survey of about 3000 galaxies, Biviano &amp; Salucci (2006) find
that X-ray determination of the baryonic component of dark matter haloes
fits evolutionary models, but subhalo components do not. Martel and
Shapiro (2003) have examined the profile of lenses for a number of
evolutionary models. While they find quantitative fits for many
properties, they find that the models do not correctly reproduce the
central region. Park and Ferguson (2003) studied the lensing produced by
Burkert haloes and found, `For the scaling relation that provides the
best fits to spiral-galaxy rotation curve data, Burkert halos will not
produce strong lensing, even if this scaling relation extends up to
masses of galaxy clusters. Tests of a simple model of an exponential
stellar disk superimposed on a Burkert-profile halo demonstrate that
strong lensing is unlikely without an additional concentration of mass
in the galaxy center (e.g. a bulge)'. In a one study for which a
particularly good analysis is possible, Wayth et al. (2005) found that,
for the optical Einstein ring gravitational lens ER 0047-2808, lensing
is consistent with a halo of the same mass distribution as the galaxy
itself. This result is not consistent with either the halo distribution
required to produce galactic rotation curves, or with evolutionary halo
models. It is, of course, trivially consistent with both in a no CDM
model.

Incidentally straight MOND does not resolve these problems, because it
finds it difficult to account for the strength of lensing. MONDian
galaxies are short on mass. The teleconnection survives because it
predicts greater lensing angles from distant galaxies. MOND also has a
problem with galaxy clusters and Lyalpha absorbers. These are modelled
from hydrodynamic principles, not from rotation curves. Again the
teleconnection does not have that problem because it modifies the
interpretation of Doppler shift, not Newtonian dynamics.

I have cited some of the literature. There is a lot more if you would
look for it. Now will you accept your own criterion that since

Indeed. Only rarely is theory scrapped wholesale and starts again from
scratch just because of inconsistent observations, especially when
observations are hard to come by, to interpret and to analyse. At a
theoretical level the teleconnection is a very small tweak to general
relativity. It does not modify classical gtr at all, but applies in the
quantum domain. The one change is that light from distant stellar
objects is then treated quantum mechanically. This does mean we have to
reinterpret almost all astronometrical data. The result of doing so is
that no other alterations to known physics appear to be required on
empirical grounds - no CDM, no Lambda, possibly no missing matter, and
certainly no modification to Newtonian Dynamics.

For a basic ref...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit
Generally the object undergoing tidal deformation,
such as a galaxy, could be regarded as a
gravitationally bound set of particles of zero pressure,
for purposes of computation.

Interestingly, the tides on Earth deform it into
a prolate spheroid with "high" tide on two sides
of the Earth. It appears to me (subjectively)
barred galaxies often have two main arms, and
when rotation is accounted for suggests a
Roche limit / tidal deformation.
Has a simulation of that been done that anyone
might provide as a ref?

Sorry, then I certainly did NOT understand
correctly, since I had it exactly backwards,
a body solid enough to have tensile strength
is the one that doesn't exactly obey a Roche

Unfortunately for your contention, and as the Hubble
dark matter map shows, CDM may exist in galaxies,
but it is not limited to galaxies, and so "one
pseudo-free parameter" as a goal is an uncatchable
ephemera.

Instead, CDM will have an inherent local
intergalactic density of its own, which should
influence its density within the embedded galaxies,
adding a second parameter.

Also as shown by the Hubble map, the intergalactic
density of CDM evolves with time, adding yet a third
parameter.

Beyond all that, I'm a math major, not an
astronomer, and if you insist in writing in
acronyms, I will have to insist on not having a

Lastly, do your own homework. Google Scholar will

I don't understand how the dark matter map makes any difference
because it is generated using standard Relativity. If we assume that
Relativity does not work well at very low acceleration, then the map
will be wrong. So it actually doesn't prove anything. Its actually a

Let me first define the only two terms that I used

MOND is MOdified Newtonian Dynamics, it says that the laws of
gravitational force is different than what is predicted by Newtonian
gravity when accelaration due to gravity is too low. It embodies a
single equation which gives the new equation for the force law that
will apply when the accelaration due to gravity is too low. It is not
a proper theory and cannot be used for other things that Relativity
predicts like Gravitational Lensing.

MOND is ad-hoc and was designed to obtain the Tully Fisher
Relationship.

TeVeS is a theory based on MOND's hypothesis. It is proper theory in
that it can be used for Gravitational Lensing.  It basically reduces
to Newtonian regime at higher accelaration due to gravity, to
Relativity at higher speed, and to MOND at lower accelaration due to
gravity and low speed.

MOND has been quite successful in fitting rotational speed data for
the galaxies. It has been tested on over 120 galaxies and there have
been no failures. Please see http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/ . If
it had no truth behind it there would have been some failures in the
nearly 30 years that it has existed, but there has been none. It does
not work as well in the Clusters of galaxies, so I guess that there
may be some kind of Dark Matter there. But at least according to MOND
there is no evidence of dark matter in the galaxies. It could be that
there is some kind of dark matter that can form stable structures at
much larger scales than galaxies. And these structures are present in
most clusters. It could be that MOND is still an approximation of some
other theory that we don't know. I would like to believe that it is
some kind of Conformal Field Theory, just like the other forces.

BTW MOND can obtain the data from Clusters of Galaxies if 2eV massive
nutrinos could form huge stable structures and was present in most
galaxy clusters.

Unfortunately I don't know much about maths. And these Relativity
papers are all filled up with so much maths that it makes the head
hurt, and they don't go about explaining the consequences of their

because he did bring his equations to lay man perspective.

Hope I am not too full of it.

Yes. But in this case, I think it is not low accelerations which are the
problem, but the assumption in general relativity about the path of
light in empty space. If the lensing is not as predicted, then too the
dark matter map will be wrong.

Not with brilliant results, unfortunately. Zhao et al. MNRAS. 368, 171,
astro-ph/0509590 found that =E2=80=9CTeVeS succeeds in providing an alter=

significant challenges when confronted with particular galaxy lens

Straight MOND also has a problem with Galaxy Clusters. So too does CDM.
At the moment neither seems capable of consistent predictions. According
to the teleconnection the problem lies not with Newtonian gravity, but
with the interpretation of Doppler shifts. The prediction is that
cosmological expansion affects Doppler shifts in just such a way as to
produce the illusion of a flat rotation curve.

I went through the FAQ at that site.

MOND seems to be self-falsifying.

It wants us to believe that there is a very low
acceleration law of gravity, and a normal
acceleration law of gravity, and that the atoms in a
star, which of necessity are in the "high
acceleration" regime _because_ they are in a star,
are *at the very same time* in a "low acceleration"
regime due to gravity of distant stars accumulated
as a "center of galaxy" force.

That's just too much handwaving to swallow.

MOND may well _fit_ mass/light for galaxies, but
making equations to fit is presumably "easy" for
those comfortable with that level of math. What MOND
does not do is _explain_ the rotation of galaxies,
and its attempts to do so are just silly, as far as
I can tell.

In comparision, CDM attempts to _explain_ galaxy
rotations, and evidence that CDM (and Cold Dark
Energy) exist seems to accumulate regularly, the
Hubble survey being merely one prominent example.

FWIW

xanthian.

Notice also that checking whether accelerations at
the MOND level exist is perfectly straightforward
(if tedious) to do in an earth based lab. If you can
factor away the gravity inside a star as MOND
proponents pretend is possible, you can surely
factor away the lesser gravity of earth to detect
with interferometry whether two appropriately sized
and spaced masses attract each other "differently in
essence" above and below the a0 parameter
gravitational behavior regime breakpoint of MOND.

If thirty years after MOND was proposed that still
hasn't been attempted and the results documented,
why is MOND still being taken seriously?

An appropriate place to attempt that Real Soon Now.
would be the "under improvement" earth based
gravity wave detection facilities where effects of
outside vibration will be carefully controlled and
culled from the data, and detection of such minor
motions are a design goal.

Because many cosmologists don't find CDM a credible explanation, and the
fits to the MOND law are definite empirical evidence which is also
mounting. It also applies to globular clusters, in which CDM is a non-
starter as an explanation - it would mean inconsistent amounts of CDM in
the cluster as is supposed to exist within the Milky Way.

The teleconnection does explain these observations, by modifying
redshifts and lensing, and without modifying either particle physics or
dynamics.

I understands the points 1, 2, and 4, and MOND works with them, as
the paper says. I don't understand the 3rd point it seems that it is
putting forward a theory that the potential in the disk plane will be
non-newtonian but perpendicular to it it will be newtonian, then uses
several observations to prove it. I don't know why is that. It should
have done the opposite. It also doesn't talk about MOND or any
other theory in that perspective, if they match the observations.

Well actually I have no problems with Dark Matter. We don't
really know the whole universe and there could be curiosities
that are too strange. We also know that MOND is not a
good theory. It is just a simple equation, which works very
well. I would say too well at the Galaxy level.

Even TeVeS is not a good theory. It is workable, but not
very good. It is ugly and ad-hoc. Which means that it will
not survive for very long.

What MOND does say that for most of the galaxies there
exists very little if any Dark Matter. It provides fits for galaxies
that no other theory, GR+DM or otherwise can match.

Also till date there have been no failures of MOND. I define
failure as in a body of mass that shows less gravitation
than MOND predicts. If there is more gravitation than MOND
predicts, it could be because MOND is wrong or because
there is some type of dark matter. But existence of DM
is not fatal for MOND. Unless you get very religious about
it, you can always admit that we don't know everything
about the universe and DM may exist.

The fact that it works as well as it does means that MOND
phenomenology is a fact at Galaxy levels. Which means
that no theory can be accepted unless it contains MOND
as an explanation. MOND cannot be ignored after fitting
120 galaxies which is probabilistically impossible if Dark
Matter could be distributed randomly.

The only way GR+DM can explain MOND by saying that
during structure formation DM and BM (baryonic mass)
where created so as to give MOND phenomenology. And
that the structures have diverged in a way so as to keep
MOND phenomenology at the galaxy scale.

Now this poses an obvious fine tuning problem, but we
may be able to live with it, if we can come up with a
possible structure theory that could explain MOND,
ie fit the observations based on the BM only, as
MOND does.

Currently the best CDM fits to the Rotation curves of
galaxies require two free parameters per galaxy.
This is way too inferior. MOND does much better with
a single universal parameter.

Now I will attempt to prove that there can be no
DM structure formation theory that can explain MOND.
For this I will use the excellent fits at
http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/n1560.gif
and other similar fits at
http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/mdlg.gif
and at http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/mdlg.gif_2

Now if you see these fits you will notice that most of
these galaxies have a lot of deviation from standard GR.
That is they require a lot of DM. Actually much much
more DM than there is BM in them.

You will also notice that MOND is also predicting the
wiggles in the rotation curve. This must mean that
the wiggles must also be present in the DM profile.

I believe that you will also agree that even if the
DM and BM evolved together, so as to maintain the
MOND phenomenology, it is still a tall order to
assume (and an even bigger fine tuning problem)
that they will evolve exactly the same. There will be
some deviations.

I also believe that at the time of structure formation
the rotation curves of the structure would be very
smooth, and the wiggles would occurr over
time due to irregularities getting magnified with time.

This means that the Wiggles in an otherwise smooth
curve would be due to the irregularities in the BM and
DM components. I would expect much less deviations
in the DM structure than the BM structure, because
DM does not interact much.

This will mean that the wiggles will be mostly due to
BM but will be quite a bit damped. ie the wiggle in
the BM structure will have quite a bit less effect on
the rotation curve. So that MOND will predict a much
bigger wiggle than in the rotation curve.

But these curves show that the wiggles are fit quite
well by the MOND theory. The magnitude of the
wiggles are also nearly the same. This would mean
very little DM if it exists. This is quite contrary to
the GR expectation.

Obviously if DM is not in these galaxies then GR
does not work well at these scales. And if GR does
not work at these levels, then we can't be sure of
its implication on Clusters, and cosmological scales.

We need a better theory. TeVeS may be a better
theory than GR, but it still needs more DM for
larger structures. It is ad-hoc and quite ugly, but
may be better to work with till we get a really good
theory.

I hope that my logic makes sense. Of course everything
depends on the fits at Stacy's site to be correct.
Which I believe they should be, because nobody refutes
them.

I have written a program to simulate galaxies using MOND.

For a more general discussion related to MOND which
includes your references See:
http://users.pandora.be/nicvroom/mond.htm
For a copy of the program see:
http://users.pandora.be/nicvroom/.prgmond.htm

You first url references NGC1560.
The url shows four rotation curves:
One Measured. One based on Newton's Law,
One based on MOND and one including Darkmatter.

If you make such a comparison the galaxy should have
the same amount of baryonic mass.
The problem is you cannnot make a simulation where
the speed of the MOND curve is twice the speed
of the Newton curve based on the same mass distribution.

(There is the parameter a0 which you can adapt, but that
makes the whole MOND concept rather speculative)

The second url shows 16 galaxies.
The problem is that many of the MOND curves the speed
at a certain distance decrease.
IMO such curves are not possible with MOND.

Ofcourse my simulations can be wrong.

I hope you took care to apply MOND correctly. It has non-local
affects.
You cannot replace all mass within a sphere with a point mass, for
measuring its effect outside the sphere. It gives non-intuitive
effects.
Check the explanation at
http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/mondnbody.ps

Other numerical approaches are necessary. For example, Brada's

hey, that's the boring version of the explanation i wrote. this one
is much more fun:

ROTFL!!

Please do ask Stacy to replace the original one. This one is much
better.

There was one . (point) too much.

How do you apply MOND correctly ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It has non-local affects.

What do you mean by that ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I agree that that gives complications. IMO that is a problem with MOND.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Why do you call the above effect non-intuitive ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes I agree there is an issue.
See also my comments See: http://users.pandora.be/nicvroom/mond.htm
at Feedback #4.
At the end of that document is written:
"Note that this does not mean MOND is wrong,
just that this kind of calculation does not work"
IMO that is a serious problem.

What MOND predicts is that when you have two colliding BH's
(or large masses) that the speed of a star,
which circulates around the center of gravity of that BH,
after collision, will drastically change.
There will almost be no change when Newton is considered.

I have serious problems with MOND.
1. One is for example the above mentioned document.
2. A different one is the value of a0. This is more or less a free
parameter.
3. Third how do you go from Newton to MOND.
There are more or less three areas involved:
One with Newton at short distance between stars,
one with both Newton and MOND
and one with MOND only at large distances.

&gt; When we have a quantized Ads/CFT theory of gravity, which is the
&gt; equivalent of the other forces, nothing will work according to our
&gt; intuition. Time Dilation etc are intuitive compared to what we will
&gt; have ;-).

Why do you again use the word intuition ?
