Yeehaa all ye falty landlubbers

Dear Fred apparently laid on a fantastical, stupendously awesome race.
in the Transkei-Single track Mania.

Team Adventure Wear had a beatific serendipitous race.
You can see the race report and pictures from the ever competent Kevin Dold
on www.vcx.co.za
Excerpt - &quot;Once down, we felt like we had entered the lost world. Giant
slippery, craggy rocks were strewn everywhere.&quot;
Read it now.

Fish

The Fish river marathon was great. I paddled with Kim Tyrer, an ex-adventure
racer who hasn't seen the AR circuit for some time.
The faast water in the fish, (Dusi 5-7 cumecs, Fish 30+) had me misjudging
distances for the first hour or so, and things we normally juuuust miss, we
were juuuuust hitting.
So we pretended we were Pirates, plundering and harassing the other boats
and being occasionally harassed and plundered by a willow tree or thorn
bush, of which there were many.

I was Captain Flatulent Rum Tigger and Kim was me First Mate Perky Twiddle
Buttons and together we scourged the Fish.
It was a good chance to test out the Starsky Range of Canoe Gear with a
Starsky Life Jacket and a Starsky Splash cover, in my case a hatch cover as
sometimes with my brilliant lines we ended up at periscope depth. Check them
out on www.vcx.co.za under &quot;Toys&quot;. Or call him on 0826509803
So now Keith's, Toast Rack, Marlowe's, Soutpan's and Gauging weir all have a
place in my mind and another tick off is done and survived.

Other AR - KZN racers we saw were James Lind-Homes and his tribe of home
grown boys, Angus and Seamus.

Trevor (Salty-Crack) Hellens, who has a bevy of beautiful seconds and many
friends who went for the party.
By the way he is leading groups on the Triple challenge route on the 13th
and 20th October.
Sign up now if you haven't done them yet as the new off road run and bike
are &quot;sick&quot; (Epworth slang for really cool and amazing and good)
Call Cwever Twevor on 0828796635 for details.
We leave at 6h00 from Polly Short's Spar

Les Willows runs a tight ship and the Epworth Contingency were amazingly
cool on and off the water.
His Mondi-Shanduka Race is coming up and entry forms are on the
www.vcx.co.za website.
This is a classy fun staged adventure race and shouldn't be missed.

Attilla The Hun-garian

Is starting a special &quot;Ballies&quot; Paddling group on Mondays and Wednesdays at
6.00am at the NCC canoe club to prepare people for the Dusi.
Attila is an Olympic coach, responsible for many of our South African
results and sprint paddlers and a great coach.
He says R350 will get you three months coaching and his sessions are the
best value of any training I have received anywhere.
From total novice to Dusi, non-stop, Umko, Fish, 50 miler, Drak, Flat water,
Ngwenya in one season, is all due to his coaching.
There is place to join this elite group of old codgers, and if you can bear
him calling you &quot;poofy&quot; and other Nordic type insults you will emerge a much
better paddler.
Drop me an email if you want to join geo ... @spindrift.co.za
It starts next Monday, so don't delay.

For those of you who aren't yet proficient  to paddle anywhere:
Hugh Raw will be doing river proficiency Sat 13th October.

Meet at 1.00pm at GlassFibre Products in Victoria Road.
