Some people who are supposedly fighting
theincome tax are dwelling on the fact that
the Income Tax Act or the Internal Revenue
Code is not 'law'. Whether they are teaching
this through ignorance, or as moles, remains
to be seen.

This is a 'red herring' to divert attention away from
the real extortion racket scheme of the Vatican
owned banksters, and their minions in government.

The Internal Revenue Code of the USA and Income
Tax Act of Canada are NOT 'law' - never were.

They are 'terms of a contract of servitude'. And
court proceedings are hearings wherein these
terms of contract are adjudicated for non-performance
of the 'subject' party to that 'slave contract'.

Free will humans are not subject to either the
IRC or ITA - only 'persons' fictional characters
or people in fictional status or roles as 'slaves'
are subject to these contract adjudications for
non-performance of the terms of contract.

How does one tell whether one is of free will
status, or are a slave with a false status of
'natural person' - natural person meaning
that the fictional role is deceptively associated
with a specific human physical body?

The answer is the 'name game'. What name?

The name, which one finds on the copy
of the birth certificate you obtained from
the State vital statistics department,
(this since the mid 1930s) , and the
name whereby the family name is the primary
name, and the given names being referental
names to the family name, is the 'natural
person/legal identity/fictional entity' name.

Historically, the opposite is the fact -
given names primary and the family name
as a reference name.

And, to continue, a child is 'given' names
by the parents. However an infant (under age 21)
cannot be party to a contract, and a gift is a
contract. Upon reaching adult age, the human
does not 'accept' the given names, so we
humans everywhere have 'no name or number'.
We only have 'nicknames' or 'commonly
called names. No 'legal names'.

The great deception upon the people
is likened to a pirate who stealthily
puts a false name on a ship, and
then claims that ship and its contents
as his own.  Neat trick!

They have been getting away with
this deception, fraud and extortion
racket for many years. I wonder
how much longer, before people
wake up?

One way to circumvent the extortion
racket called income tax is to 'file
for your strawman'.  What's this?

And, no, there have been no
court cases negating this
filing method - some sleazy
trickery, yes, but no nullification
by any law. You just have
to get a good handle on your
true status as a free will human.

Nobody -- your moniker/handle shows that you a stoolie for the fiction
-- no.body.

Also shows your lack of compassion for another human's suffering and
shows how low you would go for the 'almighty' $  -- you'd screw your
own mother and daughter. you are a lowlife!!

I read an article awhile back -- don't have it on hand. It was about a
family -- husband and wife with 11 children. Not sure if 9 or
eleven...but anyhow, the then corporation was called Revenue Canada and
RevSCAM [as i like to call it] went after these people with a
vengeance....it ended tragically with the wife killing herself.....and
it was found later that the amount they tried to extort from these
hard-working people -- was just a 'mistake', as revSCAM called it.

Now -- you pigs from the CRA who are monitoring these sites -- you
feeling better ??

That story is what got me inquisitive as to the workings of the
TOLLGATORS -- revSCAM aka CRA.

Judges' O A T H  of  A L L E G I A N C E -- ain't to 'canada' /
canadian people

Below is what I got from the horses' mouths.

Buddie
=========

Section 6(4) of the "Provincial Court Act" provides as follows
regarding the oath of office for a judge appointed under the
"Provincial Court Act", and it states as follows:

Appointment and reappointment of judges

6 (4)Before entering on the duties of the office, a judge apppointed
under any provision of this Act must swear an oath as follows:

I, ............., do swear that I will truly and faithfully, according
to my skill and knowledge, execute the duties, powers and trusts placed
in me as a judge of the Provincial Court of British Columbia and that I
will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors.

Abbot) Eldon, in addtion to being laughed out of countless courts for
the last 15 years, (12 before you borrowed it) the straw man "method"
has failed you, Cameron Hardy and Clifford Hanna.

Now, let me remind you of my several day old request:

ELDON WARMAN,  please inform Eldon of the Warman family or "I Am",  as
he refers to himself,  that I will begin proceedings against him in
according to the rights and privileges of men.

Please inform me of his response to this lawful challenge.

Now, isn't it interesting!

If one reads the repealed in 1893 Section 2 of the
BNA Act, one finds that it read:

"Section 2, repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act,
1893, 56-57 Vict., c. 14 (U.K.), read as follows:

2. The Provisions of this Act referring to Her Majesty
the Queen [Victoria] extend also to the Heirs and
Successors of Her Majesty, Kings and Queens of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland."

Queen Victoria died in 1901.

Wonder why BC judges are still taking an oath to
bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,
her heirs and successors, or any other Monarch of
Great Britain ?????

Does anyone smell TREASON against the people
pf Canada here ???  I surely do !!

Some people who are supposedly fighting
theincome tax are dwelling on the fact that
the Income Tax Act or the Internal Revenue
Code is not 'law'. Whether they are teaching
this through ignorance, or as moles, remains
to be seen.

This is a 'red herring' to divert attention away from
the real extortion racket scheme of the Vatican
owned banksters, and their minions in government.

The Internal Revenue Code of the USA and Income
Tax Act of Canada are NOT 'law' - never were.

They are 'terms of a contract of servitude'. And
court proceedings are hearings wherein these
terms of contract are adjudicated for non-performance
of the 'subject' party to that 'slave contract'.

Free will humans are not subject to either the
IRC or ITA - only 'persons' fictional characters
or people in fictional status or roles as 'slaves'
are subject to these contract adjudications for
non-performance of the terms of contract.

How does one tell whether one is of free will
status, or are a slave with a false status of
'natural person' - natural person meaning
that the fictional role is deceptively associated
with a specific human physical body?

The answer is the 'name game'. What name?

The name, which one finds on the copy
of the birth certificate you obtained from
the State vital statistics department,
(this since the mid 1930s) , and the
name whereby the family name is the primary
name, and the given names being referental
names to the family name, is the 'natural
person/legal identity/fictional entity' name.

Historically, the opposite is the fact -
given names primary and the family name
as a reference name.

And, to continue, a child is 'given' names
by the parents. However an infant (under age 21)
cannot be party to a contract, and a gift is a
contract. Upon reaching adult age, the human
does not 'accept' the given names, so we
humans everywhere have 'no name or number'.
We only have 'nicknames' or 'commonly
called names. No 'legal names'.

The great deception upon the people
is likened to a pirate who stealthily
puts a false name on a ship, and
then claims that ship and its contents
as his own.  Neat trick!

They have been getting away with
this deception, fraud and extortion
racket for many years. I wonder
how much longer, before people
wake up?

One way to circumvent the extortion
racket called income tax is to 'file
for your strawman'.  What's this?

All info is free and complete:
http://www.detaxcanada.org

And, no, there have been no
court cases negating this
filing method - some sleazy
trickery, yes, but no nullification
by any law. You just have
to get a good handle on your
true status as a free will human.

Abbot) So how did democratic governments get their authority before
births were registered?

ABBOT ??? WHAT DOES THE JUDGE'S OATH OF ALLEGIANCE HERE
INDICATE...HMMM?

[QUOTE]
Section 6(4) of the "Provincial Court Act" provides as follows
regarding the oath of office for a judge appointed under the
"Provincial Court Act", and it states as follows:

Appointment and reappointment of judges

6 (4)Before entering on the duties of the office, a judge apppointed
under any provision of this Act must swear an oath as follows:

I, ............., do swear that I will truly and faithfully, according
to my skill and knowledge, execute the duties, powers and trusts placed

in me as a judge of the Provincial Court of British Columbia and that I

will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors.

-------------------UNQUOTE

You, a so-called ivy-leaguer educated man who works for the enemy --
the banksters/gangsters and their yappy chihuahas -- the IRS/CRA --
don't see the above judge's oaths as T.R.E.A.S.O.N. ???
HELLLOOOOOOOOO???
But I guess you don't cause you also are a T.R.A.I.T.O.R. to your own
family and countrymen and women and children. I hope you can sleep well
at night/nite -- cause when these banksters/gangsters don't have any
use of you -- you going to be disposable trash. Hope for your sake that
you keep some kind of a diary in some mailbox that does NOT bear the
name on your birth/berth certificate -- just in case you toast -- and
you make a will or have some kind of instructions that upon your own
death -- the contents to be posted around the internet. will make it a
blockbuster movie, eh! but...you won't get to enjoy it, will you?
You'll be 6 feet under or dust to dust -- ashes to ashes in some toilet
bowl. :)

Who you calling old??LOL ..am quite younger than you old man --seen
your picture and you a second away from having an anurism Jack/Abbot!!

Bothers you and your crooked friends at the irs-cra that Eldon Warman
hit the jackpot about the name game, eh?LOL  Eldon Warman's stuff makes
sense. Just look at your driver's license -- it tells you that it's the
property of whater state/province so does the birth/berth certificate.

Google 'jordan maxwell' ...was looking for one of his youtube video
links and finally found it!!LOL
