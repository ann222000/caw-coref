I want to let you know my current car is the LAST gasoline car I ever owned.
Next is hydrogen, 500 GM people and uniknown # of FORD people are working
day and night to bring hydro future ASAP, they replied to my emails but of
course no exact dates due to trade secrets, already Ford operates hydrogen
fleet in CA, Michigan and FL, the p0roblem now is INFRASTRUCTURE.

Stop complaining about $2 gas, I am mentally prepared for $6!!   Single
people driving SUV's should be penalized exponentially for being dumb, if
you got a family i understand, if you';er alone most of the time driving
stupid Hammer or regular SUV you should have stupidity tax.  My little 2004
Nissan Sentra now makes 40mpg+ due to unloading unnecessary weight, I
removed spare tire as I am covered by 3 years Nissan roadside assiatnce but
that's not an option for used cars going out of the city out of the easy
reach of repair crews Ii had only ione flat shortly after leaving dealer
with a new car, LOL... was so excited I ran over a broken glass bottle not
caring...) and they arrived in 40 mins, fixed everything, anyway removed
rear driver's side seat (not passenger, to distrbute weight evenly), revode
passenger visor, jack, empty trunk etc

Just to show how insane we become as gas prices go up i will soon need to
remove engine!

General Motors has established extensive hydrogen fuel cell research and
development facilities both in the U.S. and Europe. It has produced
AUTOnomy, a concept vehicle that captures the vision and potential of
hydrogen fuel cell technology, and the revolutionary Hy-wire, a vehicle
unmatched in both hydrogen and electronic technology.

The Hy-wire's fuel cell propulsion system is housed entirely in an 11-inch
thick skateboard-like chassis. By-wire controls attached to the chassis
through a single docking port use electrical signals instead of mechanical
links of hydraulics to control steering, acceleration and braking. Without
an engine, steering column or other conventional vehicle components, this
concept provides unprecedented design freedom.

500 GM people and similar numbers of FORD people are working to kill
gasoline in favor of hydrogen and rid our country from ever aggravating
Middlea-East oil dependency.

I must say GM makes more noise than Ford about their achievements but seems
it's Ford who already delievered practical results (Hybrds) and already
operates thousands of hydrogen vehicles in CA, FL, Michicgan, NY, etc for
the government fleets.  My statement doesn't preclude a possibility GM is
hiding something until the time is right (when gas prices reach ridiculous
heights) and will release a revolution to take the lead over Ford, so in
meanwhile they dont want to lose capitalization/investements into current
gas engines.

a.. GM's prototype stationary fuel cell unit already generates power for
GM's New York fuel cell development facility.

a.. In only two years, the power density of GM's fuel cell stack technology
has increased tenfold, while costs have decreased proportionately.

a.. GM's revolutionary fuel cell vehicle, Hy-wire, has no internal
combustion engine, instrument panel, brake or accelerator pedals - but it
does have ample power supplied by a GM fuel cell that runs on hydrogen.

Where do you people get your conclusions?  Hydrogen is the future because I
SAY SO.  Hydrogen will be released by using nuclear energy and pumped
throughout a Hydrostation grid nationwide.  I have two college degrees in
Hydrological sciences

Hydroman

Again on Hydrogen economy, someone raised an obvious point of how to obtain
Hydrogen from the oceans:

Yes i know it takes energy to release energy to our convenient form, because
energy is not created form nothing, basic physic's law!  I iknow, but it's
not the point.  The point you move these energy producing facilities OUT OF
THE CITY, pollution therefor eis not in your face but in a controlled
"sealed" environment just like power plants produce electricity that runs
power grid that charges electric cars that is the answer to people who
complain electric cars still "use energy" that must be produced.  Yes, but
not on my strees, Hydrogen economy moves offensive carcerogenic things out
of our immediate contact into Hydrogen plants where much better
antipollution measures can be taken, ok?

THE SECOND POINT IS THAT FOSSIL FUELS ARE ABOUT TO REACH END OF LIFE (EOL)
AND IT CONSUMES MORE AND MORE MONEY/ENERGY TO SUCK OIL OUT OF EVER DEEPER
WELLS AND MORE REMOTE SEA SHELF.  So why bring problems of producing
Hydrogen up?

The problem is NOT PRODUCING, the problem is DISTIBUTIOn (ie
Infstrustructure), thats is the most serious problem not technology itself.
Infstrustructure means convertiung world's largest economy - USA, MILLIONS
of gas stations ionto mixed gas/hydrogen stations ands safety problems of
pumping volatile hydrogen gas or liquid even more dangerous

I AM SURPIRSED BY THE AMOUNT OF IGNORANCE IN RESPONSE TO MY HYDROGEN POST:

1)
You're not engineer.  pLEASE UNDERSTAND It's not the same Hydrogen scheme
from 60 years  ago, fuel cells have NOTHING to do with 60 year ago they were
trying to BURn hydrogen then and now we acquire energy as a result of
chemical reaction less violent than burning, it's a slow energy release
converrted
into electricty to run clean engines.  ok??  ALso it might be liquid, if you
go by "6- year ago" argument than all computers are unreal because first was
invented MOSFET transistor and then BJT (bipolar) but BJT's at first ruled
for 3 decades, so supposedly MOSFET doesnt deserve tyo live and yet it's the
backbone of modern VLSI design.

2)
ANother moronsaid "not enough hydrogen"!!  DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL??
Hydrogen is THEE MOST ABUNDANT ELELMENT ON TH EPLANET, f**k, people don't
have any education on this board, driving aro9und working with mechanical
things probably no one has any degrees.  FYU:
Hydrogen is relesead from oceanic water, enough for TENS of THOUSANDS of
years of energy required by himans at present level, if present level
increases (obviously) it is still like an ocean vs a drop of water when
comparing to fossil fuels.

Hydrogen powers most of the stars including our Sun, albeit in a different
nucearl reaction, lets not touch on this b ecause some of you will make
another nonsense claim
