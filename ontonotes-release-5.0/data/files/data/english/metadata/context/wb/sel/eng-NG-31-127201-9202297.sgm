Hello All,

Interesting weekend for me.  Nothing crazy just a good, fun weekend.
Something that happened though which was kind of interesting.

I had a home game going on this past Saturday.  There were not that
many people playing I think we had about 5 total so we played in the
kitchen which is right off the front room which is where my computer
is.

So I have this home game going and have the maniac GF's mothers
boyfriend there and early in the tourney (before the second blind
level) I pick up A-Qs and go all in and have maniac to my left and he
calls with 7-2  lol  He does not know that it is the worst hand in
poker, but that is not the point anyway.  I was ahead the whole way
and was screaming for a 2 on the river and got a 7.  I was honestly
hoping he would win though because I had been going back and forth
between my home games and the computer.

So my one buddy is there who always talks me into making stupid
decisions and this day was no ecxeption.  I have about 37.00 on PS
(thanks again BigJim) and have been playing the VERY LLHE ring games
and have played maybe 2-    1.00 tounreys also.  So my buddy talks me
into playing a 4.00 180 person SNG.  This was the first mistake, but
he says come on man lets try to win some decent money (first place I
think is like 220.00 or something)

So I have had a few drinks and say yeah ok why not.  Anyway on to the
point.  I bust out of the home game early and focus my full attention
to the MTT and am playing pretty solid I think.  About an hour or so
later the home game breaks up and people are trying to get another one
going.  I didnt want to play and my one buddy didnt want to play so
everyone just kind of hung out and watched while I played.

It ended with 3 of us pretty much talking out decisions etc.  95% of
the play was my own, but my one buddy gave me moves that I was not
ready to use or comfortable with and most worked out (1 really big one
didnt which dropped me from 23k or so down to 11k)

Anyway I finished in 15th I think and made a little more than double
my buy in when my A-Q ran into a raising war preflop with 6-2
soooooted and finally all the money got in the middle and he runner
runner'd a flush and of course he had like 30k to my 10k or so, but
again that is not the point.

Anyone ever play a tourney with a few friends kind of hanging around
offering advice once in a while on hands?  It was actually pretty fun.

10-1 a bunch of people chime in a call me a stick in the mud, but the
answer is &quot;no&quot;.

It doesn't sound like you intentionally set out to cheat, but that's
what you wound up doing. Some will say it's not a big deal, and,
granted, in the grand scheme of life, there are worse tragedies than
getting a couple of friends to help out a little in a $4 tourney.
However, that doesn't change the essence of what you were doing.

It's a slippery slope - if you do it in a $4 tourney, why not in a $10
one? Then where do you stop - $100? $1000?

The rule of one-player to a hand is there for a reason - to make it an
even match: Your skill against their skill. Not your skill PLUS some
of the skill of your buddy who knows some additional moves or insights
vs. their skill.  If you don't follow the rules, then you're cheating
and therefore you're a cheat (at least in this instance). Whether it's
a 1 cent/2 cent heads-up limit game or a $10,000 buy in tournament is
just semantics.

Now of course, I say that making no judgements about your character.
You probably don't do it all the time, and this was obviously a &quot;fun
time&quot; situation. But when it goes from someone watching you and
ribbing you after you raise all-in or something similar, to someone
giving you &quot;moves&quot;, as you put it, you crossed the line.

Now go forth and sin no more. ;)
(And as pennance, you have to go play a $1 HORSE tournament and only
play the Razz rounds.)

I thought of that for a second, but IMO anyway I am a far superior
player to those who 'helped' so it would stand to reason (in my
example anyway) that they hurt me more than helped me.

No way I would play a tourney that big AND take advice from a few
friends.  Most of the 'help' consisted of preflop play then everyone
shut up and watched what I did because they are not as strong post
flop and didnt want to be the one that screwed up my standings.

I get what you are saying by 'one person per hand', but would you
consider all the poker software that people use to help them while
playing online constitute 'one player'?  I would say the software
gives a bigger edge to someone than a player who is less skilled than
you giving advise on a hand.

I see what you are saying.  Hmmmm.  I have thought on it before and
never really felt like it was a 'morally' bad thing to do.  While
sitting playing on the computer I occasionaly have a few people
hanging around just hanging out and every ONCE in a while will have a
friend say CALL or RAISE, but the majority of the play is MINE alone.

lol  Thanks for not raking me for what you obviously feel as a moral
indiginity I participated in.  I see your points and feel them valid
and actually feel a little bad about it.  Even though like I mentioned
in my post earlier 95% of the play was mine alone and the advise on
one hand I NEVER would of went through with, but had my buddy support
bigtime which cost me half my stack.

On point with your response what would your opinion be on the
following scenario:

You are playing in a tourney and do not want help, but have someone
there who every once in a while will say something like raise or fold
etc while you are playing.  Now of course EVERY possible decision
should cross your mind while you play, but what if that person saying
raise or fold etc makes you think of that option a little more than
you normally would?  Would you still consider that cheating?

And on point again would be my question about tracking software/odds
software/any software that helps to give players edges online.  Would
you consider that cheating as well?

Just curious.

It's not cheating online.  Back in the archives there is a huge thread where
someone made a reference to an entry in Jerrod Ankleman's blog where he
mentioned that he was part of a team that &quot;consulted&quot; each other over the phone
while playing a MTT.  I was of the opinion (at the time) that this violated the
one player to a hand rule, but many including Lee Jones chimed in (I don't
recall if he actually posted or someone emailed him) and said that online and
B&amp;M were different animals, and as such that rule didn't apply to online poker.

Going back to JBK's question, I've done it occassionally, but really don't do it
with my own funds (I like to track results for my own bankroll separately).
There's this one bar I used to play back room poker at and the bartender would
fire up his laptop on slow nights and play and sometimes a couple of us would
crowd around and play it by consensus; I really didn't get much out of it.  I
have played where a group of us would chat on IM and discuss the hands
afterword, I'd learn more on those sessions.

BIG logical hole here.  Skill at game playing does not sum.  Not even
close.  The history of &quot;Expert vs. The Rest of The World&quot; matches at any
number of games demonstrates this.  TROTW tends to play acceptably, but
never brilliantly no matter what simple scheme is used to combine the
individual opinions.  In fact, there are always (almost by definition)
people in TROTW who could have played as well or better individually.

Or put another way, the intelligence of a committee is not the sum of the
intelligence of those on the committee.  On a good day, it might be the
average or mode.

If my opponents want to play against me by committee, I'm glad to oblige
them assuming they make their decisions in a timely manner.  They could
have a room with 10,000 people behind the monitor for all I care.

If you wanted to make TROTW play intelligently, what you would do is
either:
a) combine their opinions in some principled way (such as boosting)
or
b) have them hold a tournament designed to sort by skill, and then have
the winner play

If you are using it while you are playing, yes, I think that's
cheating. It would be akin to playing chess with a chess computer in
the background helping you with moves.  Conversely, I see player notes
that you can make online really a way to counteract the fact that you
can't see people's faces, and thus can't remember them as easily, and
it really does nothing more than help you recall how that player
plays.  Anything beyond that, and you're getting help that is not
permitted.  (As far as the obvious next question of having a poker
book open while you're playing and referring to it?  I don't know,
close call. I guess if they allow it in a live tournament, then fine.
I have no idea if they would - I seem to remember seeing someone at
the WSOP reading SS once.)

Back to the software, obviously, if Stars or FT or someone changed
their rules and said you could have odds software open while you
played, then fine.  IMHO, that's not poker, but as long as those are
the rules everyone who logged on agreed to play by, so be it. No
problem.

And as far as Chris' referral to Lee Jones saying it was ok to consult
with others during a hand, well, if he said that, he's just dead
wrong. There should be no difference live or online.  We're playing
poker online, we're not playing &quot;online poker&quot; as if it were some
different game.

Hmm, my recollection of the match with Kasparov, is the Irina Krush was
essentially marketed at the only voice that counted.  And that the game
was very close in a very deep technical endgame.

Today, the moves would have been better found by computers.   Which I
suppose would be strike 1 against a TROTW match like this, at least in
chess.

But it also showed that games input is essentially boosted by the most
skilled person that the group is aware of.  Then they get additional
&quot;votes&quot; on their move regardless of the quality of other moves.

What really hasn't been shown is a TROTW match that is non-hominem,
which is sort of the point of your whole argument.  So we actually don't
know well really.

What we do know, is that the stock market, para-mutuel trading, sports
betting, and other market-based research tools like for determining
things like popularity and politics, the crowd while not always correct,
and individuals can be stunningly incorrect, are amazingly correct most
of the time.   (Though crowds tend to have stunning herd activity when
dramatic events can happen in the market).

And this is all if the gaming field is level.  Poker is especially
interesting in that it is an incomplete information game.   Additional
information may very well be decisive.  Meaning if the colluders do
nothing else than share hole cards, but otherwise compete as well as
they can individually, then that may be decisive, especially overtime.
This is without any other play trickery.

Believe me, I once felt the way you did.

Can you play more than one table in a cardroom?
Can you play stark naked in a public cardroom?
Can you speak on a phone in a public cardroom while actively in a hand?

It is a different game.  No matter how strongly you feel it isn't the fact is
your opponents for the most part are aware that it's a different game and have
adjusted accordingly.  Hell, adjusted ain't the right word because many online
players cut their teeth online and have yet to set foot in a public cardroom.

I'd suggest you read John Vorhaus's Killer Poker Online to get a primer on some
of the main differences, but remember that was written before the huge poker
explosion so alot of the advice doesn't apply anymore but if anything it'll help
you adjust your mindset that online poker is a different game from live poker.

Your attitude is akin to someone playing B&amp;M and telling the dealer you insist
on playing 4/8 not a bigger game so they shouldn't allow straddles even though
the cardroom allows straddles.  No matter how adamant you are it won't change
the fact that certain things are allowed online that aren't allowed in B&amp;M
poker; email any of the sites you play on with the question to see if they have
rules against people giving you advice while playing online.

This thread really went in a direction I did not foresee.  I am sure
it has been hashed over before, but even though I think it may grey
the lines of cheating and not cheating I think Waynes response about
the sum not being above the mean makes sense.  Now to me anyway If I
felt the people who were giving advise on hands were better than me
then that would probably trigger my morality meter, but as stated I
did not consider the other people there giving advice to be better
players than I am.  I cannot think of a non poker analogy that fits,
but if the players are not as strong is it really that bad to do?

&gt; afterword, I'd learn more on those sessions.

More of what I was looking for.  I really didnt get anything out of
the experience either, but it was just a way to get the other people
at my house involved in something.  I didnt learn anything about how
they play (I already knew all of that) it really didnt help me in the
tourney because I was holding the mouse so the decisions were final
and made by me.  There were about 10 times where people were saying
call call perflop and bam I hit the fold button.

I really consider myself a moral person and even considering it was a
relatively small amount of money I still cant shake the feeling that
maybe I did something very bad on Saturday.

While it was &quot;wrong&quot;, I don't think it was &quot;very bad&quot;.  While I stand
by the slippery slope argument I made above, it was a $4 tourney.  You
probably weren't taking food out of anyone's mouth.  You didn't log on
with the thought of &quot;hey, let's all try to put our heads together to
cheat.&quot; It was just something that appears to have happened because
you let it.  That, and the fact that you're thinking about it now,
means that this is not a huge and irreversible moral failing.

IMO, it was a mistake to do it, yes. But let's be realistic, if
everyone, myself included were to act 100% morally perfectly everyday,
we'd all be walking on water and curing leprosy as well.  In other
words, we're human and we make mistakes.  Some are bigger, some are
smaller.  The key is not doing it again.  IF you can learn from this
one, then, again IMHO, it falls into the &quot;chalk it up to experience
and grow from it&quot; category.

You do the best you can each day, and that's all anyone can ask.

And as to the others who basically said &quot;everyone's doing it&quot;....was
my mother the only one who ever said &quot;Just because everyone's doing it
doesn't make it right.&quot;?  If the rules are changed to allow X, Y or Z,
then fine, knock yourself out.  Until that time, doing X, Y or Z that
is not permitted is cheating, regardless of whether you're the only
one doing it or if 99.999% of the people are doing it.  It's not a
&quot;different game&quot; as far as I can tell.  The rules on each site are
essentially the same as in a live room - one to a hand, no colluding,
no slow playing, etc. etc. If they change it so that three people can
play one account at the same time, as I said before, fine. Then those
are the rules we live by from then on, and everyone knows that going
in.  The problem is when half of the people (or even one person) is
playing by the rules, and others are gaining an unfair advantage by
not.  No matter how you couch it, that's called cheating.

I don't care WHAT the rules are, or frankly whether they are the same
as a live game or not, but everyone should play by the same rules.
Justifying your actions that are contrary to those rules by saying
that everyone else is doing it, and then citing some &quot;unwritten rule&quot;
that it is, or should be, permitted because of this or that, is a cop-
out to the Nth degree.

&gt; Hmm, my recollection of the match with Kasparov, is the Irina Krush was
&gt; essentially marketed at the only voice that counted.  And that the game
&gt; was very close in a very deep technical endgame.
">

My knowledge of chess is somewhat limited at that level, but I seem to
recall four basic points about that game -

1) Kasparov won
2) Kasparov essentially pulled his claws that match because he had lines
he was saving for Kramnik(sp?).  Of course, those lines didn't work out so
well for him, but still...
3) TROTW essentially adopted my strategy b) of choosing a champion in
Krush, although they did it by different means than I suggested.
4) Inability to coordinate on the TROTW's part hurt them seriously.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But it also showed that games input is essentially boosted by the most

&gt; &quot;votes&quot; on their move regardless of the quality of other moves.
">

This may be true in a certain sense, but this &quot;boosting&quot; is hardly
rigorous.  There's much more to boosting than simply giving knowledgeable
voters more votes.  It's also key to re-weight the problems based on
difficulty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What we do know, is that the stock market, para-mutuel trading, sports
&gt; betting, and other market-based research tools like for determining
&gt; things like popularity and politics, the crowd while not always correct,

&gt; of the time.   (Though crowds tend to have stunning herd activity when
&gt; dramatic events can happen in the market).
">

I think the crowd correctness in these cases is largely because they have
tight feedback loops.  The market moves primarily because people move it,
and only secondarily because of outside events.  Ditto popularity,
politics, and the football lines.

While poker does have a feedback loop vulnerable to the same type of
prediction, it's much looser because &quot;outside events&quot; (namely the cards)
have a much bigger influence both on play decisions and results.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And this is all if the gaming field is level.  Poker is especially

&gt; nothing else than share hole cards, but otherwise compete as well as
&gt; they can individually, then that may be decisive, especially overtime.
&gt; This is without any other play trickery.
">

Sharing cards is a totally separate issue from what we're discussing here.
There was only one hand being played by the team.

So, you're saying that 180 person SnG that Annette15 won was not a legit win
because she failed to play by the same rules everyone else followed (namely, the
right to see your own cards)?

Everyone should play by the same rules, and if you violate such a rule you're
punished if caught.  Check the Terms of Service for each online site.  You'll
see other examples of behavior allowed online that's not allowed in B&amp;M.

JBK - you did nothing wrong.  But don't justify it by saying the input of the
others hurt you.  That's like saying you're okay to kick your golf ball away
from a tree but it didn't hurt you because if rolled into a sand trap.

Johnny - Back then I was about as stubborn as you; to the point of almost giving
up online poker if such &quot;transgressions&quot; were allowed.  But, it got me thinking
that the 2 games are fundamentally different.  About as different as water polo
and horses polo.  They resemble each other, but the playing field and tools used
are vastly differently and while there are similarities, the fundamental
differences are such that they need to be treated as separate games.

Please cite one major online room where they have a &quot;one player to a hand&quot;
rule.  As long as you're not breaking other rules (colluding, multi-accounting,
etc.) I don't think you'll find such a rule.

The arguement used by Lee Jones and others, and I'm still not 100% convinced
it's an adequate reason, but they say that because it's impossible to enforce
such a rule, they won't have one.

At the time I didnt think anything was wrong with what I was doing.  I
was about 2/3 the way through a 12 of New Castle (like I said this was
a home game/party to start)  After reading the first response it hit
me that 'maybe' I did something immoral.  I thought on it some more
and thought yeah I am pretty sure I did something immoral.  I then
thought to justify and said well I am better than they are and they
were probably hurting me more than helping (actually I KNOW they hurt
me more than helped because of that one pot I mentioned where I was
sittin top 5 stack with about 25 people left and had that stack cut in
half following the advice of one of my friends that I NEVER would have
done myself)  Getting to that point was WAY more me than it was them
so I guess I tried to justify my way out of it.

And I am not taking back anything I said, but to make this part of the
story more clear I was sitting playing, I did have my friend play a
couple hands for me while I went to the bathroom, but other than that
it was all me.  And while they were there giving insight etc I think
the 'help' they were offering is being taken out of context.

It was a fun time, but it was more like them saying hey man call that
preflop and me saying no way and folding.  Or I do recall 2 situations
where I played different because of them that helped me out.  One was
a continuation bet into 3 callers on the turn when I was thinking of
shutting down (it won me the pot) and another when it was an overbet
on a scary board with KK that I was also thinking of shutting down on
and ended up winning the pot.  And the last one that had me potting
the bet every street when I KNEW I was going to get called down when I
had an unimproved AK that COST me half my stack.

I love how I feel bad about something and then justify it to make
myself feel SOOOO much better lol.

It is snowing here and it is sticking!  Big ol huge fluffy
snowflakes.  HoHoHo  or wait  I mean HaHaHa.----  Did you read that

Back up to 70 today after a nice cool spell that lasted from Wednesday night
until this afternoon.

Wed. before Thanksgiving it was 87 and people complaining because while we're
used to warm weather, even that was a bit warm for this time of the year.  Then
a cold front moved in and we had lows in the 40's and highs in the 50's from
Thursday until now (I think it was actually in the 30's predawn this morning).

&gt; I won't call you a stick-in-the-mud.

&gt; &gt; It doesn't sound like you intentionally set out to cheat, but that's
&gt; &gt; what you wound up doing. Some will say it's not a big deal, and,
&gt; &gt; granted, in the grand scheme of life, there are worse tragedies than
&gt; &gt; getting a couple of friends to help out a little in a $4 tourney.
&gt; &gt; However, that doesn't change the essence of what you were doing.

&gt; But I will say that you are wrong.  What JBK did was not cheating.  There
&gt; is no &quot;one player to a hand&quot; rule online.

Well, I stand corrected.  I actually went and read all the TOS last
night, and indeed, no one player to a hand rule. (Although it's funny
that FT's is almost verbatim to PS's in certain parts - some lazy
lawyer there.) There is some loose language in the TOSs that says you
will play ethically, etc., so as far as original question, I suppose
an argument could be made that this would include using only YOUR
skill, etc., but that's probably not a winning argument if everyone
understands that it is allowed (as I obviously had not).

Still, I hate this &quot;rule&quot;.  Isn't the argument that &quot;we couldn't stop
it anyway&quot; a very weak one on which to base this lack of a rule?  I
mean, by that logic, if someone develops a program that could run in
the background and tell you what to do each hand, but is undetectable,
then shouldn't that be allowed under the same logic?  &quot;We can't stop
it so we'll allow it.&quot;

What if I'm a rich guy and I hire Phil Ivey to stand behind be and
coach me on every hand.  The players at my table will think they're
playing against me, but they're really playing against Ivey.  You
can't tell me that I wouldn't have an unfair advantage there, but it
would be within the &quot;rules&quot;.

So basically, the question is, since when has the difficulty of
stopping something had an effect on whether it's right or wrong?

That is precisely where Chris' &quot;different games&quot; argument comes in.
Online poker is a completely different games than live poker.

In live poker, you have verbal and physical Tells to rely on, you can
straddle and restraddle, there are kill pot games, and you can only play
at one table at a time, even if you were capable of keeping up with more,
you cannot use an electronic device while playing.

Online poker is different in that you can play multiple tables,
tournaments and cash games at the same time, there are no straddles or
kills, software may be used as an aid to play, and there is no rule that
states one player to a hand.  Thus, playing with more than one player to a
hand is not a question of right or wrong.

To counter your specific question, I pose one of my own:  Would it be
better for online sites to use invasive technology (screen scrapers, hard
drive analyses, etc), to determine if a player is using software to help
his game or IM windows to chat/collude with other players?  At what point
does the tradeoff between higher security become a gross invasion of
privacy?

Not saying I agree with this, but the &quot;invasion of privacy&quot; question can be
settled easily by the online sites by adding to their TOS a statement saying
something to the effect of, &quot;By agreeing to be bound by these TOS the player
agrees that he has no expectation to privacy while playing on our site and
acknowledges that we will implement any cheating countermeasures blah blah blah
up to and including the use of software that is capable of reading any damn
thing on your hard drive etc.&quot;.  Not sure how many would actually agree to that
but as has been shown in employers accessing employees emails if there is no
expectation of privacy then there can be no invasion of privacy.
