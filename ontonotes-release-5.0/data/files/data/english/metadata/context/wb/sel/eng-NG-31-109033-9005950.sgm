It seems to me the P-38 dominated the Pacific theater -- the two ace of aces
in
WW2 both flew P-38's (Bong and McGuire) and according to wikipedia:
The P-38 was credited with destroying more Japanese aircraft than any other
USAAF fighter.
, but how did it do in the European theatre? It seems to me the P-38L had a
good
top speed, fair armament, unmatched maximum dive speed and amazing ROC.
Could it be said that the best twin-engined fighter of the war was the
P-38L?

To give a quick summary:

The P-38 had virtues, but it also had problems, which showed up more
in Europe than in the Pacific.  It was a product of California, and
had some teething problems in colder areas like Europe (unlike most
areas in the Pacific war).  It was considerably more expensive than
the P-51, and required more training and expertise to fight in
effectively.

These limited its European service to some extent, although if not
for the P-51 it presumably would have seen lots of service as the
standard long-range bomber escort.

I would say that it was the best twin-engined day fighter of the war.

Apparently when the P-38 made its debut in Europe escorting bombers into
Germany, they slaughtered the German defence fighters because they had never
experienced anything like it. But after awhile they developed counter
measures against the P-38.

Not so well; aerodynamic problems hitting the compressability limits
of the airframe in high-altitude dives as well as engine output and
reliability were critical problems for the pre-L models of the P-38.
As a result it had been allocated to the 9th Air Force in the ETO for
lower-level tactical operations by the time the L model with dive
brakes to overcome compressability problems appeared in June 1944.

The P-38 was dominant in the Pacific, but mainly because it had the
range needed before the longer-range variants of other fighters (the
P-47N and P-51D) appeared to give it any competition.  It certainly
outclassed the P-39 and P-40 on performance grounds as well as range.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

The L didn't have an 'unmatched dive speed', at least compared to the
Spitfire, Thunderbolt or Mustang.  It used dive flaps to reduce
velocity in the dive and thus avoid hitting the compressability limit
of the airframe.  The other fighters I've mentioned could all exceed
the maximum dive speed of the P-38L.

In my opinion, yes.

The British only ever got three Lightning I's (without turbochargers -
they had mechanical superchargers) for testing in the spring and
summer of 1942.  None of them were ever used operationally.

In the early 1970's I belonged to a flying club with an ex-WWII
fighter pilot.  He told me he had flown both the P-38 and the
P-51 and preferred the 51 because it had more acceleration.
(He said the P-51 had more &quot;oomph&quot;.)

I don't know if he had much time in the P-38, but he was a very
good pilot and said he had four kills before being himself
brought down in a collision with an Me-109 and spending the
rest of the war in a prison camp.

One thing that had little to do with performance in the air was the
fact that even at the height of production, they almost hand built.
Several systems in the a/c did not lend themselves to mass production
methods of the time.

I have heard, from people who's opinion I respect, that starting with
the late &quot;J's&quot; the P-38 was the equal of any a/c flying in air to air
combat provided it was flown by a well trained pilot. I suppose that
was another issue as well. It was not an easy a/c to lean to fly well.
Much more complex then any of the single engine fighters. Also, a few
more cockpit controls to manage during combat.

The RAF never really had any P-38s.  They ordered 143 Lightning Is which
were essentially P-38Es without the turbosuperchargers but only 3 were
actually delivered to the Brits.

Testing demonstrated their deficiencies as a combat aircraft and the
remainder of the order was diverted to the USAAF where they were used as
trainers under the designation P-322.

SFAIK, none of the Lightning Is or P-322s were ever used operationally.

There was a further British order for 524 supercharged Lightning IIs
which were were equivalent to P-38F/Gs but none were ever delivered to
the RAF. All of the 495 eventually built were retained by the USAAF as
P-38Fs and Gs.

Yes, but the RAF rejected the Lightning I at the end of 1941, long
before they tested one in the UK.  The USAAF converted most of their
ex-Lightning I P-332's to P-332-II standard by installing
unturbocharged V-1710-F engines instead of the original V-1710-C15's.

I'd never thought of that, but it's probably true. Although, I

That was a failing of most US fighters, across the board: had fewer
automatic mixture and boost controls than the RAF, Luftwaffe,
and even IJN types had. While it allowed a good pilot to get the
very most out of an engine, an average or poor one, less
performance and  far more failures from burned up engines.

If you want to call that a failing. You could call it a virtue. Simple
to operate meant that more pilots could reach proficiency more
quickly.

All the countries you mentioned, Britain, Japan, and Germany, selected
very closely for fighter pilots -- at least pre war and early war. One
did not have to be a college grad and/or &quot;regular&quot; military (or even
an officer) to get a cockpit in the US. Same thing applies to the a/c
they built. While the others will building Jaguars and Porshes and
RX7's with wings the US was building Plymouths and Fords with wings --
big heavy sturdy powerful things. Besides being able to haul lots of
weapons, they did a good job of bringing their pilots back. Many US
pilots got themselves shot up early in thier careers but made it back
and were able to make use and profit from the experience.

But that's the wrong way to analyze the problem.

All other things being equal, doubling the number of engines doubles the
probability of losing one, either through battle damage (twice as many
places a hit might disable an engine) or through mechanical failure
(twice as many critical parts which could fail).

If the chances of getting home in a single engined aircraft with one
engine out are zero and the chances of getting home in a twin-engined
aircraft with one engine out are 40%, you're still better off in the
single engined aircraft as the chances of a engine failure are half the
chances of such a failure in a twin-engined aircraft.

I'd think an extensive analysis of the probabilities of losing an engine
in a P-38 versus the probabilities of an engine failure in contemporary
single-engined fighters and of the probabilities of a P-38 making it
home (or at least to a friendly airbase) with one engine out would be
required before one could claim that a pilot &quot;was better off&quot; in the
twin-engined fighter.

It's not at all a foregone conclusion.

None, but I doubt that a P38 limping home on one engine (presumably
the &quot;right&quot; one, which would be the port one, as otherwise he would
have no electricity) had a chance at all if this happens over enemy

Since we were comparing fighters, it's not meaningless. Having two
engines was an advantage over those with one.....did it make the P-38
better? No, but it was something to consider. Kind of like how a P-47
could take more damage than a P-51....then we'd have to argue which

That's nowhere near a given. Many damaged fighters made it home.
Maybe the damaged fighter took flak damage. Maybe it had undamaged
escorts. Maybe it could slip into a cloud bank. Maybe the German
fighters kept after the bombers after putting the fighter out of
action.
All I'm saying is having two engines was an advantage over only one
where engine damage was concerned.

Don't know how many P-38s the RAF got, but my landlord in Germany was
a Luftwaffe pilot during WWII. He was shot down a couple of times by
P-38s with RAF markings on missions against Malta. He had a pretty

Depends on whether it's managed to escape combat by then.  There are
very real advantages to having more than one engine.

However, I was at a museum several years ago where they had a P-38.
The guide had talked to former P-38 pilots, and said that one big
problem was bailing out.  Apparently, the standard idea was to climb
out of the cockpit and drop from the trailing edge of the wing, or
to invert the aircraft, but most pilots figured they weren't going to
get out of it.  (Any more reliable sources of information on that?)

It was an interesting aircraft, but it did have problems.

Car analogies as usually bad and in this case as well. The Spitfire and
Bf 109 certainly were not the equivalent of a Jaguar or a Porsche.
Especially the Bf 109 was a relatively small and simple fighter and
quite well suited for mass production, which was rare for German weapons
of the late 1930s. It wasn't particularly fragile either. The Spitfire
had its thin wing, but otherwise it was hardly an overly sophisticated

Those things are not necessarily related to each other or the size of
the fighter. For example Soviet fighters were small and typically could
not carry a lot of weapons, but they were very well armored and had
other survivability measures. In fact the I-153 and late model I-16
fighters were one of the first production fighters with actual armor to
protect the pilot and Soviets also introduced self-sealing fuel tanks
among the first. The LaGG-3 and La-5/7 were fitted with a system that
injected inert exhaust gases to the fuel tank in order to reduce the
probability of a fuel fire.

Idon't think so.

First, the chance of having one engine damaged
by attack is not linearly proportional to the
number of engines. If this was true, a four-
engine bomber would be as likely to have two
engines shot out as a twin-engine bomber was
to lose one engine.

Yes, engine target area is doubled. But an
attacking fighter will shoot at the center
of mass of the target. If the target has one
engine, that engine will be in his bull's-eye.
If it has two engines, both will be in the
field of fire, but they can't both be in the
center of concentration.

Or consider flak: when a shell bursts near
a multi-engine plane, it's not likely to be
the same distance from all engines. Let's
guess that the &quot;target&quot; envelope is within
10 meters of an engine, and that the engine
is a spherical blob 1 m across.

For a single-engine plane that means a
target envelope that is a sphere 10.5
meters in radius. For a twin-engine plane,
the target envelope is two overlapping
spheres. A shell in the overlap has a
chance of disabling either engine, but
the overlap is where the fuselage is -
a shell there is fatal anyway.

Second: let's consider malfunction. We'll
consider that a linear risk also, and assume
3% risk of engine failure any time during
the mission.

The mission has three phases: approach,
engagement, withdrawal. That is, flight
from base area to the battle area, patrol
and combat in the battle area, and flight back
to base. If a single-engine plane loses
power during any phase, it's lost. A twin-
engine plane is at risk only during engagement.
except in the unlikely event of losing both
engines to breakdown.

Would the Luftwaffe scramble a fighter to go after a

It's not at all clear that an &quot;engine out&quot; P-38 was &quot;at risk only during
an engagement.&quot;

Losing an engine at anytime put the aircraft at risk of loss.

For instance,

&quot;Another problem seldom mentioned was the single generator problem. If a
generator was lost or a low battery the Curtis Electric prop would lose
the Dynamic Brake and go to extreme Low Pitch. This was called a RUN
AWAY. It could happen on Take Off with a low battery. Since you couldn't
feather it set up a lot of drag making it difficult to make it around to
land. The Killer situation was to lose the Generator or lose the engine
with the Generator on it while 2 or 3hrs into Germany. Procedure was to
SET the Props then turn off all electrical power. Then momentarily turn
it back on to reset the props as needed. Being sure everything
electrical was also turned off -- No Radios. The forgotten thing was you
were at altitude and the OAT was -60degrees and the little old battery
was cold soaked. Hence, dead as a dog. Result, with a lot of altitude
you have less than an hour with one or two props in RUNAWAY.

&quot;I have no statistics to back me up on this, but believe, that more
P-38s were lost from this than any other factor including combat. This
simple problem did not receive attention until April, '44.&quot;

Comments of Captain Arthur Heiden, P-38 pilot.

http://home.att.net/~ww2aviation/P-38-2.html

From these comments, a RUNAWAY an hour or more from home, whether on
the way out, on the way home, or during &quot;engagement&quot; was going to be
invariably fatal to the aircraft (if not the pilot) - despite the
remaining functioning engine.

P-38s (until the &quot;L&quot; models and a few late production &quot;J&quot;s) had a
generator on only the left engine.  A loss of the left engine would
inevitably result in a loss of the generator and the resultant RUNAWAY
condition.

He may have been shot down by P-38s but they were not carrying British

The Free French operated a small number of photo/recon Lightnings (F-4s

it possible for a lot more people to drive.  There are advances
since then, such as automatic choke, automatic transmission, and
anti-lock brakes.  These make driving cars easier.  These also
make the cars more complex.

So, it would seem that the US aircraft were analogous to cars
with manual chokes and stick shifts, while aircraft of other
countries were analogous to more modern cars.  Not an advantage for
the US.

It also maens you get pilots qualified and flying sooner. That is not

advantages was two engines. That didn't make it better than the

I've talked to two P-38 pilots that preferred it because of its
twin engines. They both flew over the Pacific and both said their
opinion might be different if they flew over Europe. The P-38 was more
than a match for any Japanese fighters and the two engines gave them a
sense of security.....real or imagined? I'm not sure, but they both
gave two engines as the reason they preferred the 38.
One said that many pilots' biggest fear....and I'm assuming his....
was ditching in the middle of the ocean without much hope of rescue.

I think there is at least a tendancy on the part of pilots to want the
best (i.e. highest performance) flying machine rather then the best
(i.e. most likely to win in combat and get home again). Faster,
higher, better turning. From the several WW II fighter pilot memiors I

rather then more/bigger guns or more pilot protection. He likely
doesn't think he going to take any battle damage and can bring down
any enemy with a vary few rounds. Fighter pilot &quot;attitude&quot;.

Much the same could be said of the Japanese pilots. The Zero was a

That's an interesting observation.

The highly skilled pilot is more confident and wants the
edge in combat.  He's going to fly aggressively and go
after the enemy.  Pilots with less skill and aggressiveness
may find combat bewildering anyway and are interested in
what they perceive as a safe plane.

My own piloting experience is in sailplanes.  I'm not a
particularly good pilot and not competent to race sailplanes.
Although I fly an old racing plane (Libelle H-301), I
sometimes long for something simpler, less twitchy, more
stable, and with more low speed control, better vision,
and more emphasis on easy takeoffs and landings.

The racing pilots on the other hand are into pure
performance.  One once told me he'd rather fly into the
ground at 80 knots than lose a race.  They take chances
that would give me a heart attack and rely on their
superior skill to get them through all difficulties.
Those guys indeed have &quot;attitude&quot;.

In a perfect air force, guys like me would be assigned
to fly bombers and guys like the racing pilots would fly
the fighters.

I served in the ETO. And we rarely ever saw a P-38. The sky was filled
with Spiits, P-47's, and of couirse p-51's. Most of the P-38's were
moved down to the Med theatre  with the Hurricanes..

Why are you discounting the Me110 and 210?

They were not really sucessfull, but they were definitely operational
