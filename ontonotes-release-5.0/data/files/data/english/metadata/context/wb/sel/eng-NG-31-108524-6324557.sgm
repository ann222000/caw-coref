3C273 - Quasar in Virgo

Dear Friends,

The quasar 3C273 in Virgo is the brightest visible quasar from Earth and
with a magnitude of 12.8 is also visible with average amateur equipment.
Lying at a distance of two BILLION light-years away, it is the furthest
any amateur equipment can reach (and especially right from one's backyard).

Further details including an image are available at
http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-DSO-QSO-3C273.htm .

Anthony.

Hi

A lovely image...
..but for example http://www.guildfordas.org/observing/quasar_episode.html
~7 billion light years (I am not a member of the Guildford AS).

There are apparently quite a few others as well as AGNs that are observed,
imaged and monitored by amateurs.

Regards
Paul

It is a great shot. Unfortunately your diffraction spikes line up with
where the jet might hope to be seen (roughly diametrically oppposite
the fainter of the two close in stars. I suspect it may be beyond
impossible for amateur kit to capture by it might be interesting to
try for...

Hi Anthony,

It's an astounding shot - Razor sharp.

I always like to show this one to the kids at star parties
and tell them it's two billion LY out there.

Keep up the good work,

Ben

Here's another - Q1634+706 in Draco.  Light travel distance: 9 billion light
years.  Distance now: 13 billion light years.  Observed in a 10" and should
be visible in an 8".

Antoni, beautiful, as always. Do you by any chance have the correct image
somewhere lurking along with the inverse image? I could not find it anywhere
and I'd be interested in seeing that as well.

Thanks.

I saw it in a 15" Obsession (I think) one night and I was struck by
it's blue colour, though that may have been an illusion.  Fascinating
to think these things are so far away and odd at the same time.  Why
are there no closer quasars?

I believe the current theory is that they are the nucleus of very young
galaxies. Why there are no young galaxies in our direct neighbourhood is
left as an exercise for the reader ;-)

There is also PHL 1811, discovered in 2001.  It is the second brightest
quasar (visible in a 6"):

Hi Anthony:

Nope.

There are a number of more distant QUASARs visible in amateur
instruments--and I don't mean 25 - 30-inch behemoth's either.

I've seen the double QUASAR (QSO 0957+561 A/B) in my humble 12.5-inch
scope (albeit from the dark skies of Prude Ranch).

This object in Ursa Major was seen (though NOT EASILY, and not
resolved as double) despite a distance that may approach 7.5 billion
LY.

Hi:

Not much of an exercise. It's probable that these objects and their
galaxies are the product of the early universe. In our "modern times"
locale, you ain't gonna see QUASARs--the period of galaxy formation is
long over.

Yup. I just wanted to avoid the usual "if the universe is expanding..." or
"Einstein was wrong..." stuff.

But maybe Oriel will chime in anyway. ;-)

Dear Friends,

A huge thanks for the various recommendations surrounding other
interesting quasars and which I will mark down for immediate imaging.

Nevertheless, I am delighted to see the thread that has been generated
and the really cool tips (targets) that have ensued. I am quite eager to
pursue PC 1247+3406 in Canes Venatici which I think (?) is the further
quasar found so far (over 12 billion light-yrs away and at magnitude 20.4).

Can someone enlighten me how to convert the redshift to percent of the
speed of light? Also, Ioanni, I do have the regular image (white on black).

Anthony.

Anthony,

In SR the redshift formula is:

1 + z = SQRT[(c + v)/(c - v)]

Solving for v (recession velocity) yields:

v = [(1 + z)^2  -1/(1 + z)^2  +1]

An easier keypunch is:

v = (1 + z)^2 c - c/ (1 + z)^2 +1

Ben

Thanks Ben! I have a little Excel spreadsheet with the 15 brightest
quasars (for me to image) and I have added the above formula so that I
can convert at will when preparing the associated webpage for each new
quasar image.

McGaha, J. March 2006.  The Outer Limits: Observing Quasers at High
Redshifts. S&amp;T. 111(3):69-72

for a list of quasers visible to amateurs.  Here's my short list of
the five brightest:

V_mag   Cat_IdSimbad_Link       Con     J2000_Position
14.86   QSO J0407-1211  Eri     J040748.43-121136.7
12.86   3C273                   Vir     J122904.80+020307.2
15      QSO J1436+6336  Dra     J143645.80+633637.9
14.66   QSO J1634+7031  UMi     J163428.99+703132.3
15.85   QSO B1946+768   Dra     J194400.00+765400.0

"Distance then" for these objects are:

Dist. 5.5B l/yr (z=0.57) per McGaha2006.
Clark note: brightest quasar;  dist. 1.96B l/y (z=0.158) per
McGaha2006.
Dist. 10.4 l/yr (z=2.07) per McGaha2006.
Dist. 8.9B l/yr (z=1.33) per McGaha2006.
Dist. 11.5 l/yr (z=3.00) per McGaha2006.

&gt; Dear Friends,

&gt; The quasar 3C273 in Virgo is the brightest visible quasar from Earth and
&gt; with a magnitude of 12.8 is also visible with average amateur equipment.
&gt; Lying at a distance of two BILLION light-years away, it is the furthest
&gt; any amateur equipment can reach (and especially right from one's backyard).

&gt; Further details including an image are available at
&gt; http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-DSO-QSO-3C273.htm .

Sounds like a drug ad commercial. Eversite and Moxycondrhindrum will keep you
spry and at the teescope to
view that quazar. My God I need a break from civilsation!

&gt;&gt; Anthony,

&gt;&gt;     In SR the redshift formula is:

&gt;&gt;       1 + z = SQRT[(c + v)/(c - v)]

&gt;&gt; Solving for v (recession velocity) yields:

&gt;&gt;      v = [(1 + z)^2  -1/(1 + z)^2  +1]

&gt;&gt; An easier keypunch is:

&gt;&gt;    v = (1 + z)^2 c - c/ (1 + z)^2 +1

&gt;Thanks Ben! I have a little Excel spreadsheet with the 15 brightest
&gt;quasars (for me to image) and I have added the above formula so that I
&gt;can convert at will when preparing the associated webpage for each new
&gt;quasar image.

Why? The answer will be wrong for redshifts greater than about 3.

Interesting comment, as I am currently trying to image the jet myself
(no success "yet"). The jet is very faint, approx. mag 21 according to
this site, which shows it faintly visible in a 3x5 min exposure taken
with 16" telescope by famous "amateur" Jack Newton:
