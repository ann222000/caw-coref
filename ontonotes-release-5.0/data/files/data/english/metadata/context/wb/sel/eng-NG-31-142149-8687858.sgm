ChimpzillAhmadinejad is a world class idiot. What a wonderful thing that he
appeared at Columbia University! He has so effectively proven himself a
fanatical leftist idiot, that all leftists will be proud of him. Buffoon
Chimp Ahmadinejad is nothing more than a petty and cruel dictator according
to Columbia University President Lee Bollinger. Hell, I have been telling
all of you ass-kissing neo-kook leftists that the Monkey of the Middle East
is a Hitler/Stalin/Milosevic/Mao tse-dung murdering son of a bitch for
years. He is an embarrassment to humanity. Let us hope something happens to
his plane on the way back to Iran.

And just think, Ahmadinejad's babbling non sense enabled him to become
president of Iran.  I am happy that the students laughed at some of
his ridiculous comments.  I'm sure he was taken back by that... since
he is so &quot;self righteous&quot;.

You are obviously avoiding the question! When Saddam was in charge of Iraq
and usiong chemicals against tyhe Kurds the US traded with him and shook his
hand. There were no standards with respect to being a dictator. The Us
subsequently made big pals with their fundamentalist chums in saudi.

BUT NOW you are suggesting that the President if Iran is to be opposed
BECAUSE he is in a fundie dictatorship! So why are you applying standards to
Iran which you ignored even in the case of Saddam.

It seems your only answer is &quot;it didnt suit us&quot;. so you basically are saying
that something is acceptable if it is in your own self interest! How then is
that any different from or better than any dictator or fundamentalist?

AMY GOODMAN: President Bush has not commented on the recent election in
Saudi Arabia that was dominated by Islamist groups. Women were not allowed
to participate. Your comment.

AS'AD ABUKHALIL: I mean, again, there's absolutely no power that is attached
to these councils, and of course, 50% of the population are not allowed, and
50% of the seats are appointed by the Royal Family itself. So, I mean, the
Royal Family just want to make sure just in case that there are some
dissident voices that may infiltrate through, but they're doing all of their
best to prevent that from happening.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; righteous or being a dictator isn't enough to oppose someone
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; then why do you claim it as the sole reason for opposing
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Iran's president? THAT is my point!

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You are obviously quite naive. Saddam wasn't supported. He was
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; used. Are you that dense?

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You are obviously avoiding the question! When Saddam was in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; charge of Iraq and usiong chemicals against tyhe Kurds the US
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; traded with him and shook his hand. There were no standards with
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; respect to being a dictator. The Us subsequently made big pals
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with their fundamentalist chums in saudi.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You are obviously a dunce.

&gt; Attacking the person rather than the argument they make is a sure sign
&gt; that you are losing the argument.

What makes you an authority on argument? The argument comes from the
person, therefor the person is as valid a target of attack as the
argument itself. Why are you so naive? Why can't you come up with
arguments of your own? Why do you always dovetail yourself in on
anothers arguments? Are you that insecure in your values that you cannot
formulate an argument of your own or make a hypothesis yourself? Why are
you limp wristed leftist?

An ad hominem argument, also known as argumentum ad hominem (Latin:
&quot;argument to the person&quot;, &quot;argument against the man&quot;) consists of replying
to an argument or factual claim by attacking or appealing to an irrelevant
characteristic about the person making the argument or claim, rather than by
addressing the substance of the argument or producing evidence against the
claim. It is most commonly used to refer specifically to the ad hominem
abusive, or argumentum ad personam, which consists of criticizing or
personally attacking an argument's proponent in an attempt to discredit that
argument. A reductio ad Hitlerum argument can be seen as a special case of

not answering questions. You as usual failed to support it. Asking you a
question like &quot;can you provide evidence to support this claim&quot; is not making
a claim. Nor is &quot;no I didn't&quot; as if anything it is a counter claim and the

Why do you attack the person? Aren't you against attacking the
messenger? You said you were. Why are you posting self-serving leftist
gobbledygook about your benevolence towards others? Can't you see how
self-serving you are? It is nothing more than gainsaying.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;You spew out the same crap
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that comes out of the mouth of Ahmadinejab

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Really? Can you show where ANYWHERE that I agreed with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ANYTHING Ahmadinejab stated?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Whether you agree with him or not is insignificant.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Actauallly it is THE whole point you are making! Now you are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only contradicting yourself! On the one hand you state I say the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; same thing and on the other you say I don't! How can Iu state
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sometihing that I support if I don't actually believe it and say
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i don't believe it?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So then you do agree with the Chimp of Tehran.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't know what you are getting at. Why don't you actually state
&gt;&gt; &gt; each point he stated one by one and ask me if I agree with any?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Im not aware what you are saying I agree with.

&gt;&gt; Why are you lying again?

&gt; Yoyu can't show ANYWHERE where I agreed with anything he siad. That
&gt; isnt a lie.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; By the way please look up &quot;guilt by association&quot; . If I happen
&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; to
&gt; like
&gt;&gt; &gt; a portrait or music Hitler liked that doesnt mean I am a NAZI

&gt;&gt; Why do you make such foolish statements? Is it because you are a
&gt;&gt; fool?

&gt; Again you presuppose and laod the question. Please look up @guilt by
&gt; association@

Why are you getting upset?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Why do you support the

&gt; liar!
