I am curious how you all keep your 'helpful' QI's safe in your sewing area.
Until now, I have not had to worry about it.  My Darius kitty had decided at
the start he will only worry about checking the final project for comfort
because it is too much work to help with the rest of it, unless you are in
the middle of laying out blocks on the floor/bed then he may test those to
see how the comfort factor is coming along.  Samson isn't interested in any
of it (with the exception of an occasional comfort test) so long as he can
lay near by.  For him I need to worry more about my safety (tripping over
him), than his.  My new kitty QI, Cheetah, is MUCH more involved than the
other two.  She wants to climb on my cutting table, ironing board and sewing
machine table and I worry about her getting hurt.  I can't close my area off
because it is in the corner of a dining room with no doors.  I do keep
things picked up when I'm not sewing, so that isn't a concern.  It is just
when I'm working on things and she is 'trying to help' that is the issue.  I
do try to keep an eye on what she is doing and I remove her when she decides
to 'help me cut' or when she thinks she wants to check out my iron.  Right
now she is just 3 1/2 mo. and is still very curious about everything and
very energetic and playful so I don't know if she will eventually start
finding a spot to observe or will always 'be involved'.  What are some of
the measures you do to keep your helpers safe?

Lilly cat got all tangled up in the sewing machine thread one night.
Good thing the machine was in the bedroom corner and she made a fuss
and we were able to help her.  Had she been in the other room and not
had help it might not have been such an ok outcome.  SInce then I try
and keep covers on my machines. I even had to make a new cover for the
serger.  SHe reached in the hand hold opening and pulled the thread
through there.  I have the rest of the thread in a cabinet or on a
higher wall rack.  I keep cutters closed unless I am using them and
hung on a key holder up in the closet.  You may need to put her in
another room while you rotary cut or run the machine.   I was told if
a cat touches the iron once they won't do that again.  I try to keep
a close eye on kitty location when the iron is on.  Mine sits in a rack
on the end of the board so most of the accessible parts of it are not
hot if a cat gets too close.   Maybe if you have a basket with some
fleece in it handy to lie in and Darius might like that?  It gets better
as they get older but Maki still likes to be right in the middle of
things a lot!

I'm allergic to cats, so I can't offer kitty-specific advice ... but what
about setting up a nice bed for her in the corner of your room? Perhaps
keeping a few special toys in the bed (toys she can only have in the room in
the bed) that she loves to play with might help?

All QIs that I know of (canine and feline alike) love us and want our
approval. If you teach her early that she won't get mommy's approval when
she climbs on the ironing board - but she will if she stays OFF, she'll
learn quickly.

Worst comes to worst, when she gets up on the board, tell her to &quot;Get Down,&quot;
and take her down, put her in the basket, look very pleased and give her a
tiny treat and tell her what a good girl she is for getting down.

That is, of course, assuming that you can train kitties like you can
doggies. :-)

Winston (Mr.Cute by Polly!) has been told by Lulu that he is no longer
welcome in the sewing room!  Lulu has a box lid near the doorway where
she spends her time and she will not permit him to pass her lair - he
has decided that the best spot for him to observe is from the doorway
sitting on top of a large air cleaner - same idea that he has when I
am in the kitchen, he has a tall box outside the door where he can
watch me without getting in the way.  Lulu has also decided that she
has to spend her nights in the kitchen and she doesn't think that
Winston should have his eating station in there - it is a 'cat and
mouse' game for him to grab his food and run.
I have set up a spare ironing board next to my sewing machine desk
that Katie will use to be close to me - Winston will attempt to share
this space with her sometimes when he thinks that he can get away with
it - he is not so much interested in the sewing as in the quilting of
something and he does know the difference (I think that the aroma of
batting has that effect on him!)  When he was younger, he couldn't
resist thread and would take off with it but I have learned to cover
the machine and remove the thread cone from the back of the machine.
I remember turning from the ironing board one evening after hearing a
whimper, Winston was clinging upside down underneath the other ironing
board - his claws were holding him through the holes in the metal - I
still haven't figured out how he had managed to get into that
predicament in the space of a few seconds.  He wouldn't have been able
to extricate himself without hurting himself - he hasn't actually
bothered me much since this episode.  I think that part of the safe
training involves giving your QI a place of their own and having a
sound or a signal that he/she recognizes as a reprimand in any
situation.
However, you attempt to safety train your kitten, it takes lots of
patience and repetition.  Let her have other toys to distract her from
the iron cord and keep sharp items (like scissors, rotary cutters,
seam rippers, etc.) in a box or tray away from the table edge.
Another tip for yourself - check your garbage bin for any items that
might have been played with by kittie that have fallen in the bin -
before tossing the contents!  I've lost several good items that way in
the past.

Everything is a toy to a kitten, and the kitten may or may not grow
out of it.  One of my cats is permanently a kitten mentally, another
one learned a bad trick after he was grown due to a poorly designed
pet toy, and that trick is now a weird habit.

I must pick up all stray bits of threads, and put away all thread
spools and bobbins after sewing.  My Samson thinks thread is kitty
spaghetti and will chew and possibly eat it. I have even caught him
trying to bite the thread right off the sewing machine. It is not
enough to put the stray thread bits into an open trash can because
Samson will try to dig the threads out, so I have to hide them below
other items of trash while he isn't looking rather like one throws
away a 6 year old's drawing that has been attached to the refrigerator
door for the last 6 months.   His favorite &quot;flavor&quot; is black but he
will go for whatever he can reach.  Thankfully he only chews
cords/thread under 1/8 inch diameter.  Unfortunately that means he
will chew things that range from thread to silk cording, including
mini blind cords.

Samson also enjoys preforating paper.  So any instructions, notes, row
numbers, etc. that I may pin to a project are subject to being gnawed
on.  I use safety pins for notes instead of straight pins.

I must put all straight pins and needles out of reach of cats because
Trouble will bite anything that stands up and away from the plane it
is attached to, as if items around her must be smooth or they offend
her somehow.  She will try to eat buttons off shirts, and pins/needles
off pin cushions and fabric.  Usually all I have to do is put the
pincushion and current pinned project under a piece of folded yardage.
This is one of the reasons I prefer to use Elmer's Glue Stick for
applique piece placement rather than pins.  I never liked getting
stuck by pins while doing applique so the glue keeps us all safer.
Trouble has also been known to bite the thread spool pin on the
machine just because it protrudes from the machine body.

Trouble also chews on plastic bags when she thinks she is hungry so I
have to keep those in closed bins most of the time.  Since I like to
use large zipper bags to keep order with my projects this is a real
concern for me.  The zipper bags with the slider closer are a bigger
problem because she feels the slider part should not be there and
tries to bite that offending part off the bag.

The ironing board must be folded and the iron must be placed on a
steady surface when not in use.  If I forget, the cats will remind me,
usually by the loud thud of iron or board hitting the floor.

The rotary cutter and blades get put in a bin away from prying paws
and mouths.  The good shears get hidden from the man in the house. The
sewing machine gets covered when not in use because of 2 cats. Current
projects are put away in containers or hidden under uncut yardage.

Cleo is my only cat that doesn't care about the sewing items.  She
will only lay on freshly cut fabric stacks or finished quilts.

Oh dear!
Most cats don't give two hoots about pleasing their human!  We are there
to serve them and that's pretty much *it* &gt;g&lt;
We love them, and hope they love us, in their own way; but I have
discovered that is by no means guaranteed.  Fine, if their will is the
same as ours; otherwise ... ...  It is no skin off their nose if they
displease us!
I have one who quite often does what he is told, but I think it is only
for the praise and attention he then gets - which, of course, he sees as
his due.
I'm afraid they have an entirely different mind-set from that of dogs.

My late QI, Blackbean, who crossed the rainbow bridge in May, ignored
the small and sharp things but enjoyed inspecting finished quilts and
sleeping on my stash of polar fleece - I think I'll be using hairy
fleece for some time to come!  She also loved kneading any batting she
found lying around, so that had to be stored in oversized plastic bins.
When I was making clothing she always tried to run under the paper
pattern as I laid it onto the fabric.

Smokey our new QI who is about 9 months old is fascinated by fasteners
and fixings.  His favourite game is to carry a 4&quot; screw up our
uncarpeted wooden stairs and roll it down each step to the bottom  - and
then do it all over again.  He also likes occupying my cutting table, so
now he is shut out of the room when I am using the rotary cutter.
Another trick is playing with safety pins (ugh!) so I have to keep them
in a closed container AND close them as I go along while pin basting
'cos otherwise he will pull them out of the quilt!

Good luck with keeping you new QI out of too much trouble.

Only if they want to be trained!

When she is a little older she will have discovered lots more
interesting things - feathers, (hopefully not birds!) butterflies and
mouses.

Yesterday Kiwi was taking a great interest in a largish hebe bush so I
went to investigate. There, right at the top was a very worried little
mouse with the most enormous eyes. Kiwi spent the next 2 hours indoors,
and hopefully mouse had gone home when he went out again, though he
appeared to have forgotten mouse's existance fortunately.

He's still an excellent QI, but saves inspections for when they are
spread on the floor. I do make sure that everything is covered up at
night though, as cats sleep in their beds in the conservatory where I
sew. I am especially careful with pins, threads and thimbles. Hodge is
too old to be bothered and Mia says she is a good girl, so its really
only Kiwi who might be tempted, and now it is &quot;Summer&quot; they don't always
come home at bedtime anyway.

So if Cheetah's allowed outside enjoy the attention while you can, but
if she's an inside cat I can't help!

&gt;&gt; I'm allergic to cats, so I can't offer kitty-specific advice ... but what
&gt;&gt; about setting up a nice bed for her in the corner of your room? Perhaps
&gt;&gt; keeping a few special toys in the bed (toys she can only have in the
&gt;&gt; room in
&gt;&gt; the bed) that she loves to play with might help?

&gt;&gt; All QIs that I know of (canine and feline alike) love us and want our
&gt;&gt; approval. If you teach her early that she won't get mommy's approval when
&gt;&gt; she climbs on the ironing board - but she will if she stays OFF, she'll
&gt;&gt; learn quickly.

&gt;&gt; Worst comes to worst, when she gets up on the board, tell her to &quot;Get
&gt;&gt; Down,&quot;
&gt;&gt; and take her down, put her in the basket, look very pleased and give
&gt;&gt; her a
&gt;&gt; tiny treat and tell her what a good girl she is for getting down.

&gt;&gt; That is, of course, assuming that you can train kitties like you can
&gt;&gt; doggies. :-)

Probably another flaw in my character but I have enjoyed so much your
adventures with baby QIs.  When our Sweet Pea was in his prime, he chose the
ironing board as an acceptable place to practice his Olympic competition
high dives. I had to keep the hot iron off of the board and over on a hot
pad on an old SM cabinet when I didn't actually have the iron in my hands.
We just never knew when a double Swan belly-buster needed to be perfected.
There's also a drawer-pull mounted over on the cabinet to control the extra
length of cord.  Our Yorkie does not jump (or practice diving) but we don't
want him to bound through and pull a dangling cord.  When your little
darling QI gets a little weight, you'll also want to turn off your machines
when you are not stitching.  Sweet Pea could get a truly comfortable nap on
a foot control and run the SMs and the sergers.  That will give you a heart
attack for sure.  Rub the precious whiskers for me.  Polly

&gt; My late QI, Blackbean, who crossed the rainbow bridge in May, ignored

&gt; sleeping on my stash of polar fleece - I think I'll be using hairy
&gt; fleece for some time to come!  She also loved kneading any batting she

&gt; When I was making clothing she always tried to run under the paper

&gt; Smokey our new QI who is about 9 months old is fascinated by fasteners

&gt; uncarpeted wooden stairs and roll it down each step to the bottom  - and
&gt; then do it all over again.  He also likes occupying my cutting table, so
&gt; now he is shut out of the room when I am using the rotary cutter.
&gt; Another trick is playing with safety pins (ugh!) so I have to keep them
&gt; in a closed container AND close them as I go along while pin basting
&gt; 'cos otherwise he will pull them out of the quilt!

&gt; Good luck with keeping you new QI out of too much trouble.

Faced with these cats I determined that I had three choices.

1)  Give up the cats.
Sure, I will get rid of the rest of the family while I am about it.

2) Give up what I do.
I have not been informed of any severe climactic changes in the nether
realms as of this time.

3) Lock the door.
Reasearch demonstrated that this could be accomplished with $2 at the
hardware store and 15 minutes of my time.

Having reviewed the situation I selected option number 3.
I even got lavish and spent an additional $2 to put a lock on both
sides of the door.

If you cannot do as I did, you can lock the cat away instead.  With
cats this can sometimes accelerate the learning curve as being on the
wrong side of a locked door is something they seem to really really
hate.  They are often quick to learn that &quot;jump on table&quot;=&quot;get locked
in bathroom&quot;.  I just don't happen to have four bathrooms.

While we are alking about keeping QIs safe...

Jiji-chan is a greenery browser.  We had one of those tubs of oats for
cats, and he would pull the whole rootbound lot right out of the tub
and make off with it.  Eventually he chewed it right down to the
roots.  He has been making a break for the hallway to investigate my
tub of peacock orchids ever since they came up, fortunately after
taste testing them he does not seem to have aquired a taste for
gladiola.

However we had guests on Labor Day and they gifted me with a new
plant.  It is a nearly 3 foot tall salvia divinorum.  Jiji is in love.

There is no way I want him munching on one of those.  I currently have
it in the hallway with the glads, but that is overmuch sunlight for it
and I would like to bring it in to more diffuse lighting.

Does anyone know of anything I can spray it with that would convince
him that it is not good to eat?  Do bitter apple or tabasco sauce
actually work and not hurt the plant?

Fortunately Ash does not pay much mind to houseplants. Though if it
smelled like apples it might be a different story.

I'm so glad you thought about plant safety.  That danger hadn't crossed my
mind to warn Charlotte about.  We have a Euphorbia Tirucalli (pencil plant)
that would terribly dangerous.  It can cause temporary blindness from just a
clipped branch.  I approach tending it with great caution. It has a
potential height of 18' and is happy as a clam to live here (quite a
surprise).  Unless the Yorkie or gators have access to a stepladder, all is
well.  For a greenery browser, it could  be v-e-r-y  interesting.  Polly

Wish I had an answer for you, Charlotte! Boots is the biggest problem.
She eats pins. So, needless
to say, she cannot be around at all when I'm sewing, and I have to be
really mindful about pins. Fortunately, she's an independent soul
and doesn't decide to &quot;help&quot; very often.
The first time I put a quilt on the frame to handquilt, it was a
nightmare. They thought it was their own
personal kitty trampoline. This is about the 5th one I've quilted on
the hanging frame. Weirdly enough,
I don't think any of them have been on it once so far.

Samson and Maisie both like to sit/lay close by.  If I'm quilting they like
to be wrapped in the quilt that I'm quiling.  If it's just something I'm
appliqueing they like to sit on me.  Machine sewing?  They ain't interested.

Mia is completely thick when it comes to doors, whereas the other two
just put a paw round and pull. Her favourite place to get shut in at the
moment is the bathroom. Her answer is to hurl herself at the door which
just shuts it more!

The other thing she can't do is to jump on the windowsill so she faces
the open window, nor can she reverse - so her slaves have to go all the
way to the door to let her in when she appears on the sill.

flowers are lunch.  I sprinkle the dry pepper on arrangements and cut
flowers, esp. roses.  Wolfie had gotten really good at either tipping the
vase of roses over and pulling the flowers out, or just removing one at a
time. I now put the vase on the stove and sprinkle pepper in the flowers and
just a tiny amount around the base of the vase.  He leaves it alone.  Just
don't make the mistake of sniffing the flowers after putting pepper on
them--I never knew one could sneeze so much!!  I also put Cayenne pepper on
plants on the deck that I don't want the squirrels to chew.  Works.  And no,
they don't get sick.  One tiny lick and it's enough to leave things alone.

They are both trained to come when I can, but Darius only comes for the
treat.  He will also lay still for grooming for the treat, but if you take
too long he will decide that it isn't worth it and walk away.  I need to
work with Cheetah on that one.  She is learning that mom doesn't want her on
the kitchen table, but has recently started climbing up to one of my
counters which is not allowed either.  I am trying to get her to learn that
the ironing board and cutting table are off limits, but that training has
just started, so we'll have to see how long it takes her to get it.

Thanks for the tips jennelh.  I hadn't thought of needing to check the
garbage for lost tools.  I try to keep things put away except when I'm using
them because of my kids, which I've got to crack down on myself again - I've
gotten lazy now that they are starting to get older.  I'd better watch that
garbage can just in case she gets one anyways.

&gt; Winston (Mr.Cute by Polly!) has been told by Lulu that he is no longer
&gt; welcome in the sewing room!  Lulu has a box lid near the doorway where
&gt; she spends her time and she will not permit him to pass her lair - he
&gt; has decided that the best spot for him to observe is from the doorway
&gt; sitting on top of a large air cleaner - same idea that he has when I
&gt; am in the kitchen, he has a tall box outside the door where he can
&gt; watch me without getting in the way.  Lulu has also decided that she
&gt; has to spend her nights in the kitchen and she doesn't think that
&gt; Winston should have his eating station in there - it is a 'cat and
&gt; mouse' game for him to grab his food and run.
&gt; I have set up a spare ironing board next to my sewing machine desk
&gt; that Katie will use to be close to me - Winston will attempt to share
&gt; this space with her sometimes when he thinks that he can get away with
&gt; it - he is not so much interested in the sewing as in the quilting of
&gt; something and he does know the difference (I think that the aroma of
&gt; batting has that effect on him!)  When he was younger, he couldn't
&gt; resist thread and would take off with it but I have learned to cover
&gt; the machine and remove the thread cone from the back of the machine.
&gt; I remember turning from the ironing board one evening after hearing a
&gt; whimper, Winston was clinging upside down underneath the other ironing
&gt; board - his claws were holding him through the holes in the metal - I
&gt; still haven't figured out how he had managed to get into that
&gt; predicament in the space of a few seconds.  He wouldn't have been able
&gt; to extricate himself without hurting himself - he hasn't actually
&gt; bothered me much since this episode.  I think that part of the safe
&gt; training involves giving your QI a place of their own and having a
&gt; sound or a signal that he/she recognizes as a reprimand in any
&gt; situation.
&gt; However, you attempt to safety train your kitten, it takes lots of
&gt; patience and repetition.  Let her have other toys to distract her from
&gt; the iron cord and keep sharp items (like scissors, rotary cutters,
&gt; seam rippers, etc.) in a box or tray away from the table edge.
&gt; Another tip for yourself - check your garbage bin for any items that
&gt; might have been played with by kittie that have fallen in the bin -
&gt; before tossing the contents!  I've lost several good items that way in
&gt; the past.

&gt;&gt;now she is just 3 1/2 mo. and is still very curious about everything and
&gt;&gt;very energetic and playful so I don't know if she will eventually start
&gt;&gt;finding a spot to observe or will always 'be involved'.  What are some of
&gt;&gt;the measures you do to keep your helpers safe?

&gt; Everything is a toy to a kitten, and the kitten may or may not grow
&gt; out of it.  One of my cats is permanently a kitten mentally, another
&gt; one learned a bad trick after he was grown due to a poorly designed
&gt; pet toy, and that trick is now a weird habit.

&gt; I must pick up all stray bits of threads, and put away all thread
&gt; spools and bobbins after sewing.  My Samson thinks thread is kitty
&gt; spaghetti and will chew and possibly eat it. I have even caught him
&gt; trying to bite the thread right off the sewing machine. It is not
&gt; enough to put the stray thread bits into an open trash can because
&gt; Samson will try to dig the threads out, so I have to hide them below
&gt; other items of trash while he isn't looking rather like one throws
&gt; away a 6 year old's drawing that has been attached to the refrigerator
&gt; door for the last 6 months.   His favorite &quot;flavor&quot; is black but he
&gt; will go for whatever he can reach.  Thankfully he only chews
&gt; cords/thread under 1/8 inch diameter.  Unfortunately that means he
&gt; will chew things that range from thread to silk cording, including
&gt; mini blind cords.

&gt; Samson also enjoys preforating paper.  So any instructions, notes, row
&gt; numbers, etc. that I may pin to a project are subject to being gnawed
&gt; on.  I use safety pins for notes instead of straight pins.

&gt; I must put all straight pins and needles out of reach of cats because
&gt; Trouble will bite anything that stands up and away from the plane it
&gt; is attached to, as if items around her must be smooth or they offend
&gt; her somehow.  She will try to eat buttons off shirts, and pins/needles
&gt; off pin cushions and fabric.  Usually all I have to do is put the
&gt; pincushion and current pinned project under a piece of folded yardage.
&gt; This is one of the reasons I prefer to use Elmer's Glue Stick for
&gt; applique piece placement rather than pins.  I never liked getting
&gt; stuck by pins while doing applique so the glue keeps us all safer.
&gt; Trouble has also been known to bite the thread spool pin on the
&gt; machine just because it protrudes from the machine body.

&gt; Trouble also chews on plastic bags when she thinks she is hungry so I
&gt; have to keep those in closed bins most of the time.  Since I like to
&gt; use large zipper bags to keep order with my projects this is a real
&gt; concern for me.  The zipper bags with the slider closer are a bigger
&gt; problem because she feels the slider part should not be there and
&gt; tries to bite that offending part off the bag.

&gt; The ironing board must be folded and the iron must be placed on a
&gt; steady surface when not in use.  If I forget, the cats will remind me,
&gt; usually by the loud thud of iron or board hitting the floor.

&gt; The rotary cutter and blades get put in a bin away from prying paws
&gt; and mouths.  The good shears get hidden from the man in the house. The
&gt; sewing machine gets covered when not in use because of 2 cats. Current
&gt; projects are put away in containers or hidden under uncut yardage.

&gt; Cleo is my only cat that doesn't care about the sewing items.  She
&gt; will only lay on freshly cut fabric stacks or finished quilts.

Yup, she's strictly an indoor cat.  I think she would be a good mouser if
she were a farm kitty.  She may mellow out a bit as she ages (at least I
hope she does).  I don't think she will hit my Darius's stage of mellow
though.  Which would be nice.  I often wished he was playful, so I guess I'd
better watch what I wish for because I'm getting that wish and then some
with her right now.

Unfortunately I can't lock her out of my sewing space because there are no
doors on it.  I have done some of my cutting sprees with her locked in 'her
room' , and when DH is home at night he is a good distraction for her too.
I just have to watch what I do during the day, and watch her so she can
check my things out without getting hurt.  We are both kind of learning

Oh my, eating pins.  That could be dangerous.  Cheetah decided to take a few
out for me one day.  My others leave everything alone unless it is a
finished(or near finished) quilt, so with out thinking one night I left some
rows of blocks out that had been pinned an ready for sewing.  After she was
released from her room the next morning she thought the pins looked
interesting and removed some to play with.  Luckily she didn't try to eat
any and I caught her right away.

Sorry I can't help, but wish you luck.  Our Darius used to just love my
plants (still does just no longer has access).  There was a product that was
just for cats that we tried without any luck.  We also tried cedar
balls/chips, having plants of his own (kitty oats) and a few other tricks
that I can't recall right now.  Finally, we just ended up getting rid of all
but my favorites and putting them in places he can't get to.

Thanks for thinking of my QI's Polly.  We have been down this road with our
first QI, and unfortunately didn't have much luck.  We now have just 3
favorite plants placed where they don't have access.  I would love to have
more, but I just can't risk it because Darius would eat anything he can get
at.  Even if I did get one that is totally safe for him to chew on, he would
probably eat the plant, and I'd be left with a pot of dirt. Since QI's out
rank plants (at least in my book), I have a couple of silks to help me feel
better.

&gt; There is no way I want him munching on one of those.  I currently have
&gt; it in the hallway with the glads, but that is overmuch sunlight for it
&gt; and I would like to bring it in to more diffuse lighting.

&gt; Does anyone know of anything I can spray it with that would convince

First, check the toxic plant list to see if the new plant might be
poisonous to cats.
http://www.catdr.com/toxic_plants.htm

or the Non-toxic plants list to see if it is safe
http://www.metpet.com/Reference/House%20&amp;%20Garden/nontoxic_plant_lis...

Get the kitty more oat grass to eat.  You might want to consider
buying seeds so you can grow a new batch while Jiji-chan eats the
first batch.  If he has his own plants he will be less likely to chew
your decor plants.

Bitter apple, Tabasco, cayenne pepper powder, and other topical
additives only work for a short time, if at all.  Animals will get
accustomed to the taste and eat it anyway.  Bitter apple usually
doesn't deter young children from sucking thumbs for very long,
cayenne pepper powder doesn't deter squirrels from eating bird seed
(especially sunflower seed) for more than a couple of days, and I once
had a cat that ate some sardines in spite of the spicy jalapeno pepper
oil the sardines were packed in.  (The cat's eyes watered, but she
wouldn't quit eating the sardines.  Ever try to retrieve food from a
cat that is that determined to eat something she can carry off?  Let's
just say I made a good effort and leave it at that.)

Not likely to find it on such a list.  It is a  weed indigenous to
Mexico, and not a very common house or garden plant.  The flowers are
freaky looking though, which is of course why I wanted it. (G)
http://www.unc.edu/~purdie/images/salvia.jpg
http://www.carolinanature.com/plants/sadi1767.jpg

It has been tested on cats, in a rather non pet friendly fashion.
It didn't seemto hurt them, but they did sit and tre off into space
for about half an hour. (concentrated tincture adinistered orally, and
yes I think the anti-drug people that did it so flippantly had ought
to be shot.)

I have been trying to figure out a way to get a goodly greenery forage
area set up for the kitties. Problem is I have limited sunlight and
most of the grasses and such want full sun.  With four cats, one of
which is a fiend for greens, I would just sew a tub with cat friendly
greens and keep it seeded.  But I don't have good lighting for it. the
oat grass we had I had to keep toting around to get good light.
I have my one micro-greenhouse sort of set up on the stair landing
(where the glads are), and that is the only full sun zone in the whole
house.
What can I grow for them that likes partial to full shade?  kiri is
violently allergic to ferns, so those are out.

I suspected as  much. Jiji is our green fiend, but the other three are
all inordinantly interested in this salvia as well.  Catnip and
salvias are members of the mint family, maybe they are more closely
related than I thought.  The cats did devestate the kitchen sage I was
trying to nurse along in the kitchen.

We eat red lentils and rice fairly often. If we do not tithe some to
the cats they will come right up onto the table after it.  The only
thing that makes them do that.  Though Mr. Bear (RIP) would jump up
and steal pizza after every one had left the table.  With the lentils
all of them will swarm on up and snatch it right off your fork.
Tithing is better than lentil battles.

We can close the hall off from the cats, so it is looking like that
salvia is going to have to either put up with overmuch light, or come
to live in my studio.

Yep, that flower is a little unusual looking.  I totally understand
why you'd want it too.

Perhaps have one pot of new grass growing outside while the other is
being eaten.  Also give a try at growing catnip because it may
distract the kitties from eating the lesser cousins of the plant.
Catnip is notoriously easy to grow.

Many cats despise citrus.  I find a light mist of a citrus-based
household cleaning spray on my palm tree keeps my QI from nibbling.

My QI's Nuala and Halo (young kitties) both love to inspect and test the
comfort levels of the latest quilts, even if I am still sewing them at
the time. Nuala loves to play with the thread as it feeds through the
machine! Luckily there has been no harm as yet, though all I can suggest
is repeatedly pushing them away until they take the hint.  A good tip is
to have another quilt nearby for tem to snuggle on undisturbed.  As far
as the iron goes, both have been curious and I always keep an eye on
them, but they seem to realise that it's hot and leave it alone.  I find
the cable more of a worry in case they pull the iron down onto
themselves.

&gt;Lilly cat got all tangled up in the sewing machine thread one night.
&gt;Good thing the machine was in the bedroom corner and she made a fuss
&gt;and we were able to help her.  Had she been in the other room and not
&gt;had help it might not have been such an ok outcome.  SInce then I try
&gt;and keep covers on my machines. I even had to make a new cover for the
&gt;serger.  SHe reached in the hand hold opening and pulled the thread
&gt;through there.  I have the rest of the thread in a cabinet or on a
&gt;higher wall rack.  I keep cutters closed unless I am using them and
&gt;hung on a key holder up in the closet.  You may need to put her in
&gt;another room while you rotary cut or run the machine.   I was told if
&gt;a cat touches the iron once they won't do that again.  I try to keep
&gt;a close eye on kitty location when the iron is on.  Mine sits in a rack
&gt;on the end of the board so most of the accessible parts of it are not
&gt;hot if a cat gets too close.   Maybe if you have a basket with some
&gt;fleece in it handy to lie in and Darius might like that?  It gets
&gt;better as they get older but Maki still likes to be right in the middle
&gt;of things a lot!

Oh, I;d forgotten about pins - Nuala loves to try to eat/play with them
- I have to store them in a drawer - luckily she hasn't yet thought of
taking any out of fabric so I can keep her safe quite easily.  I'm sure
that she is just interested in whatever it is that takes my attention
away from her.

&gt;&gt;  I'm allergic to cats, so I can't offer kitty-specific advice ... but
&gt;&gt;what
&gt;&gt; about setting up a nice bed for her in the corner of your room? Perhaps
&gt;&gt; keeping a few special toys in the bed (toys she can only have in the room in
&gt;&gt; the bed) that she loves to play with might help?
&gt;&gt;  All QIs that I know of (canine and feline alike) love us and want
&gt;&gt;our
&gt;&gt; approval. If you teach her early that she won't get mommy's approval when
&gt;&gt; she climbs on the ironing board - but she will if she stays OFF, she'll
&gt;&gt; learn quickly.
&gt;&gt;  Worst comes to worst, when she gets up on the board, tell her to
&gt;&gt;&quot;Get Down,&quot;
&gt;&gt; and take her down, put her in the basket, look very pleased and give her a
&gt;&gt; tiny treat and tell her what a good girl she is for getting down.
&gt;&gt;  That is, of course, assuming that you can train kitties like you can
&gt;&gt; doggies. :-)

&gt;Only if they want to be trained!

&gt;When she is a little older she will have discovered lots more
&gt;interesting things - feathers, (hopefully not birds!) butterflies and
&gt;mouses.

&gt;Yesterday Kiwi was taking a great interest in a largish hebe bush so I
&gt;went to investigate. There, right at the top was a very worried little
&gt;mouse with the most enormous eyes. Kiwi spent the next 2 hours indoors,
&gt;and hopefully mouse had gone home when he went out again, though he
&gt;appeared to have forgotten mouse's existance fortunately.

&gt;He's still an excellent QI, but saves inspections for when they are
&gt;spread on the floor. I do make sure that everything is covered up at
&gt;night though, as cats sleep in their beds in the conservatory where I
&gt;sew. I am especially careful with pins, threads and thimbles. Hodge is
&gt;too old to be bothered and Mia says she is a good girl, so its really
&gt;only Kiwi who might be tempted, and now it is &quot;Summer&quot; they don't
&gt;always come home at bedtime anyway.

&gt;So if Cheetah's allowed outside enjoy the attention while you can, but
&gt;if she's an inside cat I can't help!
