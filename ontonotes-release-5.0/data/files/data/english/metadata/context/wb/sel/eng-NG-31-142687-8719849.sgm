Ending the Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex

by Phil Tajitsu Nash

-snip-

Not only did they lie to get us into the disastrous war against Iraq, but
their failed policies have left us less safe, less respected and less well
off than we were in 2000. We cannot wait and allow them to lead us into
another war, when our economy is failing and our army is already stretched
to the breaking point.

Lying about the nuclear threat of Saddam Hussein and the presence of weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq is closer to the constitutional standard of
&quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; than engaging in a sexual act, yet our
congressional representatives refuse to open an impeachment inquiry.
Sanctioning torture, illegally wiretapping American citizens and illegally
using the Justice Department as a political weapon, are other issues that
should be investigated in an impeachment inquiry of Bush and Cheney.

Iraq war was illegal and breached UN charter, says Annan

Ewen MacAskill and Julian Borger in Washington
Thursday September 16, 2004
The Guardian

The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, declared explicitly for
the first time last night that the US-led war on Iraq was illegal.

Mr Annan said that the invasion was not sanctioned by the UN security
council or in accordance with the UN's founding charter. In an interview
with the BBC World Service broadcast last night, he was asked outright if
the war was illegal. He replied: &quot;Yes, if you wish.&quot;

---- YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW SQUAT ABOUT THE MIC!  ----

It:

1)  Provides jobs for tens-of-millions of U.S. citizens plus those of
allied nations.

2)  It is the bulwark of American enterprise.

3)  The 2-percent of the wealthiest Americans can and will protect it,
forever!

4)  Doubtless you and some members of your family and your friends and
associates live off the MIC.

5)  It is our nation's protective shield for liberty and what freedoms
we still enjoy.

It's a bloodsucking, war creating nightmare that needs to be put out of its
misery before it destroys mankind and the world.

A soldier came to Hakuin and asked &quot;Is there really a paradise and a hell?&quot;

&quot;Who are you?&quot; inquired Hakuin.

&quot;I am a samurai,&quot; the warrior replied.

&quot;You, a samurai!&quot; exclaimed Hakuin. &quot;What kind of ruler would have you as
his guard? Your face looks like that of a beggar!&quot;

The soldier became so angry that he began to draw his sword, but Hakuin
continued. &quot;So you have a sword! Your weapon is probably as dull as your
head!&quot;

As the soldier drew his sword Hakuin remarked &quot;Here open the gates of hell!&quot;

At these words, the samurai, perceiving the discipline of the master,
sheathed his sword and bowed.

&quot;Here open the gates of paradise,&quot; said Hakuin.

It is not &quot;our nation's protective shield.&quot; Our Nation's
protective shield is our humanity and if we do not bring the
MIC under control, its inhumane indifference to humanity
will lead to a much deserved destruction of our Nation.

Its a little more complex than that. Machiavelli noted that the only
time the Italians had any peace, was when the French king threatened
to invade. It is the fear that the US imperialists will take over
which reduces factionalism, and the expectation that it wont in Iraq
which empowers it.

By the same token when the Brits left, genocide began immediately,
which resulted in the formation of Pakistan &amp; India. As the Prince in
&quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; said, &quot;a pox on all their houses.&quot;

Before we can bring the MIC under control, we need an electorate that
has control of itself. Dont hold your breath.
