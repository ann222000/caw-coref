As You Like It Act 2, Scene 7

JAQUES All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being SEVEN ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of STRANGE oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the BUBBLE reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes seVERE and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this STRANGE eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere OBLIVION,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sanS EVERything.

The Author's Preface To The Reader (Shelton translation)

'For how can I choose,' quoth I, 'but be much confounded at that
which the old legislator (the vulgar) will say, when it sees that,
after the end of so many years as are spent since I first slept
in the bosom of OBLIVION, I come out loaden with my GREY hairs,
and bring with me a book as dry as a kex, void of invention, barren of
good phrase, poor of conceits, and altogether empty both of learning and
eloquence; without quotations on the margents, or annotations in the end
of the book, wherewith I see other books are still adorned, be they
never so idle, fabulous, and profane; so full of sentences of Aristotle
and Plato, and the other crew of the philosophers, as admires
the readers, and makes them believe that these authors
are very learned and eloquent?

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SURVEY AND
NATURAL HISTORY OF THE NORTH DIVISION
OF THE COUNTY OP WILTSHIRE.

BY J. AUBREY, ESQ.

&lt;&lt;In former days the churches and great houses hereabouts did so abound
with MONUMENTS and things remarkable, that it would have deterred
an antiquary from undertaking it. But as Pythagoras did guess at the
vastness of Hercules' stature by the length of his foot, so among
these ruins are remains enough left for a man to give a guess what
noble buildings, &amp;c. were made by the piety, charity, and
magnanimity of our forefathers.

And as in prospects, we are there pleased most where something keeps
the eye from being lost, and leaves us room to guess; so here the eye
and mind is no less affected with these stately ruins, than they would
have been when standing and entire. They breed in generous minds a
kind of pity, and sets the thoughts a-work to make out their magnifice
as they were taken in perfection. These remains are &quot;tanquam
Tabulata Naufragii&quot;, that after the revolution of so many years and
governments, have escaped the teeth of Time, and (which is more
dangerous) the hands of mistaken Zeal. So that the retrieving of these
forgotten things from OBLIVION, in some sort resembles that of a
conjurer, who make those walk and appear that have lain in their
graves many hundreds of years, and to represent, as it were to the
eye, the places, customs, and fashions that were of old time.&gt;&gt;

&quot;Wherefore considering the small harm I do to you, the great good I do to

patient in the extremity of his burning fever is desirous of cold liquor
or drink to qualify his SORE thirst, or rather kill his languishing
body, yet for the danger he doth evidently know by his science to ensue,
denieth him the same. So you being sick of too much doubt in your own
proceedings, through which infirmity you are desirous to bury and
insevill your works IN THE GRAVE OF OBLIVION, yet I, knowing the
discommodities that shall redound to yourself thereby (and which is
more, unto your countrymen) as one that is willing to salve so great
an inconvenience, am nothing dainty to deny your request.&quot;&gt;&gt;

ULYSSES:

Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
In monumental mockery.

&quot;Let me read,&quot; I said to myself, after drawing a long breath.

I spread it before me on the table, I passed my finger over each letter,
I spelled it through; in my excitement I read it out.

What horror and stupefaction took possession of my soul. I was like a
man who had received a knock-down blow. Was it possible that I really
read the terrible secret, and it had really been accomplished!
A man had dared to do- what?

No living being should ever know.

&quot;Never!&quot; cried I, jumping up. &quot;Never shall my uncle be made aware of
the dread secret. He would be quite capable of undertaking the terrible
journey. Nothing would check him, nothing stop him. Worse, he would
compel me to accompany him, and we should be lost forever. But no;
such folly and madness cannot be allowed.&quot;

I was almost beside myself with rage and fury.

&quot;My WORTHY uncle is already nearly mad,&quot; I cried aloud.
&quot;This would finish him. By some accident he may make the discovery;
in which case, we are both lost. Perish the fearful secret -

let the flames forever BURY IT IN OBLIVION.&quot;

THE PHILOBIBLON OF RICHARD DE BURY
TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BY E. C. THOMAS

&quot;TAKE THOU A BOOK INTO THINE HANDS AS SIMON THE JUST TOOK THE CHILD JESUS
INTO HIS ARMS TO CARRY HIM AND KISS HIM. AND WHEN THOU HAST FINISHED
READING, CLOSE THE BOOK AND GIVE THANKS FOR EVERY WORD OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD; BECAUSE IN THE LORD'S FIELD THOU HAST FOUND A HIDDEN TREASURE.&quot;
-- THOMAS A KEMPIS: Doctrinale Juvenum

PREFACE | CONTENTS

The Author of the Book. Richard de Bury (1281-1345), so called from being
born near Bury St. Edmunds, was the son of Sir Richard Aungerville. He
studied at Oxford; and was subsequently chosen to be tutor to Prince Edward
of Windsor, afterwards Edward III. His loyalty to the cause of Queen
Isabella and the Prince involved him in danger. On the accession of
his pupil he was made successively Cofferer, Treasurer of the Wardrobe,
Archdeacon of Northampton, Prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum, and Lichfield,
Keeper of the Privy Purse, Ambassador on two occasions to Pope John XXII,
who appointed him a chaplain of the papal chapel, Dean of Wells, and
ultimately, at the end of the year 1333, Bishop of Durham; the King
and Queen, the King of Scots, and all the magnates north of the Trent,
together with a multitude of nobles and many others, were present at his
enthronization. It is noteworthy that during his stay at Avignon, probably
in 1330, he made the acquaintance of Petrarch, who has left us a brief
account of their intercourse. In 1332 Richard visited Cambridge, as one of
the King's commissioners, to inquire into the state of the King's Scholars
there, and perhaps then became a member of the Gild of St. Mary-
-one of the two gilds which founded Corpus Christi College.

In 1334 he became High Chancellor of England, and Treasurer in 1336,
resigning the former office in 1335, so that he might help the King in
dealing with affairs abroad and in Scotland, and took a most distinguished
part in diplomatic negociations between England and France. In 1339 he
was again in his bishopric. Thereafter his name occurs often among those
appointed to treat of peace with Philip of France, and with Bruce of
Scotland. It appears that he was not in Parliament in 1344. Wasted by
long sickness--longa infirmitate decoctus--on the 14th of April, 1345,
Richard de Bury died at Auckland, and was buried in Durham Cathedral.

CHAPTER I: THAT THE TREASURE OF WISDOM IS CHIEFLY CONTAINED IN BOOKS

In books I find the dead as if they were alive; in books I foresee things to
come; in books warlike affairs are set forth; from books come forth the laws
of peace. All things are corrupted and decay in time; Saturn ceases not to
devour the children that he generates; all the glory of the world would be
BURIED IN OBLIVION, unless God had provided mortals with the remedy of
books.

_Tom Jones_ BOOK XII

&lt;&lt;The attorney's clerk had taken a great fancy to the sagacity of Partridge.
Whether this proceeded from the great discernment which the former had into
men, as well as things, or whether it arose from the sympathy between their
minds; for they were both truly Jacobites in principle; they now shook
hands heartily, and drank bumpers of strong beer to healths
which we think proper to BURY IN OBLIVION.&gt;&gt;

Moby Dick - Melville

Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there
is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of EVERy man's and EVERy
being's face. Physiognomy, like EVERy other human science, is but
a passing fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty
languages, could not read the simplest peasant's face in its
profounder and more subtle MEANINGs, how may unlettered Ishmael
hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow?

I but put that brow before you. READ IT IF YOU CAN.

Why upon your first voyage as a PASSENGER,

did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told
that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did
the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a
separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not
without MEANING. And still deeper the MEANING of that story of
NARCISSUS, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild
image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned.

CHAPTER VII. OF RECOMPENSES OF HONOUR
Translated by Charles Cotton, Edited by Hazlitt, 1877

&lt;&lt;Now, to expect that in obliterating and abolishing this, suddenly to
create and bring into credit a like institution, is not a proper attempt for
so licentious and so sick a time as this wherein we now are; and it will
fall out that the last will from its birth incur the same inconveniences
that have ruined the other. -[Montaigne refers to the Order of the
Saint-Esprit, instituted by Henry III. in 1578.]- The rules for dispensing
this new order had need to be extremely clipt and bound under great
restrictions, to give it authority; and this tumultuous season is incapable
of such a curb: besides that, before this can be brought into repute,
'tis necessary that the MEMORY of the first, and of
the contempt into which it is fallen, be BURIED IN OBLIVION.&gt;&gt;

ESSAY ON THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SHAKSPEARE.

by , Charles Henry Wheeler 1833

&lt;&lt;With these imperfect particulars,

derived from the united labours of various admirers and commentators,
our brief sketch of the life of Shakspeare must necessarily conclude.
On all the topics which usually constitute the personal history
of an individual, his contemporaries and immediate successors
have been equally silent. The meagre facts which were first imbodied
in a memoir by Mr. Rowe, and have been moulded into so many forms
by the caprice or taste of successive writers, remain to the present
day, unaided by any accession of novelty, and unimpeached by the
utmost acuteness of criticism. His early studies-the progress
of his pen-his moral and social qualities

-his, friendships AND HIS ERRORS, are completely BURIED IN OBLIVION,

as if the homage which is paid to his splendid poetical genius,
should be unmingled with any recollection of his faults and failings
as a man. Nor, after an interval of two centuries, is it probable
that any undiscovered clue is in existence, by which the memorial
of his actions can be redeemed from its present obscurity.&gt;&gt;

_The Ern Malley Poetry Hoax_ - by David Lehman

&lt;&lt;The greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century was concocted
by a couple of Australian soldiers at their desks in the offices of the
Victoria Barracks in Melbourne, land headquarters of the Australian
army, on a quiet Saturday in October 1943.

In a single rollicking afternoon McAuley and Stewart cooked up the
collected works of Ernest Lalor Malley. Imitating modern poets they
most despised ('not Max Harris in particular, but the whole literary
fashion as we knew it from the works of Dylan Thomas, Henry Treece,
and others'), they rapidly wrote the sixteen poems that constitute Ern
Malley's 'tragic lifework.' They lifted lines at random from the books
and papers on their desks (Shakespeare, a dictionary of quotations, an
American report on the breeding grounds of mosquitoes, etc.). They mixed
in false allusions and misquotations, dropped 'confused &amp; inconsistent
hints at a meaning' in place of a coherent theme, and deliberately
produced what they thought was bad verse.

They called their creation Malley because mal in French means bad.

Later, the hoaxers added a high-sounding 'preface and statement,'
outfitted Malley with a tearjerking biography, and created his suburban
sister ETHEL. The invention of ETHEL was a masterstroke. It was she who
sent Malley's posthumous opus, 'The Darkening Ecliptic', to Max Harris
along with a cover letter tinged with her disapproval of her brother's
bohemian ways and proclaiming her own ignorance of poetry.

Ern (she wrote) had been born in England in 1918, was taken to Australia
after his father's death two years later, and was left in ETHEL's care
after their mother died when he was fifteen. Having dropped out of
school, the young man worked as a garage mechanic in Sydney and later
as an insurance salesman and part-time watch repairman in Melbourne.
In 1943 he returned to Sydney, where he died of 'Grave's Disease.'

Artless ETHEL, the bourgeois philistine, had the effect of
authenticating Ern's poignant existence. The simplicity of her account
inspired Harris to construct the poignant life-story of a poet who
burned Keats-like in a flame snuffed out before its time. 'The weeks
before he died were terrible,' ETHEL wrote. 'Sometimes he would be all
right and he would talk to me. From things he said I gathered he had
been fond of a girl in Melbourne, but had some sort of difference with
her. I didn't want to ask him too much because he was nervy and
irritable. The crisis came suddenly, and he passed away on Friday
the 23rd of July. As he wished, he was cremated at Rookwood.'

McAuley and Stewart saw to it that Malley had, like Keats, died
at the age of twenty-five. 'Now in your honour Keats, I spin / The
loaded Zodiac with my left hand / As the man at the fair revolves
/ His coloured deceitful board,' Malley writes in 'Colloquy with
John Keats.' And, Like you I sought at first for Beauty

And then, in disgust, returned
As did you to the locus of sensation
And not till then did my voice build crenellated towers
Of an enteric substance in the air.

Amid the red herrings scattered in the poems, McAuley and Stewart did
sprinkle a few genuine clues to the mystery of Ern Malley. From
'Sybilline,' for example, these splendid lines hint at
Malley's ghostly nature:

It is necessary to understand
That a poet may not exist, that his writings
Are the incomplete circle and straight drop
Of a question mark
And yet I know I shall be raised up
On the vertical banners of praise.

It was, however, possible to take these lines metaphorically as the
dying man's vision of impending OBLIVION and posthumous applause.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;SIR HENRY WYATT (1460-1537), the father of the poet, resisted
the pretensions of Richard III to the throne, and was in consequence
arrested and imprisoned in the Tower for two years. According to his
son's statement he was racked in Richard's presence and vinegar and
MUSTARD were forced down his throat. There is an old tradition in the
family that while in the Tower a cat brought him a pigeon every day from
a neighbouring dovecot and thus saved him from starvation. The Earl of
Romney, who is directly descended in the female line from the Wyatts,
possesses a curious half-length portrait of Sir Henry seated in a prison
cell with a cat drawing towards him a pigeon through the grating of a
window. Lord Romney also possesses a second picture of 'The cat that
fed Sir Henry Wyatt,' besides a small bust portrait of Sir Henry. The
pictures, illustrating the tradition of the cat (now at Lord Romney's
house, 4 upper Belgrave Street;, London), represent Sir Henry Wyatt
in advanced years, and were obviously painted on hearsay evidence
very long after the date of the alleged events they claim to depict.&gt;&gt;

ASPHODEL, in the language of flowers, means &quot;regret.&quot; It is said that
the spirits of the dead sustain themselves with the roots of this
flower. It was planted by the ancients on graves. Both Theophilus

of ASPHODEL, in order if possible to reach the waters of LETHÊ or
OBLIVION. The ASPHODEL was dedicated to Pluto. Longfellow strangely
enough crowns his angel of death with AMARANTH, with which the
&quot;spirits elect bind their resplendent locks,&quot; and his angel of life
with ASPHODEL, the flower of &quot;regret&quot; and emblem of the grave.

The Order of the AMARANTH

&lt;&lt;The Order of the AMARANTH is a fraternal organization composed of
Master Masons and their properly qualified female relatives. In its
teachings, the members are emphatically reminded of their duties to God,
to their country and to their fellow beings. They are urged to
portray, by precept and example, their belief in the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;
and by conforming to the virtues inherent in TRUTH, FAITH, WISDOM and
CHARITY they can prove to others the goodness promulgated by the Order.

The leaves of the AMARANTH plant (Like the &quot;Laurel&quot;) is indicative of
distinction and honor, and when formed into the &quot;AMARANTHine Wreath&quot;
with its never ending circle, is typical of the bond of fraternal
friendship which encircles our beloved order, and which has
a central place upon our Standard (Ceremonial Flag),
surrounding the &quot;Crown and Sword&quot;.

The History of the Order of the AMARANTH dates back to the time
of the Reign of Christina, Queen of Sweden, in the year 1653.
Christina was the only daughter of Gustav Adolphus, King of Sweden.
She was placed on the Swedish Throne when she was six years old.
Queen Christina was given a Liberal education, was an avid scholar
and studied in all area's of learning which were taught at that time,
to the extent, that she was considered to be the most brilliant woman
in her time, in all of Europe. The people of her homeland
were fierce and warlike, having little or no learning, and none
of the fine arts and graces of the older and more sophisticated nations
of the Southern European continent. In order to attract men of talent
and letters as well as prominence to her Court, she beggared her
Treasury and gave most of her Crown Lands away to these gentry; Through
her diplomacy, the Peace Treaty of Westphalia was concluded in 1648,
and so the 30 years War was brought to an end. She made large purchases
for the various Swedish Museums. Her own magnificent library
was eventually purchased by Alexander the 8th.

Records show that Queen Christina created the order of the AMARANTH,
to honour the Lady Amaranta, a woman of rare beauty, modesty and
charity, who was attached to the Royal Court. For many years the Order
was immensely popular throughout Europe, with the most distinguished
ladies and gentlemen considered themselves highly Honoured by being made
Members of the Court. During Christina's Reign, the Order was supported
with Royal pomp, dignity, and magnificence by the Ladies and Sir Knights
of the various Courts which had been established. From a report by the
Honoured Lady Grace Scheninger, one account given by a distinguished
Englishman, himself a member of the Order, and a long time Guest of
Christina's Court, seems to be the most plausible and in keeping with
the lessons handed down to us in our present Order, he stated that: The
person who was being inducted into the Order, kneeling before the Queen,
held up his hands placing them between the Queens hands, as she declared
his duties in the Order: to maintain and defend Virtue and the Honour of
Virtuous Ladies: to endeavor to correct Vice: to perform Honourable
actions: to keep his Faith inviolable in all matters relating to Honour
and Virtuous performances, which the Court promised to Observe.
The Queen then placed a Scarf of Crimson Taffeta, with a broad
Silver fringe, with the Jewel of the Order hanging on the scarf,
on his Left shoulder, and tied under the left arm.

The GOLD Jewel was about the size of a English half-a-crown,
with a Round Wreath wrought and enameled like a Laurel,
and in the centre two letters in the form of an A, reversed, and
set with a cluster of Diamonds. The two A 's represented the First and
Last letters of the name AramantA, and about the wreath was written

René Descartes (March 31, 1596 - February 11, 1650)

Meditations (1641): &quot;I shall proceed by setting aside all
that admits of even the very slightest doubt, just as if
I had convicted it of being absolutely false.&quot;

&lt;&lt;In 1649 Descartes received an invitation from Queen Christina of
Sweden. Queen Christina liked to draw tangents at 5 a. m. and as a
result, disrupted Descartes' not-getting-up-before-11-in-the-morning
rule. However walking in the palace in the cold mornings of the
northern climate made Descartes sick and he eventually died of pneumonia
on February 11, 1650 in Stockholm, Sweden. He died just
a few months after he had accepted the invitation from the Queen.
17 years after his death, Descartes' remains
were returned to France; except for his right hand.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The Order of the AMARANTH, derived its name from Amaranta, which
presumably was derived from the Amaranth flower, a plant well known to
the Ancients, and from the fact that its blossoms were of that lasting
nature, they gave to its perpetual bloom the symbol of immortality.
The Amaranth flower, whose Greek name is &quot;Amarantus&quot; signifies
&quot;never withering&quot;, as it is of that dry nature that it can maintain its
freshness for a long time. It was believed by the Ancients, that if
left in water, they would bloom anew, hence the implied symbol of
Immortality. Its leaves, (like the Laurel) is indicative of Distinction
and Honour, and when formed into the &quot;Amaranthine Wreath&quot; with its never
ending circle, is typical of the Bond of Fraternal friendship which
encircles this beloved Order, and which has a central place upon
its Grand Standard, which surrounds the &quot;Crown and Sword&quot;.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;In 1860, James B. Taylor, a prominent Mason of New Jersey N.Y.
using the Ritual and Ceremony as used in Sweden, adopted and altered
AMARANTH's ceremonies and language, so as to make it more
appropriate to Masonry, and Masonic purposes, which with
some revisions, is in universal use to the present time.

Some of the Emblems and Symbols of the AMARANTH Order are:

1. The All Seeing Eye. The Eye of watchfulness. Psalm 121-4.
which neither Sleeps nor Slumbers.

5. Altars: Among the Ancients, both Jews and Gentiles alike,
altars were of two kinds, that is for Incense and for Sacrifice. On it
we are urged to lay all our Vices, and Ill doing's, as an oblation to
the Deity, we are to offer up thoughts of a pure heart, as the most
incense to our Supreme Patron on High; Conspicuously upon this Altar,
is placed the Holy Bible, the inspired word of our God.

Its Divine Truths send forth its sacred luster to all parts
of the Globe, and is used by us as a symbol of the Will of God,
which reminds us of the omnipresence of the Almighty who over SHADOWs
us with his Divine Love, as he dispenses his Blessings among us.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In Psalm 80, the powers that destroyed the Jewish nation
are compared to wild BOARs and wild beasts of the field.

Psalm 80:8-13 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast
out the heathen, and planted it. Thou preparedst room before it, and
didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were
coVERED with the SHADOW of it, and the boughs thereof were like the
goodly CEDARS. She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches
unto the river. Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all
they which pass by the way do pluck her? The BOAR out of the wood
doth WASTE it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.

BOAR, n. [OE. bar, bor, bore, AS. b[=a]r; akin to OHG. p?r, MHG. b?r, G.
b[&quot;a]r, BOAR, and perh. Russ. borov' BOAR.] The uncastrated male of swine;
specifically, the wild hog. BOAR occurs only in Ps. 80:13. The same Hebrew
word is elsewhere rendered &quot;swine&quot; (Lev. 11:7; Deut. 14:8; Prov. 11:22; Isa.
65:4; 66:3, 17). The Hebrews abhorred swine's flesh, and accordingly none of
these animals were reared, except in the district beyond the Sea of Galilee.
---------------------------------------------------------------
DEBAUCH, v. t. &amp; i. [F. D['E]BAUCHER,

&quot;he . . . wouldn't be DEBAUCHED,
&amp; if invited to writ: he was in paine.&quot;

The Cambridge History of English and American Literature

The best loved of all the ancient poets was Ovid, whose
popularity is attested by many translations of varying worth.

The first version in point of date (1560) is

_The Fable of Ovid treting of NARCISSUS, translated oute of Latin
into Englysh Mytre, with a moral therein to, very pleasante to rede._

Of all the translations, by far the most famous was Arthur Golding's
rendering of the Metamorphoses. The first edition (1565)
contained but four books. In 1567, the work was complete.
It is described on the title-page as &quot;a worke very pleasaunt &amp;
delectable,&quot; and a stern couplet warns the reader against frivolity:
------------------------------------------------------------------
NARCISSUS so himself himself forsook, and died
to kiss his SHADOW in the BROOK. - Venus &amp; Adonis

Philip Neri: born July 22, 1515 in Florence, Italy; &amp; died in Rome,
May 26, 1595; canonized in 1622 by Pope Gregory XV. {Feastday: May 26}

Of all the saints, Philip Neri was one of the happiest &amp; most
original. Nature had endowed him with a rich &amp; cheerful
temperament and he always saw the best side of things.
He loved music &amp; poetry and was a skilled amateur psychologist.

A room was built over the nave of San Girolamo for the people
who attended his informal spiritual conferences. He and his priest
followers grew to be called ORATORIANS, because they RANG a LITTLE BELL
to summon attendees to the gatherings. The music called &quot;oratorio&quot; was
named for the Oratorians, because they used music in their services
based on biblical or other religious themes, sung by solo voices and
a chorus. Like Saint Thomas More, 'laughter' is a word of frequent
occurrence where Saint Philip Neri is concerned. Saint Philip
is often in red carrying a LYLY or with lilies around him.

And spur my dull REVEnge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.

Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be

BESTIAL OBLIVION, OR SOME CRAVEN SCRUPLE OF THINKING

too precisely on the event,
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and WILL and strength and means
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,

That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,

Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not TOMB enough and continent
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

foot was in a simple slipper (i.e., slipshod), my left leg was exposed

that my chest was bared on that side.
A hangman's noose (known as a CABLE tow)
had been put around my neck and draped down my back. (We later learnt
that this mode of dress, the rough smock with the running noose
about the neck, was exactly how a medieval heretic would have been

&lt;&lt;[WILLiam Camden] pays a just tribute of honour to Drake &amp; Hawkins,
he celebrates the prowess of John Davis &amp; WILLiam Sanderson
and he hails the rising colony of Virginia.

Of Shakespeare and the drama he has not a word to say.
The peculiar glory of his age escaped him.

The death of Ascham, it is true, persuades him to deplore
that so fine a scholar should have lived and died a poor man
through love of dicing and cock-fighting. And he fires a salute over the
grave of Edmund Spenser, who surpassed all English poets, not excepting
Chaucer, and into whose TOMB the other poets cast mournful elegies and
the pens wherewith they wrote them. But, in the end, he returns to his
starting-place, and concludes, as he began, on a note of panegyric.

&quot;No OBLIVION,&quot; he says, shall EVER dim the glory of her Name:
for her happy and renowned memory still lives,
and shall for EVER live in the Minds of Man to all posterity,
as of one who (to use no other than her successor's expression)
in Wisedome and Felicitie of government surpassed (without envy
be it spoken) all the Princes since the days of Augustus.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Ogburn quotes an account of Spenser's funeral in which Spenser's
fellow poets &quot;vied with each other in Elegiac tributes to his memory&quot;
and threw their verses into his grave along with the pens that wrote
them. In fact, no contemporary account of Spenser's funeral exists;
the story Ogburn quotes comes from the third volume of
William Camden's Annales, which was not published until 1627,
28 years after Spenser's death.&gt;&gt; - David Kathman

[The Middle Ages] is was a period of biographical darkness,
an age dominated by the priest and the knight.

The priest shaped biography into an exemplum of other-worldliness,
while the knight found escape from daily brutishness in allegory,
chivalric romances, and broad satire (the fabliaux).

Most remarkable, however, a self-consciously wrought work of biography
came into being in the 9th century: this was The Life of Charlemagne,
written by a cleric at his court named Einhard.

He composes the work in order to ensure that Charlemagne's life is
not &quot;wrapped in the darkness of OBLIVION&quot; and out of gratitude for
&quot;the care that King Charles bestowed upon me in my childhood,
and my constant friendship with himself and his children.&quot;&gt;&gt;

XV. ASTOLPHO in Abyssinia

&lt;&lt;Before quitting the planetary region Astolpho was conducted to an
edifice on the borders of a river. He was shown an immense hall full of
bundles of silk, linen, cotton, and wool. A thousand different colors,
brilliant or dull, some quite black, were among these skeins. In one
part of the hall an old woman was busy winding off yarns from all these
different bundles. When she had finished a skein another ancient dame
took it and placed it with others; a third selected from the fleeces
spun, and mingled them in due proportions. The paladin inquired what all
this might be. &quot;These old women,&quot; said the saint, &quot;are the Fates, who
spin, measure, and terminate the lives of mortals. As long as the thread
stretches in one of those skeins, so long does the mortal enjoy the
light of day; but nature and death are on the alert
to shut the eyes of those whose thread is spun.&quot;

Each one of the skeins had a label of gold, silver, or iron, bearing
the name of the individual to whom it belonged. An old man, who, in
spite of the burden of years, seemed brisk and active, ran without
ceasing to fill his apron with these labels, and carried them away to
throw them into the river, whose name was Lethe. When he reached the
shore of the river the old man shook out his apron, and the labels sunk
to the bottom. A small number only floated for a time, hardly one in a
thousand. Numberless birds, hawks, crows, and vultures hovered over the
stream, with clamorous cries, and strove to snatch from the water some
of these names; but they were too heavy for them, and after a while the
birds were forced to let them drop into the river of OBLIVION. But two
beautiful SWANS, of snowy whiteness, gathered some few of the names,
and returned with them to the shore, where a lovely nymph received them
from their beaks, and carried them to a temple placed upon a hill,
and suspended them for all time upon a sacred column,
on which stood the statue of Immortality.

Astolpho was amazed at all this, and asked his guide to explain it. He
replied, &quot;The old man is Time. All the names upon the tickets would be
immortal if the old man did not plunge them into the river of OBLIVION.
Those clamorous birds which make vain efforts to save certain of the
names are flatterers, pensioners, venal rhymesters, who do their best
to rescue from OBLIVION the unworthy names of their patrons;
but all in vain; they may keep them from their fate a little while,
but ere long the river of OBLIVION must swallow them all.

&quot;The SWANS, that with harmonious strains carry certain names to the
temple of Eternal Memory, are the great poets, who save from OBLIVION
worse than death the names of those they judge worthy of immortality.
SWANS of this kind are rare. Let monarchs know the true breed, and fail
not to nourish with care such as may chance to appear in their time.&quot;

BERTRAM His good remembrance, sir,
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his TOMB;
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech.

OBLIVION in the darkest day to come,
When sin shall tread on merit in the dust,
Cannot rase out the lamentable TOMB
Of his short-lived deserts, but still they must,
Even in the hearts and memories of men,
Claim fit respect, that they, in every limb,
Remembering what he was, with comfort then
May pattern out one TRULY good, by him.

THE STORY OF BIG BEN

&lt;&lt;In 1844, Parliament decided that the new buildings for the Houses of
Parliament, then under construction, should incorporate a tower and
clock. The commission for this work was awarded to the architect
Charles Barry, whilst the specification for the clock
was drawn up by the Astronomer Royal, George AIRY.&gt;&gt;

The Merry Wives of Windsor Act 5, Scene 5
PISTOL: Elves, list your names; silence, you AIRY toys.

&lt;&lt;Sir George Biddell AIRY (b. July 27, 1801, Alnwick, Northumberland,
Eng.--d. Jan. 2, 1892, Greenwich, London), versatile English scientist
and seventh Astronomer Royal (1835-81). He reorganized the Royal
Greenwich Observatory, installing new apparatus &amp; rescuing thousands
of observations from OBLIVION, but his hesitation in acting on
the calculations of English astronomer John C. Adams in 1845
somewhat delayed the discovery of Neptune.&gt;&gt;

ECHO--Milton.

SWEET Echo, sweetest Nymph that liv'st unseen
Within thy AIRY shell
By slow Meander's margent green,
And in the violet imbroider'd vale
Where the love-lorn Nightingale
Nightly to thee her sad Song mourneth well.
Canst thou not tell me of a gentle Pair
That likest thy NARCISSUS are?
O if thou have
Hid them in som flowry Cave,
Tell me but where
Sweet Queen of Parly, Daughter of the Sphear!
So maist thou be translated to the skies,
And give resounding grace to all Heav'ns Harmonies!

The Marble Faun, 1859, 1860 By Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1804-1864

In such circumstances, Hilda's gentle reserve must have been stronger
than her kindly disposition permitted, if the friendship between Kenyon
and herself had not grown as warm as a maiden's friendship can ever be,
without absolutely and avowedly blooming into love. On the sculptor's
side, the AMARANTHine flower was already in full blow. But it is very
beautiful, though the lover's heart may grow chill at the perception, to
see how the snow will sometimes linger in a virgin's breast, even after
the spring is well advanced. In such alpine soils, the summer will not
be anticipated; we seek vainly for passionate flowers, and blossoms of
fervid hue and spicy fragrance, finding only snowdrops and sunless
violets, when if is almost the full season for the crimson rose.

Paradise Lost. BOOK III.

With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's filld
Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent
Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence
To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows,
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,
