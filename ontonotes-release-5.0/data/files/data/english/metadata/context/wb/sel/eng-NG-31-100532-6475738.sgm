Continuing saga of my daughter's Sentra GXE(1999, not 2000). AFter cleaning
the distributor from oil, it ran for the past week just fine. But
yesterday, it died again after running rough for a few minutes. I thought
maybe the oil has again contaminated the distributor again, but, nope, it
was dry. The check engine came up and it shows code P0340 CMP sensor
(CAMshaft position sensor). So where is this thing located in a GA16DE
engine? Can someone tell me where it is or send me a JPG pic to cmdrdata
at mail dot com? Thanks.

The cam position sensor is in the distributor. Unplug all the harness
connectors for the distributor and plug them back in. Hopefully it's
just a loose connection. If it continues to fail you have to replace
the entire distributor as they are one unit.

Codifus, thanks for the quick reply. While waiting for anyone to answer my
post, I called a local Nissan dealer (Courtesy Nissan whom in the past has
been very competitive and good pricing wise when compared to Autozone) and
the parts guy said they have the sensor for ~ $46 (internet pricing). So I
am going there soon to pick this up. Is he selling me a different part than
the one you described?  This car's distributor does have 2 plugs, a 6-pin
plug and 2 or 3-pin plug on its side, which I would guess is the one if
indeed the CPS is built-into the distributor.

He probably quoted you the cranksahft position sensor. Easily mistaken
over the phone.

My initial contact to the dealer was email, and I specifically capitalized
the word "CAMshaft" and gave him the P0340 code, but I think you are
right. He probably is not a mechanic that knows the difference between the
two. In my own Maxima, I did replace the CRANKshaft pos. sensor last year.

Nissan's terminology may have contributed to the confusion.  The early
factory service manuals for the old E16 engine named the sensor in the
distributor the "crank angle sensor" though it obviously monitors the
cam position.  Eventually Nissan changed terminology.  In any event,
no matter what anybody calls it, indeed it cannot be obtained
separately.  You can only buy a whole distributor assembly.  Good
luck.  Al

Maybe it was called a crank angle sensor because the E16 was an OHC
engine, whereas the GA16DE is a DOHC motor, so the OHC has a more direct
rotational relationship with the crankshaft when compared to the DOHC motor.

That's an interesting point.  Although in any four cycle engine the
camshaft, or camshafts in a DOHC design, must turn at half engine
speed, you're right that with a single camshaft every position of the
camshaft corresponds to a single point in the cycle.  You need the
positions of both camshafts to get that with a DOHC.  Good thinking!

Crossing my fingers, and spending money, I am buying a NEW distributor from
eBay for this car. I hope yall are correct that the integrated camshaft
position sensor (CMP) problem (P0340) will go away soon. I am about to
cancel crankshaft position sensor order since the diagnostic code did not
say CRANKshaft position sensor (CKP).  It would be upsetting if soon down
the line the CKP fail.

It's a common issue with some Nissan's. The 93-97 Altima had this
issue as well. Some would say its a failing on Nissan's part, but the
fact is, the part lasted over 100,000 miles. Is that really that bad?
When you replace it, the new one will outlast the rest of the car.
