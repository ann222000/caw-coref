Anyone care to venture a guess why phlebotomy / bloodletting isn't
used in lupus or arthritis when a drug that is an "alternative to
bloodletting" .. IS .. readily prescribed .. ?

A comparative trial of desferrioxamine and hydroxychloroquine for
treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda in alcoholic patients.Marchesi L,
Di Padova C, Cainelli T, Reseghetti A, Di Padova F, Rovagnati P,
Cantoni L.
Forty male alcoholic patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) were
randomly assigned to 2 groups of 20. The 1st group received
desferrioxamine (30 mg/kg body weight/day for 1 week every 3 months)
whereas the latter was given hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice/wk
orally). Alcohol abstinence was advised for all patients. Improvement
of cutaneous signs was evident after 6 months in hydroxychloroquine-
treated subjects and after 12 months in desferrioxamine-treated
subjects. At the end of the 1-year clinical trial, significant
decreases of serum iron and ferritin were found in all patients,
irrespective of the therapy. Urinary total porphyrins were reduced
significantly in both groups, but the drop was significantly more
evident in hydroxychloroquine- than in desferrioxamine-treated
subjects. After 1 year of therapy, 4 desferrioxamine-treated patients
vs 16 hydroxychloroquine-treated subjects acquired a normal urinary
porphyrin pattern. These results indicate that hydroxychloroquine is
more effective than desferrioxamine in inducing clinical and
biochemical remission of PCT. Accordingly, hydroxychloroquine should
be the preferred alternative to phlebotomy, if the latter is
contraindicated.

Anyone care to venture a guess as to why you post stuff you
don't understand?  If you had bothered to read your gibberish,
you'd know the article talked about using the drug (which costs
money and has side-effects) in cases where less-expensive,
less-expensive bloodletting is contraindicated.  Rusty, why
did you decide that use of your brain is contraindicated
under all circumstances?  That foil hat of yours isn't doing

The iron-binding and hydroxyl radical scavenging action of anti-
inflammatory
drugs.

Aruoma OI, Halliwell B.

Department of Biochemistry, University of London King's College,
Strand Campus,
UK.

1. Hydroxyl radicals (.OH) are thought to be generated at sites of
inflammation
and to contribute to tissue damage. All anti-inflammatory drugs tested
were
able to scavenge .OH generated in free solution at almost diffusion-
controlled
rates (rate constants about 10(10)M-1s-1). 2. Much .OH generation in
vivo
occurs at specific sites, where bound metal ions (such as Fe2+) react
with H2O2
to produce .OH that immediately attacks the site. Only .OH scavengers
that have
sufficient metal-binding ability to withdraw metal ions from this site
can
protect against site-specific damage. 3. All anti-inflammatory drugs
tested
were able to protect against site-specific damage by .OH in a simple
model
system in vitro. Penicillamine, diclofenac sodium, piroxicam,
azathioprine,
primaquine, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were especially
effective. 4.
The ability of an anti-inflammatory drug to protect against .OH
formation in
vivo depends not only on its rate constant for reaction with .OH, but
also on
its metal-binding ability and on the geometry and redox potential of
any metal
complex formed.

higher deposition of iron in rheumatoid muscle
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;

Scand J Rheumatol 1976;5(4):205-8

A comparison of the content of iron in normal and rheumatoid striated
muscle.

Goldie IF, Bjonness T, Tiselius P, Plantin LO, Sato T

An investigation has been carried out on the presence of iron in
striated muscle from normal individuals and from patients with
rheumatoid disease. The methods used for the estimation of iron
required a neutron activation analysis of total iron and extraction
of
hemoglobin in cyanide buffer. The results disclosed that there was
a
higher deposition of iron in rheumatoid muscle as compared with
normals. Iron has a destructive effect on lysosomes and mast
cells,
the effect of which is an inflammatory reaction which may in part
cause "metabolic myopathy" in rheumatoid disease. It is
tentatively
suggested that this "metabolic myopathy" may cause muscular pain
and
weakness in rheumatoid disease.

Oral liquid hydroxyurea promising for long-term use in babies with
sickle cell anemia
17 Jun 2005

Treating babies who have sickle cell anemia (SCA) with oral liquid
hydroxyurea appears to prevent the onset of long-term complications
triggered by this disease, according to results of a preliminary
study
by investigators at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

The study's findings are important because the onset of damage caused
by SCA complications can occur as early as three months after birth.
Starting treatment before those complications begin could
dramatically
reduce the chance of organ damage and premature death. A report on
the
study appears in the June 14 online edition of Blood.

In SCA, a genetic mutation causes oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin
(Hb) to form rigid cords in red blood cells, causing the cells to
take
on a bent, sickled shape. The sickled cells clog small blood vessels,
causing pain and serious damage to the brain, kidneys, spleen and
other
organs; and the subsequent premature death of the abnormal red cells
causes anemia. In the United States, SCA is found mostly among
African
Americans.

Hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), the
main oxygen transport protein in fetal red blood cells. Because HbF
prevents red blood cells from "sickling," clinicians have used
hydroxyurea for about a decade to reactivate HbF production in adults
and older children with SCA. In addition, hydroxyurea reduces the
severity of symptoms suffered by adolescents and adults with SCA,
such
as lung infections, organ damage, stunted growth, impaired brain
development and acute chest syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to an
infection
in the lungs that causes difficulty breathing, pain and other
symptoms
and can be fatal.

The current St. Jude study was an extension of a previous clinical
trial, Hydroxyurea Safety and Organ Toxicity (HUSOFT), which was the
first in which young babies were treated with hydroxyurea. The
original
HUSOFT study, published in 2001, demonstrated that short-term oral
liquid hydroxyurea therapy can be safe and effective in babies with
SCA. In the extension study, these infants were followed for up to
six
years of therapy.

"Our results are promising and justify a larger multicenter clinical
trial to confirm that treating babies with hydroxyurea is safe and
effective," said Jane S. Hankins, M.D., a physician at the St. Jude
Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center and the study's lead author. "If a
larger trial supports our observations in the HUSOFT Extension, the
treatment of sickle cell anemia will undergo a significant change."

"This study is particularly encouraging because it suggests that we
can treat babies with hydroxyurea for several years without side
effects serious enough to limit the use of this drug," said Winfred
Wang, M.D., St. Jude Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center director. "Our
aim is to make sickle cell anemia a survivable disease that doesn't
significantly reduce a person's quality of life." Wang is the senior
author of the paper in Blood.

A two-year pilot study of 21 babies with SCA, the original HUSOFT was
designed to examine the feasibility of treating infants with liquid
hydroxyurea; to determine the toxicity of this drug in babies; to
assess hydroxyurea's effects on fetal Hb levels; and to observe if
this
treatment could preserve spleen function. Patients received 20
milligrams/kilgrams of body weight/day (mg/kg/day) of hydroxyurea.
All
21 patients who completed the initial study were enrolled by their
parents into the HUSOFT Extension study. In that study, the dose of
hydroxyurea was elevated from 20 to 30 mg/kg/day for an average of
4.0
years (range 2.1 - 6.0 years).

The aim of the HUSOFT Extension was to determine if this higher dose,
given for an extended period of time, provided significant long-term
benefits without causing unacceptable side effects in children
ranging
in age from 2.6 to 4.4 years (median age 3.4 years).

After four years of hydroxyurea therapy, the concentrations of Hb,
HbF
and the volume of red blood cells were significantly increased in the
children receiving hydroxyurea. Moreover, the HbF level often
exceeded
20 percent of the total amount of Hb, Hankins said. "In children who
weren't treated with hydroxyurea, the level of HbF declined
significantly," she added. "The fact that HbF levels rose in babies
treated with hydroxyurea suggests that the drug is effective in
babies,
as well as in adolescents and adults."

Babies receiving hydroxyurea also weighed more and were taller than
those untreated children 2 to 5 years old who had been observed in a
previous, long-term national study called the Cooperative Study for
Sickle Cell Disease. The average weight gain for babies in the St.
Jude
study was more than 4.5 pounds per year; and the gain in height was
more than 3 inches, the researchers report.

"Hydroxyurea could also prove to be an effective way to improve the
care of sickle cell anemia patients who live in underprivileged areas
of the world," said Russell E. Ware, M.D., Ph.D., director of the
Hematology division of the Department of Hematology-Oncology at St.
Jude. "Treatment with hydroxyurea requires periodic checkups, but the
medication is relatively inexpensive and should be adaptable to
countries with limited resources," he said. Ware is a co-author of
the paper.

Texas,
Dallas); Lynn W. Wynn, MSN, PNP, CCRP (St. Jude); Peter A. Lane
(Emory
University, Atlanta, GA); and J. Paul Scott (Medical College of

Service de pediatrie, CHU,
Constantine, Algerie.

OBJECTIVES:
Sickle cell disease patients suffering from frequent painful crises
were submitted to phlebotomies in order to reduce hospitalization
days
due to pain, through hemoglobin (Hb) level reduction and iron
deficiency in patients with an hemoglobin level equal to or above 9.5
g/dL.

PATIENTS:
Seven sickle cell disease patients (four SC, three SS), aged four to
24
years, were submitted to sequential phlebotomies during periods from
18
months to four years.

METHODS:
The number of hospitalization days for crises was considered.
The volumes and frequencies of phlebotomies were adjusted according
to
the patients ages, the hemoglobin concentrations and the serum
ferritin
levels.

RESULTS:
One hundred and forty-four hospitalization days were recorded in the
seven patients in the year preceding the treatment.
During the study period, the annual numbers of hospitalization days
were respectively 20, five, six and one.
Mean hemoglobin concentration was 10.7 g/dL before phlebotomies and
8.8
to 9.2 g/dL during the four years of treatment.
Mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration
and
serum ferritin were also reduced.
The volume of phlebotomies was 116 to 39 mL/kg/year according to the
patients.
COMMENTS AND CONCLUSION:
The striking decrease of the number of hospitalization days for all
the
patients suggests a closed relationship between

Rusty the Cabbagehead Kid &lt;ironjust ... @aol.com&gt;
came up with yet another snippable display of verbal diarrhea:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;  when there's a sound medical alternative? &lt;&lt;
&gt;Real .. sound ..
&gt;For .. sure ..
">

So you're saying that bloodletting is safe and chloroquine isn't,
Rusty?  This runs counter to your earlier words:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bloodletting has never been tested .. but .. the drugs /
&gt; chloroquinine .. IS .. currently working very .. well ..
">

So, Rusty, were you lying then or are you lying now?
Or are you just a loud-mouthed, ignorant egotist?  Tell the
truth, Rusty, or Jesus will send you to Satan's Rib Roast
until you're nice and crispy!

No, but I can see why you're confused, Rusty.  You're a
herbivore, but that's because you're a mouse, not a man.
