Subject: No nursing home for me...No way

About 2 years ago my wife and I were on a cruise through the western
Mediterranean aboard a Princess liner. We noticed an elderly lady sitting
alone along the rail of the grand stairway in the main dining room. I
also noticed that all the staff, ships officers, waiters, busboys, etc.,
all seemed very familiar with this lady.

I asked our waiter who the lady was, expecting to be told that she owned
the line, but he said he only knew that she had been on board for the
last four cruises, back to back. As we left the dining room one evening,
I caught her eye and stopped to say hello. We chatted and I said, "I
understand you've been on this ship for the last four cruises". She
replied, "Yes, that's true."  I stated, "I don't understand" and she
replied, without a pause, "It's cheaper than a nursing home".

So, there will be no nursing home in my future. When I get old and
feeble, I am going to get on a Princess Cruise Ship. The average cost for
a nursing home is $200 per day. I have checked on reservations at
Princess and I can get a long term discount and senior discount price of
$135 per day. That leaves $65 a day for:
1. Gratuities which will only be $10 per day.
2. I will have as many as 10 meals a day if I can waddle to the
restaurant, or I can have room service (which means I can have
breakfast in bed every day of the week).
3. Princess has as many as three swimming pools, a workout room, free
washers and dryers, and shows every night.
4. They have free toothpaste and razors, and free soap and shampoo.
5. They will even treat you like a customer, not a patient. An extra
$5 worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you.
6. I will get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days.
7. TV broken? Light bulb need changing? Need to have the mattress
replaced? No Problem! They will fix everything and apologize for the
inconvenience.
8. Clean sheets and towels every day, and you don't even have to ask
for them.
9. If you fall in the nursing home and break a hip you are on Medicare.
If you fall and break a hip on the Princess ship they will upgrade you
to a suite for the rest of your life.

Now hold on for the best! Do you want to see South America, the Panama
Canal, Tahiti , Australia , New Zealand , Asia ?

Princess will have a ship ready to go. So don't look for me in a nursing
home. Just call shore to ship. PS - And don' t forget, when you die, they
just dump you over the side at no charge.

Cheers!

It's not too shabby a deal.  There is at least one dedicated cruise
liner ("Orion" ??) that just does that, you can buy a cabin on it for
a fixed price (IIRC anywhere from $150k to 2M) with a monthly service
fee, which was not that great. MUCH cheaper than a nursing home.

But, do they offer NG access with the middle of the Pacific?

Hey, Rich, how old are you?  Why does this (already old) story
hold such interest?  Surely you're not beginning to think ahead
to that time already?  I'm 63 and I trust it'll be a long while
until these stories become interesting and relevant to me.  :-)

You set up your own US nursing home system via a holding company in the
Bahamas which is held by your Swiss conglomerate which is run out of your
Liechtenstein registered private limited partnership. You pay no taxes but
enjoy large write offs on money that doesn't exist.

Lessee, my B'day is 3/3/49, so this March (two weeks from now??!?!)
I'll be, lessee... 58!!?!?!?!???. No wonder I'm tired all the time!

I got the item from my brother, who's sixty-something, and I just
thought it was a cute story. :-)

As far as elderly care is concerned, the only thing more expensive
then nursing home bills is long term care insurance premiums......

If you are truly tired all the time (and not joking), that could be a symptom of
depression (as well as low blood cell counts and other nasties). Go see a
doctor.

PS:

My permanent exhaustion was a severe depression, now in remission. Especially
since I expect that I shall retire on the profits from shares in
producers/resellers of SRRI's - Wyeth, f.ex. - we have three people @work down
apart from me; it's a brand new epidemic in the making. I see colleagues,
friends and neighbours all exhibiting the same behaviour that made me keel over:
All work and no Fun, basically.

The Danes have become neo-puritans:

"There is only one honest impulse at the bottom of Puritanism, and
that is the impulse to punish the man with a superior capacity for
happiness"

I read somewhere that they banned bear-baiting, not because it caused
pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators.
