Something happened again today that has happened ONE HUNDRED times in
the past six years and prompts this post. I'm sure that I'm not making
any headlines by stating that the Tampa,Clearwater,St. Pete area has a
LARGE gay community and every weekend I get about a dozen couples a day
on Sat. &amp; Sun. I think that I mentioned in an earlier post about the two
fellows that have a shop just down from mine and carry many expensive
items and play cards all weekend while waiting for a sale. Here's the
rub.. The original two buidings that are now part of the much bigger
flea market,were mini-storage areas first. That is , they were like a
series of little garages with big metal garage doors that pull down and
lock when you leave.
They're back to back spaces 12'X25' and face north and south and you may
rent as many as are available side by side or front and back. Well, my
shop is on the end of a row and consists of two spaces back to
back,which means that my shop goes 'all the way through' and rather than
walk outside the gate and fence,people 'cut through' my shop to get to
the next row of shops. This is fine with me and the reason that I have
my shop set up this way.
Now, to get back to the original subject of this post. As I said, I
have a number of gay couples that 'come through' my shop and many will
stop and examine/touch/fondle the goods and show pleasure with each
other over how nice that item would look/fit in their home. Back to
'here's the rub', in six years I have NEVER,not even ONCE made a sale to
a gay couple. They don't make an offer or want to haggle or buy
anything. They DO buy items from the two fellows on the other end.
Before you think it's my attitude or I'm giving off some subtle sign of
homophobia or something, I'd like to say that, that isn't the case.
Apparently, they like to spend their money with the other two fellows.
I'll ask them if they want to pay cash or write a check? Would you like
me to hold this until you bring your car around? Would you like for me
to deliver it or will you be taking it with you ? If there were a way
that you could take that home with you today for even less money,you'd
probably want to hear more about it,wouldn't you? I've had couples stay
and talk with my wife and I for an hour and come back week after week
and stay and converse,BUT, NEVER buy anything. What's up ? Is there some
kind of a code word or secret sign or SOMETHING that will make them
spend their money with me as well as the two fellows on the other end?
This is driving me CRAZY. It's NOT my imagination,but , an actual fact.
Logic tells me that if I have nice items (I do) at a fair price (I do)
then I should have sold many things to gay couples,I haven't.
Is there such a strong bond and feeling of support among gays that they
shun straight shops and and prefer gay owned shops ?
I realize that I'm opening myself up to possible criticism by even
suggesting such a thing and it doesn't seem logical to me, however,the
facts are the facts. Does anyone have any answers or suggestions for me,
other than just coming out and asking them why they never buy anything
from me. When I say 'they', I'm talking about my repeat gay 'browsers'
that are just cutting through. I can't call them repeat customers, as
they've never bought anything..
HELP !!!!
thanks,

Doug W.

I am, however, bothered by the fact that you seem
to have selected one group of people and tracked
their non-purchases.

Can you tell me how many &quot;straight&quot; (ie, straight
as you perceive) individuals have not made purchases
from your booth?

Kris,
Thanks for your reply . I knew that it would be hard to illustrate in
words the actual real life example that I was trying to convey. I also
knew that I would get responses such as 'it's my attitude' and 'how do I
'know' they're gay' and what about 'single' gays ? This was a heartfelt
inquiry and I think that I will now ask everyone to just forget about
this post, it was a mistake on my part to ask it in this ng or forum.
This would have been a question better asked if we were all together in
person. The printed word is too easily picked apart and taken out of
context and emphasis may be put where none was intended. The next thing
you know,I'll be saying something stupid in defense of myself such as,
&quot;but,some of my best friends are gay&quot; and I simply don't want to get
into any arguments over my post. If any one of you that are tempted to
reply,would spend one day in my shop,then you would see personally what
I apparently have not been able to explain properly.
I apologize to the the whole ng for bringing this up and ask that
we drop this discussion here and now. Oviously, my answers lay elsewhere
and I think that I shall simply ask my customers if I have any questions
about their buying habits.
SO, has anybody read any good price guides lately ?

Doug and Glen...........................

You both flatter yourselves........Doug, you described the browsers as &quot;Gay&quot;
not &quot;Desperate&quot;. It's just like a &quot;Breeder&quot; to &quot;Dream&quot; that every Gay man
wants him. Doug, you did not mention how many African Americans do not buy, or
have you counted the number of Native American Indians that did not buy? What
about Cubans? Since you are a counter of minorities, I'm sure that the National
Census Board would be very interested in your data.......and there should be a
review of why a Gay man will not buy from a &quot;Breeder With An
Attitude&quot;..........Glenn you sick pup, go play with your own &quot;Pony&quot;, as it
sounds to me that no one else has wanted to touch it! You both truly need to
search for a life!

Doug's post, I'm sure, stepped on some political-correctness toes,
but I don't recall his saying a negative thing about gay people except
that they don't buy from him. Sure, he stuck his neck out on that one,
but that's his choice. Had he used derogatory names or made generalizations
about lifestyles or whatever, that would have been different. He didn't.
He merely wondered aloud why gay couples didn't buy from him. A bit naive
to think he could spot all gays, but certainly not mean-spirited.

In response, you came back with the name calling. I don't care
if you're in love with your goldfish...that's really none of my
business. But I'm not a &quot;breeder&quot; and I find that term offensive.

Calling names and getting hysterical will do not a thing to
further the harmony between gays and straights. It might
be a good idea, C. Dodd, if you refrained from living up
to the negative stereotypes about gay men.

Linda Z.

PS. And don't EVEN come back at me with the standard &quot;homophobe&quot;
name calling just because I don't buy your venomous kneejerk
reaction to what was really a pretty innocuous observation.

Also, your comments reflect that you have not followed the entire thread.
Particularly, please read Kris' very apt reply to Doug. Maybe your WebTV
newsreader has the beginning of the thread buried on a back page. You can

In rec.antiques the crap continues:

Wise-up you lot!!

I'm the first to have a good old flame with the &quot;best&quot; of them or a
bit of spicy humour and a bit of mickey taking, but this is beyond
even me. Doug's original post was out of order, (the thread he has
attempted to explain and kill himself) Glenn was MOST certainly WAY
&quot;out of order&quot; and Calvin Dodd is obviously just hurt (with &quot;some&quot;

So leave it alone and kill this thread!

&gt;Do you think that is ok??? What is wrong with this picture???? What if
&gt;he had talked about a WOMAN (doing) them. Would that have been OK????
If
&gt;not ...why?????

however, I don't think anyone here would suddenly jump
up and make such accusations unless they were first
attacked.

Hi Calvin, I, too, was offended by the posts on this thread...and I'm
not gay...I'm a &quot;breeder&quot;....at least I guess I am...I'm the mother of
two children. I am not going to personnally attack anyone but I would
like to say that I think you are totally justified in your anger. I
agree with you that I would have been even MORE offended if I felt they
were referring to women as opposed to gay men. I think it should be
acknowledged though that Doug did try to &quot;kill&quot; this thread at one
point, knowing that he had made an error in judgement by thinking out
loud.
I have some friends/customers who are gay and sometimes they come
over to my house to surf the net. I cringe at the thought of them
seeing this thread. I cringe at the thought of myself having to see
this thread !
Anyway, I think apologies would be appropriate all around. Then we
can all get back to insulting newcomers, and each other, in a much less
stereotypical way.
