I had a spotless record (14 years of driving) up until Dec when I was stopped
for "speeding". I honestly don't believe I was as there was another car in
front of me breaking which ment I was breaking as well. Anyways I pled not
guilty and had my hearing today. I had to speak with the officer that pulled
me over. He said he'd suspend my ticket for 6 months as long as I completed a
Defensive Driving class of my choice before Aug 1st.

So I was wondering if any of you could help me locate some classes in or
around Keene or Milford NH. I've been looking online and finding nothing! I
did find some online DDC but not sure if the officer will go for that.

Thanks a bunch!

This is going to sound like an off-the-wall suggestion, but consider getting
a motorcycle learner's permit and attending a MSF Basic Ridercourse.  If you
have to do the defensive driving thing, you might as well have fun with it
and aquire a new skill.  Yes, Steph, the course is female friendly.  In
fact, the motorcycles you will ride are sized for females more than males,
as they are really SHORT, lightweight and severely under-powered.  :)  And
the coaches are plenty patient enough to help just about anybody learn to
ride safely.

Double-check this, but NH *should* recognize the Basic Ridercourse as a
defensive driving course.  I used to live in NH.  After we moved to NY, I
decided to buy a motorcycle.  The only legal way to get a motorcycle license
in NY (if you've never held one that you can transfer from another state) is
to attend a MSF Basic Ridercourse (well, there are other ways, but
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, the only legal way is to attend the MSF BRC).  Passing
the course got me a waiver for the NY motorcycle road test (so now I'm class
M).  But when I pulled an abstract of my driving record from NY recently, I
noticed that the MSF BRC is listed on my NY driving record as a Driver
Safety course (Defensive Driving course), and my *CAR* insurance is cheaper
because of that Defensive Driving course listed on my driving record now.  I
was getting the motorcycle license anyway, so the attaboy on my driving
record was a pleasant bonus.

I'd bet NH has a similar policy, check.  If so, there are classes in
Manchester (familiar with the area, that's not too far from Milford)

Did this 'speeding' cause an accident to happen ?

If not, in good faith your driving record is still spotless.

Some clowns would however have you believe that exceeding some randomly defined
number of mph is a mortal sin.

I think her query was more about how to convince the *state* that she

It depends on how the state runs things, if a DDC is offered and will
avoid points against the license, might as well use it.  A speeding
conviction usually is not a high-point violation (usually 3 points or
less).  Each conviction, at least in MO, drops off the point tally
after 3 years.  The state would likely not have a problem unless there
is an accumulation of convictions in a short time period.  However,
the auto insurance may go nuts; they treat jaywalking like DUI when it
comes to coverage rates.

true, but there's other factors to consider like employment... lots of
employers check driving records.

You've entered a plea and now the officer is going to "suspend" your

not necessarily, sounds like an odd form of a PBJ.  Not completely

Or course not, but it does seem to me to be improbable.  I'm not
interested enough to do the research of NH law but, to my knowledge, a
cop can't suspend or withdraw charges w/o approval of the Court.
Which may be quite cooperative, for all I know.

But state laws are very often very different.  You can't "display" a
deck of cards in an OH bar because they constitute a "gambling
device", but you can play chess, or golf.

IME, it's a judge who would make a decision like that.  In fact, I've
had the same thing done to me by a judge to dismiss a ticket.  Defensive
driving and 6 months of no other tickets.

This was approved in the court! Before my hearing I had a chance to talk to
the officer. We negotiated this arrangement of doing a DDC to dismiss the
ticket. Then we had to go before the judge as he approved it.

So this DDC is mandatory for me and worth paying $25-$50 for compared to $100
ticket and points against me and my insurance.

I have left a message with the clerk of courts to find out about the online
classes. They are the same as classroom ones just online. It's a 6-8 hour
course with a test that needs to be scored 80% or higher to pass.

&gt;I'm catching a whiff of bullshit here. The officer who wrote your

No bullshit here! The officer does if he is acting as prosecutor the day of
your hearing and it did happen yesterday! It has to go through the court
system. Mark yourself not guilty on the back of your ticket, mail it into the
state whom will contact the court in your jurisdiction and will set up a
hearing. You have a chance to talk to the prosecuting officer about your plea
and to see if you can negotiate. Which is what I did. It happens all the time!
In fact my MIL is the clerk of courts and encouraged me to plea not guilty
and strike a deal with the officer and judge. You still need to go before the
judge and he/she needs to approve it.

Don't worry about it.  Eeyore is an easily excitable Brit, and gpsman is
a sniping troll.  I'd answer your question, but I have very little
experience with tickets and I don't live anywhere near NH.
