Hello, I am looking for an adapter or cord that allows a Gameboy link
(any system) to plug into a USB port of a PC. The cord could replace
the link, so that one end connects to the Gameboy, and the other end
to a USB port; or, it could be an adapter, which connects to a link
cord and converts one end to a male USB connector. A cord is
preferred, but any suggestions help. Thanks!
