The following is excerpted from Genesis Chapter 8 with verse notes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the NIV bible
">

&quot;1 But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock
that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and
the waters receded. 2 Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates
of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from
the sky. 3 The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of
the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, 4 and on the
seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the
mountains of Ararat. 5 The waters continued to recede until the tenth
month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the
mountains became visible.

6 After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark 7
and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the
water had dried up from the earth. 8 Then he sent out a dove to see if
the water had receded from the surface of the ground. 9 But the dove
could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all
the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He
reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself
in the ark. 10 He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove
from the ark. 11 When the dove returned to him in the evening, there
in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the
water had receded from the earth. 12 He waited seven more days and
sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him. &quot;

Alrigth so the water had receded until in the tenth month the tops of
mountains were visible. And 40 days after that Noah sends out a dove
and it can find no place to set down because there is no place for it
to set down ' because there was water over all the face of the earth'.
Seems to be a bit contradictary there. Can see the mountains but can't
land on them ? HUH ?
Ok so there is  no land visible and then 7 days later there is a
growing olive tree with leaves upon it ? HUH ? I am reasonably certain
that it takes a lttle more than seven days for an olive tree to spring
up and produce leaves that can be plucked off.

Anyone notice some problem with the flow of time here. On cultivating
olives, olives grow in dry climates. I do not think after some 7 days
the groudn would be dry enough for an olive tree.

So I would like an explanation of this.

Thank you.

What is so unbelievable about that? It only took 6 days to create the
universe complete with the Garden of Eden. It only took one day for
Jesus to kill a fig tree.

Of course, the ark could have traveled quite a distance in seven days,
further than a non-migratory dove might be willing to fly alone over
water, so the olive tree may have been growing for several months. I
think it had to have been an African swallow.

I always assumed it was from a dead olive tree that had been growing
before the flood, and had just been uncovered by the floodwaters as
they flowed off the edge of the Earth.

That one is easy - the water came from the canopy - and is now in the
oceans. Creationism always have a way out. I fail to see how it could have

&gt; &gt; land on them ? HUH ?
&gt; &gt; Ok so there is  no land visible and then 7 days later there is a
&gt; &gt; growing olive tree with leaves upon it ? HUH ? I am reasonably certain
&gt; &gt; that it takes a lttle more than seven days for an olive tree to spring
&gt; &gt; up and produce leaves that can be plucked off.

&gt; &gt; Anyone notice some problem with the flow of time here. On cultivating
&gt; &gt; olives, olives grow in dry climates. I do not think after some 7 days
&gt; &gt; the groudn would be dry enough for an olive tree.

&gt; &gt; So I would like an explanation of this.

&gt; &gt; Thank you.

&gt; What is so unbelievable about that? It only took 6 days to create the

&gt; Jesus to kill a fig tree.

Yup.  Miraculous tree.  Miraculous bird.  Hey, the bible doesn't say
that those /aren't/ miracles.

Incidentally, the bird that never comes back, is that one of the seven
clean ones?  Or was that the end of that particular species after
all?  I know, I know - miracles again.  God got it to find its mate
somewhere on the planet.  Like he showed all the kangaroos the way
back to Australia.  Darn it, wouldn't it have been easier just to
levitate everything that he wanted to save about a mile up in the air,
before the flood?

You are a bonehead.

Let us continue with text right where you left off:

Genesis 8:12-14 (KJV)

&quot;And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which
returned not again unto him any more.

And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first
month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off
the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and,
***behold, the face of the ground was dry.***

And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month,
***was the earth dried.***&quot;

So, the text specifically mentions that the ground WAS DRY.

It is almost unbelievable, but a guy named Gregory Rummo, a baptist (I am
not certain which kind of), who used to run a syndicated column, and is, as
he once wrote, a 'degreed scientist' (chemistry) - in his webpage or blog
told us how he had taken his 12-year old som to the seaside and pointed out
to him that the oceans - all the water there was evidence for the Noah
story. IIRC, In an earlier exchange I had with him he had 'solved' the
problem of where the water came from by referring to the 'water canopy'. So
we must assume the Earth had much less water befor the flood. Why it would
have covered even the highets mountains before flowing into the oceans beats
me, though.

But since Greg appears as being a nice guy, I haven't had the heart to push
the issue of Bible vs. science with him. (I ran across him because I read
somewhere that he had earned some price for his review of Darwins Black Box)

&gt; &gt; from the ark. 11 When the dove returned to him in the evening, there
&gt; &gt; in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the
&gt; &gt; water had receded from the earth. 12 He waited seven more days and
&gt; &gt; sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him. &quot;

&gt; &gt; Alrigth so the water had receded until in the tenth month the tops of
&gt; &gt; mountains were visible. And 40 days after that Noah sends out a dove
&gt; &gt; and it can find no place to set down because there is no place for it
&gt; &gt; to set down ' because there was water over all the face of the earth'.
&gt; &gt; Seems to be a bit contradictary there. Can see the mountains but can't
&gt; &gt; land on them ? HUH ?
&gt; &gt; Ok so there is  no land visible and then 7 days later there is a
&gt; &gt; growing olive tree with leaves upon it ? HUH ? I am reasonably certain
&gt; &gt; that it takes a lttle more than seven days for an olive tree to spring
&gt; &gt; up and produce leaves that can be plucked off.

&gt; &gt; Anyone notice some problem with the flow of time here. On cultivating
&gt; &gt; olives, olives grow in dry climates. I do not think after some 7 days
&gt; &gt; the groudn would be dry enough for an olive tree.

&gt; You are a bonehead.

&gt; Let us continue with text right where you left off:

&gt; Genesis 8:12-14 (KJV)

&gt; &quot;And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which
&gt; returned not again unto him any more.

&gt; And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first
&gt; month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off
&gt; the earth:
">

Ah, creationists need to get their act together; Did the water run down and
fill the oceans, or did it dry up from the earth?

If there were enough water to cover the highets mountains, hwo could it dry
up in a matter of days? No need to mentin the cruel and idiotic method God
used to get rid of a few humnas he didn't like. Not even realizing that it
would not work, the next generation would be no better than the preceeding.
Can anyone imagine just how a real earth would have looked after a real
flood of this kind? I can - to some extent, and it doesn't look like a place
where I would want to be.

and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and,

The text is perfect but the omisssion of the fact that it is of course just
a myth is missing. But people with their mind in order know that anyway.

&gt;  6 After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark 7

&gt; water had dried up from the earth. 8 Then he sent out a dove to see if
&gt; the water had receded from the surface of the ground. 9 But the dove

Duh, it was a miracle.  Until after the Flood, soil did not absorb
water.  You may remember that God told Adam that it would be a bloody
difficult job to farm.  This is one reason why.

In the &quot;sevens&quot; passage of the Flood story, it is said
that *all* the birds are taken by sevens.

Are bees &quot;clean&quot;? Did Noah take a beehive with seven bees, or
only two bees? Two bees would be interesting - a queen, a
drone, and no workers.

When the anteater had its first meal after the Flood, how
many different &quot;kinds&quot; of ants went extinct?

Do you know where the bees were stored on the ark?  In the ark hives.
