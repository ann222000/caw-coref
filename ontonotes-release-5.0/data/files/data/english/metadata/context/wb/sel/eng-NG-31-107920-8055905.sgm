I think our meanings of bandied about are different! I know you guys
have gone around and around on this before, but my view as someone who
has had design experience is if Coughlin was in posession of the
material for any length of time without notifying his superior or the
FIA he is complicit in the matter. Copying the material shows he was
not about to send it back or tell the authorities he had it and
possibly planned to use it.

I would love to get a copy of my rivals designs to see how they
accomplish certain aspects of the feature sets. I would not have to
actually use any exact knowledge gained, but it would definately aide
in my future designs.

At the end of the day I am a McLaren fan and hope if not for their
sake, then the sake of F1 that the facts prove that no design
influence was gained.

Yes, far better either to punish people on the back of no proof, or
alternatively give them a complete exoneration and risk looking silly if
more evidence came to light.

They have said there is no case. End of. Unless it later transpires that
there is other evidence and there is a case, in which case McLaren can't
point to this acquittal of the charge of improper use of the data to
escape later punishment.

All absolutely as it should be in any system that believes in fair

NASCAR is known for allowing, with a wink and a smile, cheating. To
allow the chief designer of Mclaren to have Ferrari's design documents
for some time without notifying the authorities and then not impose a
penalty leads the FIA down that same sordid path.

It may a perception only, but it is certainly a start.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

He could be hoping to scare Ferrari into cutting a deal, in which case false
protestations of innocence would be perfectly logical. Stepney has publicly
accused Ferrari of smearing him because he knows &quot;where the bodies are
buried&quot;. His implication was that Ferrari was trying to frame him to force
him to keep quiet about their dirty secrets -  however, the opposite could
be true: if he did steal the info, he could be using &quot;the bodies&quot; to
blackmail  Ferrari into letting him off. Remember, Stepney, Brawn, Byrne and
Schumacher were all together at Benetton when that team was penalized for
illegal traction control - it's unlikely that this predeliction for cheating
ended when they moved to Ferrari, so there could well be a lot of skeletons
Stepney could expose.

An interesting conundrum - is Stepney trying to blackmail Ferrari, or are
Ferrari trying to blackmail Stepney?

Or, another theory: Ferrari, getting flack  for their relatively poor
performance after their wind-tunnel failure, needed a scapegoat to deflect
criticism. Stepneygate provided the added bonus of possibly getting points
stripped from McLaren, which would effectively hand the WC to Ferrari. (If
one really wanted to dive into conspiracy theories, one could suggest it was
Ferrari who mailed the docs to Coughlin, using Stepney's name; or even more
implausibly, that Stepney, Ferrari and Coughlin were alll in it together).

For what it's worth, I don't believe the last two. I do believe that Ferrari
are milking Stepneygate for everything they can get, and there is more to
their involvement in the saga than meets the eye. Their past history, and
win-at-all-costs reputation, indicates that dirty tricks are far more their
forte than Dennis' (who has a public reputation for fanatical integrity),
and this case is unlikely to be an exception to that general rule.

Yes, about what I would expect from a Ferrari fan. Far better to have an

than they've already seen, and what they have seen has shown that
McLaren didn't use the documents. It's such a pointless statement that
it's curious as to why they made it - why have a hearing at all if they
didn't intend to draw a line under the affair? They were aware of the
ongoing legal proceedings, and they took no action whatsoever against
Toyota when their employees were similarly suspected (and now AIUI
convicted, and still no action by the FIA). And you wonder why we're
slightly suspicious of the FIA's motives!

&gt; I think our meanings of bandied about are different! I know you guys

&gt; material for any length of time without notifying his superior or the
&gt; FIA he is complicit in the matter. Copying the material shows he was
&gt; not about to send it back or tell the authorities he had it and
&gt; possibly planned to use it.
">

I more or less agree with that - though it's not clear what he planned
to use the documents for. Blackmail? Who knows.

Irrespective of how these documents came to be in his possession he
has not acted like an honest person would in this regard. He should
have immediately destroyed them or immediately notified Dennis and/or
the FIA and/or his lawyers.

Ron's actions look very different. Once he found out about the
situation he immediately called Todt and Moseley. A very different
reaction and a very open one.

So I think it's fair to cast aspersions about Coughlan's motives but
not about McLaren's.

I also think that the WMSCs findings cast some doubts about various
reports in various publications. If Ferrari were able to prove that
Stepney had been tipping Coughlan off via e-mail or that Coughlan had
shown the documentation to other members of the McLaren team then they
would surely have laid that evidence before the commission.

They have to be very careful about drawing lines here. There is the
potential for opening up a can of worms about how details of a team's
designs or other information can and cannot become available to other
teams. Is it OK to have photos of other team's cars taken during test
sessions? Is it OK to look at Giorgio Piola's drawings?

They would need to put in place regulations about movements between
teams.

Presumably all teams take the opportunity to look at all other teams
in the pits and on the grids. Magazines print detailed drawings of new
developments on cars and accompanying technical analysis. You can bet
your bottom dollar that there are people in each team who can see the
same details and analyse them in the same way.

Which also raises the interesting point about what is in those
documents. Presumably it must have been things that are not
discernible in the run of the mill racing and testing activities.

So what was it? There's no point in dobbing McLaren in about a new
wishbone design because they'll know about that soon enough anyway.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WMSC where it will face the possibility of exclusion from not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heh heh.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you trying to make some kind of point? After all, we've all read
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the statement.

&gt; &gt; Talk about transparent. You know what my reply was and in the exact

&gt; &gt; and your group find the attached post &quot;interesting?&quot;

&gt; The exact context your post was made was in reply to a link to the

&gt; didn't intend to draw a line under the affair? They were aware of the
&gt; ongoing legal proceedings, and they took no action whatsoever against
&gt; Toyota when their employees were similarly suspected (and now AIUI
&gt; convicted, and still no action by the FIA). And you wonder why we're
&gt; slightly suspicious of the FIA's motives!

Yes, I understand the points you make, but to finish your inquiry, I
hitched my wagon to that quote, it was the only counter point for Ric's

The WMSC made the verdict, not the FIA, and the WMSC decision is
referrable to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport, and also
McLaren could take the case to the High Court in London. Therefore the
WMSC had better take a decision based on the evidence presented, or else
risk having it overturned - their jurisdiction is based on the contracts
McLaren have signed, and contract law is testable in a full court.

Absolutely. In fact given the number of high priced lawyers at their
disposal the wording of the WMSC decision is quite awful. It goes without
saying that if more information comes to light they'll review things again
so why even mention it nevermind spell it out that if so then McLaren might
face being excluded from not only this year's championship but the next? It
almost forces you to conclude they believe there is evidence they haven't
yet seen. In fact it's deeply prejudicial to McLaren's position and to the
sense one gets that a fair 'trial' has been held.

IMO what they should have done was
A) Explain properly why they held McLaren technically liable for the actions
of a rogue employee.
B) Explain properly why the actions of a rogue Ferrari employee haven't led
to a similar censure of Ferrari.
C) Leave out completely all the rest of the statement that serves only to
fuel speculation that we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg.

I think any half decent barrack room lawyer could have done a better job of
all this. Maybe the FIA and WMSC need to consider the competence of the
professional ones they employ.

&gt;&gt; without bothering to have a hearing - but that's my assumption, they've
&gt;&gt; made no statement at all that I've seen.

&gt; Ok then: from now on, should anybody ask for my opinion, I'll tell
&gt; them to read this post.

You don't have to agree with me if you don't want to!

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Companies are nothing more than groups of people -

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sorry - from a legal point of view, they most certainly are not.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So spare me the &quot;livelihood at stake&quot; stuff, it's way beyond the
&gt;&gt;&gt; point.

&gt;&gt;No it isn't. Companies have their own separate legal personality,
&gt;&gt;sure, but the impact on individuals still counts under the Human
&gt;&gt;Rights Act.

&gt;You don't say. Except, well, it has nothing to do with the matter at
&gt;hand.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, they have not. They have said that there is, and I quote,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;insufficient evidence&quot;.

&gt;&gt;Exactly. And therefore no case.

&gt;Really. Then I suppose that in your country, when there is &quot;no case&quot;,
&gt;they put you under observation for two years, saying that if evidence
&gt;should surface, you will be punished?

&gt;What..? No they don't? Yes, I didn't think they would - *when* there
&gt;is no case.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't remember reading about Ferrari
&gt;&gt;&gt; claiming that McL have benefited from their data outside RASF1,

&gt;&gt;You have already been pointed to the Guardian article where they did
&gt;&gt;exactly that. And you then indulged in typical tifauxsi

&gt;Tifauxi. If you're calling me that after I've defended McLaren from
&gt;day one, then, my friend, you are a moron.

&gt;&gt;claiming that it was their lawyers

&gt;&quot;Claiming&quot;. It WAS their lawyers, junior.

&gt;&gt; Well I have news for you.

&gt;I can hardly wait...

&gt;&gt;Lawyers can only act on instructions from their client.

&gt;You have no idea what you're talking about but, of course, believe
&gt;what you will.

&gt;&gt;In this instance, I don't.

&gt;What a surprise!

&gt;&gt;McLaren, the result is that there is nothing to prove McLaren have
&gt;&gt;benefited.

&gt;&quot;Nothing to prove&quot; and &quot;Insufficient evidence&quot; are entirely two
&gt;different things in the world of lawyers and judges, mate. But again,
&gt;believe what you will.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You don't say. Wow, and here I thought it was pretty much what happens
&gt;&gt;&gt; in most civilized countries.

&gt;&gt;So did I until you claimed that companies don't have the right to a
&gt;&gt;fair hearing in Italy.

&gt;Too bad I never said that then, eh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Human beings have an amount of rights that,  thank goodness, companies still
&gt;&gt;don't have.

&gt;&gt;So either you have mis-stated the law in Italy,

&gt;I have said nothing about the law in Italy - I could speak volumes
&gt;about it, but for what purpose? You are apparently stuck with your own
&gt;view of the World, the Law, the Tifauxi and Yours Truly. If it suits
&gt;you, hey.
">

You know what's ironic here? I work for the interests of the legal aid
system, trying to ensure that individuals can get their rights protected
and enforced against the State and big companies. From your comments in
another post on this thread, I suspect that if we were talking politics,
there would be far more uniting us than dividing us.

Oh, and it also means that I know and understand a lot more about legal
systems and the relationship between lawyers and their clients than
perhaps you realised.

The comment of mine that started all of this was that the result was as
it should be in a system that believes in holding a fair hearing.  Your
response was that the right to a fair hearing applies &quot;not necessarily
to companies. Human beings have an amount of rights that,  thank
goodness, companies still don't have.&quot;

That is a bizarre statement that effectively says the rule of law does
not apply. It may not be what you meant, but that is what your words
actually say.

So perhaps this all stems from a misunderstanding due to language
issues, or perhaps you have some other meaning that I have been unable
to discern. But perhaps it is best if we just both calm down, take a
deep breath and walk away from this one.

Deal? :-)

Heh.  Yeah, I do - by the look of it, you're saying pretty much what I
was thinking...

Good man!

Indeed. But you're inducing me to suspect that there are significant
differencies in the lawyer-client relationship between your country
and mine. I did study the basis of Common Law and the british and
american judicial systems back at the Uni, but

a) I can't remember a thing (it's been a while!), and
b) that kind of detail probably wasn't there anyway.

Well bugger me then. I was actually referring to something else, blah
blah blah, oh well. As I've said elsewhere, my english shows its
limits when it comes to technicalities. Or perhaps even before that.
:P

Absolutely. Now, when's the next GP..? :)
