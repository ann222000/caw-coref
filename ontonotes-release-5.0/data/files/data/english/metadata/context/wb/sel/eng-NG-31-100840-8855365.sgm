&gt; The Natashas: The New Global Sex Trade

&gt; A review by Borys Prokopovych

&gt; The &quot;Natashas&quot; are part of a vast new underground economy-the
&gt; trafficking of women and children. Groups like Amnesty International
&gt; and UNICEF have been sounding the alarm about this modern day slavery
&gt; for years. Now a new book by reporter Victor Malarek-The Natashas: The
&gt; New Global Sex Trade (Viking, Toronto, Canada, 2003. 274 pages,
&gt; $36)-paints a harrowing picture of this merchandising of human beings.
&gt; According to the UN, the buying and selling of human flesh for the
&gt; worldwide sex industry is organized crime's fastest growing business
&gt; with up to 2 million people worldwide-mostly women and
&gt; children-trafficked into the sex trade every year.

&gt; The name &quot;Natasha&quot; is the generic name given to the estimated 900,000
&gt; girls and women who are trafficked over international borders into
&gt; sexual slavery each year. Most of these women are smuggled into the
&gt; Middle East, Asia, and North America. The trafficking of human beings
&gt; is now the third-largest moneymaking venture in the world, after
&gt; illegal weapons and drugs, generating about $12 billion a year in
&gt; illicit income.

&gt; Malarek's book begins with the story of Marika, a 19-year old
&gt; Ukrainian woman who accepts a job as a waitress in Tel Aviv that she
&gt; found through a job agency. As soon as she gets off the plane, she is
&gt; whisked away with three other girls and locked in a room with no beds,
&gt; no food, and no water. The next day they are told to disrobe and are
&gt; looked over by the owner. He tells them they have been purchased for
&gt; $10,000 each and will be his property until they can pay him $20,000.
&gt; Their only way to make money is to have sex with men unknown to them.
&gt; They are beaten and raped when they disobey any of the owners' and
&gt; clients' demands.

&gt; In the two years he spent researching this heinous international
&gt; problem, Victor Malarek has gathered hundreds of these stories The
&gt; trafficking of women is, in essence, modern slavery. Lured by the
&gt; promise of jobs overseas, millions of women leave their homes, hoping
&gt; to reduce the poverty in which their families live or simply to escape
&gt; political oppression. When they apply for these generally nonexistent
&gt; jobs, they are kidnapped by traffickers, smuggled across borders, and
&gt; sold into sexual slavery.

&gt; For the traffickers, it is a lucrative enterprise. It is very much a
&gt; &quot;win-win&quot; type of business: the &quot;exporter&quot; can make several thousand
&gt; dollars a head, with very little overhead, while the &quot;owner&quot; can
&gt; usually make back his initial investment within a few days. By forcing
&gt; the women under his control to work as many as 15 hours a day, six or
&gt; seven days a week, and paying them only enough for food and
&gt; cigarettes, a pimp can rake in anywhere from $75,000 to $250,000 per
&gt; woman, according to the police agency Interpol. Moreover the
&gt; &quot;risk-benefit ratio&quot; is much better than running guns or peddling
&gt; drugs because legal sanctions tend to be much lighter-when they are
&gt; enforced at all.

&gt; There is no lack of raw material. In the old Soviet bloc, the return
&gt; of capitalism since 1990 has been an unmitigated disaster for the
&gt; great majority of the population. Unemployment is rampant, the social
&gt; safety net has been all but destroyed, and living standards have
&gt; collapsed-in short, there is destitution on a colossal scale.
&gt; Desperate people are easy prey. An ad in a local paper promising jobs
&gt; in the West as secretaries, models, waitresses or nannies nets
&gt; hundreds of applicants. Or there are orphanages where a crop of 16 or
&gt; 17-year-olds can easily be &quot;harvested,&quot; since the cash-strapped
&gt; institutions are only too glad to have these children taken off their
&gt; hands, and some officials knowingly collude with a supposedly
&gt; long-lost &quot;uncle&quot; or &quot;aunt&quot; who suddenly turns up to take a girl
&gt; &quot;home.&quot;

&gt; During the last decade, hundreds of thousands of women from Russia,
&gt; Ukraine, Moldova and Romania have been sold into slavery as
&gt; prostitutes. Crime syndicates use a variety of methods to capture
&gt; young women. Malarek provides copious examples. A girl walking down a
&gt; road in Moldova is forced into a car. An overflowing Romanian
&gt; orphanage receives a visit from &quot;social workers&quot; offering &quot;apprentice
&gt; programs&quot; for adolescent girls. A young Ukrainian woman, desperate to
&gt; help her starving parents, responds to a newspaper ad to work in
&gt; Germany. An ambitious young graduate signs up with what appears to be
&gt; a legitimate foreign corporation during a job fair at a Russian
&gt; university.

&gt; The author's description of what occurs next makes the reader cringe.
&gt; The women, entrusting their lives to unscrupulous traffickers, are
&gt; packed off to various training centres, particularly in the Balkans.
&gt; Transported westward to be &quot;broken,&quot; they are raped, beaten and
&gt; terrorized into submission. Then they are ready to be auctioned off to
&gt; the highest bidder, often in much the same way as a cattle sale.

&gt; In cities such as Belgrade, Yugoslavia, stunned women stand naked in
&gt; secluded apartments waiting to be bought by pimps. Here, a woman can
&gt; be sold for as little as $500 or as much as $10,000. After being sold,
&gt; she will be locked in a room, fed one meal a day, burned with
&gt; cigarettes to destroy her self-esteem, and forced to have sex with up
&gt; to a dozen men a day, seven days a week, until exhaustion or disease
&gt; wipe out her market value.

&gt; In Germany, up to half a million Eastern European women work as
&gt; prostitutes. The streets of Italy are lined with Romanian and Moldovan
&gt; teenagers. Other serious offenders include Greece, Turkey, and South
&gt; Korea; many of the &quot;Natashas&quot; also end up in Toronto, Chicago or Los
&gt; Angeles. Among Malarek's most shocking claims is that on a per capita
&gt; basis the two countries with the most voracious appetites for Eastern
&gt; European women are Bosnia and Israel.

&gt; With respect to Bosnia, Malarek provides an unsavory explanation.
&gt; Prostitution in Bosnia sprang up to serve the United Nations troops
&gt; and international aid workers who flooded into the country at the end
&gt; of the war in the former Yugoslavia. Malarek underscores the irony of
&gt; these supposed emissaries of civilization feeding a barbaric industry
&gt; with descriptions: 60-year-old U.S. military officers showing up at
&gt; social events with their 14-year-old sex slaves. UN police demand
&gt; &quot;freebies&quot; in return for curtailing raids on brothels packed with UN
&gt; soldiers. At a place called the Arizona Market in northwestern Bosnia,
&gt; &quot;The girls appear naked on stage with numbers in their hands. Men walk
&gt; up, touch their flesh, inspect their skin and even look into their
&gt; mouths before they make a bid.&quot;

&gt; In Israel, it is common to blame rampant prostitution on foreign guest
&gt; workers. But Malarek argues that these men lack the money to buy sex.
&gt; Israel's &quot;Natashas,&quot; smuggled in via Egypt, service an estimated one
&gt; million men a month. Many of the &quot;clients&quot; are Orthodox Jews. Malarek
&gt; quotes Israeli anti-prostitution campaigner Nissan Ben-Ami: &quot;You see a
&gt; lot of . . . very, very religious men-because these men need sex but
&gt; the women in their society cannot give it to them when they want it.&quot;

&gt; In every country where women are trafficked, the police are involved.
&gt; Enforcement is cosmetic and judges refuse to take the work of a
&gt; &quot;foreign whore&quot; over that of a local businessman. International plans
&gt; to crack down on trafficking collapsed earlier this year when the
&gt; United States backed out of the projected plans to avoid imposing
&gt; economic sanctions on Israel, Russia, South Korea, and Greece.

&quot;Diabolic&quot;! He thinks the debbil makes us do it, obviously!! ;-&gt;
How stupidly insipidly Xtian!!

Actually, I have NO interest in &quot;making pedophilia legal&quot; or in making
&quot;child prostitution legal&quot;. Hell, I don't even want ADULT prostitution
to be legal!! I think it is disadvantageous to the poor!

But we want consensual sexuality in all its forms to be made thoroughly
and affirmatively legal. Making incest legal should be conditional upon
registering your liaison with the State and supporting its interest in
protecting future persons from being crippled or deformed by requiring
any pregnancy be terminated, and that people doing it have a thorough
course in contraception, unless they can show such knowledge via
testing!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The main similarity with Incest and Pedophilia is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they both have &quot;Laws&quot; which should be revoked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; People should not try to legislat Love.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It's just like years ago when it was a crime for black
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people and white people to have relationships, and
look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; at how people talk about homosexules.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pedo sock

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do I hear any echo in here??

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ohh, it's just Bo0by talking to his little bob.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;He seems to like to believe that he is doing something...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God forbid anyone does anything about pedophiles ....right
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Father?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The new death penality pedo laws will give us a few laughs.-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I challange you to give Real Verifiable links to your alledged
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Laws&quot; or shut your Ass.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;There's tough. And then there's Texas tough,&quot; Republican Lt. Gov.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; David Dewhurst declared at his January inauguration as he pledged
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; press for mandatory 25-year sentences and a two-strikes death-
penalty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provision for convicted child predators. The proposal is a more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extreme version of the so-called &quot; Jessica's Law &quot; passed by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Florida legislature in the wake of the February 2005 rape and
murder
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of nine-year-old Jessica Lunsford. That landmark statute imposed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mandatory 25-year prison terms and life electronic monitoring for
sex
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offenders, and since its passage in May 2005 42 states and Congress
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have implemented or are considering their own very similar laws.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The &quot;Law&quot; does not exist and if the public has any brains it wont.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I lay odds the &quot;Bleeding Hearts&quot; (God Love'um) will squash that
trash
&gt;&gt;&gt; real quick.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He claims to work with sex ofenders but doesn't say if they know he
&gt;&gt;&gt; posts to pedophile and incest groups as sweetnibblettes.

&gt;&gt;Wait, &quot;The 'Law' does not exist and if the public has any brains it
&gt;&gt;won't?&quot;

&gt;&gt;So the public can choose to not exist?

&gt; That's Dan's statement

&gt;&gt;Read any Kirkegaard lately?

&gt; I have.
&gt; I suspect Dan has little interest in existential Danes.
