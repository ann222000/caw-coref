For the past 6 months I've been experiencing the greatest anguish of my
entire life. My partner/wife is contemplating divorce.

She's overwhelmed, feels oppressed, overworked, stressed, unfree and
unheard. She feels I haven't supported her, she feels I don't respect
and appreciate her. She feels I'm needy.

I feel all the same things except maybe the needy part. I feel she is
less affectionate than I generally like. and in our present
circumstance, need.

I see several factors that have led to this state. In my mind the first
is logistical. We have two children 6 and 3 years old. The 6 yr old is a
high needs child who we've recently come to believing has a high
functioning form of autism called Asperger Syndrome, combined with some
traits of ADHD. The energy drain from this child has been intense. It
has been all consuming. We have had virtually no free time for each
other nor for our own selves. The sensory and emotional overload
associated with his behavior has been and continues to be crippling and
unrelenting.

I see significant aspects of my role. I am emotional and passionate in
my expressions. I say exactly what I think and I impart emotional energy
and too frequently blame to those expressions. I speak and consider her
as if she were myself. With myself, I'm highly critical yet I love
myself and life, and therefore do not feel damaged when being critical
to myself. I have high esteem for myself as a prevailing background
notion and do not need to temper critical observations with positives.
The positives are givens. I've treated communication with my wife in the
same manner. When I say something direct and critical I assume the
positives. I consider her as myself.  I know I love her. I have not
communicated the positives and my love for her nearly to the degree I
hold, both in word and action. While writing this I read my words as
being intellectual and dry, but I'm crying hard as I write this.

While my parts alone are enough to have brought us to this place, I see
significant parts in her mannerisms and behaviors as well. I find many
things to be chicken and egg type things that are hard for me to grasp
what causes what. I have strong perceptions, but hers are often so
contradictory that to be fair to truth I can't know what is real. I
perceive that she is unable to allow a change of course in a thought,
action or feeling of hers in any way I communicate without taking it as
an assault to her self worth. Even though my expressions can be harsh
and overbearing, there are times when I'm completely aware,
non-emotional, unattached to the outcome and doing my best to tread as
lightly as I can. In those times I still find that her self worth is on
the line over even small inconsequential items when they involve any
causal effect from her.

Related to this communication dynamic is that she does not communicate
her thoughts and feelings. On the rare occasions when she does they tend
to be of exactly the nature of mine, offensive and blaming. My response
tends to be defensive and offensive. The cycle then spirals and here we
are on the edge of dissolution.

Unfortunately we've let this dynamic go untreated for years and plodded
on trying to keep afloat with an extreme parenting situation.

About six months ago she started talking of divorce. I was completely
devastated. Most of the communication from her was in the form of rants
and strong attacks against me and what wasn't, I perceived as so.
Instead of listening I took things extremely personally and responded
with everything she gave me, pointing to every flaw of hers as I saw them.

I was in so much anguish I spent a solid four months sleeping not more
than 3 - 5 hours each and every night. I became physically traumatized.
I felt alone and abandoned in the dark for several hours each night. I
started to meditate again. In those painful, dark, lonely and cold hours
I started to let go of my blame to her. I came to a quote that described
the nature of all conflict coming from our own lack of knowledge of our
true nature. I started to accept my part in the worst tragedy of my
life. By thanksgiving I came to not only an acceptance of my pain, but a
thankfulness for it. I had come to a greater knowledge of myself. I
still wrestle with that pain, and I can't always find that place of
thankfulness but I know it's there and keep working toward it.

I believe we can repair our love. I see and own so much that I had never
known before. I also believe in the commitment we made to each other and
our family. I also believe that the work we need to do in any
relationship including the one with our children will be the same, so
why not with the one in hand, the one with our children and our commitment?

Up until three weeks ago my partner seemed pretty sure that we could not
get beyond our past dynamic. Most of her conflicts were directed toward
me. When I could get her to acknowledge any part in her dynamic she says
incompatibility. Since my new awareness and a complete surrender to
anything to do with on her part in my communication, she's started to
come around a little but consistently maintains doubts. For a few
reasons I believe she has, in her own words "outside draws". I think
they are somewhat conceptual and from an on line social network.  I
don't think they are significant, but I do believe they are a factor.  I
could be imagining it, but it seems that often we will make some forward
steps then after she spends a session online things will seem farther
apart again.  I confronted her about it and she became nervous, red in
the face and strongly denied it.

I felt like over the holidays we had made some strides, we made love
once, and she had called a postponement in any decisions. Today was our
first day of going to a marriage counselor. It brought up old issues and
I felt like it set us back to where divorce was again a lively
possibility. I feel like I had a large scab torn off from a deep wound.

I'm back to big discomfort again, but am realizing that a large wound is
still a large wound even though a scab had started to form, and that if
it formed once it can form again.

But I really hurt. I love my wife, my family, I love my children, I want
it to be whole. Sometimes I don't think I can hold on  much more.

What you have written certainly sounds like a believable assessment
of a difficult situation.

You indicate that you are very direct in your communication,
often conveying criticism, but not actually expressing the
love you say you feel.

Unfortunately, most of us cannot actually read the minds of
other people, even the spouses we've known for years.

Love has to be *demonstrated* to be perceived.

All of the passion and intensity you say you *feel* does you
absolutely no good unless the positives are expressed and
comprehended.

If instead, your wife encounters only negative comments from
you, she will associate her anger, resentment and emotional
betrayal and abandonment *with you*.

If it is not too late already, you may be able to turn
this situation around.  But it will require you to make
changes all on your own, since your wife isn't the one
seeking help here.

The next time you go to say something critical - shut the
f*ck up, be quiet, bite your tongue, count to ten, meditate,
write it in a journal -- do whatever it takes to keep from
talking first and regretting later.  Do not command what
someone else should do to fix a problem.

Instead, look first to what *you* can and will do.  In
the end, your wife will feel less resentment, and you will
feel more able, and find it easier to get what you want
accomplished if you do it yourself.

I cannot begin to know the stress you two are under, and you
have my deepest sympathy.  But if you want to keep your
marriage and your family together, you need to create a happier,
quieter environment.  It is possible that you difficult child
is responding to, and amplifying the discord and tension in
the house.  Being quieter, and more positive, might also be
reflected as well.

Best of luck,
Larry G.

It sounds like neither one of you is getting your emotional needs met.
This can be learned and makes both spouses much happier and able to deal
with challenges.  You also need to stop hurting each other (criticising
and blaming and so on).  Check out marriagebuilders.com and/or Fall in
Love, Stay in Love.

You really will need to spend time alone together for this, whatever
arrangements you need to make for your kids.  Pay a babysitter twice the
going rate if you need to.

It is good that you are able to assess and admit your part in the
problems.  It is also good that there is some direction towards
rebuilding.

I have had problems in my relationship with my wife for many years.  We
used to fight a lot.  I often can become very angry and critical at the
least thing.  Some issues were related to a poor self-image, not
responding to criticism well.  There were issues on how she
communicated as well, being overly critical on small things, etc.

I am a slow-learner, but I've been growing a lot lately, and
consequently, I have been growing a lot in my relationship with my
wife.  We used to be more distant.  Now we are much closer.  Both of us
have changed, but I know I had to focus on myself.  Many of my changes
have resulted in changes in her in response.  Someone has to be willing
to take the step toward the other first.  I have determined to always
try to be that person.  It isn't easy, but I've seen the benefits
finally after years of stuggle and (often) deep unhappiness.

I invite you to read some of my detailed thinking on this on my blog @
http://whiterobe.blogspot.com/2007/01/relationships-are-hard-but-wort... .

One of the biggest helps has been changes in how I view my wife in
terms of what I expect of her.  I used to look at her as the someone
who had to play a part in satisfying me.  I'm not talking sexually, but
just in terms of life in generally.  May of us look at our
relationships and want them to fill in the empty spots in our heart and
soul.  And when they disappoint us, which they always will because none
of us is perfect, we get upset at them and can easily fail to treat
them well.  We argue when we should stay quiet or say sorry, ignore
them when we should be near them, and so on.  I have some thoughts on
that as well at my blog @
http://whiterobe.blogspot.com/2006/12/challenges-of-finding-satisfact... .

I hope you find these thoughts of help, Leo.

Thanks for that.  The marriagebuilders looks good.  They are having a
seminar near me.  It's a bit expensive for us.  Do you have any
experience with the seminar or were you referring to the books and other
materials?

I don't believe that a six year old can have Aspberger's syndrome, and
I don't believe there is any such syndrome. Are you aware that this
disease was invented as a disease in Nazi-controlled Vienna, in 1944?

Insofar as Aspberger's syndrome is "irritating peer group members
through excessive interest in and focus upon your own interests", it is
misdiagnosed whenever the "peer group" is characterized by mass social
damage, that causes the "peer" group to in fact be interested in
nothing (as in the social phenomena of anomie) or in unworthy things.

An African-American kid with a passion for mass transit taught himself
in the 1990s how to drive buses and worked as a NYC bus driver, doing a
better job than the paid help. He was arrested and tossed in jail.
Pseudo-compassionate people said he should have been diagnosed with
Aspberger's: but note that in older times, a white kid who pulled a
stunt like this would have probably been hired as a bus driver. In
fact, in older times, white kids who hung about railroads, news rooms
and other work sites often got their start as trainmen, reporters and
other employees by a "passionate interest".

How often is merely having a "passionate interest" as opposed to being
a typical bored and depressed kid confused with this mostly bogus
syndrome?

As to a child's "having" these fashionable diseases, I believe that
most diagnoses of Aspberger's and many diagnoses of attention disorder
are child abuse, and made by doctors at the behest of drug companies on
behalf of drug company profits.

When women get nutty like this, you are generally screwed. Check out
this web site:
www.divorcedirtytricks.com
She is going to do things that will drive you crazy. But it's in your
interest to try to delay things as long as you can. Sure , try to fix
your marriage. Don't be supprised if nothing you do works. The system
is set up so that divorce is like hitting the lotto for women. That's
why she's thinking that she'll be ok if she goes through with this.
One thing you should go for is split physical custody. I did this and
it helped. My son lived with me for 2 weeks and with his mother for 2
weeks . It reduced the child support and kept me close to my son. This
is better for the kids. They still have both parents. It's better for
the parents. Especially if you have kids with problems, You will still
be both available even if you don't live together.It will be alot
easier to get partial custody than it is to get full custody.
Don't be overly generous with a settlement. If you control the money
you can be sure that your kids needs are met. Plenty of women spend the
child support on themselves and you end up having to pay twice to meet
your kids needs.
What you are experiencing is exactly what most guys go through in a
divorce., The woman turns into an unreasonable nutjob and there is
nothing you can do about it. They know that the courts are in their
corner. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Delay things as much
as you can so that you can prepare yourself with a good plan. Plenty of
guys have been through this and there is lots of info out there. Don't
try to win, just cut your loses. Make up your mind you will survive no
matter what happens. Sometimes bad thingsw happen and you just have to
get through it.
Good luck

Mary responds:
Leo, at this point, you are still thinking about your finances as
though your marriage was secure? How much will a breakup cost you? I
would think at this point, since you are teetering on the cliff,
anything that might successfully pull you back from the edge would be a
very, very good long term investment, irrespective of being a "bit"

That's silly.  Diseases aren't invented, they're noticed.  Small pox
existed long before anyone knew that there were deadly viruses.

Asperger's is a disease of childhood, as much as it is anything else -
it's almost always diagnosed in childhood, having a juvenile onset is
one of its features.  There's some evidence that people can "drift"
into the diagnosis somewhat later, having been marginal to it to begin
with.

Asperger's is a diagnosis of exclusion, if that's what you're
criticizing.  And it is a "border" category diagnosis between some
others - just like "early stage diabetes."

It exists.

Well - of course you're absolutely right, here.  And people who are
unable to watch a potential diagnosee in a larger setting - with other
autistics, especially - have no way of knowing how to judge any
particular peer group.  But when a person is persistent in alienating
their own peers by choosing, over and over again, to be intensely and,
well, monotonously obsessed with interests that virtually *no one*
shares - you have to admit, that person's life is going to go down
differently than someone who fits in easily!  Unlike many people with
odd interests, Asperger's people often don't seem to figure out why
they are not fitting in - and when a normal person would pull back and
simply see themselves as having an eccentric hobby, the Aspie truly
doesn't understand how their interest isn't the same as, for example,
sharing cookie recipes (something many people enjoy and which will
almost always work as a "topic" for conversation among peers of a
certain gender and age).  That was a random example.  Most people have
a list of interests they can exhibit in public, rather than push people
away with obsessing about some small thing.

For example, my mother (who I think may be right on the edge of having
Asperger's) will go into her hobby (talking about the numbers in her
checkbook, the numbers on her doctor's bills, the numbers that relate
to phone calls, the number of children in her kindergarten class who
had black hair, the numbers that she can remember that no one else can
remember, etc.).  She has never noticed that  A)  Everyone has heard it
before and it's not interesting, just like my stamp collection isn't
interesting to anyone any more, and surely, no one wants to visit my
collection of ASCII art or web buttons!   B)  It isn't interesting to
most people even the first time through.    C)  No one can figure out
why she's interested in it or what to say about it - and she's NOT
interested in anyone's comments on her numbers - she just wants to
recite them - again.   D)  The sets of numbers don't appear related to
each other - though they are in her mind, they are NOT like a stamp
collection even.   E)  She resists all attempts to be interested in
other people's similar stories about numbers - even if they politely
share their own number stories, she doesn't see the point in THEIR
stories about numbers - although she will listen politely and is very
glad to go back to her own number stories when that person has finished
theirs.

Now, I have odd interests, myself - and can be digressive.  It's not
the same, because for one thing, I just wrote this post and show some
degree of awareness of my problem (some here think I'm way too detailed
about some or many of my interests - and tangential, too - which isn't
quite the same thing, particularly since I have a *peer group* of
colleagues who share my interests - it's not like there's NO one
interested in the Gravettian period in European prehistory - and the
earliest uses of herbal medicines (etc.)

I submit to you that NO one is interested in the digits in my mother's
checkbook in and of themselves (without regard to what they stand for).

I don't believe you.  Which people said this?  They were stupid and
lacking in knowledge about Aspie's, if they said it, based on an
anecdote.  The only people qualified to diagnose Aspies and use it as
part of an explanatory system would be experienced clinicians - and,
perhaps, parents and patients themselves.  Not idiots comment on the
media - anyway, I think you made the story up.  There is no group of
"pseudo-compassionates" who expressed this opinion - there were, at
most, a few pundits and the story stuck in your head.

Go to some center where they actually treat autistics and spend about
8-12 hours observing and you'll change your mind.  If you don't, you're
an odd duck.

I don't know what drugs people use for Aspie's, but I have several good
friends and good students who are definitely Aspie's and it's not easy
for them.  They truly don't understand the emotional dispositions of
other people's minds.  For example, one is still trying to figure out
why, when four student council members rode in a car to a statewide
convention together, the secretary was allowed to sit in the front
seat, next to the president, while he - the vice president - had to sit
in the back seat next to the treasurer.  For one thing, it was the
president's own private car - and so, the president got to have
whomever next to her.  Secondly, the secretary was the president's
fiancé.  The Aspie person was confused about why car ownership should
be involved in politics - or why emotional bonds between lovers might
supercede political protocol while outside an actual meeting.  He felt
better when it was explained to him (that these people weren't acting
in a random or malicious manner) - but these problems arise *daily* for
him.

Unfortunately, this leads to others (including students) making fun of
him.  Teachers have actually made fun of him, too.  He's been made fun
of all his life, outside his own family (his dad is clearly, in my
view, Asperger's as he can be).

Asperger's adults with mild symptoms may often marry very high
functioning spouses, one bit of research shows - they are smart (having
a higher than average IQ is regarded as a symptom by some researchers,
although this area of the diagnosis is complex - and the IQ is often
European-style IQ - related to numbers and mechanics, not the more
typical American test).

I do agree that ADD/ADHD kids are over-diagnosed and over-medicated
(any time a diagnosis starts to comprise 30% of a particular school
system, one has to sit back and think a bit about what's going on! -
but that only happens here and there, not everywhere).

More and more kids are being put on SSRI's and anti-psychotics each
year, which is not a good trend - but the parents want "normal kids"
and so do the schools.  My parents attempted to achieve their goal of
having a "normal" with the belt and the coathanger.

Personally, I prefer pharmaceuticals, but that's just me.  YMMV.

Of course, many diseases ARE invented, such as Monday flu. And only a
physical disease with a biological basis can be "noticed". Just because
Asperger SAID it was a disease does not mean it WAS.

Sure, there may be a bioneuro basis for Asperger's. The problem is that
medical research at the cutting edge in the USA is overfunded by
for-profit institutions with a clear interest in a quick cure...and
quick profits.

What they've done, not through science but using public relations, has
been to implant the thought in the mind of people that because there
MAY BE such a bioneuro basis, there IS, the lowest common denominator
of the general public being unclear on the distinction between modal
and real.

But instead of acting like real scientists, theorizing the bioneuro
basis and only then testing the theory against reality, captive
slave-labor scientists at pharma companies instead are tasked and not
asked by the "suits" to go straight to human trials of some potion
which at first doesn't kill one of its subjects: in a more or less
polite form of Nazi experimentation, prisoners and the down-and-out
strapped for cash form, in America, the initial risk takers.

Then, when the potion "seems to work" according to sloppy texts made by
its users (the parents of the kids in this case), sloppily and with
only apparent precision placed in data bases with very impressive
"graphical user interfaces", the potion is released to the predefined
sufferers.

Much of this pseudoscience occurs in the oh, so very "high tech"
Research Triangle of North Carolina, a state not noted previous to the
funding of the Research Triangle Park for producing much of anything
beyond tobacco and Tarheeled boys. At typical "research" jobs at major
multinational firms, people with PhDs are forbidden, like children or
tobacco sorters, from talking "unnecessarily" on the job, and often
under the crazymaking pressures of maintaining access to these jobs
(which through the provision of health insurance lock entire families
into a slavery and debt cycle) these people turn to Fundamentalism,
which further undercuts their ability to do real science when it
preaches that the "theory" of evolution (the very basis of the biology
that grounds their science!) is "unproven" or just wrong.

The researchers then increasingly rely on patient texts and treat these
as brute facts, and the "facts" are delivered by programmers who have
either never learned, or who have been brutalized and God-walloped into
unlearning, the scientific method, in particular the central role of
"theory".

The damage is evident right here on alt.support.marriage. Entire
families become locked into a debt slavery cycle that whirls around a
kid defined as having a disease as the kid enters a cycle of
ever-stronger meds, and the authoritarianism of the parents binds them
ever closer in a mutual embrace of recrimination and despair as they
sit in yet another Doctor's waiting room only to be chided by Doctor's
secretary for not having enough Insurance to pay yet another
Deductible.

The kid, in what sane and humanistic psychologist Alice Miller called
"the drama of the gifted child" eventually is turned into a piece of
garbage.

The instinct to leave such a marriage is in my opinion Godlike because
such a situation is beyond repair.

...which neatly excludes any discussion of the pathology of GROUPS when
every day the pathology of GROUPS (as in the "mean girls" phenomenon
and at Littlewood, where the "trench coat mafia" reacted almost
understandably to jock persecution) grows by leaps and bounds. The
phrase "a diagnosis of exclusion" is on the border of gibberish. It's
ungrammatical because grammar (and compassion) is unequal to the task
of defining a person's rejection by a group (such as Christ's rejection
by the Jewish elite) as a sickness, and the "compassion" in such a
gesture is a mask!

And making it a "border" category is deliberate: it allows Doctor to
escape legal responsibility for his actions.

Here is in song the kind of medicine we're talking about:

Sister bought a coconut she bought it for a dime
She put de lime in de coconut drank and fold up
Called de doctor and said
Doctor
Is there nothing I can take I say
Doctor
To relieve the belly ache

You put de lime in de coconut you drink and fold up

Doctor
I gonna tell you what to do
You put de lime in de coconut you drink dem both together
Take de lime in de coconut and call me in de morning
You such a foolish woman
You call me in de morning

I am not trying to be droll, and you may take this as read. Fashionable
and bogus diseases are being overspecified while in the Third World
children die from syndromes that it would cost even a stressed American
family pennies to cure with a science no better than lime in de
coconut.

What's novel is the reaction vis a vis the way in midcentury where
there was support for people like a young Noam Chomsky because
Americans had no vicious word for him such as "nerd".

Sure, I can see how an 'addiction model' might fit. Gee, the Asperger's
sufferer, given, in the context of the typical American family, few
enough opportunities to get much out of life beyond commodities and
crazy "religion", might get addicted to the memory of a time when
people might not say first to him "that is BORING" because there was a
time when children were not by default "bored", because there was a
time when in the country they could go skinny dipping or blow up frogs,
or in the city play stickball in the street without a Swat team
descending on them.

But here as a layperson (and father of two grown kids) I'd say that a
Twelve Step program would work better, and Twelve Step programs don't
use drugs.

Whoa. With respect, this sounds to me like schizophrenia, not

Did Dolores Ibaurra have an attack of female hysteria when the elected
Republican government of her counrty was overthrown by thugs, and she
said to a silent crowd e los madres e son hijos (and the mothers! and
the sons!).

Oops, my mistake. I replied to the wrong person. The last poster
showed, correctly, that hysteria is a construction which in some sense
didn't exist before doctors said it existed.

All this estrogen is clouding my brain.

Perhaps it was a scab torn off a suppurating wound that needs to be drained

I'm sorry you're having such a sad and troubled time, Leo.

I'm not sure if this anecdote will be of much use to you but when I read
your post just now it came straight into my mind. I have an acquaintance who
I met at the beginning of last year - she's the mother of one of the
children in my youngest child's grade although not one I've spent more than
3 or 4 hours with in total. I've been aware she was unhappy for some time -
a tired, drawn and sad visage most mornings made that most obvious and her
little child was very quiet and sad too.

Yesterday we passed each other in a supermarket aisle and exchanged new
year's greetings then met again in another aisle whereupon she spent the
next fifteen minutes telling me that she'd left her husband just before
Christmas and why. Apparently he'd been criticising her for years over a
wide range of subjects and she'd finally had enough. She was obviously still
hurting but her _relief_ overwhelmed the mix of emotions she expressed.

Now some of the criticisms she recounted I could actually understand her
husband making from the little I know of her personality by talking to her
even so briefly in the past. I can't understand what possessed him to speak
to her as if she was his enemy or in such contemptuous terms, though.

Given your family situation you are both under a great deal of stress even
in the best of times. What can you learn through counselling to help you
both be better at being a partnership? One thing I can tell you straight
away is that you will have to be kinder to each other and more nurturing of
yourselves, your spouse and your relationship.

It seems to me that you are on a knife's edge with your wife at the moment.
She has agreed to go to marriage counselling which I do think is hopeful
even if there are people she is confiding in that seem to sway her away from
you. It's important to keep in mind that people tend to choose the
confidants that will tell them what they want to hear and your wife is the
one who needs convincing that she should stay.

I don't think I'm contemptuous, but because of her emotional childhood
wounds, she perceives any request for a change in her action that way.
Combined with my delivery which can be strong and overbearing when I
feel something is important and is being rejected, we have major upheaval.

My new strategy is all about allowing, and letting her come to things on
her own.  One of the major sources of conflict come from the way she
treats the children's behavior and emotions.  I've decided to let go and
just be an example, not to try to educate or convince her verbally.
Overall she's an excellent mother and puts forth and unbelievable amount
of energy and devotion, but our son who just doesn't operate on normal
levels get sharply reprimanded constantly throughout the day.  The tone
and the words themselves wound me just standing by, let alone him.  He
has serious self esteem issues. He says he doesn't love himself. I'm
sure much of which comes from the disorder, but the harsh reprimands he
receives constantly would do that on their own.  I have become critical
and that is not working to affect a change in her. It's just made her
want me out so she can feel free to act as she feels.  The whole
situation is so frustrating.  I've finally come to the Gandhi philosophy
of "be the change you wish to see".  I'm letting her consider me to be
the source of conflict.  I have been critical and sometimes angry, when
what I should've been is compassionate about how hard it is to work with
some extremely energy consuming behaviors.

It is very tricky right now.  It doesn't help that my body's reaction is
to give me constant insomnia, when I need the best emotional composure
of my life.

It doesn't help that she came home high yesterday. Now today she's
depressed.  I don't know why she can't see that that's what happens
every time she does that. I can tell you it's going to last precisely
3-5 days.  I've pointed that out to her.  So today, I've not been able
to get away from modeling her mood.  I've been depressed all day.  That
is normally not one of my emotions.  She's hurting and running away and
doesn't know what to do.

I want to help her be happy. I work hard for that, do double duty with
the kids, let her go out as much as she wants so she can heal herself.
I don't say one thing about anything she does, even if it just seems
wrong to me, even when she's ridiculously sharp with me or the children.
She starts to feel better towards me and then boom, she does something
that makes her feel alienated and unhappy.

It seems like everytime she gets high, everytime she goes out and talks
with her friends who are on the verge of divorce and often times when
she goes on her private forum she comes back feeling disconnected from me.

I really don't believe that being divorced is going to give her the
relief and freedom she conceptualizes.  That's part of why this is
hurting me so much.  It seems like such a waste.  I've outlined some of
the options in breaking up and that has had her call a temporary truce.
She says well, we can try therapy because I need to be able to
communicate with you even if we break up.

I hope I'm not ranting too much.  I haven't really had any outlet for my
frustrations.  I hope I didn't paint a picture of her being an ugly
ogre, overall she's a wonderful woman and mother, she's just hurting,
she's overwhelmed, lost and confused, I have equal parts to play as I've
tried to explain in my posts.  It's just such a hard situation.

I've had some small success in this area in the following ways:
1.  My daughter is in counseling.  The counseling doesn't seem to have
helped her behavior much yet, but it does at least give my husband the
feeling that "something is being done" and so he doesn't have to spend
as much time and energy being upset about her behavior.

2.  I've come to understand that he just can't handle her attitude day
to day as well as I can -- it's more stressful to him.  So I can

with what he does.

3.  I will address specific issues as they come up, along with the
reasons why I feel they are issues.  For example, she has taken to
throwing things down the stairs when she's put in her room.  DH
started asking our son if he wanted the things she was throwing away.
I told him that we could throw them away, or give them to charity, but
that I thought it was a big mistake to involve our son in any way.
DH, at least, will agree with me as long as my reasoning is sound.

There ya go.  This is the thing I wish more than any other that my
husband would just see, not only with me, but with our daughter as
well.  You have to keep your eye on the long view.  It might be
satisfying on some level to criticize what you don't like, but if it's
not going to make things better in the long run, then you have to find
another way.

No, you're not ranting too much. I don't see your wife being portrayed as an
ogre either but she does sound as if she's only just hanging on to the
threads of her life. That coming home high after she's gone out and being
depressed for days afterwards seems very like a prisoner returning from day
release. When she's away from home she's just herself and free of
responsibilities, not a struggling mother or wife and it must be horrible
for her that her home is the opposite of a refuge from the world. And
horrible for all the rest of you, too.

I don't have any advice, I'm afraid, just some sympathy - you both need
help. Is your wife being treated for depression or anxiety at all and, if
not, has she been assessed for either? (I'm sorry, I hope I didn't miss this
information in an earlier post.)

Good evening, Leo ...

Your heartfelt plea for help is so raw and honest.

I can see that you have really spent a great deal of time, energy and
emotion trying to confront and deal with your marital problems.  I
think THE most important thing the two of you are doing is seeking
counseling.  It IS going to hurt to go there for some time, but with
each discussion and each week that passes where you two have time to go
over what each of you and your counselor said, I think that you will
find your relationship will improve.  It is only natural that you would
be repelled by going back to revisit old events and emotional
consequences.  After all, they are the evidence, or symptoms, of the
state of your marriage and how it got to where it is today.  Let your
counselor walk you through the steps of reconciliation and developing
better, healthier habits within your marriage and allow time to do her
work.  There is no hurry in making a decision here.  Try to stick with
it and do your level best to COMMUNICATE with each other (that requires
listening, Leo...).

The way I see it you both went.  This is a sure sign that neither of
you have given up and that you both still care about each other.  The
love is there, it's just buried underneath a life that has become so
stressful and emotionally draining that neither of you has been the
best possible mate to the other that you should have been.  Coping with
a child that has special needs is another reason to seek a support
group or counseling.  There simply needs to be a time and place where
you two can go, RECEIVE and return to your little family to try again
for another week.  Life is hard, but if you love one another you will
find your way back to one another, by God's grace.  Tell her you want
her in your life.  Confess your wrongs and ask for forgiveness.
Demonstrate by your actions that you are dead serious and that come
hell or high water, you are going to be there for HER (that's
unselfishness, Leo ...).

I wish you all the best.  I am a veteran of marital dischord and can
say from experience that love will lead the way if you want it to and
there isn't any trial that can overcome it if you are determined enough
not to let it.

Tab

Whoa. Stop right there. In such a stressful situation, she's using
recreational drugs? Give me a break!

Suppose YOU came home DRUNK in response to the strain. This is what I
did in my marriage, which ended many years ago.

People, especially women, would be on your case although in a sense it
would be understandable that in your situation you might stop for a
couple of blasts after work.

The recreational use of mind-altering substances is linked in a
constellation with the overuse of prescription drugs to "treat" social
disorders caused by a culture of work, consumption and debt, and an
international foreign policy which uses ultraviolence against women and
children to secure markets...as seen today in Somalia, where US forces
once again killed women and children.

You cannot stop your wife from getting high. But you can within
yourself say to yourself, this is not me, and it is wrong, and I am
powerless over it.

But you also have the responsibility to protect your kids against the
consequences of her irresponsible behavior.

I suggest you stay away from a therapist with an MD and/or the ability
to prescribe anything.

I had great success with a feminist therapist in straight talk therapy.

Also, I found that relating my disorder to larger, political issues
helped. I started reading the New York Times and Economist and began to
learn more facts about the way the world works. I stopped thinking,
politically, in the cardboard terms of the Fox network. I "recovered"
from an addiction to conservative politics which was a neocolonialist
identification with my oppressors (the sort of men who had far more
money than my wife and I), a syndrome which the Algerian psychoanalyst
Franz Fanon said is almost incurable in a colonialist order, which
America has become, I believe, towards its own people outside the
superrich: the middle class computer programmers and such are to the
superrich expendable cannon fodder, and the damage to them and their
families is an externalized "cost of doing business".

You see, the Fox network and other sources send the message that
America is the "best of all possible worlds", that we represent "power
and goodness". This however implies that people who in America are,
poor, fat, or unhappy are the biggest Losers of all time, because they
cannot figure out how to be happy as they see on TV.

But if in fact, Amerikkka has in fact evolved, and devolved, to in many
ways a neo-Third World country for nearly all black people and many
middle class white people, then this means that you can focus on what
you CAN control as seen in the Serenity Prayer:

"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
ability to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the
difference".

I'm glad you liked the articles.  I hope they were a blessing to you.

Reading further in the discussion thread, I'm glad to see your
self-awareness and the changes you are attempting to make in your
behaviour.  I have to say I am impressed.

I'm sorry to hear that your wife gets into drugs and around some bad
influences.  I'm glad you are looking at the positives as well as
honestly assessing the negatives.  Don't fear "ranting".  Expressing
your thoughts and feelings is good and necessary.  It sounds to me like
you are trying to be balanced.

I hope you don't mind, but I will pray for you and your wife.  I will
pray that she begins to stop taking drugs and stops listening to
friends with negative views.  I will pray for the protection of your
children.  I will pray that you will continue to find the strength,
serenity, and insight needed to make it through this.  Ultimately,
though, I will pray that you see gradual improvement in your marriage
with every passing day, week & month.

God Bless,

I read that as meaning his wife came home in high spirits having enjoyed her
time away from the stresses of home and not that she'd been taking drugs. I

Thanks, that's the new thing I'm learning and trying to surrender to.

Part of the difficulty for me in coming to surrender has been that her
self worth is on the line for things I wouldn't understand.  At first I
believed she was perceiving things blown way beyond the way they were
expressed.  My feeling now is that that's not relevant. I started to
look at myself and what my reactions are.   I started realizing that I
need to look to myself and my reactions rather than to her actions.  In
life, I'm not guaranteed that things go the way I think they should out
on the streets, why should I expect that at home.

As your example above points out, I've now realized that it's better to
have compassion for her and how she feels rather than trying to change
her behavior.  I've realized that there's more likelihood of her
changing her behavior if I don't have a reaction and just do as Gandhi
put it "Be the change you want to see".

Easier said than done of course, I keep wrestling with it.  I have at
least changed my perspective to "what can I do to accept" rather than
"what can she do to change".  Even if I perceive or even if third party
observation would perceive an action as less than desirable, I'm trying
to hold that my job is my reaction and having understanding and
compassion.  Her actions are her job, my reactions are mine.  I'm
getting there but damn sometimes it's hard to be a mature adult :)

That's all true but the degree is less than the way it sounds as you've

When she's away from home she's just herself and free of

No, but that is what I've been wondering how to go about, what can she
do to feel happier. She's put a lot of blame on me, and I'm trying hard
to look at my parts (and finding plenty), but I think there's just
general unhappiness involved.  I've been trying hard lately to give her
her own space and to be with the children as much as I can, to the point
where my work is suffering and so am I. I've totally given up any of my
own recreation for now. It's been helping, but progress has been really
slow, or maybe I'm impatient.  It's just sometimes, emotionally, I don't
think I can go on.  If it goes on much more, it's going to be me saying
I can't do it anymore.  I've come close. But then I think about the
alternatives. I think about the children, I think about my parents and
how happy they are and that they've made it 38 years and almost didn't a
couple of times.  I think about the logistics.  I think about what a
beautiful family we are and not making it work just seems so wrong.
