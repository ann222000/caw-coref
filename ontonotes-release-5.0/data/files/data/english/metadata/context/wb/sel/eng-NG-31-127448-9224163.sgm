Over at the Panda's Thumb they have a link to this article:
http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/intelligent-design-rebranding...

It is about the changing tactics of the intelligent design scam
artists.  It is about the new creationist scam.

They have a book &quot;Exploring Evolution.&quot;  They were smart enough not to
get the FTE to publish the book, but they did get a small publishing
company to do the dirty deed.
http://www.exploreevolution.com/

Someone should do some investigating and find out just how much Hill
House publishing knew about what they were getting into.  They look
like a legitimate publisher that hasn't ever published a book like the
Discovery Institute rag.  It may be interesting to inform them of the
various activities of the authors and see what happens.

It is a no brainer why they didn't use the FTE to publish this book.
They made the mistake of publishing the Dembski replacement to Of
Panda's and People with that publisher, and they know that it is
useless to their cause.  They will still sell it to make money, but
they will try their best to get the rubes running the various
creationist scams to understand that it can't be used to further the
creationist agenda, just as bait.

Exploring Evolution isn't going to be just bait.  They seem to have
worked very hard to make it look legitimate, but their problem is the
authors.  No one can miss the fact that they were associated with the
intelligent design creationist scam.  Meyer was director of the ID
scam and Nelson was the first Discovery Institute fellow to admit that
there never had been a scientific theory of intelligent design to
teach to school children right after Meyer ran the bait and switch on
the Ohio State board in 2002.  The Ohio board had bought the ID scam,
but Meyer gave them the teach the controversy replacement scam.  The
scam that Exploring Evolution is supposed to help perpetrate.

I don't think that it is going to work.  No one is going to be stupid
enough to buy into trying to claim that this is a pristine creationist
ploy when you have the same ID perps running it.  The only ones that
will buy into it are the ignorant or incompetent, and those that know
that it is a scam, but the only game in town at the moment.

My main question is, did Hill House know what they were getting into?
This could impact their credibility in selling the nature books that
they have been selling.  That is sad because their previous work looks
like high quality material.

It appears from a very cursory view that this is the next step in the
&quot;teach the controversy&quot; strategy. For example, they state that they
are promoting an &quot;inquiry based approach&quot;. Here is a snippet:

&quot;The approach we are using in this book is called &quot;inquiry-based&quot;
education. This approach allows you, the student, to follow the
process of discovery, deliberation, and argument that scientists use
to form their theories. It allows you to evaluate answers to
scientific questions on your own and form your own conclusions. Our
goal in using this approach is to expose you to the discoveries,
evidence, and arguments that are shaping the current debates over the
modern version of Darwin's theory, and to encourage you to think
deeply and critically about them.&quot;

And two other snips:

&quot;United States federal education policy, for example, calls for
teaching students about competing views of controversial scientific
issues. As the U.S. Congress has stated, &quot;[W]here topics are taught
that may generate controversy (such as biological evolution), the
curriculum should help students to understand the full range of views
that exist.&quot;*&quot;

&quot;This book is one of the first textbooks ever to use the inquiry-based
approach to teach modern evolutionary theory. It does so by examining
the current evidence and arguments for and against the key ideas of
modern Darwinian theory. We hope examining the evidence and arguments
in this book will give you a deeper understanding of the theory and
help you to evaluate its current status.&quot;

I have followed this topic for years now and these guys simply amaze
me. If they wanted to hash out the controversy in a meaningful way
they would follow the normal venue of science and do that with
research and peer review. No, instead, they make their case to a group
of 15 - 16 year old high school children and ask them to decide for
themselves. Maybe the next time one of the ID scammers wants medical
treatment they should simply poll the local high school regarding
teatment options.

I don't believe that any of the authors of this book really believe
the blurps and that they are really trying to educate the youths.
Like you say if they had an argument they wouldn't have to prey on the
ignorant.  We would all know their valid arguments by now, but they do
not have any.  Child abuse is morally reprehensible, and what are they
trying to do?  Since they know that they do not have valid scientific
arguments lying to children is their only recourse.  What does it do
for them to know that they are lying to young people that aren't
equiped to deal with the lies of people that they are told to trust?
How misplaced can trust be?

The scientific debate doesn't exist.  It didn't exist when the teach
ID scam started in its modern form and it doesn't exist today.  These
guys not only lost, but they ran away.  If they had a valid argument
they would still be running the teach ID scam, but what have they been
reduced to perpetrating?  They have been reduced to lying to children
because the adults laugh when they put their fingers in their ears and
pretend that they can't hear how bogus their junk is.

Just look at the lead author Meyer.  He personally ran the bait and
switch on the Ohio rubes back in 2002.  For over half a decade he
participated in the Wedge teach ID scam.  He was director of the
&quot;science&quot; scam outfit of the Discovery Institute, but when he got a
chance to let ID shine and show the wonders of ID that he had to
teach, he gave the Ohio creationist rubes this replacement scam.  A
scam that can't even mention that ID ever existed.  With a lead author
like that what kind of science education is this book selling?

Interesting. I see in the Table of Contents that much of it, contrary
to the past ID practice, directly addresses common descent. Of course,
they shrewdly use the qualifier &quot;universal,&quot; which has become
curiously common whenever an IDer addresses CD. I could be wrong, but
this could be another bait-and-switch where they invoke Carl Woese as
rejecting *universal* CD (technically true, but very misleading).

Second, they give the last word to the dissenting viewpoint. That may
be legal, but it's rather a slap in the face to those who have done
the hard work, if it gives the last word to &quot;armchair quarterbacks&quot;
like the DI gang.

Third, and most important, I see no sign - at least in chapter titles
- of what may qualify as an alternative to &quot;UCD.&quot; Which means no
critical analysis of *that*. And no &quot;last word&quot; to dissenters of
*that*, even though they are anything but &quot;armchair quarterbacks.&quot;

Unfortunalely, most 15 -16 year olds  - *and their parents!* - do
think that any half-baked idea off the street deserves an equal
hearing with those who have spent years researching it - even in
medicine (lots of poorly tested supplements out there). Worse, the
DI's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; apporach means that they (unlike classic
creationists) don't even propose testable alternate hypotheses (maybe
this book might finally have some, but I wouldn't bet on it). Rather,
they let the students infer their own, which avoids the very
inconvenient fact that the past hypotheses are not only total
failures, but come in many mutually contradictory varieties, in stark
contrast to the a &quot;convergence, neither sought nor fabricated&quot; (Pope
John Paul II's words!) of evolution. So the student is made to feel
like he's the one who &quot;figured it all out.&quot; Which means that he has
even more vested interest in doubting - or tuning out - anything that
a critic of ID might say.

I felt sorry for Philip Johnson.  He spewed a lot of nonsense, but he
knows that ID was just a sham.  He has admitted that there never was
any science equivalent to what he doesn't agree with, and he even
admitted that ID was a failure.  He claimed in the NOVA special that
he no longer expected the Wedge strategy to come to anything within
his lifetime.  He knows that the cock and bull story that the
Discovery Institute scam artists are running at the moment isn't going
to fool anyone with a brain.  He knows that the Wedge will have to
wait for a new pristine batch of creationist scam artists that haven't
been tainted by participation in the dishonest ID scam to come forward
and take the place of the current creationist scam artists.

Just look at this book.  Is unbiased observer going to take it
seriously with the list of authors that it has?  Meyer, Nelson,
Minnich, Moneymaker, and Seelke.  The only one that I haven't heard of
before associated with the teach ID scam is Seelke, and he was
probably involved too.  Anyone just has to look up their rhetoric for
the past decade and compare it to the book that they supposedly wrote
to improve science education and what will they have to conclude?
Even if they don't understand most of what is in the book, as is
probably the plan of these scam artists.

I think Johnson is aware of how bad it makes the scam artists at the
Discovery Institute look, but it is all they can do to stay in the
game.  Absolutely no one will miss the fact that these guys spent
years selling the dishonest teach ID creationist scam.  They will try
to ignore the fact and belittle it, but they can't deny it.  Well, my
guess is that they will, but it will just be the big lie propaganda at
work.  Meyer was director of the creationist scam outfit of the
Discovery Institute since it was founded.  He personally ran the bait
and switch scam on the Ohio State Board creationist rubes that had
bought into the bogus ID scam and found out that there was nothing
about ID that they could teach.  Meyer seems to be first author of
this book.  How credible can the book possibly be?  These guys ran a
dishonest bait and switch scam on their own creationist supporters.

The creationist scam artists obviously went to a lot of trouble to try
and find a publisher that didn't have a creationist taint that they
could get to publish this book, but they can't hide their identities,
and their past is a matter of rercord.

One of the most memorable moments in the PBS documentary for me was
the shot of Johnson admitting that the creationist scams weren't going
to work within his lifetime.  I think that there was a genuine sadness
in his face, when he admitted failure.

&gt; Interesting. I see in the Table of Contents that much of it, contrary
&gt; to the past ID practice, directly addresses common descent. Of course,
&gt; they shrewdly use the qualifier &quot;universal,&quot; which has become
&gt; curiously common whenever an IDer addresses CD. I could be wrong, but
&gt; this could be another bait-and-switch where they invoke Carl Woese as
&gt; rejecting *universal* CD (technically true, but very misleading).
">

If they stick to their usual dishonest approach, misdirection will be
a key component of the book.  Common descent is a fact of nature.
They can't deny that all vertebrates have a common ancestor, but
&quot;universal&quot; is just as dishonest and &quot;darwinian&quot; when they talk about
evolution.  We already know the ploy they tried invoking Woese.  If
this book just heaps on more of the same, it wouldn't surprise me.
Confusing the issue is all that they can do.  Heck they are going to
be talking about evolutionary events that happened over 3 billion
years ago.  My guess is that they will gloss over that fact.
Education isn't the goal of this book.

It gives the advantage to the underdog, but whatever they come up
with, there is a lot more that they can't counter.  Any teacher that
uses this book as a study aid should not be teaching in the public
schools.  Just looking at the authors and their sordid history of
their involvement in an obvious creationist scam to teach ID in the
public schools.  That should be enough to warn off any credible
teacher.  About the only ones that would use this book are the
ignorant, incompetent, and/or dishonest.  That is sad, but it is a
fact.  Just try to claim that anyone would think that this book was
anything more than an extension of the dishonest creationist ploys
that the authors have been involved in before.

Have they appologized for running the dishonest creationist teach ID
scam?  Have they admitted that they were wrong about ID?  Have they
appologized for running the bait and switch scam on their own
creationist supporters that fell for the teach ID scam?  Even after
Dover these clowns were still talking about intelligent design theory
as if they really had a scientific theory.  The last that I heard from
Meyer was that teaching ID is &quot;premature&quot; at this time.  That was last
year at some church sponsored ID dog and pony show.  If ID is
premature today, what was it over a decade ago when they were running
the teach ID scam full steam ahead?  They are only using ID as a come
on to make the rubes believe that there is some controversy that they
want to teach.  What happens when the creationist rubes get the
replacement and find out that ID/creationism can't even be mentioned
among the topics under discussion?  Some like the Ohio board take the
switch even though it is coming from the same guys that they know lied
to them about ID, but a lot of them have just dropped the issue.  All
the legislation about teaching ID that has been proposed has been
dropped, once the bait and switch came in, and has come to nothing.
These legislators may be planning to run the switch, but they have to
figure out how to do it and stay credible.  I'd like to think that, at
least, some of them realize how bogus the effort is.

The history of the Discovery Institute demonstrates that they are not
open to placing their own alternatives up to scrutiny.  In all the
years that the ran the teach ID scam they never put up a lesson plan
to demonstrate what they had to teach about ID, never.  Since they
have been running the bait and switch and pushing the teach the
controversy-critical analysis replacement scam they have never put up
their version of a lesson plan to teach that scam.  They have always
left it up to the rubes to do the dirty work and take the fall for the
effort.  This book will be no different.  They know that the only way
that their views will be introduced into the science class is if some
ignorant or incompetent teacher screws up, or one purposely introduces
the junk.  They have to rely on incompetence and dishonesty to do what
they know that they can't do themselves.  If this was not true, why
did they never put up an ID lesson plan?  Why don't they have a lesson
plan for the replacement scam?  Why didn't they have this lesson plan
ready when they ran the bait and switch?  They had been working on the
replacement scam since, at least, 1999, so why make the Ohio rubes
screw up and take the heat?

For those of you that don't know what a lesson plan is it is fairly
simple.  You just say what you are going to teach, why you are going
to teach it, and how you are going to teach it.  It has to include how
you are going to evaluate what your students learned from the lesson.
You should have the materials (like a textbook and lab equipment) that
you need and a class time outline.  The scam artists with PhDs at the
Discovery Institute have never produced one in all the years that they
have claimed to be able to teach this junk to children.  What does
that tell any thinking human being?  We all know why they never put up
their ID lesson plan.  They never had anything to teach because
teaching ID is &quot;premature.&quot;  What is their excuse today for the
replacement scam?  Will they use the &quot;premature&quot; excuse again?

How do they expect teachers to incorporate their bogus book and what
do they expect students to get out of the lesson?  If the scam artists
don't know, why hawk the book?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think that it is going to work.  No one is going to be stupid

The excerpt on the Cambrian (P.30-31) sure indicates that. Not to toot
my horn - well OK, yes, to toot my horn - most reviwers will
concentrate on how they misrepresent the Cambrian and associated &quot;soft
fossils,&quot; and miss what I think is the biggest point. Nowhere in those
2 pages do they even mention what the &quot;next best formal hypothesis
would be&quot; if Cambrian evolution didn't occur. Behe seems to think
there was widespread saltation, and others seem to suggest widespread
abiogenesis of eukaryotes. Well, which is it?? The excerpt ends with a
section on PE, but I'll bet $ to donuts that it's the same old long-
refuted misrepresentation of Gould, and not their own hypothesis that
they plan to test on its own merits.

I heard of Seelke, but googling A'abrera was a &quot;d'oh&quot; moment. Kind of
like when I suggested to Dale Kelly that he look up a potential

turned out to be one and the same):

&gt; &gt; scam that Exploring Evolution is supposed to help perpetrate.

&gt; &gt; I don't think that it is going to work.  No one is going to be stupid
&gt; &gt; enough to buy into trying to claim that this is a pristine creationist
&gt; &gt; ploy when you have the same ID perps running it.  The only ones that
&gt; &gt; will buy into it are the ignorant or incompetent, and those that know
&gt; &gt; that it is a scam, but the only game in town at the moment.

&gt; &gt; My main question is, did Hill House know what they were getting into?
&gt; &gt; This could impact their credibility in selling the nature books that
&gt; &gt; they have been selling.  That is sad because their previous work looks
&gt; &gt; like high quality material.

&gt; &gt; They have a book &quot;Exploring Evolution.&quot;  They were smart enough not to
&gt; &gt; get the FTE to publish the book, but they did get a small publishing
&gt; &gt; company to do the dirty deed. http://www.exploreevolution.com/

&gt; &gt; Someone should do some investigating and find out just how much Hill
&gt; &gt; House publishing knew about what they were getting into.  They look
&gt; &gt; like a legitimate publisher that hasn't ever published a book like the
&gt; &gt; Discovery Institute rag.  It may be interesting to inform them of the
&gt; &gt; various activities of the authors and see what happens.

&gt; &gt; It is a no brainer why they didn't use the FTE to publish this book.
&gt; &gt; They made the mistake of publishing the Dembski replacement to Of
&gt; &gt; Panda's and People with that publisher, and they know that it is
&gt; &gt; useless to their cause.  They will still sell it to make money, but
&gt; &gt; they will try their best to get the rubes running the various
&gt; &gt; creationist scams to understand that it can't be used to further the
&gt; &gt; creationist agenda, just as bait.

&gt; &gt; Exploring Evolution isn't going to be just bait.  They seem to have
&gt; &gt; worked very hard to make it look legitimate, but their problem is the
&gt; &gt; authors.  No one can miss the fact that they were associated with the
&gt; &gt; intelligent design creationist scam.  Meyer was director of the ID
&gt; &gt; scam and Nelson was the first Discovery Institute fellow to admit that
&gt; &gt; there never had been a scientific theory of intelligent design to
&gt; &gt; teach to school children right after Meyer ran the bait and switch on
&gt; &gt; the Ohio State board in 2002.  The Ohio board had bought the ID scam,

This one is more informative:
http://www.iscid.org/bernard-dabrera.php

D'abrera is one of guys that joined ISCID.  For those that do not know
what the ISCID is, it was supposed to be the science society for
intelligent design advocates.  It was likely known to be bogus from
the beginning because the Discovery Institute ID scam artists didn't
start ISCID until after they had given up on teaching ID and had
started looking for alternative creationist scams.  It looks like all
ISCID was supposed to be was a propaganda organ to make it look like
the IDiots had something worth teaching so that they could perpetrate
the bait and switch scam and substitute the replacement scam for ID.
Really, before they founded ISCID the Discovery Institute already had
a pretty good idea that ID wasn't going to make the grade.  They were
already talking about the legal ramifications of the replacement scam
back in 1999.  If they thought that ID warrented the ISCID why would
they need a replacement scam:

http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id;=58

http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id;=589

So it doesn't look like the publisher is going to be pristine enough
to substitute for the FTE.

Seelke seems to be researching ID, but supports running the
replacement scam in the public schools.

http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id;=3536

and he participated in the Kansas fiasco in 2005 on the ID side:
http://wiki.cotch.net/index.php/Kansas_Intelligent_Design_Army

We will soon see how the Discovery Institute ID scam artist will sell
the publisher and the authors.

If you read the Bio blurp for Meyer it looks like he is working for
the Discovery Institute full time:

http://www.exploreevolution.com/about_the_authors.php

Quote Meyer bio:
He is currently the Director and Senior Fellow of the Center for
Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute in Seattle. Previously
he worked as a professor at Whitworth College and a geophysicist with
the Atlantic Richfield Company. He has co-authored or edited two other
books: Darwinism, Design, and Public Education (Michigan State
University Press) and Science and Evidence of Design in the Universe.
He has authored articles in scientific journals such as the
Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington ...
End Quote:

Can you believe that he is listing the Biological Society of
Washington as one of his science publications?

http://www.biolsocwash.org/

It takes more than nerve to list that publication, when you are trying
to look respectable.  It is relying on the ignorance of your audience
to pull a fast one.  You have to have a pretty pathetic publication
record to have to use that one.

Does anyone think that this book has scientific credibility?  Meyer
has admitted that Sternberg approached him about publishing this
article.  They met at an ID propaganda fest before Dover, a time when
the Discovery Institute was running the bait and switch on any rubes
that wanted to teach ID after Ohio in 2002.  Dover hadn't started when
Sternberg decided to publish this paper (probably before it was even
submitted).

&gt; and take the place of the current creationist scam artists.

&gt; Just look at this book.  Is unbiased observer going to take it

&gt; to improve science education and what will they have to conclude?
&gt; Even if they don't understand most of what is in the book, as is
&gt; probably the plan of these scam artists.

&gt; I think Johnson is aware of how bad it makes the scam artists at the
&gt; Discovery Institute look, but it is all they can do to stay in the

&gt; One of the most memorable moments in the PBS documentary for me was

Oh, I don't know.  Buckingham's name-calling of Judge Jones was the
highlight for me.  A guy who tries to claim that drug's messing with his
judgement was the excuse for perjury calling down Judge Jones was a good an
example of unintentional irony as I've ever seen.

Johnson just comes across as a pathetic old con-artist who realizes that
after all those years of well-placed lies and dealings with even more
immoral people than himself, that no American court, not even one run by an
appointee of George W. Bush (supposed champion of the Religious Right) will
give Creationism even in the most diluted of forms a pass.  Johnson and his
proteges simply cannot convince the scientific community that ID is
scientific or non-religious, and since the courts are always going to defer
to science on what constitutes science, and since only religious groups and
individuals are the least bit interested in promoting ID, Creationism is
likely forever to be barred from the secular science class.

I suspect for Johnson the failure is even bigger.  His best weapons, the
very few scientists like Behe who have been perverted to his cause are, in
fact, foolish, irresponsible men who ultimately betray the fact that they
are knowingly trying to bypass the First Amendment.  I don't think a judge
necessarily has to agree with evolution, but any judge, particular at Jones'
level, has had enough experience to recognize a liar, and let's face it,
Behe simply could not dissemble sufficiently the IC crapola, and to be
honest, I think Behe is the best they've ever had and ever will have.

My prediction right now is that the Discovery Institute probably doesn't
have more than five to ten years before it's shut down and morphs into
something else.  It's association with Dover and the Wedge strategy, no
matter how much it tried to distance itself after the brutal reverse
engineering of its nudge-nudge-wink-wink Creationism, is something it cannot
escape.  Whenever it's agents try to con some school board, someone will
always be able to bring up the Dover decision.

ID is dead, and Dover saw the last nails put in the coffin and the coffin
buried.
