Hi.

If I brake hard my car glides little before it brakes but if I brake
soft/gently it brakes normal.
I have bleeded the system few time and checked for fluid leaks but
there is non.

Changed the pad and the rota but still it glides little bit of
distances.

Would it be something wrong with the master cylinder..or is it
something else?

What do you mean that it Glides? It doesn't feel like it is stopping
as fast as it should?

It may help a bit if we knew some details about the car, like year,
make, model, transmission type, mileage, etc.

It's Subaru Impreza GX, 2.0 litre 2004 Model. Standard wheels and
tyres.
It's 5 speed manual and it has done about 72000Kms

Yes. It does not stop as fast as it should, don't even feel ABS
working. But If I brake slowly, I mean push the brake paddle gradually
I can feel it is gribs and I can even feel the ABS working towards the
end of stop.
