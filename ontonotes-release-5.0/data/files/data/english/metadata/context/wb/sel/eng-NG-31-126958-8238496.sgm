Valerie Grosvenor Myer
Prolific and versatile writer who won acclaim as a novelist,
literary critic, biographer and editor

Valerie Grosvenor Myer was best known as a novelist,
literary critic, scholar, biographer and editor. She was
also a fine journalist, poet and playwright and a gifted
university teacher, and will be remembered as a role model
for anyone considering taking a university degree as a
mature student.

Valerie Winifred Godwin was born in 1935 in the village of
Lower Soudley in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. The
maiden name of both her great-grandmothers was Grosvenor: no
coincidence, for her parents were second cousins, descended
from an illegitimate branch of the Westminster family.

The realities of her upbringing were less glamorous. Her
father, Donald Godwin, was a coalminer who had looked after
pit ponies as a boy. He became an insurance clerk and during
the war worked for the Forestry Commission. Valerie's
mother, Margaret, a policeman's daughter born in
Leytonstone, had attended a private girls' school in London.
She had ambitions for her daughters, but, after her husband
returned to work in the pit, she lost heart.

When Valerie pressed her to be allowed to continue into the
sixth form at East Dean Grammar School, Margaret decided
that her family belonged in the working class after all.
Valerie left school at the age of 16, trained as a librarian
in Gloucester, and contributed freelance reports to the Dean
Forest Mercury, which then took her on full-time.

In 1958 she moved to Kent as chief court reporter on the
Dartford Chronicle. On holiday in Brittany, she met Michael
Myer, and a year later, despite his Jewish family's initial
opposition to the match, they married. The couple integrated
the maiden name shared by Valerie's grandmothers into their
marital surname.

Grosvenor Myer then moved from local papers into London
women's magazines: first, as a subeditor on Housewife, then
as chief subeditor on Flair. Meanwhile, Michael, a Cambridge
graduate, encouraged her to continue studying. She enrolled
on an English course at the City Literary Institute. On
returning her first marked essay, her teacher, Dr Lois
Spencer, suggested she go to university, which inspired her
to apply for a mature state scholarship.

Her essay on Jane Austen's juvenilia won the award and, in
1963, aged 28, she sat the entrance exams for Cambridge and
was accepted by Newnham College. Supervised by Jean Gooder
and Q. D. &quot;Queenie&quot; Leavis, she graduated in 1966 with
first-class honours. Although she was never a strict
&quot;Leavisite&quot;, F. R. and Queenie Leavis were undoubted
influences on her work. Her enduring, though not exclusive,
interests were in the novel.

After a brief spell teaching, she joined The Times
Educational Supplement as deputy features editor, and then
The Teacheras features and literary editor, and wrote
Puritanism &amp; Permissiveness (1974), an exploration of moral
issues in Margaret Drabble's novels. This marked the start
of a steady and prolific output.

She wrote two books on Jane Austen: a critical study (1980)
and a biography, Obstinate Heart (1997). Other books on the
novel were Truculent Spirit, a History of Charlotte Bront?
Criticism (1987) and Ten Great English Novelists (1990).

Meanwhile, her elegant campus novel Culture Shock(1988) was
chosen as one of The Observer's books of the year. There
were two further biographies, A Victorian Lady in Africa:
The Story of Mary Kingsley (1989) and Harriette Wilson, Lady
of Pleasure (1999). As editor, she compiled Laurence Sterne:
Riddles and Mysteries (1984), Samuel Richardson: Passion and
Prudence (1987) and, her final scholarly work, The Continuum
Encyclopedia of British Literature (with Steven R. Serafin,
2003).

In 1988-89 she taught for a year at Beijing Language
University. Her posting was cut short by the Tiananmen
massacre on June 4, 1989. She visited the square on the day
before to witness her students demonstrating and, the night
after it, sheltered a group of them in her apartment.
Advised to leave the country by any means possible, she
spent a night in the Beijing Toronto hotel - where, the next
morning, bullet holes were found in the building's walls -
and managed to hitch a lift to the airport in the US embassy
bus.

In 1991-92 she spent a year teaching at the University of
Sierra Leone in Freetown. Then, having been begged to return
to Beijing, in 1992-93 she compiled and edited a standard
English comprehension textbook for students of English at
Chinese universities with Professor Li Yanshu ( Advanced
College Reading). Her novel based on her Tiananmen
experiences, The Butterfly House, appeared in 1998.

Possessed of a restlessly inquiring curiosity and a
discerning intellect, Grosvenor Myer was ambitious but
without vanity or snobbery. Throughout her life she remained
scathingly critical of the increasing influence of
&quot;celebrity&quot; culture on literary standards. Always courteous
and kind, she had an effervescent and generous personality
and an alert sense of humour.

In the last decade of her life she suffered from Parkinson's
disease.

Grosvenor Myer is survived by her husband.

Valerie Grosvenor Myer, writer and editor, was born on April
13, 1935. She died on August 9, 2007, aged 72
