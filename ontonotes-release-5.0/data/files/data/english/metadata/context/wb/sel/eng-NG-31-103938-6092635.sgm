I would like to invite all of the G4B folks back out for some more hill climbing.  It was such a pleasure having a group of you invade Northgate Mall back in November.  I am putting on this ride every Sunday through March, so if you can ride it as much as you want through the winter.  There will even be the "Frankenstein" option for those of you who want more.  It adds 3+ miles and 475 feet of climbing to the ride.

SUNDAYS: JANUARY 7TH THRU MARCH 25TH, 2007
1:00 PM – “Northgate Hills”
11-40mi. / various speeds / Meet in the southwest corner of the Northgate Mall parking lot behind Sears.

We have two routes available, a 32-mile Developmental Route and a 40-mile Advanced Climbers Route.

The Developmental Route allows you to ride from ONE to all SIX hills on the route.  This allows you to climb as much as you can handle.  At the top of each hill, you will have the option to continue on to the next climb or return to the start location with minimal additional climbing.

The Advanced Climbers Route contains 9 hills compacted into 40 miles.  This route will test your determination and willpower to continue through to the end.  There is a Drive-Thru conveniently located at the 20-mile point to refuel before conquering the remaining 6 climbs.

* Contact David “BigDave” Riemenschneider at 513-373-5387 or bikemi ... @fuse.net if you have any questions.
* Maps and Cue Sheets will be available at the ride start or via e-mail.
* Temperature won’t cancel the ride, only snow or ice covered roads or rain at ride time will cancel the ride.

Could you re-confirm the time for the Northgate Hill Rides. Some think
it is a 10:00 am ride others think 1:00 pm per your post. Please
rec-confirm.

Thanks

Through the winter, it will start at 1PM to allow for warmer
temperatures.  You guys could start at 10AM from Nisbet and ride to the
ride (about 20 miles), then refuel at the IHOP across the street before
the 1PM start.  Easy route, just follow Kemper Rd. all the way across.

Sounds great, I'm in if we get a group.  Sounds like Fraser is in.
Brian H. indicated he'll go if we get a group.  Bill R. may also be
able to squeeze in a ride depending upon the "game" schedules.

Dave, if I fuel at IHOP, then ride hills, it will get ugly real
fast!

I'm not squeamish about doing urban rides on roads like Kemper, but
I'm not sure doing it with a large group is adviseable... I suppose a
10:00 start would allow a leisurely pace though.

Thanks for the timing clarification, I was suffering tempory
insanity last night when people were asking about the start time....

See ya there!
Mr. C.  :-)

It looks like rain after 6PM. Is there a ride this afternoon?  If not I will
watch for the weekend postings.
