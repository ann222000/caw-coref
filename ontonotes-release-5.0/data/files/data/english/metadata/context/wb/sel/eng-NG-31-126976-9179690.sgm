On a recent Empire Builder trip to Glacier Park, we saw in Havre Mt a
parked Baldwin steam loco.  I believe it was 4-8-4, with 80&quot; drive
wheels.

I was wondering whether one of those monsters would have pulled our
current Amtrak 11-car consist at current 80mph speeds?

Easily, on reasonably level terrain.  Such engines were designed
for operation in the 80 to 100 mph range in passenger service
(back then there were no Federal rules restricting speeds to
79mph or less).

Where Amtrak has the advantage is on hillier sections, since they
can just add an additional locomotive for extra power and maintain
speed.  In steam days they typically would have simply run slower
on the uphill, and made it up by going faster on the down side.

Yes.

In the &quot;old days&quot; of steam (before the &quot;modern&quot; steam era when everything
was carefully engineered) the general rule was that the maximum safe
operating speed in miles per hour was equal to the size of the drivers in
inches.

So, even using that rule (which turned out to be overly conservative in
the later decades of steam operation) a locomotive with 80 inch drivers
would operate a train at 80 mph.

As the engineering got better and better, the speeds got faster without
increasing the driver diameter.

The Hiawatha locomotives owned by Milwaukee Road, for example, had to
operate at 100 mph just to keep the timetable but had drivers in the
approximately 80 inch range.

It really is a shame not one single Hiawatha loco was saved. Almost as
sad as the scrapping of all the NYC's Niagara locomotives. However given
the high cost of preserving/restoring such vintage beauties, they'd
probably have sat rotting anyway.

As for a 4-8-4 pulling a modern 11 car train at 80mph or above, don't
see why not. In fact probably would be a piece of piss for many of the
major haulers since most were built to move heavy-weight Pullman cars.

Better measurement than pieces of piss might be hp, but indeed, some of
them delivered slightly more than the ~4000 hp of a Genesis, so they
should be up to the task.
None of them was a match for an Amtrak Toaster or NJT Alp-46, though.

I would think that with modern welded rail, 80+ would be easy, or is
engine weight a factor?

Not sure I understand this question.  In days of steam big engines
like 4-8-4s routinely exceeded 80mph on 110lb jointed rail.  100mph
running was not unknown.  If that was possible on the lighter rail
of 60 years ago, it would certainly be possible on modern 140lb
welded rail.

And talk to Doyle, Steve Lee, and a few others about what a 4-8-4 can do
when it is asked to stay out of the way of modern main line freight
traffic.  Only just a few years ago the SP&amp;S #700 (another 4-8-4) ran from
Portland up to Spokane and back, and despite the fairly heavy train did
quite well, and I am quite certain it got up to the maximum allowed 79 mph
in places.

With passengers?  I had thought all the big steam operators had

It probably depends on who the insurance carrier is.

I have definitely seen 4449 with train and passengers on it going over 45
mph since that time.  I was on Interstate 5 going north out of Vancouver,
WA a few years ago, and Doyle and his locomotive appeared on the main line
and ran parallel to me for some distance, and in fact I think was gaining
on me slightly.  The speed limit on that part of I-5 is 70 mph, and that
is about what I was doing.  I'm guessing the train was going in the 73 mph
range.

At that time, Montana Daylight was operating a train out of Sandpoint,
Idaho made up of Amtrak compatible private cars, complete with Amtrak
800,000 series numbers and fully maintained to Amtrak conditions.  This
means those trains could operate as Amtrak trains.  My understanding is
that this also allowed them to operate with Amtrak's insurance policy
which helped the economics of operating excursions quite a bit.

A few years ago, Montana Daylight folded and sold all its cars.  Thus,
main line excursions here in the northwest have been few and far between
since.  Thanks to the Union Pacific and BNSF they did operate the 4449 and
844 on a double headed train earlier this year.  However, without Montana
Daylight and their fleet of Amtrak quality maintained cars, the economics
of operating main line excursions here in the northwest, and certainly
operating at speed, is quite different.  They can no longer be treated as
Amtrak trains with a steam locomotive at the front.

Up in Deerfield some years ago while chasing NKP 765 when she was in

What would be the good of building either, when few if any of the major
RR's would permit them on their ROW? UP does have a decent steam loco
program, and there are a few others, but nothing remotely like it was
back in the day, which is what it would have to be in order to generate
anything near revenue to offset costs.

Consider how things, including labour laws have changed since even the
1950's. Tree huggers don't want coal burnt for anything including
generating electrical power, so you'd be hard pressed to get a coal
burning loco into revenue service past them. Oil is very expensive these
days, which would add to the cost.

Personally am not interested in a &quot;fast&quot; steam loco, we have modern
trains that can reach speeds to make a
4-8-4 eat dust. In a perfect world, would LOVE to see resources devoted
to rebuilding a &quot;Big Boy&quot; , and putting her back on the rails. Now that
would be something to see.

&gt; What would be the good of building either, when few if any of the major

&gt; back in the day, which is what it would have to be in order to generate
&gt; anything near revenue to offset costs.

&gt; Consider how things, including labour laws have changed since even the
&gt; 1950's. Tree huggers don't want coal burnt for anything including
&gt; generating electrical power, so you'd be hard pressed to get a coal

If the crew works for free, in order to support the preservation effort,
economics of a steamer can look different.

After a &gt; 10% railfreight growth last year, Germany has another 10%
growth this year, with the result of a serious shortage of freight
locos. See one result of the loco shortage in these 4.5 MB and 3 MB
amateur films.

I agree that rebuilding a lost loco from scratch will not work, but
under the conditions of serious loco shortage and the crew working for
a thank-you, working a &quot;normal&quot; train now and then can gain serious
money for the preservation effort. I don't know about US rules for
steamers, but by German safety rules, any steamer has to pass a boiler
safety check after some years, if it is supposed to operate, not just
standing in a museum. Costs of a boiler check can easily endanger such
loco, or at least its operation on the tracks, so there is real need, to
find some money.

The British groups have considerably better financial support than North
American rail preservation groups.  I'm not sure exactly why, but they
seem to be extremely good at getting lots of money from very wealthy
donors.

The ACE3000 would not sound or look like earlier steam engines, which were
labor-intensive.  The ACE3000 was projected to be economical if oil went up
in price to about where it is now.  But with inflation, about $200 a barrel
would do it.  At the time it was developed, it was also a fear that oil
would be cut off because of an embargo and at least we would have
transportation on the railroads.  The project was not as far from reality as
you think.

They aren't doing so, they have done so years ago. A private operator
has bought the newest QJs and operated a mining railroad in a very cold
area with them, but despite the very young age of the locos, despite
them being rather well-built, despite Chinese labour costs, that
operator has scrapped them after a few years, too. (After some years of
creating a steam fan Mekka.)

But the profile of CR is a little different. Last year and this year,
CR took delivery of 180 HXD1:

This year and next year, CR will take delivery of 180 HXD2:
http://www.railcolor.net/PRIMA/PRIMA_DJ4.html

CR has now ordered 1500 DJ-8 locos, 500 from Bombardier/Dalian,
500 from Siemens/Zhuzhou, 500 from Alstom/Datong. 9600 kW, six axles,
150 metric tons.
2.2 million ¤ each, not bad for AC drive and the power of 3 US diesels.

Delivery of the Bombardier units in 2009 - 2011, the Siemens units will
also start in 2009, Alstom a little later.

Then there are 420 Toshiba/DLoco SSJ3, six-axle locos of ~7000 kW, a
first series of 60 locos is currently in the works.

CR has now ordered 1500 DJ-8 locos, 500 from Bombardier/Dalian,
500 from Siemens/Zhuzhou, 500 from Alstom/Datong. 9600 kW, six axles,
150 metric tons.
2.2 million ¤ each, not bad for AC drive and the power of 3 US diesels.

Delivery of the Bombardier units in 2009 - 2011, the Siemens units will
also start in 2009, Alstom a little later.

Read Wardale's book some time.  That'll give you the true story on

Even if one gets around the problems of burning coal, steam locomotives
still need water, lots of water. Unless you intend to reinstall water
towers and pans, it is going to take lots of water trucks moving about
to feed steam engines.  Diesel engines can run from one end of the
country and probably half way back on one fuelling, IIRC. RR times are
bad enough already without allowing coaling/water stops.

Again, not saying it couldn't be done, but it would take someone like
UP, who already has the in house expertise and labour to pull it off.
Sadly again, there aren't any &quot;Big Boys&quot; for them to restore, and even

Yes, most of the 25 class (the basis for the Red Devil) were
built as condensing locomotives, to operate a section of line
with no natural water supply available.  By the time the Red
Devil was built, all the operating locomotives of the class
had been converted to non-condensing, due to the extremely high
maintenance the condensers required.

There are two main objections to condensing.  One is that the
actual process of condensing requires a lot of extra rotating
machinery - pumps to move steam and water, fans to move cooling
air.  The other is that the water becomes contaminated with
cylinder lubricant which is entrained in the exhaust steam.
(note that neither issue exists in marine or stationary steam
plants, where cooling water can be easily moved to the steam,
and the turbine does not have lubricant in the steam space).

Plus the fact that the line requiring condensers had converted to
different power.

At the time, the line through the Karoo was running a lot of trains.
There is an old (mid-1980s) &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot; program
on South Africa in general, including a visit to the Karoo.  As soon as
one train was gone you could hear the next one coming in the distance.
Here, one heavy freight would every 10 minutes would be unheard of except
on city transit lines, but under South African conditions at the time it
was happening on the line through the Karoo.

Also remember that despite the poverty of the people, South Africa is
actually a fairly rich country in terms of the amount of money available
to accomplish things.

With cheap labor, lots of coal, a fair amount of cash, and lots of
traffic, it should be no surprise that the best choice at the time was to
electrify a massive amount of track.

During the entire time I spent in South Africa, I never saw a single
diesel locomotive, except on the line up to the border crossing to Maputo,
which I think uses Mocambique Railway's diesel to complete the last little
bit of of unelectrified line from the border into Komatipoort, which is
electrified.

I would take the SA example more to be that neither design was better
than burning the coal in a power station and electrifying the line.
Coal power stations can be made a whole lot more efficient than a
locomotive because they can employ a much higher pressure ratio, various
bits and pieces like feed-heaters, turbines and condensers.  None of
these is practical in a locomotive format.  Locomotives will be lucky to
get near 20% thermodynamic efficiency, steam power stations can
routinely exceed 40%.  Desings for things like IGCC look to even better
performance with coal as a fuel, and IGCC with carbon sequestration is
now moving off the drawing board into pilot plans.  Clean coal is not a
fantasy any longer.

Spoornet has a policy that they won't operate a diesel locomotive under
wire, since their price for diesel is about twice that in other parts of
the world, due to taxes. Electricity is very inexpensive.

Therefore, the diesel locomotives tend to operate only on light density
branch lines, and other non-electrified lines, such as the line through
Swaziland up to Zimbabwe.  They trade off the cost of energy against the
efficient use of locomotives as a result.

The one exception that I know of is the iron ore line, which is one of only
two in the world with 50kV overhead.  The traffic on the line has grown so
much that they ran out of capacity in the electric substations, and would
have to completely rebuild the electrification to run more trains.
Instead, they are using diesel helpers along with the electrics to handle
the traffic.

This has been posted before.  You obviously weren't paying attention.
Here goes again.

Here are some cites for the large engine efficiency:

http://people.bath.ac.uk/ccsshb/12cyl/

&quot;Fuel consumption at maximum power is 0.278 lbs per hp per hour (Brake
Specific Fuel Consumption).  Fuel consumption at maximum economy is 0.260
lbs/hp/hour.  At maximum economy the engine exceeds 50% thermal
efficiency.&quot;

http://www.manbw.com/category_000444.html

&quot;1982: First two-stroke diesel engine with an efficiency of more than
50%&quot;

And some general discussion on the subject from Chevron and others:

http://tinyurl.com/2o8ftc

&quot;The main advantage of a diesel engine is its high thermal efficiency.
Diesel engines can achieve thermal efficiencies in excess of 50%. The
best gasoline engines are only about 30% to 33% efficient, and then only
at wide throttle openings.&quot;

http://www.dieselforum.org/where-is-diesel/railroad/?type=98

&quot;Diesel engine technology in railroad locomotives has advanced
dramatically in recent years. Fuel-efficiency has increased 61 percent
since 1980.&quot;

And a 2002 paper from the Department of Energy specifically discussing
the efficiency of locomotives (PDF file). Things have improved even
further since then:

http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/RR/261.pdf

&quot;The diesel engine is the most efficient transportation power plant
available today. Thermal efficiency of locomotive diesel engines is 40%
or higher, which results from high power density (via high turbocharger
boost), high turbocharger efficiencies, direct fuel injection with
electronic timing control, high compression ratio, and low thermal and
mechanical losses.&quot;

The thermal efficiency at the time steam was displaced with diesel
locomotives was about 30 percent.  There has been steady improvement in
the intervening years, as noted in the quotes above.  The current numbers
reflect the result of the evolving technology. (Shhh: Jack doesn't
understand that R&amp;D is actually going on in the rail industry.)

Improvements included turbosupercharging, higher injection pressures and
better injection spray patterns, electronically controlled injection
timing, higher combustion temperatures, etc. etc.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wheels.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering whether one of those monsters would have pulled our
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; current Amtrak 11-car consist at current 80mph speeds?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In the &quot;old days&quot; of steam (before the &quot;modern&quot; steam era when
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; everything
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was carefully engineered) the general rule was that the maximum safe
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; operating speed in miles per hour was equal to the size of the drivers
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; inches.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, even using that rule (which turned out to be overly conservative
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the later decades of steam operation) a locomotive with 80 inch
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; drivers
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would operate a train at 80 mph.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As the engineering got better and better, the speeds got faster
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; without
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; increasing the driver diameter.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The Hiawatha locomotives owned by Milwaukee Road, for example, had to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; operate at 100 mph just to keep the timetable but had drivers in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; approximately 80 inch range.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It really is a shame not one single Hiawatha loco was saved. Almost as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sad as the scrapping of all the NYC's Niagara locomotives. However given
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the high cost of preserving/restoring such vintage beauties, they'd
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; probably have sat rotting anyway.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As for a 4-8-4 pulling a modern 11 car train at 80mph or above, don't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; see why not. In fact probably would be a piece of piss for many of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; major haulers since most were built to move heavy-weight Pullman cars.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;They've built as new an A1 in England so with all our resources why
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;can't we rebuild a Hiawatha and/or Niagra.

&gt; &gt;&gt; We also have the resources to rebuild a WWI era bi-plane, but why
&gt; &gt;&gt; would we want to??

&gt; &gt;Because 1) it isn't that hard. Those were largely wood and far easier to
&gt; &gt;make. Steamer's like these are built with brute force by comparison. You
&gt; &gt;know, those things like rolling 1&quot; or more thick steel into a boiler, or
&gt; &gt;forging rods. Small things like that.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Despite all the Foamer's rantings, Steam is not

&gt; &gt;&gt; the Model T without the electric starter.....

&gt; &gt;I guess you missed the ACE 3000 which would MU with diesels, use

While it has little to do with overall thermal efficiency, it does have a
lot to do with overall fuel consumption:

There have also been significant efforts at reducing idling speed and even
building engines that don't have to be left idling all the time.  It is
harder to get that type of fuel economization from steam.

or 1440 / 150 = ) one train every 9.6 minutes, on average.  However, those

While fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs were major reasons for
replacing steam with diesel, there is an additional reason that helps keep
steam from returning: wear and tear on the track structure.

It was pointed out to me by a mechanical engineer a few years ago that
there are some incredible forces exerted on the track structure by steam
locomotives - the torque is not constant as the wheels turn, compared to
wheels driven by either an electric motor or by a diesel-hydraulic drive
train.

While they had good intentions, and were intending to incorporate many
improved designs, the fact is that a steam locomotive will always be more
labor-intensive to maintain and operate than a diesel-electric.

As an example, just look at the wheel arrangments, with large, spoked
wheels connected by side rods.  Worn wheels will be difficult to replace,
requiring time and effort for disassembly and reassembly, careful
matching of diameters and accurate quartering.

The wheels on a diesel-electric are relatively inexpensive, and fairly
easy to swap out.  The ease of swapping wheels and motors means that the
locomotive is quickly returned to service, keeping availability high.

There are also operational issues, such as how long it takes to get a
cold locomotive into service, how to resupply them with coal if you run
out somewhere away from a normal coaling location, operational
restrictions around hazardous chemicals, the effectiveness of adhesion
control, and the effect of any future emission regulations relating to
exhaust emissions and the level of CO2.  The locomotives simply might not
be able to meet current emission requirements.
