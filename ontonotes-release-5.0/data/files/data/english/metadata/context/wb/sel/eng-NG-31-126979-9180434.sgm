How should we eq the guitar and bass amps for a good live mix with a PA
that is for vocals only?
I would assume to tell the guitar players to turn down the bass settings
on their amps and even on the bass amp.
With drums unmiked they would be in competition for the low frequencies
with the guitars and bass.
Any comments on a good live eq mix onstage?
Assume that it's not that the guitar players are too loud- just eq
settings on individual amps.

trial and error till you get the sound you want

start with the vocals and then establish a backline mix that fits
comfortably under the vox

Not really. It's about getting the sound you want.

The only advice you do need is not to play too loud on stage. The sound from the
amps will either spill into every mic and destroy any chance of a decent mix.or
simply overwhelm the PA with their raw SPL and mess things up that way. OR the
sound engineer will compensate with the PA level and deafen everyone. Bad news
whichever way it goes.

Turn DOWN.

Getting the players to change &quot;their sound&quot; may be difficult but
alot can be done with positioning the mic's.

One of the keys to a good live sound is a good stage sound.
Encourage players to obtain a good balance between insturments at the
source and you are most of the way there. If they are balanced onstage
then the first insturment you may need to mic is the kick drum.

Depends a lot on the actual musical context and on the amp's speaker
setup.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I wouldn't, but I would ask them to avoid turning it up. Basically if
their rigs do not sound OK as they are, they need fixing.

I doubt that and would rather say &quot;not to worry&quot;, you won't get the body
feel of rock at sane sound levels if your start curtailing the naturally
occuring bass level.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Do nothing is a good default eq strategy. But there are very different
cases to consider, such as also whether guitar and bass plays parts of
the same chord or whether they are in dialogue. Some of the time they
should blend to one instrument.

Not having them amplified via a PA adds the option of solid directional
clues because you hear them from each their instrument, I consider amp
and loudspeaker to be integral parts of the instruments in question.

OK, will try assume, but you do realize that what you ask for is very
difficult? - guitar players are notoriously difficult to control, they
always have an extra volume control somewhere ...

This is great advice, but sometimes hard to put into practice.  In my
experience, the drummer sets the stage volume; everything else
(guitars, vocal monitors, etc.) have to be up high enough to be heard
over the crash cymbals and snares.  Particular the lead guitarist
(e.g., me) needs to be able to hear himself well enough not to get
lost while soloing, and the guitar (as well as vocals) shares much of
the frequency space with cymbals and snare.

There are drummers who can drum well with a light touch (and light
sticks) and drummers who can't.  The latter seem to be more common.
I've seen the trick of putting up a plexiglass shield around the
drummmer, and it makes a lot of sense, but we don't have one yet (I'm
not even sure where to get one or what it would cost).

How big is your amp ? Can you tilt the cabinet so you're more directly in line with
the speakers ? That'll reduce the need to play too loud.

I have my combo amp on a tilt-back stand that points pretty much right
at my head.   But the volume from the nearby drummer still determines
how loud I have to set my amp, and then I have to be able to hear
vocals (including my own) over both the drums and my own guitar amp.

Sadly, getting an engineer of any kind seems to always
be very low on the needs list.

As for mic' placement, stating the (not always) obvious, don't
place your quiet/lower level things in front of your very loud
things.

In a sound for musicians class I said, &quot;...you shouldn't
put a weak vocalist in front of the drums&quot; and half the
class said, &quot; ...wow, I never thought of that.&quot;

Let the guitarists do their own EQ.... Work on getting a good volume mix..
Warm up with your drummers favorate(loudest)song and everyone can set their
volumes to that.

I presume that you are running a cable from the line outputs of the
bass and guitar amps into line-level inputs on your FOH mixer.

How you eq those inputs first and foremost is whatever it takes to get
the sound you want. I end up rolling off the top end and bottom end,

IME no changes are needed. Let the musos adjust their amps to sound
good to them, but make sure they know that it is not up to them to
fill the hall with the sound of their instruments. You will probably
still have to deal with a lot of bleed from their amps.

Unless you carry and threaten to use a loaded weapon, or your musos
are exceptionally mature, the musos will turn their amps up to hear
&quot;more me&quot;, and the drummer will play as loud as he can, leaving

Are you wearing any kind of hearing protection?  &lt;seriously&gt;

Next-to-drums + amp-aimed-at-head + no ear protection = deaf guitarist

It'll all become mush and you won't be able to hear your guitar over
anything once you damage your ears enuf, if it isn't that way already.

Also, I think you may be a little off in your &quot;drums dictate the stage
volume&quot; theory.  I play both guitar and drums in bands and I can see
both sides, but when you get into the rock world, a drumset doesn't
have a volume control and the guitar amps do.  Lower your amps and
you'd be amazed how most drummers will quiet down with you nicely.
&lt;disclaimer realizing that there are those drummers who are and always
will be insane bashers tho&gt;  I love being able to play with some
dynamics, and cranked up guitar amps (or cranked up anything for that
matter) don't encourage playing dynamics at all.

So turn it down, and it'll all become clearer.  ;-)

I made that crazy suggestion to a band. They were amazed at
how much cleaner things were with the lower stage volume, and
with less stage bleed I had a much easier time balancing the mix.

The problem is then that your post was not a logical post for a live
sound group. You were basically asking a buch of live sound technicans
how to avoid using live sound technology to solve your problem.

The answer is: forget about trying to get the musos to do something
that they are poorly equipped to do. On stage sound and hall sound are
two different things. Expecting musos to control something that they
can't hear is unreasonable.

If you read virtually every post in this thread, you will find  the
message that your problem would probablyl be best solved by making
greater use of live sound technology, instead of limiting it to just
the vocals.

Live sound technicans best serve by managing FOH sound which they can
hear, on behalf of the musos who can't hear it.

The biggest struggle that live sound technicans have, the one that is
the most frustrating for everybody and takes up the most time, is
managing the on-stage sound when the people adjusting it can't hear
it. By now everybody knows that the best person to manage stage sound
is someone who can hear it, hence sepearate mixer(s) for the stage
monitors.

With guitars that is something you shouldn't do as the harmonics created by
the speaker cone make up a good part of the sound. A bass will work from a
DI, a guitar won't.

The OP is using the PA for vocals only Arny which means you are way off bat
as usual. Why do you bother trying to give advice when you do not have the
smarts to do it and end up doing more harm than good? He would be better
served with getting a good sound out of the amps to the satisfaction of the
player and working on stage volume getting each amp to the right level so
the vocals can cut through without straining the PA.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Depends on the size of the room and the system. I have no problems in my
theatre but then I know what I am doing, you do not.

To the OP: Get a sound you are happy with as players then bring your volume
levels down so the vocals can cut through. EQing the amps is not the way to
go. Oh, and ignore anything Arny posts - he's so clueless he thinks FOH is
backstage.

As a soundman it's a winner too - less bleed, more control over the

This band flat out rejected the suggestion. They were afraid that the
drummer would no longer be able to hear the vocals...

For the hundredth time I get &quot;we use Fender toob amps, we must to turn them
up to get the tone we want&quot;.

One of the Country bands i did a couple years ago the lead G had a wedged
rig whigh he put in front next to the vocal monitor... it worked very well.
I keep wondering how the guys with 27 pedals in series know which one to
stomp on.

Im looking forward to my annual Christmas musical in an all new venue.  I
need to determine if I can mix from inside the sound and light booth.

Well - there is truth to that.  Even the best sound guy cannot make an amp
sound like something it's not.  If it's not making the sound, no amount of
mixing effort is going to create it.  Unfortunately, many of these &quot;tones&quot;
are more suitable for outdoor performances...

As for turning the amp toward the player, I've done that myself.  It's not a
bad address of the problem, but it's not without its own issues.  Suddenly
the guitar player is hearing too much of himself and loosing the stage mix -
the self mix.  IMHO, there's just no trick substitute for self discipline up
front.

Actually - I generally suffer more grief from female vocalists who can
*never* hear enough of themselves in the monitors...

I've tried telling them that the difference between a female vocalist and a
puppy is that if you pat a puppy on the head it quits whinning.  Somehow
that seems to upset them.  Go figure.

A good place to look is the actual vocal mic and it's spec's.  Getting a
modern mic (like the Audix om5-7) that you have to 'eat' to sing on will
pick up less drums and gtr amp. Isolation is the key to lower stage volume,
and if you can't do it with space, do it with smart mic positioning, monitor
and amp placement.  It's pretty hard to talk about stage dynamics as a
player if the stage vol is already loud before you even start playing gtr
due to the wedges.  Another thing is to not put anything in your wedge that
you can already hear from elsewhere. That could substantially reduce the
volume just by having less duplication of sound.

Otherwise, keep it as quiet as possible.  Only put in what is needed to
blend, do harmony, etc.  Essentially, the lead instrument, lead singer, and
yourself, maybe a little kick if you can't hear it naturally.  Usually if
the lead instrument has their own amp you may not need any of them in the
separate monitor.

If you mean mixing on stage for the FOH, hire a sound tech to do it off
stage and in front of the mains.

If there are problems with eqs on just the individual amps, then address
these individual amps.

&gt; ???  You mean the pa is designed only for vocals and you are using it for
&gt; the guitar and bass?

No, read what he said again, possibly after you take some English
comprehension classes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No such thing.  All PA's (mixer, amp, speakers combos) are multi purpose.
&gt; The PA is a fixed install and commonly used only for vocals
&gt; (announcements)?  totally different problem here.

Get a clue Bony.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I would assume to tell the guitar players to turn down the bass settings
&gt;&gt; on their amps and even on the bass amp.

&gt; Why?
">

Because he thinks that would help the vocals cut through. It is pretty
obvious he is only slightly more clued-up than you are so is humble enough
to come here and ask for advice. Sadly people like you and Arny who know
nothing but like to pretend they are sound engineers post replies like this
and confuse the poor guy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; With drums unmiked they would be in competition for the low frequencies

See above.

Your lack of English comprehension is showing through again Bony.

Hmmmm, you rant on and on about how churches have no money and that budgets
are tight then you go telling this particular church to go out and hire a
sound engineer.

&gt; As for turning the amp toward the player, I've done that myself.  It's not a
&gt; bad address of the problem, but it's not without its own issues.  Suddenly
&gt; the guitar player is hearing too much of himself and loosing the stage mix -
&gt; the self mix.  IMHO, there's just no trick substitute for self discipline up
&gt; front.
">

As the lead guitarist (and backing vocalist) in my band, I've taking
to putting my Fender combo on a tilt-back stand right next to my wedge
monitor, facing backwards and up toward (but slightly behind) my
head.    That way, I hear less of my guitar when I'm at the mic
singing, more when I step back to play a solo.  The FOH gets all of my
guitar via the PA.  It works well because I can keep the overall amp
volume way down and still hear it over the drums and everything else,
it doesn't bleed much into my vocal mic (because it's behind the mic),
and the drummer can hear me well enough to know where I am in my
solos.  The other guys get a little of my guitar in their monitors, if
they need it (e.g., on an open stage with no reflecting wall behind
us)

Interestingly, I've had at least two sound guys tell me that they had
never seen a guitarist set up their amp like that. Then, after a
pause, they said &quot;seems like a great idea!&quot;

As for Fender &quot;toob&quot; tone, I have found that no matter how large the
venue, the guy running sound always begs me to keep the amp down to
around 3-4, which means it's basically running clean.  Therefore I get
all of my tone from pedals.  No one in the audience has ever
complained that my tone is from the pedals not the power tubes.
