I've got one of the last Sony desktops that are really almost dead quiet and
am currently running an XFX 7600gs w/256 just for regular desk top use.  No
gaming.  Does anyone know of a faster card without a fan ?   TIA.

Gigabyte 8600 they have two models that are fanless, I'd prolly get the
one with the bigger heatsink.

XFX makes several 7950GT models with passive coolers (single-slot, no less).
Ensure your case is wide enough to accommodate the heatpipe module that
protrudes over the top edge of the card. The 7950GT is faster than the 8600,
by the way, though it obviously lacks DX10 compliance.

If you don't intend to do any gaming, what's the point of upgrading your
7600GS?

Thanks.  They're on Newegg.  I am wondering though - rhetorical question -
Am I going  see a whopper of a perceived speed increase ?  In XP or Vista ?

In regular desktop use - not at all, not even in Vista Aero. In games, the
7950GT is easily twice as fast as the 7600GS.

I had a 7600GT by asus without fan. Worked well until I replaced
it last week by a Asus 8800 GTS, shich is quiet enough that I do
not regret the change.

Actually the only game I play very occasionally is Flight Simulator.
Thoughts on vast improvement there ?

Flight Simulator X or an earlier version? FSX can bring an 8800GTX SLI setup
to its knees at the highest settings. FS9 and earlier tend to be more CPU
limited - i.e. with a faster video card you will be able to run at higher
resolution and higher AA settings and maintain the same speed as before.

FSX.  Are you suggesting the 7950GT ?

No gaming - stick with your current card.

I have 2x eVGA 7600GS (no fan) in SLI. Both were under $60 after rebates,
for 24pixel power for $120 and silent.
