Recently, in an extremely heavy rainstorm, the New York City subway
system got flooded with severe service disruptions.

The MTA has issued a report:

http://www.mta.info/mta/pdf/storm_report_2007.pdf

I am curious as to what people think of it.

It's been a few days and no one has taken the time to reply.  It is a
heavy read to find out that there are some things that no matter what
you do, service will be disrupted.  How much is the city willing to
spend to assure service during a 'Noah Flood&quot;?  Where do you draw the
line at how much water can be tolerated and how much is too much?

Without reading or (re-reading) in detail some points I remember:

There aren't enough buses and drivers available to cover the number of
subway passengers, even in a one or two line disruption, much less a
system wide outage (duh!).

Not to mention what about those passengers who only use the bus lines
when they lose their ride because the buses are diverted?

=======
The streets were flooded because the storm sewers couldn't handle the
water.  Water and stuff flows to the lowest point, the subway (duh!).

=======
The TA could do a better job of cleaning drains.  Where does the garbage
that clogs them come from?

=======
While the street furniture might look nice, they will take up space on
the sidewalks, so pedestrians won't be able to walk.

Hey, how about this:  put the sidewalk vendor stands over the subway
vents with duct work though the stand to make the opening seven feet
above street grade.  That will kill two birds with one stone and not
clog up the sidewalks any more than now.

========
Weather forecasting could be better.  I don't think any of the services
thought the storm would hit the city.  Most (all?) said it would pass
well to the north.  Wasn't there also a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico
that 'popped up' suddenly this year?

========
The brunt of the storm hit after most passengers were on the way or
already on the system.  Even if cell phone text messages could work,
it's like tuning into a traffic report and hearing that there's a
traffic jam on the road you're stuck in.

========
MTA Bus and/or LI Bus never thought of rain as a major problem.

========
Within an hour or two of the end of the storm, most lines were back to
normal, except for balancing equipment.

========
They even mentioned global warming as a problem.

========
Bottom line, it was typical for this kind of report mandated by the
politicians, who probably won't want to spend the money that could
improve some of the things needed to help in future storms.

Not cleaning the drains my big gripe.  While garbage cloging the top of
the drains is an issue, the bigger issue is dirt / silt build up in the
drains themselves.

Directing passengers to bus service would  only serve to overload the
buses.  I work (and live) in Jamaica.  One person at work knew he could
get to Jamaica from Manhattan on the Q60 bus.  He got to work
eventually.  Another person got stuck at 59th Street but didn't know
anything about Queens buses. She went back home.  I don't think the Q60
bus could handle everyone who takes the  E and F trains even in the
reverse commute direction.

&gt; the sidewalks, so pedestrians won't be able to walk.

One of the pictures of the proposed street furniture on Hillside Avenue
shows the next block up from my apartment building.  There is quite a
bit of pedestrian traffic on Hillside Avenue.  I think you are right
,the sidewalks would be too narrow.

Just this week the MTA covered up parts of the sidewalk grates with
plywood.  They blocked off the end of each grate and also the places
were there are driveways and bus stops.  I think they might be checking
to see how much they can reduce the area of raised grates and still have
enough ventilation.  If the raised grates are too close to the curb
there might be traffic issues.  People would not be able to get out of
parked cars on the right side.  Drivers would block traffic dropping off
their passengers before they parked.

I've often wondered if weather forecasting companies really provide
anything better than what you get for free from the weather service.

I've used commercial forcasting services.

They are 'wrong' about as often as the NWS.

they tend to be wrong at _different_times_, so if they agree, there's a better
than usual chance of things hppening that way.

the commercial services will also forcast for your -specific- location.
as in how much rain you can expect overnight in _each_ field of your farm.

*EVERYBODY* uses the same basic weather model data.  There are only something
like five, I think it is, short-to-medium term weather models.a And only -two-
that attempt to model more  than 30 days out. *ONE* 5-day  forwared  analysis
run take about 14 hours  on the most powerful computer system of it's kind.

With _known_ uncertanties in the model output.  Local forcasts  are 'teweaked'
by what people see in 'local' conditions, and what that portends for the near
future.

I used to be incredibly accurate at predicting down-town chicago weather.
I could call the  start of precipitation up to 24 hours in advance, with
better than 15 minute precision.  No skill involved. I routinely got reports
from a location that was exactly 24 hours 'upweather' from the loop, under
normal conditions.  if it rained there at 2:40 on Tuesday, rain would hit the
Chicago loop at 2:40 on Wednensday.

I could only predict for Chicago.  but was much better than NWS or either of
two commercial services our company used.  Unfortunately, predicting for
Chicago was of liltle value to the company.  Not much farmland near
Chicago.  ;)

Chicago weather is absurdly simple. It comes from the west. Period.

New York weather can come from the south, east, west, or north.

Here's the roster:

Type    Car numbers     Contract                Quant   Year   Converted
Reach   OP6835-7629     R-81 (combined with R71) 9      1988    Y
Pump    OPC01-03        R-65                     3      1989    N

The reach cars are used between the locomotive and the actual pump cars.
They were converted passenger cars, probably IRT so they can fit
anywhere.  I'm guessing 3 trains made up of 3 reach and one pump each.

All TA work cars are listed here:

There's a link to the 1996 roster at the bottom of the page.

They could probably use either diesel or electric, but remember, if the
flood is high enough to need the pump train, the third rail power is
off.  The rule of thumb is if the water is up to the ball of the running
rail, power is shut off.

I'm checking for the details on the pump and reach cars, if I can get
them.  I only had the roster handy.

Diesels are used all the time in the subway.  They are supposed to have

I have no clue how long a third-rail segment is in NYTA, but assuming you
stop still in a live section; you could just suck from there.

Unlike the US household's 120v@20A outlet, you have many hundred KW
readily available, more than you can carry pumps and hose to use.

Hmm, I'm envisioning a 2 axle say 4 ft. long work platform. It's towed to
the site by the pumper consist. It holds an air-driven high volume but
low head pump, and maybe a small air-driven traction motor. A winch line,
discharge line and an air line will run from the consist.

The advantage of air is no one standing in water ever got cooked by an
air leak...and the EPA lets you spill air-laden water into the East
River.

The platform will proceed downhill from the consist into the flooded
area. It charges the discharge line, and the main pumper {say 50-500
ft away} then sucks from it and lifts to street/sewer level; or
where-ever. [This is what the fire dept does in some cases; one engine
feeds others.]

With this, you have ~2 feet of suction line. Discharge hose deploys and
stores far more easily than rigid suction line. The other plus is, the
only thing to get soggy will be the axle bearings, and submersible pumps.

Don't know about New York, but Washington DC metro has diesel powered
maintenance equipment.  They use reasonably standard GE 25 ton industrial

Running a 200 horsepower engine in the tunnel isn't that much different
than running an auto engine in there.  It's not like this is a 6,000
horsepower freight locomotive engine.  So long as there is sufficient
ventilation (and they pretty much have to have that due to the number of
people moved) there won't be any problems.

Indeed, there's one right outside my window as we speak, on

RE:

electricity collected from the third rail when they are in
Penn Station and in the East River tunnels. &gt;&gt;

Usually...  :)

Same thing for Metro-North. I think most enginemen will
switch to electric mode while approaching the 97th street
portal to the Park Avenue Tunnel, but they will LEAVE THE
MAIN ENGINE RUNNING (but not developing traction power).

The reason is because on Metro-North, the push-pull trains
operate into G.C.T. with the cab car ahead and the diesel on
the rear of the train.

Because Grand Central is a busy place (particularly at rush
hours), it is not always possible for a train to get a
&quot;straight shot&quot; to the platforms without having to stop for
a signal for a movement ahead.

There is a slight upgrade from the throat of the terminal
towards the platforms. And also keep in mind that with
third-rail supplied power, there must be &quot;breaks in the
third rail&quot; at switches, crossovers, etc.

Now and then a train will stop with the engine on the rear
&quot;gapped&quot;: that is, the engine may have stopped in the middle
of a switch, and none of the third rail shoes are in contact
with the rail because of the gaps mentioned previously. It's
pretty hard to guess exactly where the engine is (in
relation to the gaps) when it's six, seven or eight cars
behind you.

If this happens, the only way to get out of the gap is to
switch back to the main diesel, change the locomotive back
to &quot;diesel mode&quot;, and power out of the gap - then switch
back to electric mode once you're back on the third rail.

Of course, getting the main engine started again if it has
been shut down takes a couple of minutes. And all the while,
the train isn't able to move, and thus is blocking up the
whole operation.

If the diesel engine is running - even at idle - things go
MUCH faster.

It's easier to leave the main engine running (but not under
load) until the train is actually entering the platform,
then shut it down and go totally on the electric.

Don't know how this reconciles with laws or operating rules,
but's that's the way it is....

New York City transit, and it's patchwork of predecessors were certainly
not under the control of NYS, it is only rather recently (in terms of
the history of NYC subway system), that the MTA took over New York City
Transit. IIRC the thing was pretty much done, dragging and screaming all
the way because the city, like the private companies before them could
not afford to run the system.

IIRC what is now parts of Metro-North were once part of the New York
Central system, and as such very much under the control of New York
City.

New York State cannot dictate safety laws to New York City in regards to
what runs through or on it's land, unless the land is part of a state
wide system such as the Thruways or highway system. Could be wrong, but
think that is pretty much how things go. As to why and how both the MTA
and Amtrak run diesels in NYC, perhaps one or both entities have some
sort of waiver? Or, since the fear pretty much was about steam
locomotives blowing up, there is less to worry about with the odd diesel
locomotive. Diesels do pump out fumes, but nothing like a coal or oil
burning boiler (steam loco), and they certainly do not blow up.

Here is the law, may have had the wrong end of the stick:

Start

The Electrification Law
Chapter 901 of the Laws of 1923, an amendment to the Public Service Law
(chapter 480 of the Laws of 1910), prohibits steam operation in the
entire City effective 1 January 1926:

&quot;No railroad corporation, operating a railroad or part thereof within
the limits of a city of the first class having a population by the last
state or federal census of one million or more, shall on or after the
first day of January, nineteen hundred and twenty-six, use any motive
power in the operation of such railroad or part thereof within the
limits of such city, except electricity to be generated, transmitted and
used in such operation in a manner to be approved by the public service
commission.&quot; The two other sentences provide for the Public Service
Commission to approve the equipment and state that the law is in effect
immediately, that is, as of 2 June 1923 when it was passed. New York is
the only city meeting the description, but laws are required to be
written generically.

The above, forming the new section 53a of the Public Service Law, was
amended twice. Chapter 626 Laws of 1924 adds &quot;or within the limits of a
city adjoining such city&quot;, which describes Yonkers, Mount Vernon, and
possibly New Rochelle. Chapter 845 Laws of 1926 adds that the Public
Service Commission may, after a public hearing, extend the deadline to
no later than &quot;five years after the first day of January, nineteen
hundred and twenty-six&quot; (apparently hedging against the possibility of a
different calendar being adopted before 1 January 1931 ?).

This law was repealed by Chapter 789 Laws of 1930. Section 53a is still
listed in the Consolidated Laws under Public Service Law, as a repealed
section.

In his book The Port of New York, Carl Condit mentions that the Public
Service Commission held that use of diesel electric power was sufficient
to meet the requirements, and that this is why some of the dock
railroads began to use such engines during the time the law was in
effect. Condit also attributes the electrification of the New York
Central west side freight line to the law, although since that was
accomplished after 1930, it must be that other factors, such as getting
the line off the street surface, were just as important. According to
company information in Moody's Railroad Manual, the Staten Island Rapid
Transit Railway electrified its lines in 1925 because of this law, but
again it seems that other factors were really behind it, since
electrification of the SIRT was being considered at least as early as
1920, just on practical grounds for a railroad with frequent service and
short distances between stations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------

There appears to be no law specifically applicable to, say, operating
steam engines into Penn Station, but laws not directly about railroads
could come into play. The resulting poor air quality for example would
probably violate laws about public health and workplace conditions.

True.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

You've got it backwards.  New York City can't scratch its nose without
permission from Albany.  All governments below the State level are
creations
of the State government, and have only those powers that NYS has given
them.  Nearly every initiative of any significance in New York City
(or
elsewhere in the State) requires action in Albany.  For example, the
congestion pricing proposed by Mayor Bloomberg was (and maybe still
is) in limbo because Albany has not given its approval.

They don't call it the &quot;Empire State&quot; for nothing.

My guess is that the statutes that created the MTA give it
considerable
freedom from NYC interference -- there wouldn't be much point in
creating
a supra-local authority if it didn't.  And given the publicity that
the operation
of diesels in the Park Avenue tunnel and the NYC law against it
gets on a regular basis, NYC would have done something if it could.

Do you mean that NY state statutes and safety codes do not apply to or

Garbage trains are not diesel powered. Depending on what's available
they either have two EPO units (R62 shells with different insides, but
still electrically powered) with three flats between them or two sets

Most work locos are diesels, since they need to be able to move in

The New York subway doesn't qualify as a &quot;railroad corporation&quot; under the

I believe you are referring to the &quot;General Railway System&quot;, which comprises
the railroads that exchange traffic and thus are under FRA jurisdiction.  A
railroad, however, is any operation on fixed tracks, whether part of the GRS
or not.  The FRA does _not_ have jurisdiction over railroads that are not
part of the GRS.

If Metro-North has _electric_ locomotives, I have never seen them.

All revenue-service trains I have ever seen (and I ride them
every day) are either MU electric or trains hauled by diesel
locomotives with 3rd rail shoes.   For some runs, passengers
take MU electrics to the end of the electrified service and change
for diesel, but in most cases, the diesel equipment runs all the way
to/from GCT.  According to M-N engineers, diesel power is used for
motive power; they do seem to shut the engines down when
laying over at GCT, which reduces the smoke somewhat, but
they start them up before departing.

AMTRAK, as far as I know, uses electric locomotives
(with pantographs) for service to New Haven or Washington,
but it must use diesels for service to Albany, as only
part of the way is electrified (Spuyten Duyvel &lt;-&gt; Croton.)
I don't know for a fact whether these locomotives go through
the East River tunnels, but, if not, where _are_ they serviced?

BTW, are the turbo-trains still in service?

I don't think the NYC ever had dual mode engines.  They changed power at
Croton Harmon and, I believe White Plains for through trains.  What a
concept, changing power instead of making the passengers change trains!

An interesting thing about the NYC electrics (and some were second hand
from Cleveland) is that they had very short 600V contact shoes on the
roof to connect with matching third rails in the ceiling of GCT approach
tracks to prevent stalling over switches.

The New Haven had the FL9's that were diesel/third rail.  They also had
EP5's that used overhead and both types of third rail (LIRR and NYC).
It wasn't all that long ago that NY-Boston trains changed engines at New
Haven.

I believe AMTRAK removed all of the turbos from service.  But, if memory
serves, both the United Aircraft (NY-Boston) and the sets used for
NY-Albany had third rail shoes.

AMTRAK uses &quot;dual mode&quot; (diesel / third rail electric) Genesis locos
between Albany and NYC (Penn Station).  These locos have third rail
shoes and once they get to the tunnel, they are *supposed* to shut down
the diesel prime mover and run off third rail.

Metro-North has either old (much rebuilt) FL9s (which are 1st generation
&quot;dual mode&quot; locos, also diesel / third rail electric) or &quot;dual mode&quot;
Genesis locos (like AMTRAK uses now).  Again, they are *supposed* to
shut down the diesel prime mover while in the tunnels.

Until a few years ago, they had a few adorable 1000 HP units that were
hand me downs from some terminal operation (Niagra Junction?).  They
were used for switching stuff at GCT, then they just sat unused for a
while, then junked.  Interestingly, they WERE used in passenger service
at one time, and there's pictures of this out there.  Being remarkably
short and no HP, they weren't useful for much, and MN dumped them.  I
think the official excuse was age and prone to gapping.

As far as dual modes, at least MN shuts theirs off at times - the LIRR
thinks nothing of leaving their units idling all weekend in yards,
despite the installed 'shore power' stands in the yards.  You know, why
bother, when oil's at $20 a barrel?

They are not supposed to. They are supposed to operate on third rail
throught the Park Avenue Tunnel. The FL9s lost their third rail ability long
before they ceased operating into GCT; the Gennies are suppposed to have
their electric power in service. However, some use their diesel power in GCT
for various reasons, including gaps and the like.

They use 3rd rail only in the short tunnel from the West Side line into Penn
Station and then on through the East River Tunnels. Diesel comes on for the
loop into SUnnyside and until the tunnel is encountered on their next

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No. NY had several rebuilt, but they are sitting at the Bear shops.

The Turbos all had third rail shoes -- some remember very well an Amtrak
Turbo starting up in GCT because it stalled on a long stretch of no third
rail through some puzzle switches -- and the hot blast from the stack just
**happenned** to be under a major telephone switching room thgat served
three midtown exchanges -- knocking out phone service for days and resulting
in lawsuits that took twenty years to settle.

Even the New Haven's lightweight and Talgos had third rail shoes. They had a
penchant for catching fire when making the switch on the Park Avenue
Viaduct. I think each of the three lightweights ruined one or more rush
hours  of NYC and NH commuters during the short time they were operational.

The LIRR uses dual modes as well though they are unreliable.

Not for passenger service (except for a brief experiment with a New

The

That law doesn't apply to anything now since it was repealed in 1930; it was
a pretty short-lived one, and more of a historical note than anything that
has a serious bearing on operations today.  Of course, once the requirement
was dropped, the lines had already paid the cost of electrifying, and
apparently they've considered it cheaper to keep maintaining that and use
dual-modes than go back to single-mode diesels.

If the regulations/laws/etc. were written specifically to cover one and not
the other, that's certainly possible.  Also, local attempts at regulation of
RRs are often preempted by federal laws and/or FRA regulations.  For
instance, a state (or city, if given that power by the state) could ban
whistles, but it would only apply to non-GRS RRs (e.g. non-FRA transit
operations) today.

It's common for MOW and other specialty equipment to be exempted from most
regulations; the politicians usually only care about regulating the stuff
used in revenue service since that's all they see.

See:

But it should be noted that other NYCity operations were electrified &quot;in the
spirit&quot; of the law and after repeal of the 1926 Act. Joe Brennan cites the
NYC West Side Improvements, but another was the PRR putting third rail on
all its freight sidings in DC electrified territory and handling freight
with DD-1s.

The most interesting of these included electrification of the Montauk Branch
from Fresh Pond to Glendale Jct., the Montauk Cut-off, the Creedmoor Branch,
and the Central Extension to Meadowbrook Hospital (the latter in Nassau
County)

The NYC's Getty Square Branch was electrified in 1926, though whether as a
result of the law or in anticipation of it I have no idea.

Jim
