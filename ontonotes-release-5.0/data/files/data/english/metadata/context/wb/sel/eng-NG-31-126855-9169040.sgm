1)  GA: Atlanta sued in police killing of 92-year-old
MSNBC

&quot;The family of a 92-year-old woman fatally shot during a botched drug
raid has filed a lawsuit against the city and police on the first
anniversary of the killing. ... Plainclothes narcotics officers burst
into Johnston's home Nov. 21, 2006, using a no-knock warrant. Johnston
was killed during the raid in a hail of nearly 40 police gunshots.
Prosecutors said the officers obtained the warrant by falsely telling
a judge that an informant confirmed drug dealing at the home. The
informant later told federal investigators he was told by police to
concoct the tale.&quot; (11/21/07)

2)  Australia: Rudd tops Howard in landslide
Los Angeles Times

&quot;The Bush administration lost one of its staunchest political allies
Saturday when Australians chose a Mandarin-speaking former farm boy to
become their new prime minister. Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd
swept to power in a landslide victory over Liberal incumbent John
Howard, the second-longest serving prime minister in Australian
history. Unlike Howard, Rudd has pledged to pull combat troops from
Iraq and to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a move that would leave
the United States as the only major industrialized country to shun the
initiative regulating greenhouse gases.&quot; (11/25/07)

3)  Iraq: Terrorists murder 11 relatives of journalist
Agence France-Press

&quot;Gunmen in Baghdad killed 11 family members of an Iraqi journalist
operating an electronic news website, the journalist Dia al-Kawwaz
told AFP by telephone from Amman on Monday. 'Four gunmen entered my
family house in Shab area. Two of my sisters, their husbands and seven
children between five and 10 years old were killed yesterday (Sunday)
morning,' Kawwaz said. He accused Shiite militiamen of carrying out
the killings, saying they 'stormed the house when the family was
having breakfast.' Kawwaaz, who has lived in Germany for the past 20
years, operates the Internet website Shabeqat Akhbar al-Iraq (Network
of Iraqi News). ... The latest incident involving a journalist comes a
week after the kidnapping of a reporter for Iraq's Al-Baghdadiyah
satellite channel. Muntadhar al-Zaidi, 28, was released three days
after being abducted.&quot; (11/26/07)

4)  Afghanistan: 12 civilians, Italian soldier killed in attacks
Agence France-Press

&quot;A bomb planted on a dust road used by Italian military forces on the
outskirts of Kabul tore apart a car Monday, killing four Afghan men,
security officials said. The bomb, apparently remotely detonated,
exploded as the car passed through farmland in the Charasyab area,
about 15 kilometres (10 miles) southeast of the city centre. General
Zalmai Uriakhail, a city police chief, said the four men were local
farmers and it was unclear why their vehicle had been targeted. ... On
Saturday a suicide bomber blew himself up among Italian military
engineers working on a footbridge in the town of Paghman, 25
kilometres (15 miles) west of Kabul. One Italian soldier and eight
Afghans, three of them children, were killed. The Taliban claimed
responsibility.&quot; (11/26/07)

5)  Pakistan: 35 dead in suicide attacks
Arab Times [Kuwait]

&quot;Militants struck at the heart of Pakistan's security establishment
Saturday, killing up to 35 people in suicide attacks on a checkpoint
outside army headquarters and a bus carrying intelligence agency
employees, officials said. The brazen attacks coincided with the
announcement that Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister overthrown in
1999 by the country's current military leader, President Gen Pervez
Musharraf, would return from exile Sunday. Sharif, one of Musharraf's
most strident political foes, may contest parliamentary elections
scheduled for January. ... Also Saturday, Pakistan's electoral
commission formally ratified Musharraf's election for a second 5-year
term as president. The move, widely expected after Musharraf's
hand-picked justices on the Supreme Court approved it Friday, paves
the way for the president to resign from the army and rule as a
civilian.&quot; (11/25/07)

BBC News [UK]

&quot;A human-rights organisation has claimed that Kenyan police killed as
many as 8,040 people by execution or torture during a crackdown on a
banned sect. The group said a further 4,070 people had gone missing as
security forces tried to wipe out the Mungiki sect. The deaths and
disappearances occurred over five years up to August 2007, said the
Oscar Foundation Free Legal Aid Clinic-Kenya.&quot; (11/26/07)

7)  Malaysia: Ethnic Indian protesters clash with police
Independent [UK]

&quot;Police used tear gas and water cannons to crush a banned rally by
more than 10,000 ethnic minority Indians yesterday. In a rare street
clash that exposed Muslim-majority Malaysia's deep racial divisions,
slogan-shouting protesters hurled water bottles and stones at police,
who chased them through streets surrounding the famous Petronas Twin
Towers in Kuala Lumpur and doused them repeatedly with tear gas and
chemical-laced water for more than eight hours. Some demonstrators
carried pictures of Mohandas Gandhi and banners that read: 'We want
our rights.'&quot; (11/26/07)

8)  UK: Child database plan under attack
Independent [UK]

&quot;A review of security has been ordered over Government plans to put
the personal details of 11 million schoolchildren on to a database.
The move comes in the wake of the HM Revenue and Customs missing discs
debacle. ... Parents' groups have protested against putting their
children on the database, fearing it could be dangerous. But the loss
of the personal details of 25 million people receiving child benefit
prompted fresh demands from parents for a rethink of the entire
scheme.&quot; (11/26/07)

9)  UN: Tasers are a form of torture, rallies call for bans
CBS News

&quot;A United Nations committee said Friday that use of Taser weapons can
be a form of torture, in violation of the U.N. Convention Against
Torture. ... The reported incidents this week did not have cameras
documenting the use of the Tasers, but in British Columbia, a
tourist's video camera recorded the death of a man tased twice while
in custody at the Vancouver Airport last month. That horrifying video
shows Robert Dziekanski, a Polish man who spoke no English, become
increasingly agitated. He was shocked twice, and then died. The stun
guns were denounced at memorial rallies in Vancouver and Toronto for
Dziekanski.&quot; (11/25/07)

10) MO: Robber shot by intended victim
Kansas City Star

&quot;A would-be robber remained hospitalized in critical condition this
afternoon after he was shot by one of his intended victims. The man
was shot about 1:30 a.m. after he followed several people to their car
in a Westport parking garage in the 4000 block of Pennsylvania Avenue.
As the people were getting into their car, the man, who had earlier
asked them for money, pulled up his shirt and revealed a gun in his
waistband, Kansas City police said. One of the car's occupants
retrieved his own gun from inside the vehicle and fired.&quot; (11/23/07)

11) OH: Robber shot at Mexican market
Cincinnati Enquirer

&quot;A store clerk shot a robbery suspect inside a Mexican market on
Glenway Avenue tonight, and police were hunting for a second suspect.
The incident happened about 8:45 p.m. when two suspects, wearing
scarves over their faces, entered the Tienda y Carniceria. A woman
behind the counter shouted for her husband, while trying to protect a
3-year-old child who was with her. The male clerk scuffled with the
robber and was struck in the face with a gun. Both apparently fired
shots. One robber was wounded in the shoulder and was taken to
University Hospital. The second fled the store and was being hunted by
police.&quot; (11/23/07)

12) Fred Thompson calls for flat tax
Fox News

&quot;Republican presidential hopeful Fred Thompson proposed an income tax
plan Sunday that would allow Americans to choose a simplified system
with only two rates: 10 percent and 25 percent. Thompson's proposal,
announced on Fox News Sunday, would allow filers to remain under the
current, complex tax code or use the flat tax rates. Asked whether the
plan would cut too deeply into federal revenues, the former Tennessee
senator and actor said experts 'always overestimate the losses to the
government' when taxes are cut. 'We've known for years any time we
have lowered taxes and any time we've lowered tax rates, we've seen
growth in the economy,' Thompson said. Thompson added that money would
be saved by his Social Security reform plan.&quot; (11/25/07)

13) Preview: Next year's new citizenship test
Arizona Republic

&quot;The federal government is launching a new citizenship test next year.
The questions are aimed at better measuring how well immigrants
understand what it means to be an American rather than how well they
can memorize answers. Here are some samples and a list of possible
answers. ... Sample questions: Q: What is the supreme law of the land?
A: The Constitution. Q: What is one right or freedom from the First
Amendment? A: (choose one) Speech, religion, assembly, press, petition
the government.Q: What are two ways that Americans can participate in
their democracy? A: (choose among) Vote, join a political party, help
with a campaign, join a civic group, join a community group, run for
office, write to a newspaper. [The 100 study questions for the new
test can be found at www.uscis.gov/files/nativedocuments/100q.pdf .]&quot;

14) CNN profiles anti-gay minister's conversion to tolerance
Raw Story

&quot;Reverend Dennis Meredith used to condemn homosexuality in his
sermons, reports CNN's Dan Lothian in a video from CNN's Sunday
morning broadcast, but had a change of heart due to a family secret.
Nothing is understated about Reverend Meredith of Tabernacle Baptist
Church in Atlanta: not the bright yellow Harley he drives to work, not
the music, and definitely not his message. 'If you can come down the
aisle, holding your partners hand,' Rev. Meredith yells into a
microphone as he pulls a church-goer to his feet, 'I'm happy for you.'
... The Reverend has come full circle: he used to condemn
homosexuality from the same pulpit.&quot; (11/25/07)

15) Obama says his health package does more
Boston Globe

&quot;Democratic Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, seeking to distance
himself from his leading rivals, touted his healthcare expansion
package as doing more to cut costs and deal with root problems facing
consumers 'than any other proposal in this race.' Obama's two main
rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination -- Senator Hillary
Clinton of New York and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina
-- have offered universal healthcare plans, while his stops short of
mandating everyone have health insurance. Obama routinely describes
his rivals' plans as similar in thrust, but he began sharpening those
differences as he opened his latest campaign swing yesterday.&quot;

16) SC: Ex-Black militant becomes Eagle Scout
San Francisco Chronicle

&quot;Cleveland Sellers called himself a black militant in his
autobiography, and he was convicted -- and later pardoned -- of
sparking a 1968 civil rights protest in which three students were
gunned down by state troopers. These days, however, he has a doctorate
in education and is director of the African American Studies program
at the University of South Carolina. On Dec. 3, the 64-year-old man
will become an Eagle Scout, an achievement he hopes will add an
important layer to a personal narrative that to many people will
always be linked to the protest known as the Orangeburg Massacre. ...
Sellers was on the path to becoming an Eagle Scout until his paperwork
was lost nearly four decades ago.&quot; (11/25/07)

17) Russia: 200 arrested in anti-Putin demonstration
Agence France-Press

&quot;Russian riot police on Sunday detained opposition leader Boris
Nemtsov and some 200 other protestors in Saint Petersburg as they
broke up the second demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in
two days. The disturbances, exactly a week ahead of December 2
parliamentary elections, came 24 hours after police dispersed a
similar anti-Putin march of around 2,000 people in the capital Moscow,
arresting chess legend turned opposition leader Garry Kasparov. ...
Kasparov's The Other Russia coalition accuses the Kremlin of
corruption, crushing dissent, and rigging December 2 parliamentary
elections to ensure victory for Putin's United Russia party. Putin is
due to step down after a presidential poll in March, but is standing
as the lead candidate of United Russia, which is forecast to win at
least two thirds of seats in the State Duma.&quot; (11/25/07)

District manager, Kim Cavros, that customers in line complained to

19) AZ: Immigrant rescues boy in desert
Yahoo! News

&quot;A 9-year-old boy looking for help after his mother crashed their van
in the southern Arizona desert was rescued by a man entering the U.S.
illegally, who stayed with him until help arrived the next day, an
official said. ... The van vaulted into a canyon and landed 300 feet
from the road, he said. The woman, from Rimrock, north of Phoenix,
survived the impact but was pinned inside, Estrada said. Her son,
unhurt but disoriented, crawled out to get help and was found about
two hours later by Jesus Manuel Cordova, 26, of Magdalena de Kino in
the northern Mexican state of Sonora. Unable to pull the mother out,
he comforted the boy while they waited for help. The woman died a
short time later. 'He stayed with him, told him that everything was
going to be all right,' Estrada said. ... Cordova was taken into
custody by Border Patrol agents, who were the first to respond to the
call for help. He had been trying to walk into the U.S. when he came
across the boy.&quot; [editor's note: instead of a medal, he gets arrested.

20) Firefighters trained as &quot;lookouts for terrorism&quot;
Yahoo! News

&quot;Firefighters in major cities are being trained to take on a new role
as lookouts for terrorism, raising concerns of eroding their standing
as American icons and infringing on people's privacy. Unlike police,
firefighters and emergency medical personnel don't need warrants to
access hundreds of thousands of homes and buildings each year, putting
them in a position to spot behavior that could indicate terrorist
activity or planning. But there are fears that they could lose the
faith of a skeptical public by becoming the eyes of the government,
looking for suspicious items such as building blueprints or
bomb-making manuals or materials.&quot; (11/23/07)

21) lib*er*tar*ian
Washington Post
by Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch

&quot;When a fierce Republican foe of the wars on drugs and terrorism is
able, without really trying, to pull in a record haul of campaign cash
on a day dedicated to an attempted regicide, it's clear that a new and
potentially transformative force is growing in American politics. That
force is less about [Ron] Paul than about the movement that has
erupted around him -- and the much larger subset of Americans who are
increasingly disillusioned with the two major political parties' soft
consensus on making government ever more intrusive at all levels,
whether it's listening to phone calls without a warrant, imposing
fines of half a million dollars for broadcast 'obscenities' or jailing
grandmothers for buying prescribed marijuana from legal dispensaries.&quot;

22) The addict's veto
Human Events
by Jacob Sullum

&quot;Annie Duke, who testified at a recent House Judiciary Committee
hearing on Internet gambling, is not a typical poker player. A
professional for 13 years, she is the biggest female money winner in
the history of tournament poker. Gregory J. Hogan Jr. is not a typical
poker player, either. As his father, the pastor of the First Baptist
Church in Barberton, Ohio, explained at a House Financial Services
Committee hearing last summer, 'Gregory Jr. is currently in prison for
a robbery he committed to feed his online gambling addiction.' While
Annie Duke recognizes that most Americans who play poker do it for
fun, not for a living, Pastor Hogan tends to over-generalize from his
son's equally extreme experience with the game, which involved losing
hundreds of dollars a day while playing 12 hours at a time. Hogan
demands an addict's veto over Internet gambling: Because his son
robbed a bank, he thinks, no one should be allowed to play poker
online.&quot; (11/21/07)

23) Medicare as a model? Heaven forfend!
The Medical Freedom Channel
by Steve Trinward

&quot;The day-job's at an end -- suddenly and abruptly. Suffice to say that
the combination of working corporate, and reporting early for extra
hours at holiday-times, proved to be my undoing. Back to the
drawing-board, but at least there's a small cushion and no overdue
bills outstanding. Perhaps it's a good time to comment on some more
things I learned in that venue, about how the current ethos of
'entitlement' will surely be our undoing, unless it is reversed very
soon. Full disclosure: The gig I just left, not entirely of my own
will, involved processing Medicare forms, and the experience has only
strengthened my already-adamant opposition to any ideas being
circulated about expanding that benighted program as a model for
nationalized health insurance!&quot; (11/26/07)

24) The bankruptcy of the national Libertarian Party
The Libertarian Enterprise
by Alan Weiss

&quot;In 'Instead of a Speech,' L. Neil Smith proposed that most logical of
analogies ('Ron Paul as the 21st Century's Eugene McCarthy') and then
proposed that most logical of positions: disagree with Dr. Paul about
a couple of issues if you must, but support him. Neil proposed, as I
have a number of times, that the Libertarian Party should endorse Ron
Paul's candidacy and wholeheartedly throw its support behind his
campaign. Given the history of the Libertarian Party, I was hopeful
that, reason would win out. Given the history of the Libertarian PARTY
(emphasis mine), I was pretty sure this would not happen, despite
Neil's suggestion. Guess what? Apparently it won't happen.&quot; [editor's
note: Actually the LP has come much closer to endorsing Paul's
campaign than it should. Hint: Endorsing Republican candidates is not
part of the LP's mission statement, nor is it provided for (and in
some case it is explicitly prohibited) in the party's bylaws. The only
ethical and honest mechanism through which LP COULD endorse Paul is
the party's national convention, which is some months away - TLK]

25) Blame the people who elected them?
LewRockwell.Com
by Robert Higgs

&quot;Discussions of calamitous government actions -- engagements in
pointless, costly, and bloody wars; counterproductive actions to avert
or shorten economic recessions; botched relief and reconstruction
efforts after natural disasters -- often arrive at, if they do not
begin with, condemnation of government leaders. Thus, in the United
States, for example, people have blamed Harry Truman for ordering U.S.
military forces into the Korean war, Herbert Hoover for worsening the
economic bust of 1929-33, and George W. Bush for presiding over the
FEMA fiasco associated with Hurricane Katrina. As soon as such a
denunciation has been made, however, a critic invariably intervenes to
challenge its perspicacity and to propose a seemingly more discerning,
if disquieting, alternative: don't blame leader X; blame the people
who elected him.&quot; (11/26/07)

27) Setting the record straight
Freedom's Phoenix
by Howard Blitz

&quot;Many individuals have a severe misconception of libertarianism. Many
think it is all about anarchy. Others think that it is a belief that
anyone can do anything he or she wants without any regard for another
individual. Nothing is further from the truth. Libertarians embrace
the 'good neighbor policy,' a policy of non-aggression,
self-government, and volunteerism. Libertarians believe that each
individual has the right to live their life any way he or she chooses
as long as the individual does not initiate aggression, such as theft,
fraud, or physical harm, against another.&quot; (for publication 11/28/07)

28) The stupid &quot;Boomer&quot; myth
The Price of Liberty
by Ed Henry

&quot;How many times have you heard about '76 million baby-boomers' that
are about to wreck havoc on our supplemental retirement system, Social
Security? In our lives, this story plays over and over and over again.
Sometimes they get the number wrong, but these 'boomers' are always
people born between 1946 and 1965 that supposedly produced this horde
primarily due to sixteen million, shall we say lusty, service people
returning home after the Second World War. The government usually puts
out a lot of propaganda and fear stories, but most of it is somewhat
believable or at least within the realm of possibilities. This one is
ludicrous, unreasonable, and out of the question. How gullible do they
think we are? If it were true it would be a miracle.&quot; (11/26/07)

29) Foreign interventionism creates the imperial presidency
Classically Liberal
by CLS

&quot;The imperial presidency of George Bush is the logical outgrowth of
foreign interventionism. And, I might add, foreign interventionism is
the policy of the imperialist Left. It was the 'progressives' on the
Left who pushed for empire building both in England and in the United
States. An uncomfortable truth for today's Left is that their ideology
created the foreign policy that Bush pursues and that policy is
directly linked to the imperial presidency he has established. Morley
warned Americans that you can't 'make a federal republic do an
imperial job' because 'our traditional institutions are specifically
designed to prevent centralization of power.' Yet an empire needs
centralized decision making. Interventionism around the world needs a
president who can respond without the shackles of public debate.&quot;

30) A nation on the edge of the final descent, part 3
The Power of Narrative
by Arthur Silber

&quot;In cultural terms, and with regard to the mythic conception of the
United States that we refuse to surrender or even to question
seriously, America is like the crazy uncle whom relatives
unsuccessfully attempt to confine to the attic. Just for amusement's
sake, let's call him Uncle Sam, shall we? Uncle Sam mumbles
incessantly and often incoherently about how young and strong he is,
while his body rots and decomposes. Sam endlessly insists that his way
is the best way -- his way in everything, mind you. Sam yells that if
only everyone would listen to him and do exactly as he says -- in
everything, mind you -- the world would be a beautiful and peaceful
place. To realize this beautiful and peaceful dream, Uncle Sam
periodically goes on notably bloody and vicious killing sprees.&quot;

31) Some pros and cons of Ron Paul
Rebirth of Reason
by Tibor R. Machan

&quot;Texas Republican House member Ron Paul is undoubtedly the most
committed libertarian among all the presidential hopefuls. Dr. No, as
he is sometimes called, opposes virtually all government spending and
other forms of oppression. He believes that many of the laws passed by
Congress aren't authorized by the U. S. Constitution -- a document he
believes is sound because of its support of the free society and a
limited federal government -- and could only be passed by state
political bodies, not by the feds. He is pro-life but instead of
wanting to outlaw abortion -- a dubious libertarian idea in my book --
he wants the issue of whether there is a right to have an abortion to
be dealt with at the state level. His views on banking, the Federal
Reserve Bank, hard money, the IRS, and, especially, military
adventurism all follow sound strict libertarian principles. On one or
two points, though, even a libertarian could take issue with Dr.
Paul.&quot; (11/21/07)

&quot;None of the corporate candidates, Dem. Or Rep., have the kind of

That worries many people though it would be more worrisome if he
believed anything Hillary says. Hillary has been attacked because she
is a woman and that is unfair and I resent it. I am a woman myself.
Hear me roar. Instead she should be attacked because she is a life
long employee of the corporations, along with Bill. Also because her
life long ambition is to have twice as much money and power as John D.
Rockefeller with half the ethical qualms he demonstrated during his
career. Rockefeller would probably been struck with awe over the kind
of stealing Hillary routinely carries out, smiling as she inserts the
knife elegantly in the back of such individuals as Peter Paul, the
Hollywood Mogul who she mangled in 2000.&quot; (11/23/07)

33) Preventing the impending war on Iran
Common Dreams
by Marjorie Cohn

&quot;Rhetoric flowing out of the White House indicates the Bush
administration is planning a military attack on Iran .... Like Bush's
invasion of Iraq, an attack on Iran would violate international and
U.S. law. The U.N. Charter prohibits the use of military force except
in self-defense or with the approval of the Security Council. Iran,
which has not attacked any country for 2,000 years, hasn't threatened
to invade the United States or Israel. Rather than protecting Israel,
U.S. or Israeli military force against Iran will endanger Israel,
which would invariably suffer a retaliatory attack.&quot; (11/25/07)

&quot;As I was putting the finishing touches on Thanksgiving dinner

a snack and watching the news. A story about Virginia Tech came on. I
forget what it was about, precisely, but it precipitated a
conversation between me and the Redhead about guns. 'Why didn't anyone
have a gun and shoot the guy who was killing people?' he asked.
'Because guns are prohibited on Virginia Tech's campus,' I told him.
He looked at me like a monkey doing a math problem. 'How come?' I told
him those were the rules and that criminals obviously don't follow
laws or rules. He nodded. 'You mean even if you have a permit, you
still can't have a gun at Virginia Tech?' he pressed? 'Sorry, buddy.
That's right,' I told him. 'Well, that's just stupid,' he exclaimed

42) Look back in awe

States of the 1950s, while Democrats want to work there.' ... While
most of the Republican presidential candidates have life experiences
more reminiscent of The Ice Storm than The Man in the Gray Flannel
Suit, all invoke a vision of the patriarchal, orderly family of
post-World War II suburban fantasy. ... But even baby boom liberals
who spent their youth in rebellion against the tranquilized 1950s have
become homesick for its virtues. Ninety-one percent tax rates! Unions!
Declining income inequality! Working people in nice big houses. What's

44) Don't ignore Hamas
Christian Science Monitor
by Yossi Beilin

&quot;Hamas's victory in the Palestinian parliamentary elections in January
2006, and its violent takeover of the Gaza Strip in June, were very
bad news for those who believe in Israeli-Palestinian peace. But as
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) prepare to
launch formal negotiations on final status -- for the first time in
seven years -- Israel should seek to reach a cease fire with Hamas as
soon as possible. This is not an easy position for an Israeli to take.
Hamas is a religiously fanatical organization that has used the worst
kind of terrorist violence against Israelis. That Hamas won
parliamentary elections does not automatically render it politically
legitimate. Democracy is about more than winning elections, and
Hamas's violent takeover of the Gaza Strip was a flagrant
demonstration of its readiness to defy democratic principles.&quot;

46) The &quot;invisible hand&quot; goes toy shopping
Tom Paine/Common Sense

cut. But in the past year I've become aware of a something as a
parent. Where toys are concerned, the only people trying to keep our
child safe are his parents. You become aware of a lot of things as a
parent, like how fast the traffic on your street is all of a sudden,
or how much sugar is actually in those breakfast cereals you ate
growing up. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission,

47) A pox on the (Iowa) polls
Salon
by Walter Shapiro

&quot;I remain a major-league skeptic about Iowa polling for a simple
reason: No one knows exactly who will attend the Jan. 3 caucuses,
which are being held this close to the holidays for the first time in
history. An adroit pollster may paint an accurate portrait of
sentiments of the larger universe of Iowa Democratic (or Republican)
voters, but miss completely in guessing which of these voters will
make the commitment to turn out on a cold Thursday night (there is no
absentee voting at a caucus) to put their thumbs on the scale of
presidential politics. Every time I read an Iowa poll -- such as the
overhyped ABC News/Washington Post survey that vaulted Barack Obama
into the lead -- I think of voters like the petite 75-year-old woman
wearing a dark blue dress whom I met at a Hillary Clinton rally Monday
night in Tama. The woman in blue, who did not want her name used,
talked about how she has been scrupulously studying the candidates and
the issues to become an informed voter. But when I inquired whether
she intended to caucus for Hillary, her chosen favorite, the Tama
woman asked in a puzzled voice, 'Where would I go to do that?'&quot;
[editor's note: No mention of it in this article, but I predict that a
disparity in &quot;get out the vote&quot; will boost Ron Paul, whose supporters
are exceptionally dedicated, considerably above his putative polling
numbers in both Iowa and New Hampshire - TLK] (11/24/07)

48) The world is round
TCS Daily

&quot;The 'world is flat' as an image for globalization is 180o askew. The

as in 'what goes around comes around.' This recognition of rotundity
provides the necessary context for assessing issues surrounding
foreign investment in the United States, an assessment made timely by
a current high-profile example -- the pending deal between U.S. tech
firm 3COM, private equity investor Bain Capital, and Chinese telecom
giant Huawei. Some reactions to the deal raise concerns that a rise in
politicization and a hint of chauvinism is threatening this
investment, which is an important driver of U.S. economic health. The

believe only in horror. In nature there is no evil, only an abundance
of horror: the plagues and the blights and the ants and the maggots.'
Of course, horror exists in (and virtually defines) nature, but the
deliberate, unnecessary, brutal theft of a life -- ANY life -- moves
beyond the impersonal horror of biologic decay and death, to the realm
of DESECRATION, a strictly human behavior that cannot reasonably be
characterized as 'natural.' According to the ABC news affiliate KATU
(Portland, OR), police recently booked two teenage boys on charges of
aggravated animal abuse, after they allegedly scalded a kitten with
hot water, then cut off its head with a hatchet.&quot; (11/21/07)

Slate
by John Dickerson

&quot;[D]espite the uproar, [[former White House Press Secretary Scott]
McClellan's excerpt pretty much tells us what we already knew about

Bush, Cheney, and Card may have been involved in pressing McClellan to
push the story, but, as far as McClellan knows, those three were doing
so because they too had been misled by Rove and Libby (with possible
fuzziness here about McClellan's view of Cheney). Lost in the
excitement is this larger point: Even if the president, the vice
president, and Card didn't know that McClellan was lying during those
two October weeks, they certainly knew afterward that his stalwart
defense had become inoperative, as reports surfaced that Libby and
Rove had talked about the matter with reporters. And if they didn't
know for sure, they should have cared enough to find out when it
became clear that Libby and Rove were not as innocent of Plame's
outing as they first claimed.&quot; (11/21/07)

51) The case against despair
The Weekly Standard
by Fred Barnes

&quot;The safest of all assumptions in Washington is that year after year
federal spending will rise. Over the past 25 years, spending increased
84 percent in real, inflation-adjusted terms as the population of the
United States rose 30 percent. Spending per capita grew 41 percent.
And though President Bush is now trying to curb spending, the federal
budget crossed the $2 trillion mark and is likely to exceed $3
trillion during his presidency. That's nothing to brag about. The
relentless rise in spending, unstopped even when Republicans
controlled the White House and Congress, has thrown conservatives
committed to limited government into despair. Their view, fashionable
at the moment, is that nothing can be done to limit spending to any
significant degree.&quot; [editor's note: Part of the problem is the
misperception that spending will grow &quot;even&quot; when Republicans are in
charge. The word should have been &quot;especially.&quot; The GOP is, and always
has been, a party of big government, and voting Republican will never
change that orientation - TLK] (for publication 12/03/07)

&quot;Most reaction to the tasering of Jared Massey by Utah Highway Patrol
Officer John Gardner has been, quite rightly, supportive of Massey.
Not just in the United States, but around the world, sensible people
realize that Gardner was out of control, and that the officer
responded with force to a situation that should have been engaged by
conversation, or (if the officer has extremely poor control of his
temper) by his leaving the speeding ticket with Massey and just
driving away. It's worth pointing out that, only now, with the video
of the incident available on the Internet, is UHP taking Massey's
complaint seriously and scrambling to investigate the incident. But a
strident minority of voices defend Gardner and insist that Massey had
an obligation to tug his forelock and obey every order issued by
Gardner, and that his failure to do so justified Gardner's use of
force in the incident.&quot; (11/23/07)

Her rapists receive a light punishment, but she receives punishment as

rape victim's punishment has yet to be carried out. In the meantime,
the whole episode is an international outrage. In the United States in

by a stranger. Her rapist receives a light punishment but she receives
punishment as well. When she and her lawyer complain about it, her

&quot;Here is the locked ward of the political asylum, the place where

Nothing in the modern world compares with North Korea, though it gives

Imperial Japan before Hiroshima, or in the obliterated years --
conveniently erased from memory by blushing fellow travelers -- when
Josef Stalin was revered as a human god. Pyongyang is the most
carefully planned and also the most mysterious city on the planet. You
cannot, unless you escape from the warders who accompany foreigners
everywhere in North Korea, walk inquisitively along its surprisingly
green and spacious streets. If you did, you would rapidly be
apprehended and returned, amid fierce reprimands, to your tour bus or
to the special hotel on an island in the Taedong River, where
outsiders are comfortably but irksomely confined when they are not on
supervised expeditions. But you can glimpse the shady, fenced-off
streets where the elite live, close to the Russian Embassy from which

was really a Baptist. Even Rudy Giuliani begs religious conservatives
not to 'fear' him, and seeks out Pat Robertson's endorsement. There is

candidates, seem curiously unconcerned with another discontented part
of that coalition: economic, small-government conservatives.&quot;

regular party operations -- but 40% of it goes into a general election
fund for 'coordinated expenditures' to promote the party's
presidential ticket in the general election. I think that's a good
thing. I understand why some of the presidential candidates don't like
Liberty Decides much. This is a hardscrabble nomination campaign
already: Ron Paul has sucked the air out of the LP room, and the only
campaigns with much money are the ones for candidates with sufficient
wealth to bankroll themselves to a degree instead of relying on
contributors.&quot; (11/24/07)

66) 11/26/07: The opportunity of a lifetime?

As reported and covered in various commentaries here on RRND/FND, the
US Supreme Court has, for the first time in more than half a century,
to hear a gun rights case which actually addresses the meaning and
effect of the 2nd Amendment: The District of Columbia's appeal of a
lower court's ruling overturning that polity's draconian anti-gun
laws.

The court's 1939 ruling in US v. Miller has long been used as
propaganda fodder for victim disarmament advocates, even though
properly read it affirms the right to possession of any weapon with
military utility.

What do you expect from the court this time around -- and what do you
expect the real effect to be? Discuss.

67) 11/19/07: Out of the in-FRN-al fire ...

... and into the &quot;law enforcement&quot; frying pan? From the ongoing
frivolous prosecution of e-gold to last week's raid on the
headquarters of Liberty Dollar, the US government's war on
alternatives to their little green pieces of paper is in visible
escalation.

So ... where are we really at, and what does the future look like for
digital gold, alternative currencies, etc.? I know we have some
experts on the subject here, and I'm all ears.
