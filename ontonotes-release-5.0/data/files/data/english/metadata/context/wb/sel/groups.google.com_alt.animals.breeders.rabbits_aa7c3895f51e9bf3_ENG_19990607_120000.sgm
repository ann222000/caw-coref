We have come into the care of a &quot;saved&quot; young wild rabbit. It is the
sole survivor of a litter of appr. 8-9 which were found under a
neighbor's porch and is appr. 4-6 weeks old. We live in a suburban
area where these rabbits are plentiful- indeed, there is an
undeveloped field behind our home where many of them certainly make
their homes.

We are keeping the rabbit in a typical animal cage (with a removable
tray beneath a wire floor) in our airy garage. Temps here range 70s to
90s (F) during the day, as low as low 50s at night.

My questions to the NG are:

1) How old do you suppose the rabbit must be for us to release
it into the field with a reasonably &quot;fighting&quot; chance for survival?

2) What time of day would allow it to meld into the
environment with, perhaps, the least chance of being immediately
attacked? (I was thinking of early evening, but perhaps nighttime
predators might be likely to nab it before it had a chance to find
shelter.)

3) Are rabbits socially accepting of newcomers? That is, do
you suppose the rabbits already living in the field will welcome our
rabbit into their &quot;family?&quot;

Thanks from me and my kids for any advise you might have for us.

Amazingly, I was about to ask the exact same question. I would appreciate
it if someone posted an answer, or wrote to my email address.

Thanks! We have a place in mind to release the bunny (about 6 weeks old).

If to be free is the most important goal of all, then to help someone else
to be or become free must be the most sublime and rewarding of human
endeavors.

Have never delt with wild rabbits - have about 60 rabbits
in my barn.
The one suggestion I would have is to let it get use to the
feed in the field before you turn it lose - feeding it hay
and pulling some grass fron the field and letting it eat it.
I know a sudden change in diet can kill a rabbit. Several
day of letting it eat some hay and field grass will help.

Guessing - time of day to turn lose - early in the day - to
avold night stalkers.
