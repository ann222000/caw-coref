Their actions are exact to their religious doctrine, so how can Steven
Spielberg or Geddy Lee protect these vile, hating, destructive
persons? By public record and their actions using public office, they
have committed the acts explained and defined below. The acts below
are forms of the protocols of the elders of zion.

The Talmud: A Jewish-Supremacist Doctrine
In rejecting Jesus Christ and the love and tolerance he preached,
Judaism proceeded on its path of chauvinism. It culminated in the
pages of the Talmud, an encyclopedic exposition of Jewish law and
custom, compiled by hundreds of rabbis over the centuries. The
American Heritage Dictionary describes it as &quot;constituting the basis
of religious authority for traditional Judaism.&quot; The Talmud was first
transcribed in Babylonian times, and the oral tradition is many
centuries older. By the sixth century AD it was put into written form,
becoming the most important religious work of the Jewish people, the
chief canon of their religion. In it they finally codified their most
chauvinistic tendencies.

Herman Wouk, the very popular Jewish writer,1 illustrates the
influence of the Talmud as follows:

The Talmud is to this day the circulating heart's blood of the Jewish
religion. Whatever laws, customs, or ceremonies we observe - whether
we are orthodox, Conservative, Reform or merely spasmodic
sentimentalists - we follow the Talmud. It is our common law.2

As a 16-year-old, during one of my visits to the Citizens Council
offices, I had found a book called The Jewish Religion: Its Influence
Today by Elizabeth Dilling.3 It interested me because the large format
of the book contained complete photocopied pages from parts of the
Talmud officially compiled by Jewish scholars. I remember skipping
Dilling's commentary and going right to the translations. One of the
first passages I read really surprised me. It said,

A heathen [Gentile] who pries into the Torah [and other Jewish
Scriptures] is condemned to death, for it is written, it is our
inheritance, not theirs. (Sanhedrin 59a) 4

If a 16-year-old boy reads something forbidden like that, he is
certain to read on. The passage was completely alien to everything I
had always understood about religion. Why would they not want all men
to read the holy word the same way Christians want to &quot;spread the good
news?&quot; Just what is in these scriptures that would oblige the Jews to
kill a Gentile that read them? Why would public knowledge of Jewish
scriptures be dangerous to Jews? I went to the library and found some
old translations of parts of the Talmud. It was not long before I came
across other, even more amazing passages such as:

Balaam [Jesus] is raised from the dead and being punished in boiling
hot semen. Those who mock the words of the Jewish sages and sin
against Israel are boiled in hot excrement. (57a Gittin) 5

Because Christian scholars periodically obtained copies of the Talmud,
Talmudic scribes hoped to deceive them by using the name Balaam to
denote Jesus. In The Jewish Encyclopedia, under the heading &quot;Balaam,&quot;
it says, &quot;...the pseudonym 'Balaam' given to Jesus in Sanhedrin 106b and
Gittin 57a.

&quot;6 The Talmud repeatedly uses obscure words to denote Gentiles with an
assortment of names such as Egyptian, heathen, Cuthean, and idolater.
In the most popular English-language translation of the Talmud, called
the Soncino edition, the practice is illustrated by the fifth footnote
of the book of Sanhedrin. It reads, &quot;Cuthean (Samaritan) was here
substituted for the original goy...&quot;7 Christians are sometimes
referred to by the code word &quot;Min&quot; or &quot;Minim.&quot;8 The footnotes of the
Soncino edition of the Talmud as well as passages in the Jewish
Encyclopedia blatantly mention this deception. In other passages in
the Talmud I discovered a possible reason why some of the Talmud's
writers had forbidden Gentiles to read it. The Talmud's words are
vitriolic:

Only Jews are human. [Gentiles] are animals. (Baba Mezia 114a-114b.)9

For murder, whether of a Cuthean [Gentile] by a Cuthean, or of an
Israelite by a Cuthean, punishment is incurred; but of a Cuthean by an
Israelite, there is no death penalty. (Sanhedrin 57a)10

Even the best of the [Gentiles] should be killed. (Babylonian
Talmud)11

If a Jew is tempted to do evil he should go to a city where he is not
known and do the evil there. (Moed Kattan 17a.)

Gentiles' flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the
issue of horses.12

If a heathen [Gentile] hits a Jew, the Gentile must be killed. Hitting
a Jew is hitting God. (Sanhedrin 58b.)13

If an ox of an Israelite gores an ox of a Canaanite there is no
liability; but if an ox of a Canaanite [Gentile] gores an ox of an
Israelite...the payment is to be in full. (Baba Kamma 37b.)14

If a Jew finds an object lost by a heathen [Gentile] it does not have
to be returned. (Baba Mezia 24a; Affirmed also in Baba Kamma 113b.)15

God will not spare a Jew who 'marries his daughter to an old man or
takes a wife for his infant son or returns a lost article to a Cuthean
[Gentile]... (Sanhedrin 76a.)16

What a Jew obtains by theft from a Cuthean [Gentile] he may keep.
(Sanhedrin 57a.)17

[Gentiles] are outside the protection of the law and God has 'exposed
their money to Israel.' (Baba Kamma 37b.)18

Jews may use lies ('subterfuges') to circumvent a [Gentile]. (Baba
Kamma 113a.)19

All [Gentile] children are animals. (Yebamoth 98a.)20

[Gentiles] prefer sex with cows. (Abodah Zarah 22a-22b.)21

The vessels of [Gentiles], do they not impart a worsened flavor to the
food cooked in them? (Abodah Zarah 67b.)22
