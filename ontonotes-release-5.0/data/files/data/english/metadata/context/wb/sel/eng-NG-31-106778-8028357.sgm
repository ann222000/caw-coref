Wow! There's a beast called pagan islam, on the Temple Mount right now! In
fact, many say that beast is situated in the place where the Temple would be
today.  What is that beast?  It is a 'false god'!  Wow!

I remember reading in the Book 'Dani'el', that a beast like that comes.  It
seems Yermiyahu (Jereimiah) spoke of that beast as well. Oh wait, so did
David!  And so did Isaiah!  And so did almost all prophets.  :-)

But trust me, I am not in any way worried, none of us should be.  I am
loving the honor of being one who gets the huge privilege of seeing the
scriptures beginning to come alive before my very eyes!  WOW!  :-)

Anyone wonder what days we 'might be' in?  :-)  Anyone wonder what evil
character Olmert works against Israel, against Jews, and even against G-d
Himself for?  As Olmert works against Israel and for &quot;HaSatan&quot; (the Hebrew
word for &quot;The Enemy&quot;) at Bush's command, does anyone wonder what that evil,
biblical character's name is?  Anyone know George Bush's name?  Huh?  Do
they, huh?  OH!  Oops!  Drat, I gave it away!  LOL

Ok, that was a bit of fun.  But for the Americans, the reality is that, at
the destroyer George Bush's command, Olmert works against peace, works
against life, and works against FREEDOM in every form.  That is what you
American, are now, against your will, part of.  Get used to it.

Olmert allows Muslims to dig on Temple Mount WITHOUT ANY CONTROL

Islamic custodians previously disposed of truckloads of Jewish artifacts

Temple Mount
JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has quietly granted the Waqf - the
Muslim custodians of the Temple Mount - permission to dig unsupervised on
the sacred site, WND has learned.

The permission was granted in spite of longstanding fears from leading
Israeli archeologists the Waqf might hide or dispose of Jewish Temple
artifacts discovered during any Muslim digs.

The last time the Waqf conducted an unsupervised excavation on the Temple
Mount, in 1997, the Muslim custodians ultimately were caught by Israeli
authorities disposing truckloads of Mount dirt that contained Jewish Temple
artifacts.

Most Palestinian leaders routinely deny well-documented Jewish ties to the
Temple Mount - the holiest site in Judaism.

(Story continues below)

According to Palestinian sources, the Waqf last month requested permission
from Israel to conduct what it said were needed excavations under the Al
Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount to install new electrical and telephone
infrastructures in the mosque. Olmert's office at first turned down the Waqf
request, but after petitioning by the Jordanian government, the prime
minister acquiesced and has allowed the dig.

The Waqf this week quietly began digging a massive tunnel that snakes from
the Al Aqsa Mosque to the nearby Dome of the Rock, bringing in heavy
equipment for the work.

According to Israeli and Palestinian sources, the dig is not being
supervised by any Jewish archeologist, including from the Israeli
government's Antiquities Authority, which boasts a board of leading Israeli
Temple Mount archeological authorities.

No supervision

Prominent Temple Mount archeologist Eilat Mazar, a professor of Hebrew
University and a member of the Public Committee for Prevention of the
Destruction of Antiquities on Temple Mount, slammed the Waqf dig.

Mazar said she was concerned the Muslims were excavating &quot;without real,
professional and careful archaeological supervision involving meticulous
documentation.&quot;

Mazar, a third-generation Israeli Temple Mount archaeologist, is the
discoverer and lead archaeologist of Israel's City of David, believed to be
the palace of the biblical King David, the second leader of a united Kingdom
of Israel, who ruled from around 1005 to 965 B.C.

The last time the Waqf conducted a large dig on the Temple Mount, during
construction 10 years ago of a massive mosque at an area referred to as
Solomon's Stables, the Wafq reportedly disposed truckloads of dirt
containing Jewish artifacts from the First and Second Temple periods.

After the media reported on the disposals, Israeli authorities froze the
construction permit given to the Wafq, and the dirt was transferred to
Israeli archeologists for analysis. The Israeli authorities found scores of
Jewish Temple relics in the nearly disposed dirt, including coins with
Hebrew writing referencing the Temple, part of a Hasmonean lamp, several
other Second Temple lamps, Temple period pottery with Jewish markings, a
marble pillar shaft and other Temple period artifacts. The Waqf was widely
accused of attempting to hide evidence of the existence of the Jewish
Temples.

Temples 'never existed'

Speaking to WND in a recent interview, Waqf official and chief Palestinian
Justice Taysir Tamimi claimed the Jewish Temples &quot;never existed.&quot;

&quot;About these so-called two Temples, they never existed, certainly not at the
Haram Al- Sharif (Temple Mount),&quot; said Tamimi, who is considered the second
most important Palestinian cleric after Muhammad Hussein, the Grand Mufti of
Jerusalem.

&quot;Israel started since 1967 making archeological digs to show Jewish signs to
prove the relationship between Judaism and the city and they found nothing.
There is no Jewish connection to Israel before the Jews invaded in the
1880s,&quot; said Tamimi.

The Palestinian cleric denied the validity of dozens of digs verified by
experts worldwide revealing Jewish artifacts from the First and Second
Temples, tunnels that snake under the Temple Mount and over 100 ritual
immersion pools believed to have been used by Jewish priests to cleanse
themselves before services. The cleansing process is detailed in the Torah.

Asked about the Western Wall, Tamimi said the structure was a tying post for
Muhammad's horse and that it is part of the Al Aqsa Mosque, even though the
Wall predates the mosque by more than 1,000 years.

&quot;The Western wall is the western wall of the Al Aqsa Mosque. It's where
Prophet Muhammad tied his animal which took him from Mecca to Jerusalem to
receive the revelations of Allah.&quot;

The Palestinian media also regularly state the Jewish Temples never existed.

'We are fed up with this crap nonsense'

In a series of WND exclusive interviews, Palestinian terror leaders denied
the existence of the Jewish Temples.

&quot;We are fed up with this crap nonsense of the Temple Mount,&quot; said Nasser Abu
Aziz, the deputy commander of Fata's Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the
northern West Bank.

&quot;We do not know where this story came from. There is no historical or
archeological proof that your legendary Temples existed. We are sick of this
story. But Allah warned us that Jews will look for an excuse in order to
corrupt life on earth, so we are not surprised from the fact that you keep
raising this issue.&quot;

Muhammad Abdul-El, spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees terror
organization, said the Jewish Temples &quot;existed only in your dreams.

&quot;Go look for your stupid Temple elsewhere. And I am not saying this for
political reasons. I say that the enemy invented this story in order to
justify its occupation of Jerusalem.&quot;

Abu Abdullah, considered one of the most important operational members of
Hamas' so-called military wing, accused all Jews of being pathological
liars.

&quot;Stop lying and believing your own lies. Even if there was such a thing (as
a Jewish Temple) do you really believe that Solomon, who was a prophet,
would have built a Temple in the place that Allah wanted for the Al Aqsa
Mosque?&quot;

Judaism's holiest site

The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism. Muslims say it is their
third holiest site.

The First Jewish Temple was built by King Solomon in the 10th century B.C.
It was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. The Second Temple was
rebuilt in 515 B.C. after Jerusalem was freed from Babylonian captivity.
That temple was destroyed by the Roman Empire in A.D. 70. Each temple stood
for a period of about four centuries.

The Jewish Temple was the center of religious Jewish worship. It housed the
Holy of Holies, which contained the Ark of the Covenant and was said to be
the area upon which God's &quot;presence&quot; dwelt. The Al Aqsa Mosque now sits on
the site.

The temple served as the primary location for the offering of sacrifices and
was the main gathering place in Israel during Jewish holidays.

The Temple Mount compound has remained a focal point for Jewish services
over the millennia. Prayers for a return to Jerusalem have been uttered by
Jews since the Second Temple was destroyed, according to Jewish tradition.
Jews worldwide pray facing toward the Western Wall, a portion of an outer
courtyard of the Temple left intact.

The Al Aqsa Mosque was constructed around A.D. 709 to serve as a shrine near
another shrine, the Dome of the Rock, which was built by an Islamic caliph.
Al Aqsa was meant to mark where Muslims came to believe Muhammad, the
founder of Islam, ascended to heaven.

Jerusalem is not mentioned in the Quran. Islamic tradition states Mohammed
took a journey in a single night from &quot;a sacred mosque&quot; - believed to be in
Mecca in southern Saudi Arabia - to &quot;the farthest mosque&quot; and from a rock
there ascended to heaven. The farthest mosque later became associated with
Jerusalem.
