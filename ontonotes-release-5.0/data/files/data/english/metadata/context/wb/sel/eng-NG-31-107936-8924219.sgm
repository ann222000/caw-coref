The B-26 Maruder had a 7 man crew when it first went into service. Due
to weight problems involving wing losding, one man was eliminaated. It
was the navigator. The Army Air Corps solved the problem by sending
the bombardier to a navoation school where he qualified on Dead
Reckoning, Pilotage and Air Plot. He was never trainied in celestial
but the B-26 with it's relativey short daylight missions had very
little use for celestial.The Bomardier was sometime called (not
offivially) a Bombagator. I was one of those guys. I trained in both
bombimg amd Navigating at Big Spring Army Air base in Texas. ans did
both when in combat over occupied Europe.

I'm puzzled by the high number of crew put in harms way relative to
bombload in US WW2 bombers, esp the B26. Using Wikipedia numbers,
which I realize Art has found fault with before, I gather:

The Mosquito carried an equal 4000lb bombload with only one thirdthe
B26 crew (2 vs 6 due to Mossie's amazing speed making gunners
dispensible).

Sticking with crew of around 7 was the B24 and Lancaster which
typically carried double and more than triple the B26 bombload
respectively.

B17 carried twice the bombload as B26 or Mosquito, but with ten souls
on board (5 times as much as Mossie!).

So maybe the B26 was still overmanned, and could have shed a gunner?
This may have brought it's high survival rate down a bit, but could be
compensated by an extra bomb and higher speed return flight, etc. I
realize missions differ, requireing different crewing, but...

BTW, I will paste in example crew duties from Wiki which raise all
sorts of other questions:

B26: 2 pilots, bombardier, navigator/radio operator, 3 gunners
Mos: pilot, bombardier/navigator
Lan: pilot, flight engineer, navigator, bomb aimer, wireless operator,
mid-upper and rear gunners
B17: Pilot, co-pilot, navigator, bombardier/nose gunner, flight
engineer-top turret gunner, radio operator, waist gunners (2), ball
turret gunner, tail gunner

Couldn't some of the He-111s get away with a 4-man crew: pilot,
bombardier/navigator, dorsal gunner, and ventral gunner? I know they
had the option of 4 or 5 with a bombload of around 5,000 lbs +/-.

Also, many refs say that the He-111 could carry a max. load of between
7,275-8,800 lbs, but the vertical bomb stores internally was fixed at
2,000 kg (4,400 lbs). I was always told that if the He-111 carried the
&quot;other&quot; 2,000 kg externally, it was at the expense of the internal
load. Externals included various bombs, missiles, and torpedos. So are
the refs adding both for that claimed maximum? Or when did the He-111
ever carry a 4,000 kg load??? You would think that load would
compromise its performance to the point of a sluggish Me-323
transport!

Well, I guess shedding gunners may have drawbacks like needing to add
escort fighters.  Most German bombers seemed to be quite lightly
defended with guns, but their bf110 long range escort fighter proved
to be unsuccesful. Lancasters with their little rifle-caliber array of
defensive guns focused more on night raids.

Still, I like to brainstorm ways to save lives, and am now thinking of
a Mosquito with just one crew. Late model Mossies were said to attain
about the same bombload as a B-17, although were starting to be
vulnerable to the best fighters. But that one overloaded pilot could
try to do the work of 10 B17 crew, so reward him with just one tenth
the number of missions normally needed for retirement?

The Me Bf 110s were unsuccessful due to their heavy armament which
caused poor performance when faced with a Hurricane or Spitfire. This
would not have happened if the Fw-187 Falke had been chosen instead.
The Falke was heavily armed (4x MGs + 2x 20mm cannon) AND had better
performance that the Me Bf 109E (had they used the V-6 version of 2x
DB-600As @ 1,000 hp each). But do give the Germans some credit with
the Me Bf 110. It sucked as a day fighter, but was useful as a night
fighter. Add a DB-605, radar, and Schrage-Musik oblique cannons and
the late version Me Bf 110s were no laughing matter .

*Note: the Fw-187V-6 attained 392 mph with two DB-600As in Jan 1939!
This was better than the best Me Bf 109 that started the war in Sept
1939 and nothing was as good as it until the Fw-190 came along by
1941.

Whoops, I guess the Mosquito normally carried half as much load as I
have been posting, so maybe not the magic bullet.

P.S. The author of &quot;No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe,
1939-1945&quot; seems to claim that Russia had a specific, workable plan to
end the war about 6 months early, hardly even needing allied air or
ground help. But instead of hitting Berlin, Stalin decided to use
Allied Lend-Lease equipment to crush Eastern Europe first, so that no
independance groups could spring up. Roosevelt agreed to this,
supposedly because he might need the Russians to contribute cannon
fodder for the 1 million casualties expected in the invasion of Japan
(if the atom bomb didn't work).

They were a bit faster due to lighter armament;  a late model Do 217M
could manage about 340mph perhaps pretty good for an aicraft forced to
opperate on 87 octane fuel.

The German bomber and fighter program failed due to poor risk and
engineering mismanagement that came out of political pressure the
shortages of engineering manpower and special alloys added to this
problem.

The Me 110 should have been replaced by the Me 210/410 almost 2 years
earlier in addition the Me 210/410 also would have replaced many of
the ju 88's roles.

&quot;Bomber B&quot;, the Ju 288, should have replaced the Do 217, Ju 88 etc.

US aircraft were profligate and inefficient in their crewing and
armament.   If it were not for the fact that these aircraft were
produced across the Atlantic ocean in a nation with relatively
abundant supplies of fuel, alloys, manpower and free from bombing the
B-17 and B-24 would have been war looser rather than winners due to
their flawed conceptualisation and resourcing requirements.   The
quality of the construction and design was excellent but the concepts
required immense manpower.

10 men, guns all over the place. lumbering across the sky not at
maxium cruising speed but often only 180mph or less.

Basically the reasoning went like this: the bombers would penetrate at
high altitude thus avoiding FLAK, even though they were likely to be
only a little slower than fighters it was unlikely that they would be
intercepted for any significant period however if they were heavy
armament would protect them.   Ofcourse what happened is that radar,
more or less proven by 1937 in the UK, Germany and US ensured that the
bombers would always be intercepted even before they reached the
borders of the country they were attack while due to the armament they
were so slow they were easily intercepted.   If 60 bombers met 60
fighters the fighters would tend to win by a modest margin though of
course 10 crew with 4 engines were lost as opposed to 1 aircraft with
one pilot who at least until some allied pilots started machine
gunning the parachutes, was often recovered.

In the end the oxymoronic flying fortress worked not only because of
the USAAF massive resources but becasue the weight of armament
required to defeat them rendered the luftwaffe fighters vulnerable to
escorts.

The Junkers Ju 288 was I think the best conceived bomber of the war
with the most potential but suffering from bad management.

I've never found an allied equivalent.

The Ju 288 was however and excellent concept; almost as fast as a
Mosquito but also heavily armed.  It needed powerfull engines.   The
engines that should have made this marvel was available in the USA;
the PW2800 and would have been as technically complicated as the B-29.

The Jumo 222 engine failed due to growth in the Ju 288 pushing a
fueselage diameter increase and a crew size increment from 3 to 4.
This meant the engine wasn't frozen.

Backup engines were the DB 604 an engine of the X-24 configuration but
his had been cancelled because the Jumo 222 showed more promise, the
BMW 802; a sort of 18 cylinder version of the 14 cylinder BMW801 with
3280 cubic inches dragged on becuase of the pressing need to develop
jets and improve the BMW801.  The other alternative; the coupled
DB606/610 was also mismanaged and unreliable.

Mosquito of course had two crew, but at 0.6% attrition rate it almost
exactly matched that of the B-26 thouygh B-26's did not penetrate
deeply into enemy territory as the B-17 and Mosquito.  However the
British never specified another armed bomber after the Mosquitos
sucess again after its success was proven.  Speed and countermeasures
was a much better way of surviving and is the method practised today.

Here is a proposal: take the B-17 superfortress, give it the turbo
supercharged allision engine that adds about 10 mph from 317 to 327
for the B-17E and then do a streamlining job on it.   No chin turret
and no ventral turret.   Consider deletion of the dorsal turret
leaving only the radio room gun, waist and side guns.    That should
get the vehicle to about 350mph.  With a lot of drag and weight gone
we have a much faster aircraft however had the aircraft been designed
for speed in mind from the beginning something matching opposing
fighters could have been achieved.  Fighters and bombers share the
same engine technology.  Given the bombers advantage in surface to
volume ratio it should be able to match the fighters speed and still
have room for bombs and fuel needed.

Curtiss LeMay found that the best way to protect the B-29 was to order
the escorts to fly ahead of the b-29's to prevent head on attacks.,
the speed of the B-29 then forced tail attacks with relatively low
angular rates that the B-29 gunner could handle.
