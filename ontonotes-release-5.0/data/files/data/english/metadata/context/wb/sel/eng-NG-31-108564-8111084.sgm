I haven't been able to make head nor tail out of the mine/quake business.

Prior to this, what was the magnitude of the largest, certified man-made
quake? If no one knows this, please give some other historic examples.

3.9 or 4.1 seems pretty extreme for a mine collapse. But hey, I'm no
expert on these things.

I think it is about 6.6 - the largest hydrogen bomb tests.
There is some &quot;fudging&quot; occuring depending on whether
a country is trying to disguise a test or brag it has the bomb.
You can implant in special geologic environoments and
in certain ways to go either way.

&quot;Since the mid-1990s, at least a half-dozen other mine collapses have caused
similar seismic waves, including a 1995 cave-in in southwestern Wyoming that
caused readings as high as a magnitude 5.4.&quot;

I suppose when you drop an entire mountain a few feet, it amounts
to more than a little energy.

A lot of underground coal mines use columns of coal to hold up
the roof in the seam being worked.  This places tremendous
compressive loads on the columns; the practice sounds insanely
dangerous.  It's mentioned in the book/movie &quot;October Sky&quot; as
feeling like an earthquake, and the column failures are literally
explosive.

I'm sure that practices vary in detail around the world, but UK
practices would have somewhere in the 1/4 to 1/3 of the area of a seam
mined by &quot;pillar &amp; stall&quot; left to prop up the ceiling. Certainly, the
limestones in the Box stone mines (which I've spent a dozen or so hours
wandering around in) are around that proportion. So you'd be looking at
a ~4-fold increase in STRESS. Ah, but you've also got the loss of
confining pressure too; that's going to increase the relative stress in
the column, particularly on the surfaces.
