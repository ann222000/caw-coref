I'm not scared but the reality today is that it simply is not worth
the risk.

But that's not why I quit that a few years ago. I just didn't think it
was right. Especially from another foot oriented site, knowing what it
takes, expense wise. Most small places do the best that they can and
put everything they can into it. I don't always agree with their
styles and specific interests, but I can appreciate the struggle and
the idea that they are creating something original and it costs them
dearly.

In the pre-cable days when only small "samples" were posted it was a
bit different in terms of the effect on such sites. It was actually
good for them.  Not now.

From general porno sites that just do lip service to feet (and aren't
worth it anyway to join for foot people) my attitude is a bit
different.  But a few years ago I decided that I was just wasting time
posting, especially since a lot of what I posted I truthfully didn't
care for that much.  And a lot of what I collected I also realized I
didn't care for.  So I got pickier too. And then I saw Skywise was
picking up the same stuff from the same places and there was no use
posting the same stuff a day earlier or later.  We were fishing in
some of the same waters.

So I don't even look much elsewhere anymore.  It saves me a lot of
time.  I used to look far and wide just to find stuff to post every
day. That was nonsense since a lot of it I really even didn't care for
myself.  So I'm better off just doing what I like, making some myself
in the style I like, and expanding the world supply at least somewhat
with my own effort.   Doc

Explain the risk. I really don't know what you are talking about...I have
webmasterster emailing me weekly asking if I could post some of
there material cause they are afraid of getting flamed and being marked as
spammers.Unfortunately I was unable to post for a long time because of
reasons
I will not disscuss on this group.

These sites that you are talking about depend on people like You and Me and

for all.Some don't even know how to post... Go figure...

Hey Doc I live in the country now and have only dial up... Pre cable is only
a term used by wealthy countries like mine and yours... What about the rest

Thats just your opinion . I bet thousands would love to see you post like
you used to.. I think you just went commercial on us all.( something you

Some people don't just like Feet only. Some like blow jobs with the girl

actress barefoot.
Who are you to say what "Foot People" want ?

or something?

Just say they are webfinds and keep your little comments and URL connected
to each post...
BTW... Do you have any of that old stuff called Naughty Nylons.. I can't
find my cd or I would post them... Maybe I will check upstairs where I keep
some of my really old stuff
but I am sure this group would like to see them. Especially the newbies !

I dunno dude, this is, or was, a Foot group.  It may have evolved past

Are you drunk? LOL. As I explained, it drained my time and others like
Skywise could and did take over the "job". It became a job to do it

me that much.

You are drunk. I didn't say there was no room for me and Skywise.
Re-read what I wrote before.  What I said was that I noticed that he'd
be posting stuff I had ready to go out or I was posting stuff he
likely had from the same places or groups so it was pointless. He was
doing it and bringing it here so why duplicate the work or even "hunt"
elsewhere.

You do drink too much in the great White North. I was the first binary
poster in some groups and the longest continuous poster in others.
I've posted responsibly, and more importantly in a regular steady
fashion esp. if I see nothing else going on for a day or 2.
"Attitudes like mine"????   Aren't you being a little harsh there just
because I no longer post other people's work? What obligates me to?
I'd rather do and enjoy my own stuff, is that so bad to feel that way?

Why do you have to be so insulting?

Of course I promote my site. I like to film much much MUCH more than
post, than work on websites, than advertise etc.  But it is
unfortunate that in order to film a little, I must spend huge amounts
of time doing the other stuff since I did not inherit wealth and what
I had saved up before is long gone.  So I must advertise, most people
in my shoes would do the same. I try to do it without the obnoxious
practices of most sites like constant repetition, just text etc. I'm
interested in the subject matter and participate in the group.

Doc I read this post and I was shocked that you would say that about me on
such a wide media...
First of all I do not drink at all and I do not do any types of drugs ( any
kind ) You want to be a webmaster that only posts his material then so be it
but never ever accuse me of being a drunk. ... I can't drink ever  . It has
to do with my condition and it also has to do with why I am back... You want
to hear about it then email me and we will talk but if you ever call be a
drunk again or accuse me being drunk on this group again I will surely do
nothing towards you but it is your credibility that is at stake... What made
you think  I was drunk ?? I work 7 days a week on my site and do 6 photo
shoots a month plus I take care of my parrents that are in there 80's. This
is the type of slander I would expect from a low life... I know I have been
away from this group for quite a bit but I am not being insulting. Actually
I love your work and hope you keep it up but I think your posts from your
archives would enrich this group.How could you possibly think I was drinking
when I posted my message to you.. Maybe you are drunk because it is the
Memorial Day Weekend in the States..

It would be better to blame it on a bottle than on yourself.  Maybe we
