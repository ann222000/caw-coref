OK Guys... some action...

Mr. Ganesh replied me promptly with the following answers. Some of the
questions regarding home theater, paying for club house construction were
partially answered and I have asked for more details and confirmation.

I have asked for more details and clarifications regarding DSL connections,
number of land line connections(Is it one phone number per socket - if I
have 3 sockets, then I can have 3 separate phone numbers), networking and
wardrobe package. I will update you guys on the outcome!

Thanks,
Purush

&gt; *It was pleasure meeting your family members at our site office.*

&gt; *Please find the answers to your queries in line:*

&gt; Can you please confirm that the following locations are provided with
&gt; split A/C connections, TV and telephone outlets?

&gt; 1) Living Room: split A/C provisions, TV and telephone points provided.
&gt; 2) Family Room: split A/C provisions, TV and telephone points provided.
&gt; 3) Master Bedroom: split A/C provisions, TV and telephone points provided.
&gt; 4) Remaining 2 rooms: split A/C provisions, TV and telephone points
&gt; provided.

&gt; What is the diameter of the current planned PVC conduit pipes that carry
&gt; the wires? If I need to add additional wiring into the existing PVC conduit
&gt; pipe, can I accommodate in the current PVC conduit pipe or need to have one
&gt; more extra PVC conduit to run extra wires? I have heard experiences about
&gt; some builders providing very little or no extra room to extend the current
&gt; wiring thus making the owner to install new external channels to support the
&gt; wiring or concealing new pipes by breaking the newly constructed wall. A
&gt; classic example being home theater connections. :

&gt; We will be providing sufficient number of electrical points for each area
&gt; in the apartment &amp; leaving no chance for shortage.

&gt; I am in favour of having extra wiring for home theater connection. How do
&gt; I need to proceed on requesting this option? Or Brigade Group discourages
&gt; all the customers by not providing options for the home theater? If this is
&gt; something which can be worked out during the wiring phase, please provide
&gt; with more information.

&gt; You can have home theater in your apartment &amp; we will be providing the
&gt; switches, 5/15 amp Switched Socket &amp; cable TV Socket.

&gt; I definitely understand about various upgrade demands by the customers and
&gt; hope that Brigade Group maintains forward thinking and near long term
&gt; visualization of the requirements. I appreciate your comments on this
&gt; subject.

&gt; Yes, Brigade Group always foresees the requirements &amp; develops on that.

&gt; I also need more information about the Club committee participation. Does
&gt; Brigade mean that if I pay for building the club house, I will be one among
&gt; the executive committee members, but, will not have a share of the
&gt; property. Are there an y rules already being formed regarding the benefits
&gt; for paying club building construction? If YES, please send the details so
&gt; that I can take a decision about paying for the club house construction.

&gt; Club membership is an *exclusive right *to use the club facilities, which
&gt; will be owned &amp; maintained by &quot;Brigade Hospitality Services Pvt. Ltd.&quot; No
&gt; one will have the share in the club house property, but will only have &quot;*exclusive
&gt; right for the usage of the facilities provided by Brigade Hospitality
&gt; Services Pvt. Ltd&quot;.*

&gt; I am not sure about whether I am asking the above questions to the right
&gt; person. If not, can you please forward the above information to the
&gt; concerned persons in your organization for further processing?

&gt; You are in touch with the right person &amp; hope; I have covered all your
&gt; queries.

&gt; &gt; I think we have about 60 people in this mailing list. I would like to
&gt; &gt; know how many of you have had a request which elicited the same response? We
&gt; &gt; should probably pool in our fav. changes and see how many of us want the
&gt; &gt; same. Then we can use a united front and talk to Brigade about it.

Couple of points:

1. The answer below doesnt fully yet answer about Home Therater wiring.
I've not asked for home theatre wiring, but interested in it. So, please
count
me in, and let us know..

2. Here are my requests turned down:
a) Wash basin sink next to dining was turned down as well.
b) Additional Tap point in the kitchen Utility area was denied.
They provide one, which you might use up for Cloth washing machine.
It would be so nice to have another one, where servant maid can use
it for washing vessles or otherwise. The reason given "Not feasible due to
column extending to balcony. space is sufficient just to accomodate one
tap point" I'm not convinced of this answer; well, if it is not feasible
change the
needed spec to provide this because this is a very basic need.
c) brigade withdrew their offer for cloth hnager hooks in the balcony
due to aesthetic reasons
d) Request for marble flooring turned down
e) Request for recessed lighting on  ceiling turned down.(i can understand
this sort of)

So, here it is - the list of gripes from me, that i can recall quickly among
others ;-)

Thanks,
