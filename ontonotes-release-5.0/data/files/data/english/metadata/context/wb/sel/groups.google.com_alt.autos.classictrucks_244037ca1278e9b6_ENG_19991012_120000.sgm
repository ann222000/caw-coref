I've got no one to bleed on. Just did complete brake replacement on my 65
C-10 and am wondering about one-man bleeding kits/tools. Seems like it
ought to be a rather simple affair, but the NAPA and another local parts
store didn't have a clue.

I used to have one, a 12&quot; hose w/check valve in one end, can't remember
where I got it though. Try some of the other parts houses, like Pep Boys,
Auto Zone, Advanced, etc.

"/> It's called &quot;Mitey-Vac&quot; if no one else has it, you can get it from Eastwood,
call your local Cornwall or Mac dealer. you can try just cracking a bleeder
screw and slowly pumping the pedal, do this one at a time, should get rid of
most if not all the air. Bob

Bruce-

Here is something I did in the past. Put a hose on the bleed valve and
run it into a jar with brake fluid so the tip of the hose is submerged. As
you fill the master cylinder and pump the brakes all of the air will go
through the hose but not back in. It will take a little more brake fluid
than normal because you will probably pump more than you need.

Good luck,
Steven

This is what I was going to suggest too. I do it. And believe it or not, AJ
Foyt's crew does it too. I used to have a friend that worked for AJ here in
Houston. He told me they did this and I thought he was full of sh*t. Surely
one of the greatest racecar drivers of all time had a profesional tool just
for this job right? WRONG. I watched them bleed the brakes on an Indy car
with my own eyes using this method. Cool huh? I guess the tried and true
methods work for everybody.

These days I just gravity bleed brakes. Seems to work a majority of the
time. Not so well on old equipment. Better on new and rebuilt stuff. Mark

Bruce:

I have used the MityVac system to bleed the brakes many times on my pick up
trucks. It works pretty good. I provides a vacuum to pull the fluid and air
out of the brake cylinders. Make sure that you keep the master cylinder
filled with brake fluid or you can bleed it dry. Start at the wheel farthest
away (usually passenger side rear) from the master cylinder and work your way
to the closest (usually driver rear, passenger front and finally driver
front). It beats having your wife mad at you for having to keep pumping the
brake. ;-)

It is easy to one man bleed. Just start with the shortest line and loosen
the bleed screw and turn it in until it just starts to seat and back off so
it doesnt touch. Slowly pump the pedal without using full strokes. Push in
slowly and return a little faster, then wait. Repeat until you have clean
fluid running out. What you are trying to do is have the return springs
push fluid enough to overcome negative pressure to pull air back in the
bleed screw. After you bleed all four wheels the pedal will start to feel
solid. Repeat and you will have it done as good as having someone help. Dont
try and use the siphon line in brake fluid. You want to push all the fluid
through the master cylinder and flush any impurities out at the wheel. Never
having someone to help I have used this way and dont bother anyone to help
anymore. It will take a little time to master it if you are not real
familiar with all the internal workings of a brake system. Make sure the
master cylinder is bled first before doing the wheels. It can be done the
same way. Bleed screw(if equipped) or loosen line.

How does this work properly with disc brakes? They don't have return
springs. As far as I know, it's the release of pressure only that causes the
pads to release the pressure. This is why when you replace the pads you have
to push the cylinder back in the caliper. If there is something I'm
misinformed about please let me know.

It works the same. The square cut oring acts as a return spring. It will
retract the piston just enough so the pad will not drag. There are other
conditions that cause the pad to drag anyway. And with volume the piston
displaces it will push plenty of fluid back to avoid air being drawn in.
Beware that if the bleed screw is open too much, it will not work at all.
