Well the 6,000 buried is a conjecture. Scud missiles managed to take out a
few dozen American lives. The gassing of the Iranians in the face of a
massive upset during their human wave attacks was in fact protested
officially in the U.N and stateside. 50% children is accurate. It's also
none of our concern. The Iraqi people have brought this upon themselves in
the same way that the German people brought about their own destruction in
WWII or more recently in Czechoslovakia.

Infatuation and herdlike submission to a personality cult leader (no matter
how gruesome his repressive tactics are) is tantamount to cowardice. The
world has changed, and the old excuses from idealistic doe-eyed citizens
flailing helplessly as their taxes and wealth fund atrocity don't cut it
anymore.

And just where are the dissenters in Iraq? They're huddled beneath no-fly
zones. Or ripping off the U.N.'s aid packages. Or worse, they've exported
their brains and con-men (don't underestimate the importance of con-men to
revolution) west to Britian and Wall Street with stops along the way to rip
off Syrian Banks and drum up Egyptian and Palestinian support (great
company). In the vacuum, the apologists and masses have created a fetid,
apathetic breeding ground for this _butchery_.

But, when it's done, we'll spend billions on medication, food, and
rebuilding. Like we have for the past 12 years through oil for food and
medicine programs, defending the Kurds in the North, and the Saudi's, and
Kuwait.

America has blood on her hands and her fangs. This is true. None of us is
proud of this. Who else is going to enforce peace? Without action, 12
years from now, after the French and Russians have retooled the Republican
guard, what would prevent Saddam or his sons from marching out again on
another fool's errand. (&quot;winning&quot; the war with Iran basically meant that
Iraq got to maintain it's pre-war boundaries after sustaining massive
personnel and infrastructure losses; we all know what happened when they
&quot;annexed&quot; Kuwait) Would a radioactive, scorched-earth Iraq, after they
naively dump sarin gas or small nuke in downtown Tel Aviv and find
themselves on the business end of the 20+ large strategic Nukes, and hundred
plus battlefield/tacticle projectiles make you happy - would it fulfil your
principles for good international governance.

Humans kill one another. That's what we do. That's what we'll always do.
We try to moderate it. Sometimes we're successful; sometimes we're not. In
this case there were multiple failures on both sides and through
international entities. People are going to die. Not innocent people.
Just people.
So take your statistics and your thin veneer of self-righteousness, stuff
them in your mouth and swallow. You'll find them to be singularly
uncomfortable and indigestible.

Right.
I want to make it very clear that I take Saddam Hussein to be a devil.

So we just go out and kill everybody around. It's a tragedy but
unavoidable. We have to do it, we can't help it. That's what history
demands. We carry the torch. We know better. Because we are the chosen
few. We shoulder the burden. Who differs in opinion is sadly deluded.
Sometimes we fail. Shit happens. But we are the final manifestation of
the world's development towards it's god-blessed good ends. Because we
are strong. Because we are good. God's own country. The safety and the
freedom of the planet depends on our friendly weapons. We just kill
the bad. Because we are the good. We are completely unselfish. We make
the whole world safe for democracy &amp;#8211; for the well-fare of all
people of this beautiful world. Any questions?

We can't organize a decent democratic election within our own country
but that's irrelevant.

There was a woman on CNN tonight, questioned: What do you think about
the war? &amp;#8211; Well, we gave them an ultimatum, they didn't comply,
so we have to strike back.

Sure, what else? Kill the bastards if they don't comply with our
demands. Nuke them. It's the Iraqui people's own fault. It's better
for the world. It will be a better world afterwards. Because we know
better, we are in the know. We have to defend the principles of the
free world. We are forced to do so by our ruthless enemies. Whatever
happens it's our enemies' fault. You object? Better be careful. What's
your name? We don't encourage dissenters. America, love it or leave
it.

I love it, so I left it.

Who the fuck are we?

I always wondered how facism in cultured Germany could become the
leading and self-distructive force. It's getting clearer to me now,
watching the developments inside the USA. You just need a basic trauma
( 9/11 in America - the lost WW I in Germany and the suffocating
war-penalties that unwisely strangulated German economies and violated
German self-respect ) &amp;#8211; and then you just need a few strong
people with their minds made up who bundle public anxieties and
understandable retaliation-dreams into three or four simple messages
and then you've got to get a real good deceitful propaganda department
like in the USSR and some real nice tricks to work your way round the
constitution, and there! look how the opposition in parliament is
crouching voluntarily and let's itself be kicked out of debate by
self-humiliation to the organized public discourse, and see how
smoothly parliament hands over it's democractic power and
responsibility as a blank check to the Leader, and you end up with the
Fuehrer's saying Â»Since 5.45 we are shooting backÂ« - meaning his
unprovoked military attack on Poland, for the well-fare of all the
good decent hard-working law-abiding people in the Third Reich. The
German people applauded widely ( not all of them, to their credit)
&amp;#8211; it was a relief-valve; and then there was no stopping anymore.
And more and more German people honestly thought that this was the
sensible solution to their national problems and fervently opposed any
idea that there was some evil lurking around in their own precincts.
