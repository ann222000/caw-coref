I notice that in iTunes, pressing the zoom button actually presents a
different view. Is this just a matter of getting a notification they
pressed it, and choosing a different content view for the window?

Yes, but don't do it; it's HORRIBLE!

why? you don't like the approach in iTunes? In my case the affect could
be similar; the 'other' display would be larger, and whose content would
be manually drawn vs. a tableview in the normal display. This 'other'
display also allow [I think] allow me a nicer printable output. Either
display could be manually sized but the overall content would be more
comprehensive in the 'other' display.

No ;-). I think the 'zoom' (or maximize as it's now known) button should
do just that: adjust the size of the window. Making it change the window
mode is not what I would expect, and iTunes' behaviour is _really_ not
what I'd expect. Even the 'trafic lights' are aranged vertically! I
wonder what the HIG says about that...

Printable output (as in 'printer') should be independent of your window
contents. Unless you want to implement a PrintScreen function ;-)

The idea of having a 'simple' and an 'advanced' view on the data can
work quite well, but the most straightforward way of implemening it is
by simply adding a button or a menu item that toggles both states. That
would be the approach of 'least surprise'.

Yeah I hear ya but a zoom'd tableView of what I have now doesn't look
that good and I was thinking of disabling it but that would also alter
resizing and I can get a better content with a different layout. I also
like the zoom button reuse as I don't have to resort to anything
additional visually; The other view would still employ a scrollview but
its contents would be a single view they could scroll and size the
scrollview around.

You're not implying that the iTunes brethren have done something to
violate the HIG?;-)

Personally speaking, the best way to take user interface guidance from
iTunes is to treat it as a vast tome of what not to do. It doesn't follow
Apple's own guidelines, it's ugly, and it behaves strangely in many ways.
The traffic light button on a window should be treated as sacred: they act
exactly the same way in every single app you ever encounter. Completely
altering the function of one of them just to add some new UI mode is
ridiculous; what if I want to actually, say, make my iTunes window be as
large as possible? If I click the button explicitly designed for that,
only confusion results.

Ok, let's say I'm less than convinced on following iTunes; I justed
wanted a different display on a larger scale, and it did look nice [at
the time]; I'll have to draw up some mock ups before I start coding.

Apple's been violating the HIG since there were HIG to violate. Of
course, what with the G standing for &quot;guidelines&quot; I'd argue that it's
important that they do from time to time. Just not gratuitously. Because
ultimately that's the point. I don't mind iTunes' deviation much - after
all, the whole app deviates - but it really wasn't a predictable
behavior the first time. You should strive to not be unpredictable.

The OS X calculator also uses the zoom button this way, btw. But in that
case it's not even a toggle; it's a cycle.

it's an easter egg; wow; now I'm less convinced not to do it;-)
