I'm sure this topic has been covered numerous times but here goes.

My wife and I have been married for almost 14 years and we have 2
children, (5 &amp; 11) and we are both in our mid 30's. Our sex life has
never really been &quot;over active&quot;, probably about once every 8-10 days
in its prime. And as time goes on it get worse and worse. In the
neighborhood of once every 4-6 weeks now. We have talked about it ALOT
but never really accomplish anything. She gives a completely different
reason literally every time we discuss it. So that confuses my quite a
bit. I always tell her &quot;If you just dont enjoy it or want to do it,
then tell me that because I think I can deal with that&quot; But she always
says she enjoys it but its this or that or whatever. I have tried
numerous approaches. 1. At first I was angry so we argued about
it....which makes things worse. 2. Then I tried the sweet approach,
(i.e. saying or doing sweet things or making sweet gestures) but that
had little or no affect. 3. Then I tried the cold shoulder affect.
Again....nothing changed.

A little more insight....She never really has been one that seemed to
enjoy &quot;fooling&quot; around. It's VERY unusual to do anything other than
conventional sex via missionary style. And most of the time she wont
even get completely undressed? Again, were both in our mid 30's and
have a little more cushion in some areas than we used to if you know
what I mean, but I have assured her that she is the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen, and I really feel that way so hopefully she
believes me.

Just a little more insight and I swear I will wrap this up. lol. A few
years ago she got into the TV show &quot;Sex in the City&quot; and for a few
weeks while she was watching all the episodes on DVD, our sex life got
VERY, VERY active. More active than it had ever been. In fact it go so
active, that she purchased a sex toy and we experimented with it 2
times. It was great! But then I got sick and she started her period.
So it got put on hold temporarily.....so I thought. It never came back
like that again which to this day confuses me??

In summary, I just dont know what to do or if there's anything I can
do. I used to get mad and upset about it but now my feelings are just
really hurt. Does she just not love me in that way? Or am I doing
something wrong? I've told her if there's something I'm not doing
right or doing at all to please show me how she likes it. I want her
to enjoy it as much as I do. I love her very much and feel like we are
perfect for each other in every way except this one. So if anybody has
any ideas or thoughts, I would love to hear them.

Thanks for those of you who read this entire post. lol. Sorry for
being so long winded.

This won't help, but consider the possibility that she _does_ enjoy
it.  Just not nearly as often as you want.  That seems like the most
likely explanation.

Asking for reasons from her probably helps neither her nor you.  She
wants sex at some frequency, and how can she know _why_ she wants it
at that frequency?

From what you've written,  I don't think it is either one.

It's just not about you, it is about her.

I know this doesn't help solve the problem, but it is important not to
turn the problem into something it isn't.  Maybe there _is_ another
problem.  Maybe she is feeling resentful about something and it makes
her want you less.  Maybe she has medical issues that interfere with
her libido.  Or something else.

But nothing you've written so far suggests anything other than
mismatched libidos, and if that is really what it is, then don't try
to make it about her not loving you, or about you not doing the right
thing.

But _do_ try to find a good marriage counselor.  This sort of problem
can lead to major marital problems,  and sometimes one can find a way
to change the dynamic between you so that your sex life can become
more satisfying.

You sound like a good man, Zippo.  And I think after getting over the
anger (for the most part) you have done a good job.

I am thinking this is about her.  Somewhere she is having a stumbling
block with sex.

One thing is - she might be in *mom mode*.  When you are really
involved with your children, sex and being sexy tends to fall to the
way-side.  Does she do enough just for herself?

The Sex and the City remark is a very, very good thing, in my
opinion.  Something sparked for her there.  Maybe because the women in
it are strong and the stories revolve around *their* life, not with
kids so much.  That they are women - first and foremost.
In any case, I would say she has it in her, just she has a hard time
getting those sexy feelings to come round again.

Also, something we have discussed here on this NG is that as more time
goes by between sex, for some women, they tend to find it not so
important and they don't want it or feel the need for it as much.  So
when you both go these longish stretches between, she gets further
away from remembering how wonderful it can be.

My suggestion is give her the boxed set of Sex and the City for her
birthday or Christmas.  Or another program that might stimulate her.
Not sure if she is into reading, but soft-porn romance could work
too.

Keep up the *I think you are beautiful* talk too.  At mid-30 women
kind of go through this, I am not a hot 22 yo any more.

The winds could definitely change also as she approaches forty, the
new age of sexual peak for women!

I think things will look up for you.  She just needs to get in the
mind frame of what a sexy, attractive, fun, sex loving person she is
and a woman above all else.  Stick with it!

Well there ya go!  Go to Costco and get as many  &quot;Sex in the City&quot;
DVDs as you can afford!  If you're not a Costco member, I've seen them
in the library.  Good luck!

BTW, folks, there are many soft-core sexy videos out there
that can help spark one's sex-life.  I'm reminded of the &quot;Red
Shoes Diaries&quot; mini-series with David Duchovny, before he
became known for the X-Files.  Early in my 1st marriage, my
ex and I would spend days in bed with them.  Look for them
on www.amazon.com

But I must say that, ultimately, the OP may simply have to
dial back his appetite and settle for more self-satisfaction.
Trying to manipulate or condition one's spouse into doing
more that what they are really up for can have LT adverse
effects on a marriage. ... BTDT.  =R=

She doesnt do much at all for herself. I try and get her to, but she
kinda seems like shes in a rut when it comes to getting out and doing
things with friends or family. And all of her close friends live out
of state so having a girls night out or something isnt real easy. But
its a great idea. I think I'll try and convince her to fly over and
visit her friends for a weekend or something. Now that you've
mentioned that, I think that's exactly what she needs...wether it
helps our situation or not.

One more question?? She refuses to let me see her naked anymore, (i.e.
after a shower or sleeping with her clothes off). And again, I think
she is just as beautiful if not more so than I did years ago. But no
matter how much I tell her that, it doesnt seem like she believes me
or agrees with me. How can I assure her that is the way I feel?

P.S. We have all of the Sex in the City DVD's. Once I picked up on the
difference they were making...I ran out and bought the whole set. lol.

Thanks a ton for all the good thoughts and ideas!! :-)

I recently purchased the book 'Passionate Marriage'.  I am only half way
through the book.  I am finding it very informative in giving me ideas
as to what is going on in my marriage.  Especially in regards to
intimacy and how it can affect your sex life.

I highly recommend it.

Yeah, it kind of is a big deal to get back in touch with who you are
outside the whole family thing.  Glad you are going to encourage her.
Even if she can take a couple hours away on the weekend is a good
thing.

I think it goes hand in hand.  The lack of feeling like a sexual being
and maybe not wanting to encourage you because she does not feel
sexy.

Couple things maybe you can do is when she comes out of the shower and
you are around, go up slowly and give her a kiss, but with no sexual
connotation.  So she knows you love her but that just being naked
doesn't mean you are going to ravish her (even if you might want
too:-).  Then she can get to feeling more comfortable being naked
around you again.

Another thing is, and this might feel funny, but once in awhile point
out a flaw or 2 on yourself.  Let her know you are progressing age-
wise as she is.  When I am feeling down about my body image, whether I
verbalize it or not, if my husband says, &quot;Dang, these jeans are
getting a bit tight!&quot; or &quot;Where the heck did the muscles in my calves
go?&quot;,  I feel more on the same level as him, you know?  (by the way,
you do not have to say something like, &quot;Do I look fat in these
pants?&quot;, lol)

&gt; &gt; One more question?? She refuses to let me see her naked anymore, (i.e.
&gt; &gt; after a shower or sleeping with her clothes off). And again, I think
&gt; &gt; she is just as beautiful if not more so than I did years ago. But no
&gt; &gt; matter how much I tell her that, it doesnt seem like she believes me
&gt; &gt; or agrees with me. How can I assure her that is the way I feel?

&gt; I think it goes hand in hand.  The lack of feeling like a sexual being
&gt; and maybe not wanting to encourage you because she does not feel
&gt; sexy.

&gt; Couple things maybe you can do is when she comes out of the shower and
&gt; you are around, go up slowly and give her a kiss, but with no sexual
&gt; connotation.  So she knows you love her but that just being naked
&gt; doesn't mean you are going to ravish her (even if you might want
&gt; too:-).  Then she can get to feeling more comfortable being naked
&gt; around you again.

&gt; Another thing is, and this might feel funny, but once in awhile point
&gt; out a flaw or 2 on yourself.  Let her know you are progressing age-
&gt; wise as she is.  When I am feeling down about my body image, whether I
&gt; verbalize it or not, if my husband says, &quot;Dang, these jeans are
&gt; getting a bit tight!&quot; or &quot;Where the heck did the muscles in my calves

&gt; you do not have to say something like, &quot;Do I look fat in these

&gt; &gt; P.S. We have all of the Sex in the City DVD's. Once I picked up on the

Good stuff....You are BRILLIANT, thanks for all the good tips. I will
definitly try those and let ya know how they work. Also, I hope I
didnt lead anybody to believe that I dont have imperfections of my
own. Because my middle aged pot belly and my head full of grey hair is
really hard to deny. So I have SEMI accepted that I am officially
middle aged and my pot belly is more than likely here to stay. I
frequently poke fun at myself for the sake of getting a good laugh out
of my wife or children.

Thanks again.

P.S. My wife just called me and told me to hurry home from work
because the kids are going out to diner with my sister. lol. Now I

Wait. I thought you said you were in your thirties. Why would your pot belly
be here to stay?  I suppose you could color your hair. But I like grey hair.
Mine has been showing grey since I was 18, so it is not like I even
associate it with age.

But really, you talk like your young life is over. I mean, if you dig the
idea of slipping early into middle age and all that entails, then that is
your business. There is a lot of nice to be said about it. But it does not
have to be that way.

Best of luck. I don't have anything to add on the original post subject
though!

Greying hair and pot belly, mmm, my favorite, lol.  Really- it is good

Whatever the case, as long as you both get close to what you want, it

You got a siren handy?  Pop it on top, set the siren and get yourself

Ever wonder whether that might be effecting her???  Because we marry
doesn't give us the right to grow physically lazy to the point of
growing out in all directions; add to that poor choice in clothes; and
BINGO BANGO - real turn off.  Middle aged is 50; not 30 something.

Vicki contributed some good thoughts.

Never saw much in the way of greying pot bellied 30 something men on
S&amp;TC; except for those they made lite of.  I think you both might need
some self-image rebuilding - to start with hit the gym and pull the
belly in; setting an example wouldn't hurt, especially when it comes to
your children;-)

Yes, poking fun at yourself is fun, depending on how you really feel
about your image...

&gt; I'm sure this topic has been covered numerous times but here goes.

&gt; My wife and I have been married for almost 14 years and we have 2
&gt; children, (5 &amp; 11) and we are both in our mid 30's. Our sex life has
&gt; never really been &quot;over active&quot;, probably about once every 8-10 days
&gt; in its prime. And as time goes on it get worse and worse. In the
&gt; neighborhood of once every 4-6 weeks now. We have talked about it ALOT
&gt; but never really accomplish anything. She gives a completely different
&gt; reason literally every time we discuss it. So that confuses my quite a
&gt; bit. I always tell her &quot;If you just dont enjoy it or want to do it,
&gt; then tell me that because I think I can deal with that&quot; But she always
&gt; says she enjoys it but its this or that or whatever. I have tried
&gt; numerous approaches. 1. At first I was angry so we argued about
&gt; it....which makes things worse. 2. Then I tried the sweet approach,
&gt; (i.e. saying or doing sweet things or making sweet gestures) but that
&gt; had little or no affect. 3. Then I tried the cold shoulder affect.
&gt; Again....nothing changed.

&gt; A little more insight....She never really has been one that seemed to
&gt; enjoy &quot;fooling&quot; around. It's VERY unusual to do anything other than
&gt; conventional sex via missionary style. And most of the time she wont
&gt; even get completely undressed? Again, were both in our mid 30's and
&gt; have a little more cushion in some areas than we used to if you know
&gt; what I mean, but I have assured her that she is the most beautiful
&gt; thing I have ever seen, and I really feel that way so hopefully she
&gt; believes me.

&gt; Just a little more insight and I swear I will wrap this up. lol. A few
&gt; years ago she got into the TV show &quot;Sex in the City&quot; and for a few
&gt; weeks while she was watching all the episodes on DVD, our sex life got
&gt; VERY, VERY active. More active than it had ever been. In fact it go so
&gt; active, that she purchased a sex toy and we experimented with it 2
&gt; times. It was great! But then I got sick and she started her period.
&gt; So it got put on hold temporarily.....so I thought. It never came back
&gt; like that again which to this day confuses me??

&gt; In summary, I just dont know what to do or if there's anything I can
&gt; do. I used to get mad and upset about it but now my feelings are just
&gt; really hurt. Does she just not love me in that way? Or am I doing
&gt; something wrong? I've told her if there's something I'm not doing
&gt; right or doing at all to please show me how she likes it. I want her
&gt; to enjoy it as much as I do. I love her very much and feel like we are
&gt; perfect for each other in every way except this one. So if anybody has
&gt; any ideas or thoughts, I would love to hear them.

&gt; Thanks for those of you who read this entire post. lol. Sorry for
&gt; being so long winded.

People are the way they are for reasons.  In the case of your wife,
a few reasons come to mind which might explain her unusually low
libido.

1. The various hormonal changes from pregnancy and motherhood have
stabilized at a &quot;low drive&quot; setting.

2. She has issues resulting from childhood:
- A difficult relationship with her father.
- Sexual abuse.
- Strong religious or parental programming against sexual enjoyment

3. She may have had little enjoyment of her previous sexual
experiences (with or without you).

4. She is having / has had an affair.

5. Her experience with pregnancy / childbirth / child-rearing have
left
her with negative associations (pain, fatigue, depression, etc) and
she is thus fearful of conceiving again.

Rather than try to sort these things out between you two, she might
be more responsive to a professional counselor.  However, I'm not
sure whether a psychologist, a marriage counselor, a physician or
a sex therapist would be the better choice.  Off hand, I would think
that a marriage counselor might be the best one to begin with, since
you and your marriage are adversely affected by this situation, and
may (or may not) be contributing to the problem.

Best of luck,
Larry G.

I just got this book from amazon--it arrived yesterday, along w/ another

Hey, except for a very few lucky few, most of us are the same as the hands
of Father Time move along.

I want to suggest a couple of things too. If you can swing it and can
arrange for someone to take the kids for a weekend, maybe you could get away
with your wife somewhere sort of romantic for 2 or 3 nights. It doesn't have
to be anything elaborate...maybe a cozy B&amp;B in the country, or a hotel in
the city...take in a show or 2 and a couple of nice dinners out. Getting
away from the kids and the house helps remind a couple that they do have a
whole separate life as a couple who love each other and should be romantic
together. It could help revitalize things that may carry over when you
return. On a similar note, a lot of marriage therapists recommend a couple
have a regular &quot;date night&quot; once a week, or every other week, at least. If
you can arrange child care, try to get out together as though you were
dating again. It need not be big budget. Maybe dinner and a movie...make it
a romantic or sexy movie, now that you've seen how she's responded to S&amp;tC.
A few years ago, my sister and her husband signed up for a ballroom dancing
class together at their local community center and she said they loved it
and found it very fun and romantic. Maybe you could find something like
that, or if you have other mutual interests that you might find a class for
it offered somewhere. It's something to think about.

While the weather is still nice, even just going for a stroll together in
the evening, or sitting out on the patio or in the yard together, looking at
the stars. You could try getting the kids to bed as early as possible one
night a week and rent a movie that might stimulate thoughts of romance. If
you help with after dinner clean up and getting the kids to bed, it will
increase your time together and put your wife in a happier mood, and maybe
an appreciative one. Things like that can make a big difference.

No need to feel like an ass. From the sound of it, you have a legitimate
problem. I've been where you are. My husband and I have been together over
20 years, and we've hit &quot;droughts&quot; several times. In our case, it was his
interest level that dropped off. Like you, we talked about it a million
times. w/ no improvement coming from that. And it *does* hurt, I know. I
felt hurt and rejected, even though he assured me many times he still loved
me and found me attractive. Eventually, he'd come out of it and things would
improve. But we hit enough &quot;droughts&quot; that it got pretty distressing. A
couple of years ago, he started a diet and exercise routine that helped him
take off weight and feel in better shape. Since then, his libido has been a
lot healthier. Even so, it may have been the accumulative effect of those
drought times that predisposed me to looking elsewhere for attention when
husband seemed preoccupied and emotionally distant this year. I'm refocused
on my marriage now, and husband knows someone else had my attention for a
while. Now he's working double time to give me TLC and is in the mood all
the time these days. I would hate to have it come down to that for your wife
to recognize you can't let your marriage go to weed.

Wow. A bunch of good ideas!! I dont know where to start now or which
ones to start with but I'm excited about getting started. I feel like
now after reading all this, that there are alot of these things that
my wife and I need to be doing regardless of our physical
relationship. They all seem like things that will build a much
stronger marriage and friendship which may make the physical part
happen automatically.

&gt;&gt; really hard to deny. So I have SEMI accepted that I am officially
&gt;&gt; middle aged and my pot belly is more than likely here to stay. I
&gt;&gt; frequently poke fun at myself for the sake of getting a good laugh out
&gt;&gt; of my wife or children.

&gt; Hey, except for a very few lucky few, most of us are the same as the hands
&gt; of Father Time move along.

That's defeatist nonsense. Yes we get older. There is *absolutely no reason*
we have to take getting larger laying down. Luck has little to do with it.

&lt;snip decent advice as far as I read&gt;

&gt; Wow. A bunch of good ideas!! I dont know where to start now or which
&gt; ones to start with but I'm excited about getting started. I feel like
&gt; now after reading all this, that there are alot of these things that
&gt; my wife and I need to be doing regardless of our physical
&gt; relationship. They all seem like things that will build a much
&gt; stronger marriage and friendship which may make the physical part
&gt; happen automatically.

That's the idea! I must say, I like your attitude. You seem to have a
positive outlook, which I think will take you far in turning things around.

I wish you well. To me, the physical side of the marriage relationship is
critical to the overall staying power and health of the marriage. I know how
unhappy it is when the needs of the partners are not sufficiently matched.
When couples have children and get saddled with the endless routines and
responsibilities of everyday life, it's too easy for the couple to lose
sight of why they got together in the first place...that there was love and
affection and desire there that drew them to one another and made them
decide to make a life together. It's important for a couple to nurture the
relationship in an ongoing way.

Good luck. I hope you try some of these things and that your wife responds
positively. You sound like a good guy and you deserve to be happy. Your wife
may not realize how lucky she is. Just read a few threads on this NG. There
are a *lot* of women out there who aren't nearly as lucky.
