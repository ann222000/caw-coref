NORDHAVN Rewrites Physics Textbooks

Well-known and well-respected motorboat manufacturer, NORDHAVN has
produced a new addition to their lineup, a 56-foot motorsailer called
the 56MS. On page 109 of SAIL magazine, October 2007 issue they have a
full-page advertisement touting how great it is.

Among other things, they claim to be able to create something from
nothing. The advert states, &quot;Even in dead air the apparent wind when
motorsailing generates lift and reduces the amount of engine power
needed to maintain the same speed the engine would produce on its own.&quot;
Huh? Tell me I ain't dreaming . . .

Now let me see if I got this straight. In dead air one assumes there is
no wind from any direction. Right? Therefore, any motion of the boat
produced by the motor in forward gear would result in an apparent wind
from dead ahead. Agreed? So, unless they've hired Old Thom Stewart, who
knows nothing about apparent wind, to write the ad script there's no way
they actually believe this nonsense that sails can be powered up by a
wind from directly ahead, is there? Seems to me the sails would just
luff and cause drag thus reducing the speed through the water produced
by the motor.

But, I guess when you're selling motorsailers you can count upon your
customers being quite stupid so perhaps some will fall for this ruse.

Yup, that's advertising BS. If there's no wind, there won't be a
benefit while motor-sailing or any other condition.

Still, most of the time when there's too little wind for sailing,
motor-sailing will benefit from quite a few wind inputs. If nothing
else, having a sail aloft will dampen the boat's side-to-side motion
much of the time.

There are many times on the Chesapeake when having a sail up doesn't
mean squat as even a couple of knot's wind speed won't affect anything
at all.

Well, perhaps the idea is that when sailing into a &quot;dead&quot; wind, the
sails be set horizontally, so that the lift generated by them is in
the direction which is traditionally associated with &quot;lift&quot;, i.e. &quot;up&quot;.
Like hydrofoils, these aerofoils would cause the hull to ride a fraction
of an inch higher in the water, reducing water resistance.

Alternatively, the idea might be to back the sails, which would generate
a sideways force on the boat, so that it actually travels with some
leeway.  If the leeway angle is big enough, and the drag from all this
doesn't slow down the forwards speed much, the effective speed will be
enhanced by the Pythagoras effect.  The helm must be instructed to steer
a few degrees off the intended destination, to compensate for this
beneficial leeway.

I don't have that rag and I looked at the Nordavn web site and they
don't make that claim there.  If, however, the claim was made as
Wilbur represents it then Wilbur is right and Nordhavn is wrong.  I'm
assuming that &quot;dead air&quot; means that the apparent wind is zero as seen
by an object floating freely on the ocean's surface.   Over here in
the Pacific the term for that condition is &quot;calm&quot;.  As far as I know,
&quot;dead air&quot; means that a broadcast radio station has gone silent.  I've
never heard it used as a meteorological term.  Maybe the ad guy meant
&quot;light air&quot;, in which case the claim is plausible.

There is some benefit.  Stability.  Though given a calm day, one can't
imagine much of a sea state :)

But certainly I'm sure all would agree that motoring in nasty weather
and rough sea, a wee bit of cloth up gives a much more even ride -
reduces that horrible rolling.

Their claims are true. I've seen large Nordhaven motorsailers go dead into a
strong wind and rise up out of the water from displacement mode onto a full
plane.

Wilbur seems to have it right this time.  Either the article is
misquoted, very badly written, or just plain wrong.

An apparent wind from dead ahead can add nothing but a force directly
astern.

The case where a true wind from ahead can be used to drive a windmill
that can drive a propeller to propel the vessel is different;  but this
requires a true wind.

BTW ice yachts cannot make 146mph *directly* upwind.

I didn't say they could, in fact close hauled at those speeds they are
usually sailing close to downwind, an apparent wind close to directly
ahead.

Nor in the case of the motorsailer will the apparent wind be from dead
ahead.

&gt; Care to explain why a windmill which is capable of powering itself

&gt; an arbitary stationary point.

&gt; As far as the windmill is concerned it has a 20kt headwind and
&gt; (alledgedly) it can take that energy, use some of it to hold itself
&gt; stationary against the wind and _still_ have surplus energy to drive
&gt; forwards. If it can do that you could gear it to the engine of the
&gt; 20kt powerboat and save petrol equivalent to the surplus power that is
&gt; left over once you subtract the energy required to overcome the
&gt; windmill's own drag from the total energy harnessed by the windmill.
">

MY recollection of this is that with a windmill it's simply not possible
to reduce the drag sufficiently to get a sufficient energy to make it
useful. Wingsails are much better at it or even even proeprly trimmed
sails.

ASCII news isn't the best medium to get the point across, but I'll try.

If one is motoring in a calm on a flat millpond then there is an
apparent wind equal to the speed of the boat from dead ahead. Hoist a
sail and you can make no use of that wind, agreed. However that only
applies if you maintain the same course. Now do what any sensible bloke
would do and adjust your course to make use of the wind as well as the
motor. You now have wind in your sails and you still have an apparent
wind. If you look at the force triangle there is still a component from
the apparent wind.

No doubt the craptain also doesn't beleive in back EMF or any of the
other phenomena which appear to produce &quot;something from nothing&quot; however
it's not the case that something is being produced from nothing and in
this case the extra energy is achieved at the usual expense of not being
able to sail directly into the apparent wind.

Ronald Raygun might be right, if the boat is designed in such a way to
take advantage of these effects. The actual effect proposed by NORDHAVN
will have to be known to know if Wilbur is entirely wrong, but we do
know that Wilbur is partly wrong because NORDHAVN doesn't claim any type
of perpetual motion, just that they can return *some* energy back to the
system to *lessen* the energy needed to propel the boat.

I thought we'd done this to death.

Don't think force, think energy.  Imagine the boat is still, the wind is
blowing over it, and the mill is connected to a winch to a fixed point.
There will be a level of gearing low enough somewhere, so that the
boat can wind itself forward against the winch.

As you increase the gearing, you will increase the amount of power
needed to drive the winch.  (not the torque, AKA force, but the POWER).

As you increase the speed of the winch with more gears you will need
more and more power.

Be careful when you crunch the numbers on this.  Drag from the mill is
proportional to the square of the apparent wind, power proportional to
its cube, and power to propel the boat proportional to boat speed times
drag.  If you forget hull and aerodyamic drag and transmission losses
you can fool yourself into thinking the boat *will* keep accelerating
forever.  Even so, if the true wind is zero you get no excess of power
whatever you do.

This is from an Excel spreadsheet.

Real Wind--&gt; 10
Boat    Apparent        req'd   Avail. Excess
speed   Wind    Drag    power   power   Power (%)
1       11      121     121     1331    1000%
2       12      144     288     1728    500%
3       13      169     507     2197    333%
4       14      196     784     2744    250%
5       15      225     1125    3375    200%
6       16      256     1536    4096    167%
7       17      289     2023    4913    143%
8       18      324     2592    5832    125%
9       19      361     3249    6859    111%
10      20      400     4000    8000    100%

100     110     12100   1210000 1331000 10%

If I reset the real wind to zero, all the excess power figures go to
zero - which implies zero losses in the system.

To make it easy for anyone else, the formulae on the &quot;9&quot; line of that read:
=A11+1
=A12+B$1
=B12*B12
=C12*A12
=C12*B12
=(E12-D12)/D12

&gt; MY recollection of this is that with a windmill it's simply not possible
&gt; to reduce the drag sufficiently to get a sufficient energy to make it
&gt; useful. Wingsails are much better at it or even even proeprly trimmed
&gt; sails.

&gt; ASCII news isn't the best medium to get the point across, but I'll try.

&gt; If one is motoring in a calm on a flat millpond then there is an
&gt; apparent wind equal to the speed of the boat from dead ahead. Hoist a
&gt; sail and you can make no use of that wind, agreed. However that only
&gt; applies if you maintain the same course. Now do what any sensible bloke
&gt; would do and adjust your course to make use of the wind as well as the
&gt; motor.

Doesn't the wind still appear to come from dead ahead? Or does your motion
cause the wind to blow?

You now have wind in your sails and you still have an apparent

&gt; wind. If you look at the force triangle there is still a component from

Back EMF actually works to negate the driving field to zero or to its

Yes, and the extra energy from back EMF is not usuable either because it is
cancelling the driven field. With logic like yours we are only steps away
from perpertual motion. Just think of all the extra energy generated by
friction - it's &quot;free energy&quot;, if only we can redirect it along the applied
force we would have all the energy problems solved. Perhaps if one runs or
drives in a zig-zag or back and forth motion we can trick friction into
going in our favor - just like you do with apparent wind in sails. You whole
argument and reasoning is just that - wind in sails.

How does the windmill know the wind is not true wind? It has no

Assume the windmill direct into wind concept works:

You can take your windmill cart, put it on another cart and tow it at
20kts. It sees 20kts and will move forwards along its cart. If you
stop the cart and blow 20kts at the windmill cart it will move
forwards at exactly the same speed.

In other words there is some spare energy left over to drive the cart
forwards after the energy required to hold the windmill in equilibrium
with the wind is expended. In my example above that spare energy is
used to drive the cart forwards but in your example of the windmill on
the foredeck that surplus energy can be used to save petrol.

&gt; I thought we'd done this to death.

&gt; Don't think force, think energy.  Imagine the boat is still, the wind is
&gt; blowing over it, and the mill is connected to a winch to a fixed point.
&gt; There will be a level of gearing low enough somewhere, so that the boat
&gt; can wind itself forward against the winch.

&gt; As you increase the gearing, you will increase the amount of power needed
&gt; to drive the winch.  (not the torque, AKA force, but the POWER).

&gt; As you increase the speed of the winch with more gears you will need more
&gt; and more power.

&gt; Be careful when you crunch the numbers on this.  Drag from the mill is
&gt; proportional to the square of the apparent wind, power proportional to its
&gt; cube, and power to propel the boat proportional to boat speed times drag.
&gt; If you forget hull and aerodyamic drag and transmission losses you can
&gt; fool yourself into thinking the boat *will* keep accelerating forever.
&gt; Even so, if the true wind is zero you get no excess of power whatever you
&gt; do.

&gt; This is from an Excel spreadsheet.

&gt; Real Wind--&gt; 10 Boat Apparent req'd Avail. Excess
&gt; speed Wind Drag power power Power (%)
&gt; 1 11 121 121 1331 1000%
&gt; 2 12 144 288 1728 500%
&gt; 3 13 169 507 2197 333%
&gt; 4 14 196 784 2744 250%
&gt; 5 15 225 1125 3375 200%
&gt; 6 16 256 1536 4096 167%
&gt; 7 17 289 2023 4913 143%

&gt; 100 110 12100 1210000 1331000 10%

&gt; If I reset the real wind to zero, all the excess power figures go to
&gt; zero - which implies zero losses in the system.

&gt; To make it easy for anyone else, the formulae on the &quot;9&quot; line of that
&gt; read:
&gt; =A11+1
&gt; =A12+B$1

I believe in entropy. The so called extra energy comes directly from
the thrust bearing of the engine, and it will drink more with a sail
developing lift. I don't necessarily say there is no benefit to having
a sail up. Lift means drag. The ratio, in an airplane, is equal to the
glide angle. The longer and skinnier the wing the better it will
glide. There is a name for that, aspect ratio. Generally low for
sails. My father had a gaff rigged schooner: now there is real low.

You can't find it that basic or you'd show the formula for energy

Yes, so you accept it has spare energy left over after it has overcome
the drag of the windmill. So the windmill on the foredeck of our power
boat has enough energy to push against the wind pushing back on it. It
also has enough energy left over after this to move it forwards.

Which means you can gear that spare energy to the engine and save some
petrol.

Yet you and I both accept you can't do that.

So there's a paradox.

It is essential that we assume that to be the case so you can explain
the paradox exposed by the windmill on powerboat example.

If in a headwind the windmill pushes back harder than it is pushed
then it must do that no matter how that headwind comes about. Which
leaves us with a power boat with a windmill on it's foredeck getting a
net gain in energy from wind that it is creating.

If the apparent wind, say, decreases *any* resistance by, say lifting
the boat a fraction, or changing the effective hull shape that is
hitting the water, then NORDHAVN's statement is technically correct.
There are other ways hull design can return energy to the sytem. Look at
hydrofoils.

NORDHAVN never claim that their design produces a net energy, just that
it returns some energy to the system, thus reducing the amount of energy
needed to propel the boat. This surely is physically possible. Many
designs, like hybrid cars, capture the energy of one engine for another
engine which then returns some of that energy. In the sailboat example,
this amount may be trivial, but their statement would still be
technically correct, if energy is returned.

That's where unimaginative folks go astray. If there's no wind and the
only wind is the apparent wind, in this case a wind from straight ahead,
you can turn the boat through 360 degrees and the wind will continue to
be directly on the bow. In other words the apparent wind, when there is
no other wind, is the sole function the speed and direction of the boat.
It will always come from dead ahead provided the vessel is moving
forward.

Poppycock! NORDHAVN's statement is fiction. Pure fiction! Had they said
light air instead of dead air they would have been correct on any point
of sail other than with the wind dead ahead but they didn't say that.
They said dead air which means NO WIND. No wind will always cause the
apparent wind to be from dead ahead when motoring ahead and this dead
ahead wind can't impart any forward force to the boat because it can
only shake the sails around and cause drag on the sails and rigging
which slows the boat.

If only these wankers could learn to draw a simple vector diagram. They
would soon see there are no other vectors than one from the rear (motor
power) and one from the front (apparent wind drag). Duh!

The vector from the rear will be longer than the one from the front. But
the one from the front will effectively shorten the vector from the
rear. The result is a slower forward speed than if the boat was powering
forward in a vacuum where there would be no vector from the forward
(from the apparent wind, at least.)

Only when there is some wind other than apparent wind can you add any
sort of sideways vector to the diagram. The advert is WRONG! It
demonstrates a common ignorance that many sailor harbour.

This is got to be one of the stupidest threads I have ever read.
Anyone who has ever been in a boat motoring directly into the wind
knows that the sail produces no forward force. I can only assume that
the individuals who argue otherwise have never been a boat under those
conditions.

In this one (and perhaps only) instance I must admit that I agree with
Willie.

BTW ice boats (yachts?) don't do 146 MPH directly down wind either.

And water vapor goes up to make clouds all without the help of scientists or
steam.

Gravity does not exist at the LaGrangian point.

Oil droplets could go up or down  under the control of Milliken.

If one accelerates toward the earth at the correct rate the gravitational
field disappears.

Photons do not change speed due to acceleration in the earth's gravitational
field. They change colour.

Electrons can exist in large, dense clusters without repelling each other.

A clock runs at two different rates for two observers travelling at
different speeds.

In spite of all these wonders there still ain't no such thing as a free

Yes it does. Gravity always exists. At a LaGrange point, the gravity

The advertisement never claimed to impart forward force going directly
into the wind. All they claimed was that they could somehow decrease the
load on the motor or increase the efficiency of the system. Even the
slightest lift on the hull could produce this, a heel to a more
effecient hull shape could also do it.

We can't tell if it's true with this boat because we don't really know
what they are talking about, but it seems very very possible, though
almost surely the effect will be trivial. So the advertisement is
probably true.

&gt; Poppycock! NORDHAVN's statement is fiction. Pure fiction! Had they said
&gt; light air instead of dead air they would have been correct on any point
&gt; of sail other than with the wind dead ahead but they didn't say that.
&gt; They said dead air which means NO WIND. No wind will always cause the
&gt; apparent wind to be from dead ahead when motoring ahead and this dead
&gt; ahead wind can't impart any forward force to the boat because it can
&gt; only shake the sails around and cause drag on the sails and rigging
&gt; which slows the boat.

Any chance they have some type of special rigging or innovative hull
shape to make what they are saying true? Ever seen what a dead air wind
dead ahead can do for an airplane?

I'm surprised that the fact that this (windmill boat sailing directly
upwind) is viable isn't intuitively obvious to more people. A sailboat
tacking upwind is an airscrew blade (the sail(s)) driving a waterscrew blade
(the keel), operating in their respective mediums. There is no inherent
difference between the back-and-forth motion of the conventional sailboat to
the rotary motion of the 'windmill' type boat.

Another mental experiment would be to think of a very wide catamaran with a
side-to-side track on which runs a car which holds the mast and sail above
and a centerboard sticking into the water below. Both are angled and a
mechanism in the 'car' causes both to change angle towards the center of the
catamaran when either end is reached. The 'car' effectively 'tacks' back and
forth on it's track while the catamaran moves straight ahead into the wind.

Intuitively it does seem obvious. As do all the best perpetual motion
machines. It's only when you think about it that the flaws become
apparent and you start to look around to look for the figures. ...and
there are none. The last time this came up we had a 300 post argument
