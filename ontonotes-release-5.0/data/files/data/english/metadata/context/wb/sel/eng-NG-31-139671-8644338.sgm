I have a level 70 hunter. I also have a level 70 priest. I don't have
a level 70 mage but I have some friends who do. I guess parts of this
treatise could apply to protection of other casters basides priests as
well.

There is something that escapes me here.

When I play my hunter in an instance I try like hell sometimes to help
protect the priest or mage. I'll send my pet after the mob that is
headed towards a caster and I'll use GROWL to stop that thing in its
tracks or turn it around. I'll hit it with a CONCUSSIVE SHOT.
Sometimes I'll hit INTIMIDATION. If I happen to be close by I'll give
it a little WING CLIP to slow it down and buy the caster some time.
There are occasions when I will lay down a FREEZE TRAP, dependant upon
whether one is already on the ground or if it looks like a viable
option.

Now why do I do that?

I have the utmost respect for these casters because they go into a
dungeon wearing nothing but cloth and they do not have the life that
the rest of us have. Granted they can pop up a bubble or mana shield
or some such, but they are really laying their life on the line when
they go in there.

I mean what's a frew seconds of lost DPS on a mob in order to keep a
better DPS mage going in full swing or keeping a priest alive so that
the tank can live longer and hold aggro longer while others DPS that
sucker he/she is on. With a quick &quot;select group mate&quot; and &quot;assist&quot; the
hunter is quickly back in the swing of things and delivering some
positive hurt upon the object in question, once the mob that is
licking its chops looking at the back side of a caster has been put to
rest. And a pet who was once called King Bang'lash can sure DASH back
into the main battle very quickly.

Even though the tank might try to pull the aggro off the caster I'll
still put my skills to use as needed and lend a hand.

Now about my priest.

I have not seen very many hunters who are willing to lend me a hand
should I become beset upon by denizens of the dark and gloomy places.
There have been a few times where I have gotten help from hunters. If
I notice a trap on the ground I will gladly head in that direction
with the hope of the mob that is chasing me should end up in a cake of
ice. Of course I have not seen that too many times.

I guess I'll just go on praying.

All you priests out there, please join me in a most humble prayer
session.

All you hunters out there, and I don't mean the ones here in agw,
because I know that people here either know how to play the game or
are on their way to knowing how, anyway, all the other hunters out
there, please take note of the priests that are praying and consider
the likelihood that they are praying that hunters will help them as
needed.

I mean after all, we don't want a maxim to get started, you know,
something like &quot;90% of the hunters in dungeons make the other half of
them look bad&quot;.

Protect your local priests.

And give hunters a good name.

Three cheers for the hunters who protect the priests and other
casters.

A month ago someone on this group asked what were signs of a good
player. One of my responses was something along the lines of, &quot;A good
player knows when to pull aggro from the healer even if it gets
themselves killed in the process&quot;

This post is a perfect example of that.

I loathe hunters who feign death, mages that go invisible, and rogues
that vanish from a dungeon fight when the going get tough costing the
healer his/her life and a chance to escape in the process. Now, if
everyone is already dead and you disapeer to avoid the repairs, so be
it, but if you have even the slightest chance to turn the tide of a
bad fight and keep someone capable of rezzing alive, do it.

This rule also applies when the rezzer is soulstoned. Many a time i
have asked people why they bailed out when the priest needed help and
they replied &quot;well they are soul stoned so they can just get back up&quot;.
Grrr.... Soul stone has a 30 min cooldown, if the healer uses it they
probably don't get another one for a while, better to save it. Hell a
good soul stone is one that is never used.

I cant count the number of times i spammed my high aggro spells then
switched into drain tank mode to keep the healer alive. Sometimes it
works out ok (tank comes along, taunts, im alive). Sometimes i get to
enjoy the rest of the fight licking the concrete floor of the dungeon.

I've play every class in the game till at least lvl30 and I have a love-hate
relationship with Hunters.  I love playing them (I've got a lvl53 HE
myself), but I hate working with them in high lvl dungeons.   I hate them in
dungeons because too many hunters use MultiShot and Volley at the worst
times.   I just sheeped or shackled a mob when some damn fool hunter throws
a careless arrow and breaks the sheep/shack.  Dumb.  Plus very few of them
are willing to stop kiting and help when I'm in trouble.  It's rare, but
when you find a really good dance partner, of any class, you keep them close
to heart, and in your friend list.  :)

I agree there :-)  I was in Deadmines with a really
wierd group.  I was level 27 warrior, the healer was
a level 25 paladin (the only person in the group who
could heal or rez).  The paladin pulled everything,
which made me very nervous.  Sure I was a bit too
high level but I can still get killed pretty quick
in there.  He'd run off, aggro 6 things, run back
so we could pull them off.  A few times he would
even bubble, so that those 6 would then run after
someone else (and not towards me, the tank).

Everytime I'd try to tell him to cool it, he'd say
&quot;these are easy&quot; (the goblins in the workshop).  Then
one time after warning him again he said &quot;it's ok,
I'm soulstoned&quot;, and then a couple minutes later he
died and used the soulstone.  5 minutes later, someone
left the group.  I wanted to get another member, and
he said &quot;that's too much effort, we can do this&quot;.
5 minutes later he was dead again, because he ran
up the ship collecting enemies while the rest of
us were still healing.  No soulstone left, no bubble,
no lay on hands.  Of course, the whole time he was
fighting with others saying &quot;I've got a level 70
main you noob&quot;.  (it's always the idiots that make
this claim defensively)

Yeah, I like to keep the healer alive, especially when
it's a character that's standing near the back where
it is easy to intervene (hunter, caster).  It's much
more difficult for the tank or melee dps to notice
that things are going wrong in the back row quickly.

A dead healer is a bad thing.  Even if the healer
isn't very good and is hated by everyone, it's
usually worth keeping them alive.

Having a priest character and knowing what it's like, I tend to watch
other priest's health when I'm playing my other characters. I'll stop
what I'm doing if I can and try to rescue the priest/healer. I've never
failed to get a thank you from the priest/healer.

Having a hunter's pet is probably the easiest way to do that. Send the
pet to battle whatever is attacking the healer. When it's finished, it's
back to helping you again. Way cool!

Way to many times I've had rogues (and ONE in particular that I
stoopidly put up with [we work in the same building]) VANISH on me and
leave me for mob fodder.

It gets old fast.

Oops! I almost got into a major VENTING session there. Good thing I have
a backspace key.

My main is a lvl 59 NE Rogue, combat spec'ed. I'm getting real popular
for instances in my guild because (for one thing) I've NEVER popped
smoke and left the others to die. I can think of only once that I ever
did that in an instance and all the others were already toast. (damn
dragons)....When we instance we are typically on skype or ventrilo and
if I hear a healer calling for help I typically leave the tank and
help the healer. Better to be a dead hero than a live louse.
I have a good friend who is a D Shammy and before we instance together
I crack her up every time by opening a trade and handing her ankh and
mana potions and I say &quot;you'll need these&quot;....

My Paladin's put together a &quot;starter healing set&quot;, consisting of
plate, leather, and cloth. Sometimes I team up with lower-level
friends as a healer. This allows me to practice healing, and allows
them to complete quests they might not be able to do on their own.

My Warrior friend I trust with my Paladin's life. He is an excellent
player, and gets monsters back pretty much immediately after they come
for me.

My Rogue friend . . . well, he is a teen, maybe even younger. During
play, he'll run off into the distance, then just stand there for a few
minutes. After a while, he'll message, &quot;Sorry, was on the phone&quot;, or,
&quot;Watching a movie&quot;. One time, in a cave, I suffered a 3-minute lag
spike where my Paladin was stuck with his hands in the air in mid-
heal. When it finished, I explained to the Rogue what happened. He
listened, then ran out of the cave. After a while, he came running
back and said, &quot;Oh, wait. You're squishy now, aren't you?&quot; Yeah,
squishy, stuck in a cave with respawning monsters, with a red latency
bar. Thanks for coming back.

I have a +Healing off-hander, so I remove my Paladin's shield. No Holy
Shield, Avenger's Shield, block. Priests are always in cloth. But for
my Paladin it feel very weird to go from 8K armor to cloth.

Easier said than done. The pet usually isn't autogrowling in
instances. If the healer has aggro, the pet might not get aggro very
quickly. Maybe a macro might work? Can anyone build a macro which does
the following things?
1) Sends the pet to the target
2) Turns on autogrowl
3) Casts Intimidation (3 sec stun, high aggro generation)

I can do it without macros.

Let's say Priest is 3rd portrait = F3 key
My assist key is &quot;W&quot;. (changed ferom &quot;A&quot; because I use &quot;A&quot; for
&quot;Attack&quot;
My &quot;G&quot; key is GROWL

So in this case I see mob heading for priest with the intention of
ganking.

Press quickly F3, W and G in that proper sequence.

Pet runs off to mob and does a GROWL. In the meantime...

My intimidation key is on extra action bat on left side, which I click
to set it off. Or I can press cntrl-9.

I either click the icon or press cntrl-9 and INTIMIDATION is next.

I have not set macros up yet, probably because I treat keystrokes liek
guitar riffs or keyboard riffs and my music playing days from the past
come into play and I reel off the desired set of keystrokes.

That may change in the future though.

First I want to continue developing good habits of gameplay during
specific situations.

What I want to do is be able to pop off a misdirection as well so that
the pet gets the misdirected aggro from my shots at that same time.

Now that I might need a macro for.

The other night I had to GROWL a mob off a priest and within a matter
of 3-4 seconds also GROWL one off a mage.

Someone broke the freeze trap and the sheep and all hell broke loose
during that fight.

Both casters were within a spec of dieing at the time. I felt good
about myself during that fight.
