That global warming that doesn't exist has apparently drawn in a few
marks, the U.S. Coast Guard is setting up a part time station to deal
with the cruise ships and the tankers that are already beginning to
ply Arctic waters. BTW does anyone know of such?

&quot;I'm not sure I'm qualified to talk about the scientific issues
related to global warming,&quot; the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Thad W.
Allen, said in an interview. &quot;All we know is we have an operating
environment we're responsible for, and it's changing.&quot;

As a side asset the lack of ice allows for bottom surveys that may
determine such useful information as the extent of the Continental
Shelf and the mineral assets beneath it.

New Coast Guard Task in Arctic's Warming Seas
By MATTHEW L. WALD and ANDREW C. REVKIN

WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 - For most of human history, the Arctic Ocean has
been an ice-locked frontier. But now, in one of the most concrete
signs of the effect of a warming climate on government operations, the
Coast Guard is planning its first operating base there as a way of
dealing with the cruise ships and the tankers that are already
beginning to ply Arctic waters.

With increasingly long seasons of open water in the region, the Coast
Guard has also begun discussions with the Russians about controlling
anticipated ship traffic through the Bering Strait, which until now
has been crossed mainly by ice-breaking research vessels and native
seal and walrus hunters.

The Coast Guard says its base, which would probably be near the United
States' northernmost town, Barrow, Alaska, on the North Slope coast,
would be seasonal and would initially have just a helicopter equipped
for cold-weather operations and several small boats.

But given continued warming, that small base, which could be in place
by next spring, would be expanded later to help speed responses to oil
spills from tankers that the Coast Guard believes could eventually
carry shipments from Scandinavia to Asia through the Bering Strait.
Such a long-hoped-for polar route would cut 5,000 miles or more from a
journey that would otherwise entail passage through the Panama Canal
or the Suez.

The Coast Guard is also concerned about being able to respond to
emergencies involving cruise ships, which are already starting to
operate in summers in parts of the Arctic Ocean.

And in yet a further kind of new activity abetted by warming seas,
Royal Dutch Shell is preparing for exploratory oil drilling off
Alaska's Arctic coast beginning next year.

&quot;I'm not sure I'm qualified to talk about the scientific issues
related to global warming,&quot; the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Thad W.
Allen, said in an interview. &quot;All we know is we have an operating
environment we're responsible for, and it's changing.&quot;

The commander of the Coast Guard's Alaska district, Rear Adm. Arthur
E. Brooks, said in a telephone interview that the expansion of open
water as summer sea ice pulls back means that &quot;almost everything the
U.S. does will be doable in the Arctic, we think.&quot;

A new survey by American oceanographers of the seafloor north of
Alaska, completed last month aboard the Coast Guard icebreaker Healy,
provides fresh evidence that the United States has much at stake in
the region. The sonar studies found hints that thousands of square
miles of additional seafloor could potentially be under American
control. That floor might yield important deposits of oil, gas or
minerals in coming decades, government studies have concluded.

So far did the sea ice pull back this summer that the expedition was
able to scan the bottom several hundred miles farther north than in
previous surveys, said the project's director, Larry Mayer, an
oceanographer at the University of New Hampshire. The team found long
sloping extensions 200 miles beyond previous estimates.

Though more surveys will be needed to firm up any American claim,
countries have a right to expand their control of seabed resources
well beyond the continental shelves bordering their coasts if they can
find such sloping extensions. That right is guaranteed by the United
Nations Law of the Sea treaty, which, after years of fights in
Congress, the United States appears poised to ratify. The treaty has
the support of President Bush, but ratification requires approval by
two-thirds of the Senate.

Senior State Department officials say the United States has to become
more involved in the region, and are urging other countries to
cooperate to encourage international trade through the Far North.

&quot;Having a safe, secure and reliable Arctic shipping regime is vital to
the proper development of Arctic resources, especially now given the
extent of Arctic ice retreat we witnessed this past summer,&quot; Assistant
Secretary of State Daniel S. Sullivan said Monday at an international
conference in Anchorage. &quot;We can have such a regime only through
cooperation, not competition, among Arctic nations. Denial of passage
through international waterways, even though they may be territorial
waters, and burdensome transit requirements will not benefit any
nation in the long run.&quot;

The change in Arctic sea and ice conditions has indeed been
remarkable, as one stark example demonstrates. The Coast Guard
recently produced a video commemorating the transit of the Northwest
Passage in the summer of 1957 by three cutters that became icebound,
forcing the crews to dynamite the ice to free themselves. Now open
water is the norm in summers along many Arctic coasts.

The resulting increase in Arctic activity will mean a greater need for
search and rescue capabilities and for environmental protection, Coast
Guard officials say. In fact, Admiral Allen says ship traffic could
turn the Bering Strait into a choke point like the Strait of
Gibraltar.

Environmentalists view the Coast Guard's interest with dismay about
what it suggests for the future of a fragile environment, but also
with some relief.

&quot;We should be taking a hard look as a nation at what do we need to do
to adequately protect the environment, faced with that kind of massive
change in risk,&quot; said Pamela A. Miller, the Arctic coordinator at the
Northern Alaska Environmental Center, in Fairbanks.

Mead Treadwell, an Anchorage businessman who is chairman of the Arctic
Research Commission, created by Congress to advise the government on
scientific and other issues in the region, said the Coast Guard's new
plans were only fair.

&quot;It is high time that our coastline in the north enjoyed the same
protections other states' coastal residents have from the Coast
Guard,&quot; he said. &quot;The Arctic may be warming, but there's no indication
that conditions at sea are getting any safer.&quot;

Jack, very few people are saying that global warming isn't happening
to some degree.  The disagreement stems from the Human caused vs.

Jack might want to examine what's currently going on in Britain.
Someone decided that requiring school students to view &quot;An
Inconvenient Truth&quot; was a good idea.  Someone else has now pointed out
that some of that 'truth' is, well, not in precise 1:1 accord with our
current reality and that it needs to be labeled as such if it's going
to be required in schools.

And they apparently give Nobel prizes for propaganda pieces these
days...

I seem to remember people saying that if it was 18 degrees in
Minnesota that global warming was a fraud. The Coast Guard is
recognizing a need whatever the cause.

It exists....most folks realize it's quite natural for our climate to warm
and cool
naturally....as is quite evident in the fossil record.
