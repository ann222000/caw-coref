During a week of mayhem in Iraq, in which terrorists have rightly been
condemned for targeting schoolchildren, it is sobering to recall that
this week is also the 62nd anniversary of a U.S. attack that
deliberately took the lives of thousands of children on their way to
school in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  As noted in
the Strategic Bombing Survey conducted at President Harry Truman’s
request, when the bomb hit Hiroshima on April 6, 1945, “nearly all the
school children ... were at work in the open,” to be exploded,
irradiated or incinerated in the perfect firestorm that the planners
back at the University of California-run Los Alamos lab had envisioned
for the bomb’s maximum psychological impact.

The terror plot worked all too well, as Hiroshima’s Mayor Tadatoshi
Akiba recalled this week: “That fateful summer, 8:15 a.m. The roar of a
B-29 breaks the morning calm.  A parachute opens in the blue sky.  Then
suddenly, a flash, an enormous blast—silence—hell on Earth.  The eyes of
young girls watching the parachute were melted.  Their faces became
giant charred blisters.  The skin of people seeking help dangled from
their fingernails. ... Others died when their eyeballs and internal
organs burst from their bodies—Hiroshima was a hell where those who
somehow survived envied the dead.”

Like most of the others killed by the two American bombs, neither the
children nor the adults had any role in Japan’s decision to go to war,
but they were picked as the target instead of an isolated but fortified
military base whose antiaircraft fire posed a higher risk.  The target
preferred by U.S. atomic scientists—a patch in the ocean or unpopulated
terrain—was rejected, because the effect of hundreds of thousands of
civilians dying would be all the more dramatic.

The victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were available soft targets, much
like the children playing in Iraq, suddenly caught in the crossfire of
battles waged beyond their control.  In “White Light/Black Rain,” a
devastating HBO documentary released this week, there is an interview
with the sole survivor of a Japanese elementary school of 620 students.
The murder of the other 619, and the 370,000 overall deaths attributed
to the bombings, 85 percent of which were civilian deaths, has never
compelled a widespread examination of the “end justifies the means”
morality of our own state-sanctioned acts of terror.  Indeed, the
horrifying footage taken by Japanese and American cameramen soon after
the devastation, and shown in the HBO film, was long kept secret by the
U.S. government for fear that an informed American public might question
this nation’s incipient nuclear arms race.

Just exactly what distinguishes the United States’ use of the ever-so-
cutely-named “Fat Man” and “Little Boy” atomic bombs on cities in Japan
from the car bombs of Baghdad or the planes that smashed into the World
Trade Center?  To even raise the question, as was found in one recent
university case, can be a career-ending move.

Of course, we had our justifications, as terrorists always do.  Truman
defended his decision to drop the atomic bombs on civilians over the
objection of leading atomic scientists on the grounds that it was a
necessary military action to save lives by forcing a quick Japanese
surrender.  He insisted on that imperative despite the objections of top
military figures, including Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who contended that
the war would end quickly without dropping the bomb.

The subsequent release of formerly secret documents makes a hash of
Truman’s rationalization. His White House was fully informed that the
Japanese were on the verge of collapse, and their surrender was made all
the more likely by the Soviets’ imminent entry into the fight.

At most, the Japanese were asking for the face-saving gesture of
retaining their emperor, and even that modest demand would likely have
been abandoned with the shift of massive numbers of Allied troops and
firepower from the battlefront of a defeated Germany to a confrontation
with its deeply wounded Asian ally.  Instead, the U.S. played midwife to
the birth of the nuclear monster, the ultimate terrorist weapon that
presents a continuing and growing threat to the survival of human life
on Earth.

This is a lesson to be pondered at a time when President Bush plays
power games with a nuclear-equipped Russia while coddling Pakistan, the
main proliferator of nuclear weapons to rogue regimes, and Congress
authorizes an expansion of the U.S. nuclear program to better fight the
war on terror by “improving” the ultimate weapon of terror, which the
U.S. alone stands guilty of using.

Were the civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki responsible for the
atrocities you list? Or does Ferguson believe in the principle of
collective punishment? Should all Christian fundamentalists be shot
because of what Timothy McVey did?

Typical of regressives, Ferguson suffers from simplistic thinking.
Either drop the nuclear bombs or millions of Americans would have to get
killed by invading Japan.  Oh, and we did the Japs a favor, because when
we had to invade we would have killed more of them then they killed of
us.

Never mind that Japan had no raw materials with which to continue waging
war. Never mind that a blockade would have forced their surrender
without an invasion. Never mind that they made overtures of surrender.
We had to drop the bomb because we are such a goddamned virtuous nation
and we always to the honorable thing. We all learned that in school.

Another characteristic of regressives, they can never imagine that they
might someday get the short end of the stick. No empathy. No remorse.
Just blind arrogance. What goes around, comes around.

Hiroshima was Japan's largest military town.  Hiroshima's military
districts held tens of thousands of soldiers (giving it the highest
soldier/civilian ratio of any Japanese city).  Hiroshima also held the
headquarters of the Japanese Second General Army, which was in charge
of repelling any invasion in the southern half of the Japanese home
islands (including Kyushu, where we were planning to invade next).

The second bomb was intended for Kokura Arsenal, a massive (4100' x
2000') arms-production complex.  The secondary target was the
Mitsubishi Shipyards, an even more massive warship construction
facility across the bay from Nagasaki.  Due to technical and weather
difficulties, the bomb ended up being dropped on Urakami, an
industrial zone north of Nagasaki.  There it destroyed the Mitsubishi
Steel Works and the Mitsubishi Torpedo Works.

Before Japan attacked us, Pearl Harbor had been regarded as immune to
air-dropped torpedoes because the water was so shallow the torpedoes
would hit the ocean floor and embed themselves in the mud.  This was
the only harbor in the world (outside Japan) that had such a natural
defense against air-dropped torpedoes.  In order to attack us, Japan
had to develop entirely new torpedo technology designed specifically
for Pearl Harbor.  The Mitsubishi Torpedo Works is the place that
designed and built those torpedoes.

There are no records of any military figures opposing the bombs before
they were used.

Ike claimed he voiced an objection to Stimson as part of idle
conversation over dinner, but there are major discrepancies between
Ike's story and the historical record, and there is reason to doubt it
happened as he claimed.

If it did happen, Stimson never had an opportunity to relay Ike's
views to Truman before the bombs were dropped; if he would have even
done so had he had a chance (it was idle dinner conversation, not a
serious policy conference).

Aside from Ike, no other military official claims to have made any
objection to the bombs before they were used.

Right.  The Serbs were bombed, their infrastructure destroyed, their

Technically true.  We used the word embargo because calling it a

However since we froze Japanese assets and forbade trade of oil and

HiroshimaFacts is sadly ignorant of the true facts:

&quot;Having broken the code Japan used for transmitting messages, the U.S.
was able to follow Japan's efforts to end the war as it intercepted the
messages between Foreign Minister Togo and Japan's Ambassador to Moscow
Sato. The messages were sent as the result of the June 22, 1945 Japanese
Cabinet meeting. The conditions under which Japan was willing to
surrender were not clearly spelled out in the messages, aside from a
willingness to give up territory occupied during the war and a repeated
rejection of &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;.

July 1945 - Japan's peace messages

Still, the messages from Togo to Sato, read by the U.S. at the time,
clearly indicated that Japan was seeking to end the war:

July 11: &quot;make clear to Russia... We have no intention of annexing or
taking possession of the areas which we have been occupying as a result
of the war; we hope to terminate the war&quot;.

July 12: &quot;it is His Majesty's heart's desire to see the swift
termination of the war&quot;.

July 13: &quot;I sent Ando, Director of the Bureau of Political Affairs to
communicate to the [Soviet] Ambassador that His Majesty desired to
dispatch Prince Konoye as special envoy, carrying with him the personal
letter of His Majesty stating the Imperial wish to end the war&quot; (for
above items, see: U.S. Dept. of State, Potsdam 1, pg. 873-879).

July 18: &quot;Negotiations... necessary... for soliciting Russia's good
offices in concluding the war and also in improving the basis for
negotiations with England and America.&quot; (Magic-Diplomatic Summary,
7/18/45, Records of the National Security Agency, Magic Files, RG 457,
Box 18, National Archives).

July 22: &quot;Special Envoy Konoye's mission will be in obedience to the
Imperial Will. He will request assistance in bringing about an end to
the war through the good offices of the Soviet Government.&quot; The July
21st communication from Togo also noted that a conference between the
Emperor's emissary, Prince Konoye, and the Soviet Union, was sought, in
preparation for contacting the U.S. and Great Britain (Magic-Diplomatic
Summary, 7/22/45, Records of the National Security Agency, Magic Files,
RG 457, Box 18, National Archives).

July 25: &quot;it is impossible to accept unconditional surrender under any
circumstances, but we should like to communicate to the other party
through appropriate channels that we have no objection to a peace based
on the Atlantic Charter.&quot; (U.S. Dept. of State, Potsdam 2, pg. 1260 -
1261).

July 26: Japan's Ambassador to Moscow, Sato, to the Soviet Acting
Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Lozovsky: &quot;The aim of the Japanese
Government with regard to Prince Konoye's mission is to enlist the good
offices of the Soviet Government in order to end the war.&quot; (Magic-
Diplomatic Summary, 7/26/45, Records of the National Security Agency,
Magic Files, RG 457, Box 18, National Archives).
President Truman knew of the messages' content, noting, for instance, in
his diary on July 18, &quot;Stalin had told P.M. [Prime Minister Churchill]
of telegram from Jap [sic] Emperor asking for peace&quot; (Robert Ferrell,
ed., Off the Record - the Private Papers of Harry S. Truman, pg. 53). In
passing up this possible opportunity for an earlier and less deadly
peace, Truman was not deliberately trying to prolong the war so the
atomic bomb could be used on Japan to intimidate the Soviets. Briefly
stated, it is likely that Truman believed the use of atomic bombs on
Japan was necessary primarily for the reasons he always gave: &quot;We have
used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives
of thousands and thousands of young Americans&quot; (Public Papers of the
Presidents, Harry S. Truman, 1945, pg. 212). (For the most thorough
exposition of the view that the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan
primarily for their effect on the Soviet Union, see Gar Alperovitz, The
Decision To Use the Atomic Bomb. Due to its many sources of
documentation, this book will be of interest whether one shares
Alperovitz' views or not). &quot;

We fought that war the way a war should be fought. We destroyed the
enemy. Both Berlin and Tokyo were left in ashes.

Then, our post war presidents, (Johnson and W. Bush) decided to have
&quot;presidential wars&quot; in my opinion, illegal since only the Congress has
the legal ability to declare war.

Both Vietnam and Iraq in my opinion are failures because in neither case
did we try to destroy the enemy.  We selected targets in Vietnam, not
the capital city, but jungles, and in Iraq Bush assumed when Sadham was
gone, the war was over. So, now if we want to win in Iraq, do we have
the fortitude to destroy Baghdad? I don't think so. So, it will be
another political war lost.

Personally, I think Truman made the only choice. Kill them until they
surrender.

Japan was looking for economic &quot;lebensraum&quot; since they could no longer
survive without becoming an industrial nation and lacked the raw
materials.  We had already become involved in stopping their goals when
we aided the Chinese.
************
&quot;When President Roosevelt signed the Lend-Lease Act on March 11, 1941,
it opened the way for China to purchase these 100 fighters with four
Lend-Lease loans totaling $150,000,000.&quot;

&quot;Permission for Chennault to form the Anerican Volunteer Group came the
following month when, over the objections of his military commanders,
President Roosevelt embraced the unorthodox idea of sending former U.S.
military pilots to defend China.&quot;
***********
So we had an open economic blockade and a semi-concealed military effort
against the Japanese before Pearl Harbor ever happened.

Your post is a good example of the problem of using WWII logic for later
conflicts. The Iraqi people are not our enemy. The last estimate I saw was
that we were fighting roughly 70,000 insurgents in a nation of 25 million
people. We have the power to make a smoldering ruin of Baghdad, killing both
friend and foe in the process. If we did this what would we gain? It not
only would not pacify the rest of the country, it would make the situation
worse. Suppose we destroy all of their cities. Iraq would become a lot
quieter as the survivers struggle to stay alive; but, the damage to our
interests would be incalcuable. We would create far more &quot;enemies&quot; than we
killed. It's probably the only solution to the problem that yeilds worse
results than &quot;cut and run&quot;.

For the most part Americans are intellectually lazy. We want our
conflicts to be like a sporting match: well defined good guys and bad guys,
a well defined goal, and a clear winner, In real life it's a lot more
complicated than that. For example, the Iraqi goverment recently signed an
agreement with Iran to build a oil piple line to Iran so they can send their
crude oil to Iranian refineries. Iran has been invited to submit a bid to
build a new refinery in Iraq. As they have been trying to explain to our
president, &quot;these people are our neighbors, we have to live with
them--eventually you're going home.&quot;

I think Korea was legal beause it was not an American War, it was a
United Nations War. Bosnia also.

That why I did not include H Bush because he also got an UN mandate so
technically, the American forces were not uder American command.
Admittedly, there is a fine line there, but no the less, legalities are
legalities.

Personally, I wish we had not needed to drop the bomb at all, but John
Tolands book &quot;The Rising Sun&quot; shows that the Japanese were not about to
surrender.  In fact, there was a palace coup to try to prevent the

Did that make it legal? I guess so if no one takes it to court. But the
constitution was made to prevent the executive branch from obtaining the
power of the monarchs of Europe. It seems to me that the executive
branch is 100 times stronger than it was in 1940.

++Civilians deaths in war are a stain on the process but almost, if
not totally, an regularly-occuring byproduct of the social insanity we
call war.

++Part of this civilian kill can be traced to the usage of modern
weaponry.  It's not like the old days when the Romans and the Huns,
all soldiers, would gather on a huge plain and hack one another to
death.  Probably 99.9% of all killed in those conflicts of hand-to-
hand combat were non-civilians.  Or when the British lined up on one
side of a farmer's field in 1860's Virginia and the Colonists soldiers
on the other and marched into one another firing and hacking away.

++Now, &quot;smart bombs,&quot; missiles, saturation bombing and all other sorts
of technologically-advanced weaponry seems to be able to destroy
anyone and anything in the area, including helpless and mostly
innocent civilians.  And to quote atrocities by the enemy in no way
justifies burning an innocent child alive.  You can dance around that
theory all day long and at dark you'll still be wrong (or a bastard
son of Barry Goldwater)!

++And to say that the people of an enemy support their government and
therefore are just as responsible to pay the price by their death is
somewhat shortsighted.  How would the Right-Wing Mob in this country
feel if they were vaporized in their own homes by enemy bombs because
of a war started and promoted by the Liberals with which they strongly
disagreed?  (Of course, they wouldn't &quot;feel&quot; too much if they were
vaporized).  In this country, they might be able to leave until the
war was over but most in other countries do not have that freedom and
therefore must remain at home as sitting ducks waiting to be burned
alive by 21st century weaponry.

++Wars will continue to be fought since the world gets along with one
another about the same as different RORT contributors do and body
count may continue to be a measure of success.  It's just too bad that
those who had nothing to do with starting the war, did not want to
have a war to begin with and do not voluntarily support a war continue
to have to pay the price for those wars with their own lives.  There's
simply something wrong with that picture and to trivialize it shows
one to be nothing more than the basest of creatures unworthy of any
and all respect due a member of the human race.

&quot;Hiroshima Facts&quot; obfuscates with:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Hiroshima was Japan's largest military town.  Hiroshima's military
&gt;districts held tens of thousands of soldiers (giving it the highest
&gt;soldier/civilian ratio of any Japanese city).  Hiroshima also held the
&gt;headquarters of the Japanese Second General Army, which was in charge
&gt;of repelling any invasion in the southern half of the Japanese home
&gt;islands (including Kyushu, where we were planning to invade next).
">

&quot;... Pearl Harbor was a military base. Hiroshima was a city, inhabited
by some three hundred thousand people, which contained military
elements. In any case, since the harbor was mined and the U.S. Navy and
Air Force were in control of the waters around Japan, whatever troops
were stationed in Hiroshima had been effectively neutralized.

On other occasions, Truman claimed that Hiroshima was bombed because it
was an industrial center. But, as noted in the U.S. Strategic Bombing
Survey, &quot;all major factories in Hiroshima were on the periphery of the
city – and escaped serious damage.&quot;90 The target was the center of the
city. That Truman realized the kind of victims the bombs consumed is
evident from his comment to his cabinet on August 10, explaining his
reluctance to drop a third bomb: &quot;The thought of wiping out another
100,000 people was too horrible,&quot; he said; he didn’t like the idea of
killing &quot;all those kids.&quot; Wiping out another one hundred thousand
people . . . all those kids.

Moreover, the notion that Hiroshima was a major military or industrial
center is implausible on the face of it. The city had remained untouched
through years of devastating air attacks on the Japanese home islands,
and never figured in Bomber Command’s list of the 33 primary targets.

Thus, the rationale for the atomic bombings has come to rest on a single
colossal fabrication, which has gained surprising currency: that they
were necessary in order to save a half-million or more American lives.
These, supposedly, are the lives that would have been lost in the
planned invasion of Kyushu in December, then in the all-out invasion of
Honshu the next year, if that was needed. But the worst-case scenario
for a full-scale invasion of the Japanese home islands was forty-six
thousand American lives lost. The ridiculously inflated figure of a half-
million for the potential death toll – nearly twice the total of U.S.
dead in all theaters in the Second World War – is now routinely repeated
in high-school and college textbooks and bandied about by ignorant
commentators. Unsurprisingly, the prize for sheer fatuousness on this
score goes to President George H.W. Bush, who claimed in 1991 that
dropping the bomb &quot;spared millions of American lives.&quot;

Still, Truman’s multiple deceptions and self-deceptions are
understandable, considering the horror he unleashed. It is equally
understandable that the U.S. occupation authorities censored reports
from the shattered cities and did not permit films and photographs of
the thousands of corpses and the frightfully mutilated survivors to
reach the public.95 Otherwise, Americans – and the rest of the world –
might have drawn disturbing comparisons to scenes then coming to light
from the Nazi concentration camps.

The bombings were condemned as barbaric and unnecessary by high American
military officers, including Eisenhower and MacArthur. The view of
Admiral William D. Leahy, Truman’s own chief of staff, was typical:

the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no
material assistance in our war against Japan. . . . My own feeling was
that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard
common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make wars
in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.

The political elite implicated in the atomic bombings feared a backlash
that would aid and abet the rebirth of horrid prewar &quot;isolationism.&quot;
Apologias were rushed into print, lest public disgust at the sickening
war crime result in erosion of enthusiasm for the globalist project.98
No need to worry. A sea-change had taken place in the attitudes of the
American people. Then and ever after, all surveys have shown that the
great majority supported Truman, believing that the bombs were required
to end the war and save hundreds of thousands of American lives, or more
likely, not really caring one way or the other. &quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;Having broken the code Japan used for transmitting messages, the U.S.
&gt; was able to follow Japan's efforts to end the war as it intercepted the
&gt; messages between Foreign Minister Togo and Japan's Ambassador to Moscow
&gt; Sato. The messages were sent as the result of the June 22, 1945 Japanese
&gt; Cabinet meeting. The conditions under which Japan was willing to
&gt; surrender were not clearly spelled out in the messages, aside from a
&gt; willingness to give up territory occupied during the war and a repeated
&gt; rejection of &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;.

&gt; July 1945 - Japan's peace messages

&gt; Still, the messages from Togo to Sato, read by the U.S. at the time,
&gt; clearly indicated that Japan was seeking to end the war:

&gt; July 11: &quot;make clear to Russia... We have no intention of annexing or
&gt; taking possession of the areas which we have been occupying as a result
&gt; of the war; we hope to terminate the war&quot;.

&gt; July 12: &quot;it is His Majesty's heart's desire to see the swift
&gt; termination of the war&quot;.

&gt; July 13: &quot;I sent Ando, Director of the Bureau of Political Affairs to
&gt; communicate to the [Soviet] Ambassador that His Majesty desired to
&gt; dispatch Prince Konoye as special envoy, carrying with him the personal
&gt; letter of His Majesty stating the Imperial wish to end the war&quot; (for
&gt; above items, see: U.S. Dept. of State, Potsdam 1, pg. 873-879).

&gt; July 18: &quot;Negotiations... necessary... for soliciting Russia's good
&gt; offices in concluding the war and also in improving the basis for
&gt; negotiations with England and America.&quot; (Magic-Diplomatic Summary,
&gt; 7/18/45, Records of the National Security Agency, Magic Files, RG 457,
&gt; Box 18, National Archives).

&gt; July 22: &quot;Special Envoy Konoye's mission will be in obedience to the
&gt; Imperial Will. He will request assistance in bringing about an end to
&gt; the war through the good offices of the Soviet Government.&quot; The July
&gt; 21st communication from Togo also noted that a conference between the
&gt; Emperor's emissary, Prince Konoye, and the Soviet Union, was sought, in
&gt; preparation for contacting the U.S. and Great Britain (Magic-Diplomatic
&gt; Summary, 7/22/45, Records of the National Security Agency, Magic Files,
&gt; RG 457, Box 18, National Archives).

&gt; July 25: &quot;it is impossible to accept unconditional surrender under any
&gt; circumstances, but we should like to communicate to the other party
&gt; through appropriate channels that we have no objection to a peace based
&gt; on the Atlantic Charter.&quot; (U.S. Dept. of State, Potsdam 2, pg. 1260 -
&gt; 1261).

&gt; July 26: Japan's Ambassador to Moscow, Sato, to the Soviet Acting
&gt; Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Lozovsky: &quot;The aim of the Japanese
&gt; Government with regard to Prince Konoye's mission is to enlist the good
&gt; offices of the Soviet Government in order to end the war.&quot; (Magic-
&gt; Diplomatic Summary, 7/26/45, Records of the National Security Agency,
&gt; Magic Files, RG 457, Box 18, National Archives).
&gt; President Truman knew of the messages' content, noting, for instance, in
&gt; his diary on July 18, &quot;Stalin had told P.M. [Prime Minister Churchill]
&gt; of telegram from Jap [sic] Emperor asking for peace&quot; (Robert Ferrell,
&gt; ed., Off the Record - the Private Papers of Harry S. Truman, pg. 53).
">

It might be noted that the exchanges between Togo and Sato
characterized &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; as something that would
*include* a &quot;guarantee for the Emperor&quot;.

So when Togo rejected unconditional surrender, he was rejecting
surrender even &quot;with a guarantee for the Emperor&quot;.

Our intelligence analysts concluded that Japan was probably angling
for something more like a ceasefire than a surrender.

Given the indications that Japan was angling for a ceasefire, there
was nothing in the messages that gave much hope that they were near
surrender.

The projections from the Joint Chiefs of Staff predicted that the
invasion of southern Kyushu followed by the Tokyo Plain would cost
1,200,000 American casualties (including 267,000 American fatalities).

These projections were made before Japan had made a massive buildup of
troops in southern Kyushu.  Projections that took this buildup into
account would be dramatically higher.

The War Department commissioned a study of what it would cost to
conquer 100% of Japan by force, and that study said it would cost
1,700,000 to 4,000,000 American casualties (including 400,000 to
800,000 American fatalities).

During the war, all Leahy had to say about the A-bombs was &quot;I'm an
expert in explosives and I say these things will never work&quot;.

After Hiroshima, MacArthur continued to push for an invasion as being
necessary to secure Japan's surrender.

Ike claims to have told Stimson the bombs weren't necessary, but this
was after the order to drop the bombs had already been given.  Stimson
didn't agree with Ike's assessment, and never had an opportunity to
pass Ike's views along to Truman (if he were even inclined to pass
them along) before Hiroshima was bombed.

Other military officials seemed to be quite supportive of the A-
bombs.  After Nagasaki was bombed, Generals LeMay, Spaatz, and
Twining, and Admiral Nimitz all pushed to have the third A-bomb
dropped on Tokyo.
