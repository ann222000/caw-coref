Hey Frank,
Took your advice and sanded down my Seagull's neck last night.  I used a
coarse sandpaper on a block to knock it down, then went with 600 grit by
hand.  What a huge difference in playability!

Before talking to you, I was planning on selling this to a close friend for
$100, because I just couldn't play it without pain in my fretting hand.
Well, last night I played from 8:30 until 2 a.m. pain free.  I fell back in
love with this guitar!

Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your great advice.  Now I
need to find a matching stain, anyone happen to know what color Seagull S6 +
Spruce comes with?

Thanks to you, Frank, and thanks to everyone else that commented.

If you've done the whole neck, it doesn't have to match the body, they
rarely do.

I've reshaped several of my guitars/basses necks, to an offset,
asymmetrical V, more curved on the bass side, and flattened on the
treble; I have very problematic wrists, these days...

After a coat or two of spray shellac, I've padded on waterbased
finish, kind of a 21st century French (&quot;Freedom?&quot;)
Polish.

I have a friend/repair customer. who has reshaped the necks of several
of his nylon string guitars, himself; I gather it's not uncommon for
them gutstringers, to do that.  This is Jack Gates, BTW, an incredible
player/composer--check him out on myspace.  Bay area folks, he's
playing at Cafe Trieste in Berkeley this Thursday--sadly, I have tix
for Ed Gerhard, at the Freight...

Jack is quite the true believer in the K&amp;K system, I've installed
several in his guitars; he's an endorser, now.

Hey, that's great to hear CR.  I was confident but advising someone to
chop away at their guitar is still a matter for breath-holding till it's
done.

For the sake of the discussion, in case others are following this, and my
own curiosity, several questions:

How much wood would a woodchuck...strike that, how much wood did you
remove?

How &quot;radical&quot; is the V shape?

What will (did?) you seal it with?  [TungOil, TruOil, Minwax, varnish,
anything goes, really - the final feel will be in the rubbing/buffing]

Where did you find yourself placing your thumb, and what were you playing?

Is there ANY difference in the sound of the instrument?

Finally, if I didn't make myself clear:  If you can't get a good match to
the color of the underbelly of a Seagull, something close might be
objectionably discernible and different.  If that's the case, or you
suspect it might be, I'd consider a nice golden &quot;highlight&quot; color as you
see in sunburst necks.  That way, it would be a clear &quot;statement&quot; and not
a &quot;patch.&quot;  Also, I'd sand the shaped area so that it symmetrically blends
into the headstock, heel, and anywhere else.  That way if it's stained
either a contrastingly different color or an attempt at a close match,
it'll still looked like an intentionally &quot;processed&quot; area, and not a
screw-up.

Again, I'm delighted to hear how it turned out.

I wouldn't say that the finished product has a definitive &quot;v&quot; shape, more of
a relaxed &quot;c&quot;, if that makes sense.  I took off a good bit, but the biggest
diffence seemed to come at the point where the fretboard meets the neck.
That area had a sharp, squared-off edge that seemed to hold my hand away in
an uncomfortable position.  Rounding that spot made the most difference in
comfort.  I had to be careful, but I was able to round it without sanding
the fretboard too much.

I have not yet finished the wood.  I played it that first night and will
play some more, to make sure that I have sanded enough away.  I did resand
some of the rought spots and reshape a little the next day with the 600
grit.  I think I have it where I want it now, but I'm going to play a few
more days to be sure. The headstock is mostly untouched, but where the
sanding area nears there, I sanded &quot;streaks&quot; instead of a straight line
edge.  I was thinking the same as you about blending.

Now about the finish.  At first I thought that it was a stain, but now I
have found that it is a semi-gloss lacquer finish.  It was most likely
sprayed on and looks more like a layer of paint.  It came off with the first
swipe, and I was down to bare silver leaf maple.  I liked what you(Frank)
had to say about finishing with stain and TruOil, but I'm not sure how well
the two materials would blend.  I need to do some research on lacquer
finishing.

As far as the sound changing goes, it was music to my ears to be playing
painfree, so I might be a little biased.  I'll let you know after I finish
the neck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hey Lance,
If it were a stain of any kind, wouldn't it have seeped into the wood?  The

Ron,

It sounds like colored lacquer.  Really crappy stuff.  As you noted, a
chip or scratch and you've got the bare maple shining through.

Any linseed oil based stain will be perfectly compatible with TruOil.

Lance's suggestion is a good one, both regarding the walnut, and if you
prefer a simple spray-can applied lacquer - as I said before the magic is
in the final buffing-out.

As long as you don't have too many bugs cemented by the spray, and the
runs and drips are not too stalactite-like you'll be fine.

I've finished 5 complete solid-body guitars with TruOil and the feel is
exquisite.  No denying, though, it's less protection on the neck than
lacquer.

Thanks for the details on what you did.

Frank

Several of you seem to like the K&amp;K Pure Western Mini. I've done a bit
of research, but haven't yet run across any actual sound samples. Do
any of you have any songs posted using the K&amp;K?

I haven't had need for a pickup in 30 years or so. I used a friend's
Bill Lawrence soundhole pickup and liked it. Now I've been invited to
jam with some friends and amplification is needed. In general, I've
not liked acoustic pickups in the past. Piezo pups leave me cold. I
haven't tried a transducer system. I recently bought a Lawrence like
the one I had used. I still like it better than most, but I fear that
clipping and unclipping will eventually wear on the soundhole. The K&amp;K
looks like a good solution. But how does it sound?

I don't but here is a great resource...

There are examples of many pickups including K&amp;K

Good source.... The thing to keep in mind, though, is that these are
direct recordings. If you plan on recording direct they're very
helpful but the way pickups sound through an amp or PA in a room is
very different. I've alwas thought it might be interesting to use a
decent reference mic and record the actual sound from the amp speaker,
comparing it to a recording of the same unamplified guitar.

Though it brings up lots of &quot;what if&quot;s.  Mic'ing the speaker will tell you
what it sounds like if your head is a foot away from the speaker (and with
the same response as the mic used).  I guess if all things remain the same
except for the guitar, you'd get a relative difference.  I still wonder just
how representative it would be of the sound that would be heard in a &quot;real
world&quot; venue though.

If it was thought through and done right, it would be one hell of a study...

3 styles of playing, 15 pickup/pickup combinations, 6 acoustic amps and 6
simple PAs, in 3 different rooms with say...  4 locations per room.  That'd
be 6480 samples...  per style.  (grin)  Pick your riff carefully, you're
going to be sick of it after you've done it a couple thousand times. (grin)

">

Others have given you the only references I know of. Having installed the K&amp;K
in three very different guitars (Martin 00-18V, Taylor 555, and Taylor T-5), I
can honestly say that no other acoustic pickup I've experienced sounds as true
to the guitar as the K&amp;K. I have yet to hear or use a PickUp The World, but
none of the other UST, AST, or contact pickups - Barcus Berry, Ovation,
Takamine, B-Band, Taylor ES, Fishman, LR Baggs, Shadow, etc., nor the
magnetics - DeArmond, Seymour Duncan, Lawrence, Dean Markley, Fishman, etc.,
sounds as true as the K&amp;K ...*and* ... it needs no preamp between the
transducer and the guitar amp or PA.

I've been fortunate enough to see David Wilcox at two theatre concerts (at the
Triple Door in Seattle) and one house concert (using a Rane/Haffler/Daedalus
PA). He has, on average, no fewer than three pickups in his guitars (UST,
magnetic, and mic), and often more, and even his Olsen sounds only &quot;reasonable&quot;
amplified. My little 00-18V through a Fishman Loudbox sounds better .... to my
ears. Obviously, this is only one man's opinion, but I won't consider using
anything else unless/until I hear something that drastically improves upon what
I've heard so far.

All of this presumes that *my* ears aren't broken! :-)

Try this, Steve: Buy a K&amp;K Pure Western Mini from Shoreline Music ($86.10 -
free shipping - Order online and it's in your hands in 3 or 4 days). Install it
using the recommended glue-in method, and if you don't like it, take it out and
post here. I'll get your snail mail address and send you a money order for
$86.10 ... $80 for the pickup and $6.10 for USPS shipping. You'd only be out a
maximum of $6.10 to try it out. Fair enough?

I'm having a pure western mini installed in my D-28S Martin by local luthier
John Thurston right now. Should be ready by friday. You can hear what the
Martin sounds like on my youtube video (below). I'll do something after the
Martin gets back here to show the difference.

That will be an interesting comparison, Ty.  I know that I have one in
my newest guitar and I very much like the sound.  However, I haven't
recorded with that guitar at all.

John finished the Martin early. (Wow. When was the last time you heard
someone say that about a luthier!?)

Played out last night with the newly installed Pure Western Mini.

Plugged directly into a Carvin system (errr).

The new strings were just beginning to mellow, so it was still a little
peaky.

I am VERY happy with the results, even with a flatpick.

I had a Gold+ before. (Clack, clack, clack)

I'll get around to plugging into my Vibrolux and/or Groove Tubes direct box
here at the studio and putting some sound files up somewhere.

I don't think it will replace my Schoeps in the studio, but the other pickers
last night said they thought is sounded a lot more like a mic than any pickup
they had heard.

Ty

&gt; &gt; recorded with that guitar at all.

&gt; &gt;     -Raf

&gt; John finished the Martin early. (Wow. When was the last time you heard
&gt; someone say that about a luthier!?)

&gt; Played out last night with the newly installed Pure Western Mini.

&gt; Plugged directly into a Carvin system (errr).

&gt; The new strings were just beginning to mellow, so it was still a little
&gt; peaky.

&gt; I am VERY happy with the results, even with a flatpick.

&gt; I had a Gold+ before. (Clack, clack, clack)

&gt; I'll get around to plugging into my Vibrolux and/or Groove Tubes direct box
&gt; here at the studio and putting some sound files up somewhere.

&gt; I don't think it will replace my Schoeps in the studio, but the other pickers
&gt; last night said they thought is sounded a lot more like a mic than any pickup
&gt; they had heard.
">

I'm am soonly to have Luke Wilson put one into the McCollum. I've been
playing swing trio gigs (old Epi Emperor, my McC, and a female vocalist)
running a Schoeps CMC6 w/MK4 cap into the Klein &amp; Hummel TRA100. That
sound is quite wonderful, but in some smaller rooms with a loud audience
it's touch and go to get my solos across. I'll use the K&amp;K into the Evil
Twin DI, and feed it along with the mic to the TRA100.

I was watching some old videos of Dan Hicks and crew at AWHQ in the
'70's, and Dan had an SM58 (!) mounted on a bracket right to his dread.
I'm sketching some ideas to try that with the Schoeps.

Thanks to you and others for this link. It appears that these tests
use the K&amp;K Trinity system. Is the Pure Western Mini much different
tonally? The soundfiles sound good enough that I'm ready to purchase.
This will be installed in a Larrivee OM-03, if that matters. The tests
appear to focus on dreads.

Thanks,

Steve

&gt;can honestly say that no other acoustic pickup I've experienced sounds as true
&gt;to the guitar as the K&amp;K. I have yet to hear or use a PickUp The World, but
&gt;none of the other UST, AST, or contact pickups - Barcus Berry, Ovation,
&gt;Takamine, B-Band, Taylor ES, Fishman, LR Baggs, Shadow, etc., nor the
&gt;magnetics - DeArmond, Seymour Duncan, Lawrence, Dean Markley, Fishman, etc.,
&gt;sounds as true as the K&amp;K ...*and* ... it needs no preamp between the
&gt;transducer and the guitar amp or PA.

&gt;I've been fortunate enough to see David Wilcox at two theatre concerts (at the
&gt;Triple Door in Seattle) and one house concert (using a Rane/Haffler/Daedalus
&gt;PA). He has, on average, no fewer than three pickups in his guitars (UST,
&gt;magnetic, and mic), and often more, and even his Olsen sounds only &quot;reasonable&quot;
&gt;amplified. My little 00-18V through a Fishman Loudbox sounds better .... to my
&gt;ears. Obviously, this is only one man's opinion, but I won't consider using
&gt;anything else unless/until I hear something that drastically improves upon what
&gt;I've heard so far.

&gt;All of this presumes that *my* ears aren't broken! :-)

&gt;Try this, Steve: Buy a K&amp;K Pure Western Mini from Shoreline Music ($86.10 -
&gt;free shipping - Order online and it's in your hands in 3 or 4 days). Install it
&gt;using the recommended glue-in method, and if you don't like it, take it out and
&gt;post here. I'll get your snail mail address and send you a money order for
&gt;$86.10 ... $80 for the pickup and $6.10 for USPS shipping. You'd only be out a

Smart-ass! Hey when are you coming to a BSA Open Mic Mr. Smarty?

OK I have two files up in my On Line Archive in a folder called
PureWesternMini. Download listen and discuss.

Both tracks recorded at the same time. If you listen to the PWM track you can
actually hear me talking way way back and being picked up by the PWM, so it
is somewhat microphonic.

No EQ, no nothin'. The Schoeps cmc641 was about 6-8 inches out and pointing
at the fingerboard between where the neck joins the body and the sound hole.
Not necessarily my &quot;perfect&quot; place, but damn close.

I was using a Groove Tubes Brick between the PWM and the line input of my
rig.

The new strings (three days old) had almost settled in. They were still very
slightly BRIGHT NEW STRING sounding.

When I played thursday night through the Carvin system (!), They were a bit
brighter. The Martin definitely sounded better that night than it EVER had
with the Gold+. Other pickers thought it sounded very good and very mic/pa
sounding instead of pickup/pa sounding.

I had it going into my Virbrolux amp in the studio Saturday and was able to
get feed back pretty easily when the guitar was close to the amp and the amp
was turned up. So if you play with BIG stage volume, you'll have to do
something about that. Plug the sound hole? Dunno.

Thaks to John Thurston for the quick turnaround and lowering the action on
the Martin. I think he said I'm at a 4.5/5.5 now and it feels very nice. No
buzzing that I've noticed other than those due to fingering faults. the
Martin has never been easier to play.

Ty Ford

They are very close, aren't they, Ty?  If anything, the K&amp;K seems to
pick up a little less of the percussive effect around 1:20, which
surprises me.

Thanks Ty,

That's what I've been waiting to hear. The Schoeps definitely sound
better but the K&amp;K is in the ballpark. I'm sure the Brick had a good
bit to do with the sound. Would my RNP work well in this case? I guess
I could just try it and see, hmm?

While we're at it, are there any other systems of similar quality I

I've been installing a LOT of these--and have them in my own guitars--
and there just ain't no downside.  It's simply amazing the they can
sound SO good, be so inexpensive, and no preamp, to boot.  Customers
regularly report that musicians and audience comment on how much
better the guitars sound.

Installation has become easier, since several of us installer types
have come up with installation jigs, lately; nylon string guitars are
still more of a chore, but they sound even MORE natural, than steel
string guitars.

Bay area folks--Jack Gates is playing NEXT Thursday at Caffe Trieste,
on San Pablo at Dwight, not last Thursday.
His guitars are K&amp;Ked, by yours truly.

The whole idea of the song circle is to bring something that isn't quite
baked yet in hopes of getting some input on how to get it done.

Not that you HAVE to abide by the suggestions. Get that smart-ass down there
and either show us how to get it done, or get some input on your own stuff. I
won't be there personally tonight. I have a video shoot. Maybe next time. Let
me know and I'll be there to hold your hand. :)

The song circle has been very helpful. I first played &quot;Existential Boogie&quot; as
a folk tune. Ken Gutberlet offered that that since I use the phrase
&quot;Existential Boogie&quot;, maybe it should have some boogie.

It came out as a country boogie tune with Ken on dobro and Ed Kaitz on
harmonica. I hadn't heard it in a while. This past weekend at Artscape, it
came up on our CD player at the booth while I was there. In re-listening, I
still like it. I think I/he must be onto something.

I've installed about 10 of the K&amp;K Pure Westerns, including an
UltraPure with an internal preamp, in all my guitars and for friends.
While the UltraPure works fine it uses an odd (IMO) system of magnets

I tried the UltraPure, and took it out; I prefer the passive tone.

I just removed a Baggs dual source system from a customer's guitar,
installed a passive Western Mini; he's MUCH happier, as are the people

Having read the K&amp;K stuff and seen the photos, the original Pure Western
looks very much like a Shadow triple with a replaced sensor for the
centre. I have three Shadow sensors which never produced enough volume
with the sticky tape. Maybe scraping off the brass surface and
superglueing would give them a lease of life in a spare guitar.

Hello Steve,

Songs, no, samples, yes. Up in my On Line Archive is a PureWesternMini folder
with a direct comparison to a Schoeps cmc641. I just put them up there this

&gt; Good source.... The thing to keep in mind, though, is that these are
&gt; direct recordings. If you plan on recording direct they're very
&gt; helpful but the way pickups sound through an amp or PA in a room is
&gt; very different. I've alwas thought it might be interesting to use a
&gt; decent reference mic and record the actual sound from the amp speaker,
&gt; comparing it to a recording of the same unamplified guitar.

Hi, just to chime in here. I considerred doing exactly that for a
while. The impetus for my tests came from people frequently asking
what what pickup they should use for recording, and that's what I
tried to capture. It's imperfect, but I tend to think a simple test
with known flaws is easier to deal with than a more complex case. Once
you go the extra step of trying to capture the live sound, it just got
too complicated for me. Different amps color the sound differently,
and different volumes, different rooms, also effect the sound. As
anyone that's done recording can attest, moving a mic a few inches can
change the sound. For that matter, two different players playing the
same setup will sound completely different.  As someone pointed out,
no one listens with their head a few inches from a speaker, and if I
record an amp from further back, you'd sort of know how that system
sounds in my room, in case you ever want to come over to my house and
play, but wouldn't tell you much about playing in your venue. So you'd
still have lots of questions and room for error. One thing you could
do is run my recordings into an amp to hear how they might sound thru
your amp, in your environment. Far from ideal, since you won't get the
interaction between the guitar and amp, but it's a thought that might
tell you something, maybe...  But I'm not sure anything replaces
trying it yourself.

I like to take the chance to say thanks for having made the recordings you
have.  Somewhere along the line you have to make command decisions in order
to make the study comprehensive but comprehendable.  I think you made good
decisions.

Ty,

Thanks for the samples. Exactly what I needed to hear. I saw your
previous post and saved the files for comparison. I appreciate that
you recorded both in a single pass, leaving the mics as the only
variable (other than the preamps).

The Martin sounds wonderful!  The Shoeps capture it beautifully. The
K&amp;K sounds very nice, but still lacks something. It is, however, the
best sound I've heard yet from an acoustic pickup. And this is for a
live application. For the price, I think I'll try it and see for
myself, upon recommendation from you and many others. But I still have
to ask, is there any other acoustic pickup system that can compete at
any price point? Just curious.

Thanks for the files, Ty.

Steve,

I dunno if anyone here has used these, but if you're interested in
higher-end pickups, take a look here:

http://www.rmcpickup.com/

and here:

http://www.tranceaudio.com/

I've read some good reviews about both of these brands, but I don't recall
having heard a guitar equipped with either of them, although something tells me
that David Wilcox has used the RMC .....

Well curiousity compels one to seek something better.

However, I'm not presently interested in multiplying the cost of my next
pickup by 3 or 5 to find out if the RMC and Trance units are better, and
I don't care for their need for active electronics within the guitar. I
like to keep it as simple as possible and I don't like to be dependent
on preamps from a pickup manufacturer. I have some very good pres and
DI's and I prefer to use them.

I do not expect any acoustic guitar pickup to sound as good as my best
mics just because pickups can't get at what happens in the air. I'm not
sure how much better than K&amp;K it can get.

Tomorrow morning Luke Wilson will put a K&amp;K in my McCollum. That'll help
get swing leads across in a few venues hereabouts. But I'm still working
on a bracket concept to mount a Schoeps right onto the guitar, looking
up from the lower large bout towards the bridge. I think such a combo,
K&amp;K plus really good mic, will satisfy me enough that I can stop
thinking about this crap and just play.

What you said.

The RNC and Trance units are pretty pricey, and I don't think I want
to install an internal preamp. Still, it would be interesting to hear
them. I find it odd that PU makers don't post samples on their
websites. Surely that would help them sell their stuff.

Then I expect I will be too. I just ordered the K&amp;K PWM from Shoreline
