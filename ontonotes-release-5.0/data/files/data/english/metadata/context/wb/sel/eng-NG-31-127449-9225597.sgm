Nice capture. I wonder, is Mt. St. Helens taking on some iconic
qualities, like Mount Fuji in Japan? Any idea if there's a community of
MSH watchers out there? What are they looking for?

I look at it several times a day, and it is quite striking it its own
right, as well as a reminder of the eruption. I have a vial of ash
from that, sent to me by a friend who has since passed away, but lived
in Seattle at the time.

In fact, I like to look at volcano cams all over the place.

Some of the links my be dead, as often due to camera problems as with

This one is nice, though not quite a volcano.

The rule of thumb in Seattle, WA is:  If you can see Mt. Ranier from
the top of the space needle, it's going to rain.  If you can't see Mt.
Ranier from the top of the space needle, it's already raining.

Cause Mt. Rainier hasn't gone kabloooie in recent memory.

Kabloooie on camera is a good thing.

More Kabloooie, or even blango on camera or even possibly
Kazambolonipowabungflabadapweengohunkahunkaburninluvbrrrzap is even
better, camera or not.

It's a cone geyser - a hot spring that erupts periodically. I can't
find anything that calls it a volcano, no matter how active the
Yellowstone Caldera is.

Volcanos do not move, as such, but the magma beneath them can,
creating a new volcano.

I am sure Charles knows more than I about the topic.

The Yellowstone Caldera Chain represents a series of
centers of volcanic activity, all caused by the same
mantle plume. The mantle plume does not move, but the
North American continent is moving generally westward
relative to the plume because of plate tectonics, so
the expression of the mantle plume on the North American
Plate appears to move as the plate moves over it. Another
example of exactly the same phenomenon is the chain of
Hawaiian Islands, with the active volcanos always being
on the easternmost end of the chain as the Pacific Plate
moves generally westward over another mantle plume.

Strictly speaking, the magma is not moving laterally.
The mantle plume, while very hot, is essentially solid,
although plastic. The top of the mantle plume is still some
distance from the surface of the earth, and the pressure
of the overlying rock keeps it from melting. [For rock,
the higher the pressure, the higher the temperature
required for melting to occur]. However, the mantle plume
heats the portions of the Lithosphere [the rigid outer
part of the earth which forms the moving plates] directly
above it, and the rocks of the lithosphere have a lower
melting point than the rocks of the mantle plume. Thus
a portion of the lithosphere in contact with the top of
the mantle plume melts and forms magma, which then
forces its way upward [at least partly because melted rock
is less dense than solid rock of the same composition],
and causes volcanic action. As time goes on, the lithospheric
plate continues to move, relative to the mantle plume,
and a different part of the lithosphere now sits on top
of the mantle plume, and a new batch of magma forms. In
the case of the Yellowstone calderas and the Hawaiian
Island chain, each new batch of magma is to the East of
the previous batch, and thus the magma appears to move.

OK. Different problem.
When magma formed at the bottom of the lithospheric plate
migrates upward to eventually erupt as a volcano, it also
pushes up the ground above it as it nears the surface. When
it is basaltic lava [as is most common in the Hawaiian Islands,
for instance], it is relatively fluid [as compared to the
lavas associated with Mt. St. Helens, for example]. The
ground being pushed up by the rising magma tends to develop
lateral fractures or fissures, radiating in all directions
from the central upraised area. Initial eruptions tend to
come from the middle of the central raised area, but
eventually a portion of the relatively fluid basaltic
magma will migrate laterally along one of these fissures,
creating a flank eruption, some distance from the central
eruptive site. This flank eruption drains magma from under
the central raised area, which now lacks proper support,
and collapses, forming a caldera.

of up to 70 km over a rift zone (I assume through such fissures as you

I understand what you are saying, I just thought I would be a pain and
point out that with most of the Earth rotating every 24 hours, the
inner core rotating just a skosh faster than that, and the crust moving
relative to the mantle on top of that, it is a bit problematic to say
that anything geological &quot;doesn't move&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Yellowstone Caldera Chain represents a series of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mantle plume. The mantle plume does not move, but the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plate appears to move as the plate moves over it. Another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example of exactly the same phenomenon is the chain of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hawaiian Islands, with the active volcanos always being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the easternmost end of the chain as the Pacific Plate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moves generally westward over another mantle plume.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you, Charles.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How much lateral movement can there be with magma, though?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Strictly speaking, the magma is not moving laterally.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The mantle plume, while very hot, is essentially solid,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; although plastic. The top of the mantle plume is still some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distance from the surface of the earth, and the pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the overlying rock keeps it from melting. [For rock,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the higher the pressure, the higher the temperature
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; required for melting to occur]. However, the mantle plume
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heats the portions of the Lithosphere [the rigid outer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part of the earth which forms the moving plates] directly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; above it, and the rocks of the lithosphere have a lower
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; melting point than the rocks of the mantle plume. Thus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a portion of the lithosphere in contact with the top of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the mantle plume melts and forms magma, which then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forces its way upward [at least partly because melted rock
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is less dense than solid rock of the same composition],
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and causes volcanic action. As time goes on, the lithospheric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plate continues to move, relative to the mantle plume,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a different part of the lithosphere now sits on top
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the mantle plume, and a new batch of magma forms. In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the case of the Yellowstone calderas and the Hawaiian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Island chain, each new batch of magma is to the East of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the previous batch, and thus the magma appears to move.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now I am confused even more (although I fully understand what you are
&gt;&gt;&gt; saying above), because I have seen articles that mention lateral magma
&gt;&gt;&gt; flow that can collapse a caldera.
&gt;&gt; OK. Different problem.
&gt;&gt; When magma formed at the bottom of the lithospheric plate
&gt;&gt; migrates upward to eventually erupt as a volcano, it also
&gt;&gt; pushes up the ground above it as it nears the surface. When
&gt;&gt; it is basaltic lava [as is most common in the Hawaiian Islands,
&gt;&gt; for instance], it is relatively fluid [as compared to the
&gt;&gt; lavas associated with Mt. St. Helens, for example]. The
&gt;&gt; ground being pushed up by the rising magma tends to develop
&gt;&gt; lateral fractures or fissures, radiating in all directions
&gt;&gt;from the central upraised area. Initial eruptions tend to
&gt;&gt; come from the middle of the central raised area, but
&gt;&gt; eventually a portion of the relatively fluid basaltic
&gt;&gt; magma will migrate laterally along one of these fissures,
&gt;&gt; creating a flank eruption, some distance from the central
&gt;&gt; eruptive site. This flank eruption drains magma from under
&gt;&gt; the central raised area, which now lacks proper support,
&gt;&gt; and collapses, forming a caldera.

&gt; Got it.

&gt; One more question....I have seen a link that mentions lateral movement
&gt; of up to 70 km over a rift zone (I assume through such fissures as you
&gt; mention).  Rare?
">

East rift zone of Kilauea. Not common elsewhere. See:

http://www.springerlink.com/content/b113t47274n85816/

Helped out by the fact that Kilauea is slowly [8 cm/yr]
moving westward relative to the mantle plume which
formed it, so that eventually a new volcano will form
to the east of Kilauea.

Much as I truly loved teaching, 40 years worth, I was/am
totally burned out on grading exams. One of the real
beauties of being retired but emeritus is that I can
still go in and give a lecture if I want to, but I will
never again in my life have to grade an exam. Much easier
just to give a talk to the rotary or to the boy scouts or
in conjunction with earth day, answer a few questions,
then pack up and go home. So anyway, if there is a final
exam I won't be giving it.
