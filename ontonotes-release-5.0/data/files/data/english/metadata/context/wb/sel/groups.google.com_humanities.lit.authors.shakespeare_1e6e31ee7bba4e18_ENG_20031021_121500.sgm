So far my report on the Warwickshire accent of the
Stratford tradesman is stalled by the fact that nothing
has been written on it in over a hundred years.

I searched Worldcat's 30,000,000 records and other
indexes and the only thing written on Warwickshire
dialect are three books printed between 1880 and
1900 by James Appleton Morgan, President of the
Shakespeare Society of New York who was also a
member of the Baconian Society.

So after looking for a week, this is about all I can find
on the Immortal Pest's Warwickshire dialect which tells
me that the Pest's Warwickshire dialect is a dirty little
secret kept hidden the way these things are when nobody
wants to be the first to puncture the paradigm.

This is from the Half-Sisters, an 1842 British novel by
Geraldine Jewsbury who wrote in the style of the Brontes
and either was or was not the lesbian lover of Thomas Carlyle's
wife Jane. Are you ready for this?

Bianca, who had great difficulty in comprehending the
strong Warwickshire dialect, signified she would be glad
to stay there, and, at the direction of the guard, paid
the first week's rent in advance; on which the woman
began to have a better opinion of the speculation, asked
her to sit by her fire down stairs, and inquired what
she would like to eat.

OK, not quite in the style of the Brontes but we can at
least detect that a novelist from Manchester, which dialect
is not all that mellifluous even today, thought the
Warwickshire dialect so 'strong' that a young girl of good
breeding named Bianca, had 'great difficulty comprehending
it.'

An interesting posting,
and I found a page on the web at

worth a look...I wouldn't take it all as exclusive,
though, since &quot;learn&quot; meaning &quot;teach&quot;, is not only Warwickshire,
and &quot;die&quot; pronounced &quot;dee&quot; is for example Scottish.

I think the Stratford actor spoke something
between the Brummie and Worchestershire
dialects, something Americans would need
a translator to understand.

Thanks for the link.

Oh, no -- Elizabeth has ferreted out the Stratford Trust's worldwide
conspiracy to suppress ALL information about Warwickshire speech!

Certainly those are the two possibilities -- mutually exclusive and
exhaustive. Elizabeth is invariably a fountainhead of information.

Elizabeth's fond faith that speech grows monotonically more
mellifluous as time elapses is so touchingly na√Øve that one scarcely
dare question it.

Remarkable! In the absence of any evidence -- all destroyed by the
Trust, no doubt (I still wonder what they did with all those poor
Warwickshire residents who had to be forcibly relocated lest some
traveler discover that the shire's inhabitants still speak Old English)
-- Elizabeth now resorts to &quot;arguing&quot; for her delusions by citing A WORK
OF FICTION!

Can anyone recall Elizabeth ever being as funny as she has been
recently? Just when I think that she cannot possibly outdo her latest
comic contribution, she surpasses even herself! I don't know how she
can possibly keep this up -- Elizabeth's missing streak must surely be a
statistical anomaly rarer even than Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak!

Excuse my ignorance (as usual), but why dost thou speak of Elizabeth
in the third person? Is she some kind of prop you use to display your
erudition to others? Whether you agree with her or not, and it is my
observation that you do not tend to, surely she is a human being worth
the minimal effort of being spoken to directly.

Best wishes,
Lynne
