And you thought the recent spate of contaminated fruits and vegetables in
the USA was bad?

Or the recent radio threat by an illegal alien leader in California that
illegal alien employees of Marie Callendar's restaurants were going to
poison the food of pro-border-enforcement U.S. citizen diners? (see:
"Enrique Morones Warns Illegal Aliens Will Poison Food At Marie Calendars"
@ http://www.immigrationwatchdog.com/?p=3145 )

THERE WAS A DAMN GOOD REASON WHY EVERY ONE OF THE LEGAL, FOREIGN
EMIGRANTS WHO PASSED THROUGH ELLIS ISLAND WERE CHECKED FOR CONTAGIOUS
DISEASES BEFORE BEING GRANTED ADMISSION TO THE US MAINLAND!

During Europe's 1,000-year "Dark Ages", which began after once-proud and
stable Rome was overrun and conquered by the *undocumented workers* of the
day, deadly contagious diseases regularly swept the land; the Black Death,
or Bubonic Plague, itself is estimated to have killed about half the
population of Europe.

But it could never happen HERE, right?

Lethal type of dengue fever hits Mexico

By Mark Stevenson
The Associated Press
4/1/07

Excerpts:

Even classic dengue — known as "bonebreak fever" — can cause severe
flulike symptoms, excruciating joint pain, high fever, nausea and rashes.

"More alarming is that a deadly hemorrhagic form of the disease, which
adds internal and external bleeding to the symptoms — is becoming more
common ...

"The CDC says there's no drug to treat hemorrhagic dengue ..."

"Mexico's Public Health Department has sent hundreds of workers to the
resorts of Puerto Vallarta, Cancún and Acapulco to try to avert outbreaks
ahead of the Easter week vacation.

"The Canadian Embassy in Mexico City issued an alert about dengue after
five Canadians were sickened in Puerto Vallarta this year. Acapulco, a city
of 700,000, has documented 549 cases of classic and hemorrhagic dengue in
the first two months of 2007, up from 86 in the same period last year.

"In January and February, Mexico's dry season, there were 1,589 cases of
both types of dengue nationwide, up 380 percent from the same period in
2006, Kuri said. And last year was also bad for dengue: Mexico documented
27,000 infections overall — including 4,477 hemorrhagic cases and 20 deaths
— compared with 1,781 cases overall in 2001.

"Dengue has been found along the U.S.-Mexico border, where 151 classic
and 46 hemorrhagic cases were recorded last year in the Gulf state of
Tamaulipas, south of Texas ...

Excerpt:

"Other health threats from illegals include, according to the report:

Chagas disease, also called American trypanosomiasis or "kissing bug
disease," is transmitted by the reduviid bug, which prefers to bite the
lips and face. The protozoan parasite that it carries, Trypanosoma cruzi,
infects 18 million people annually in Latin America and causes 50,000
deaths. The disease also infiltrates America's blood supply. Chagas affects
blood transfusions and transplanted organs. No cure exists. Hundreds of
blood recipients may be silently infected.

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, was so rare in America that in 40
years only 900 people were afflicted. Suddenly, in the past three years
America has more than 7,000 cases of leprosy. Leprosy now is endemic to
northeastern states because illegal aliens and other immigrants brought
leprosy from India, Brazil, the Caribbean and Mexico.

Dengue fever is exceptionally rare in America, though common in Ecuador,
Peru, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Mexico. Recently,
according to the report, there was a virulent outbreak of dengue fever in
Webb County, Texas, which borders Mexico. Though dengue is usually not a
fatal disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever routinely kills.

Polio was eradicated from America, but now reappears in illegal immigrants
as do intestinal parasites, says the report.

Malaria was obliterated, but now is re-emerging in Texas.

The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons report includes a strong
prescription for protecting the health of Americans:

Closing America's borders with fences, high-tech security devices and
troops.

Rescinding the U.S. citizenship of "anchor babies."

Punishing the aiding and abetting of illegal aliens as a crime.

An end to amnesty programs.

“How Eisenhower solved illegal border crossings from Mexico”
By John Dillin
http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0706/p09s01-coop.html

Excerpt:

“General Eisenhower ... quoted a report in The New York Times,
highlighting one paragraph that said: ‘The rise in illegal border-crossing
by Mexican 'wetbacks' to a current rate of more than
1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation
in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters
of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal
Government ..."

“Herbert Brownell Jr., Eisenhower's first attorney general, said the
president had a sense of urgency about illegal immigration when he took
office.

“America ‘was faced with a breakdown in law enforcement on a very large
scale,’ Mr. Brownell said. ‘When I say large scale, I mean hundreds of
thousands were coming in from Mexico [every year] without restraint.’"

Just two of MANY American cops murdered by illegals:

"Unfortunately, the majority of illegal aliens who are here are engaged in
criminal activity. Identity theft, use of fraudulent Social Security
numbers and green cards, tax evasion, driving without licenses represent
some of the crimes that are engaged in by the majority of illegal aliens on
a daily basis merely to maintain and hide their illegal status. In
addition, violent crime and drug distribution and possession is also
prevalent among illegal aliens. Over 25% of today's federal prison
population are illegal aliens. In some areas of the country, 12% of
felonies, 25% of burglaries and 34% of thefts are committed by illegal
aliens."

-- Testimony of District Attorney John M. Morganelli before the House
Subcommittee on Immigration, Border, Security and Claims [Note: 99% of
warrants for murder in Los Angeles, California -- the USA's 2nd
most-populous city -- are for illegal aliens]

"It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate,
tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of
men."
-- Samuel Adams

"“All great truths begin as heresies.”

-- Former Democrat Governor of Colorado Richard Lamm, official of
Defend Colorado Now, a movement opposed to illegal immigration
and public services for illegal aliens
