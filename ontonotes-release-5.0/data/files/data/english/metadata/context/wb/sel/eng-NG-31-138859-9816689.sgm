*STRETCH MARKS*

Pregnancy is one of two causes of stretch marks. The other is weight gain.
&quot;Stretch marks occur on the breasts, hips and stomach during pregnancy, plus
other areas such as the thighs when you gain weight,&quot; says Margaret A.
Weiss, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions in Baltimore. They're triggered when skin is stretched to the
max, which occurs when growth is so rapid that your skin's elastic fibers
break. And though it occurs less often, stretch marks can also be caused by
some hormonal problems, certain diseases and medications, says Dr. Weiss.

*Stretch Marks* are slightly depressed linear marks with varying length and
breadth found in pregnancy. They are predominantly found in the abdominal
wall below the umbilicus, sometimes over the thighs and the breasts.

Initially these are pinkish but after the delivery, the scar tissue contract
and obliterates the capillaries and they become glistening white in
appearance.

Apart from the mechanical stretching of the skin, increase in aldosterone
production during pregnancy is the responsible factors.

Besides pregnancy some other causes of *stretch marks* are: Rapidly gaining
weight (Bulking cycle), Puberty, Obesity, Heredity, Skin Type, Stress, Poor
Diet and Sudden Environmental Change

Every woman in her life develops stretch marks. Some women have a family
disposition to develop stretch marks whereas others do not develop them at
all. Once the stretch marks develop they will stay with you forever; but
with time they will be less noticeable.

*Stretch marks* are often think to be scars but they are different from
scars. They are not scars because they are not comprised of fibrotic tissue.
Instead, stretch marks represent a flattened, thin epidermis overlying gaps
in the dermis left by stretched or torn elastin fibers.

*HOME REMEDIES FOR STRETCH MARKS *

- Lie down on the floor. Bend that knee and place your foot in front
of your bottom leg, then try to raise the bottom leg up about six inches.
Then lower the leg to the floor. Begin with 8 to 10 bottom-leg raises on
each side at least three times a week. Slowly increase the workout.
- Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor; hands either by
your sides or in your lap, then swing both legs up so that they're extended
straight out in front of you at seat level
- Put your hands down at your sides to hold on to your chair and swing
your legs up until they're fully extended. Then lift each leg, from foot to
hip, about three to six inches.
- To firm your bottom, lie facedown on the floor, arms out at your
shoulders, elbows bent and palms flat on the floor. Now lift one leg, heel
first, off the floor about three to six inches, then lower it back to the
floor and repeat the lift with your other leg.
- For *stretch marks treatment*, diet should be rich in protein and
foods rich in Vitamin C and Vitamin E, they promote good tissue
growth.
- Massaging your body with olive oil or Vitamin E may help.
- Prepare a mixture by adding one ounce of carrier oil ( try avocado,
sweet almond, jojoba, they are the best ) with seven drops of lavender and
five drops of chamomile. Apply on the affected areas.
- Apply cocoa butter and/ or elastin cream through out the body. These
are very good for *stretch marks.*
- Take 1/2-cup virgin olive oil, 1/4-cup aloe Vera gel, liquid from 6
capsules of Vitamin E, liquid from 4 capsules of Vitamin A. Mix all the
ingredients together in a blender. After that store the mixture in the
fridge. Apply the oil externally all over the places where the stretch marks
commonly appear (abdomen, hips, thighs and breasts). This is an effective
*home remedy* for and by using this continuously *stretch marks* can
be prevented.
- Mix in a blender 1/2-cup virgin olive oil, 1/2-cup aloe Vera gel and
six capsules vitamin E oil (opened). Keep this oil refrigerated and massage
into areas with stretch marks at least once a day. This is also an effective
*home remedy for stretch marks*.
- You can cure or remove recent stretch marks with high doses of
tretinoin applied to the mark. Tretinoin in the form of Retisol-A, Retin-A,
Stieva-A or Rejuva-A can be used that cause a realignment of the collagen in
the skin.
- Lift weights to tighten the surrounding skin. The stretch marks will
appear smoother.
- For *strech marks removal* apply cocoa butter stretch creams in the
morning and at night to get rid of stretch marks. It works in some cases and
not in all.

*WHAT WORKS* &quot;Moisturizers, wrinkle cream and massage don't get rid of
stretch marks,&quot; says Dr. Weiss. (For a possible exception, see &quot;Vitamin
Cream Works Wonders&quot; on page 526.) And makeup doesn't cover them very well.
The best you can do is to minimize stretch marks, says Dr. Weiss. Firming
any areas that have stretch marks--usually the thighs, hips and
abdomen--makes stretch marks less apparent, she says. Women doctors suggest
these exercises. (You can expect to see results in about two months.)   *Start
with 20 leg raises. *One of the best exercises to work the hip and leg area,
which is where stretch marks are most likely to occur, is a straight leg
raise exercise, says Carol Garber, Ph.D., director of the Human Performance
Lab at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.   To begin, lie down on
the floor on your side, legs straight, one on top of the other. Then extend
the arm that's floor-side down over your head and rest your head on your
arm. Put your other hand flat on the floor in front of your waist. Keeping
both legs straight and toes pointed straight ahead, raise your top leg from
hip to toe as far as it will go, then lower it back to the floor.   &quot;Don't
just jerk your leg up in the air and let it fall back down,&quot; says Dr.
Garber. &quot;You can get injured if you raise it too quickly. Instead, raise and
lower your leg in a slow, controlled motion.   &quot;Begin with 8 to 10 leg
raises on each side at least three times a week,&quot; says Dr. Garber. Then, as
each exercise begins to seem easy, add a leg raise or two until you've
worked your way up to 20 leg raises three times a week.
*Do 20 inner-thigh exercises. *To firm your inner thigh, lie down on the
floor just as you did for the leg raises, says Dr. Garber. But this time,
instead of raising your top leg, bend that knee and place your foot in front
of your bottom leg, then try to raise the bottom leg up about six inches.
Then lower the leg to the floor.

Begin with 8 to 10 bottom-leg raises on each side at least three times a
week, says Dr. Garber. Then, as each exercise begins to seem easy, add a
couple of bottom-leg raises until you've worked your way up to 20 bottom-leg
raises three times a week.   *Swing your legs. *One incredibly simple
exercise that firms the whole thigh is to sit in a chair with your feet flat
on the floor, hands either by your sides or in your lap, then swing both
legs up so that they're extended straight out in front of you at seat level,
says Dr. Garber. Then swing them back down.   You can swing your legs
whenever you feel like it--when you're on the phone or watching television,
for example--or you can incorporate the exercise into your workout.
Whichever you choose, your goal should be 20 swings three times a week.   *Lift
off. *If you get bored with swinging, put your hands down at your sides to
hold on to your chair and swing your legs up until they're fully extended.
Then lift each leg, from foot to hip, about three to six inches, says Dr.
Garber. Finally, lower your leg until both legs are straight out in front of
you once again.   Start out with 8 to 10 lifts, then work your way up to 20
lifts three times a week.   *Firm your butt. *To firm your bottom, lie
face-down on the floor, arms out at your shoulders, elbows bent and palms
flat on the floor, says Dr. Garber. Now lift one leg, heel first, off the
floor about three to six inches, then lower it back to the floor and repeat
the lift with your other leg.   Start out by lifting each leg 8 to 10 times
three times a week. Add a couple of lifts to each workout as they get easy.
Your goal is 20 lifts three times a week.   *Keep the scale steady. *Since
extra pounds create stretch marks, try to keep your weight on an even keel,
says Dr. Weiss. To control calories, avoid high-fat foods, watch your
portions and get more physically active. Walk instead of drive, take the
stairs instead of an elevator, do your own yard work instead of hiring the
neighbor's kid.
