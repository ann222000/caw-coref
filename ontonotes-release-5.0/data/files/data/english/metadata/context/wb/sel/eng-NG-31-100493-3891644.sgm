2002 Dodge Durango Electric Radiator fan?
</HEADLINE>

Hello,

The Wife 2002 Dodge Durango (~52k miles) was complaining the the AC
wasn't very cold when she first got in the car. When get got going it
would be fine.. I checked the refrigerant level and it would fine. She
would also complain that the mechanical fan cluch would engage more
often creating a whirling noise and sluggish response. She never
complained much about this this before. So, looking at the truck today
it appears that the electric fan has given up the ghost. Checked the
relay, shorted the two relay contacts and the fan wouldn't turn on. With
the AC on the relay would click, but no movement inthe fan. I got power
at the fan connector but the fan wouldn't turn. I took the fan out of
the car and hooked it up to a bench power supply, and nothing.

So, am I missing something in my diagnosis or is it simply just a bad
fan? I called some local autoparts places (which are opened on a sunday)
and all said this is a dealer item..

Thanks,

-James

If you applied power directly to the fan motor and it didn't spin, then it
is bad.

Ok. I wasn't sure if there was some circuitry inside the fan itself
which only allowed it to turn on when hot,etc. It doesn't appear to be
the case, but wasn't 100% sure.

The dealer list price is $294.00 I have used www.dodgeparts.com in the past.
There price plus shipping from Seattle, WA  to Indiana is cheaper than my
local dealer.

Could you see any way to get it apart? You're going to replace it, may as
well see if it's something like a broken wire, bad connection or stuck
brush. Can't hurt to try. I would rap on it with a screwdriver first and see
if it runs on the bench supply. And, there may be a way to mount a junk yard
fan off something else that will work. I did this on a Jap car. The fan
motor burnt up and I was able to fit a fan off something else. Best $15.00 I
ever spent and it works fine.

I've used bremerton dodge before for parts. They are in washington
state. I ordered a new window regulator and a new side mirror from them,
great service and prices. I had hoped that the part would be $80-90
bucks but with a $300 retail, it's more likely going to be $180-200
range. Owell.. still cheaper then having the dealer fix it..

Al,

I'm going to go take a look. But from a quick look it appears to be
sealed. It has a bolt looking thing on the fan part, but I don't think
that comes of. One of the autoparts guys (autozone or advanced) said
that he thought you might be able to just buy the motor. I'll have to
find out. You couldn't do this with the window regulator I bought
before. You got the motor with it..

We will see. If the price of the fan is &gt;$200 I might check out a
junkyard. If it's $40 there I can replace it 5 times and still break
even.. minus my time..

I'm going to head to the garage and tinker with the fan. I'll see what
happens..

Ohh.. One other thing. I wonder if the fan is considered part of "drive
train" and would be covered under the 7yr/70k mile warranty that dodge
offers. I guess I'd have to put the inop fan back in and drive it to the
dealer if it is..

The fan is not covered under the 7/70 powertrain warranty.

Sorry...

I kinda figured. I'll just swap it out myself. I'm going to call around
tomorrow to locate one.

Ouch. The local dealer has the part in stock for $366. Seems high for
just a fan...
