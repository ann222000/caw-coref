The Scottish actor Finlay Currie was a marvel.

He was particularly magnificent as Magwitch in Charles Dickens' and David
Lean's _Great Expectations_ [1946].

Is he at all typical, in portrayed on-screen character, of the Scots of his
generation?

There are a number of Scots who are archetypal
of their species. Finlay Currie, Dr Cameron, Rikki Fulton,
Fulton McKay &amp; Dr John Grierson
Ally McCoist is a newcomer.  I like his style.

I am sure that others will be mentioned.
Walter Smith....???? Connery, Connelly  &amp;
Dr Monty Finniston, a wonderful man.

Sir Harold Montague (Monty) Finniston (1912-1991) was a British
industrialist born in Glasgow, Scotland. He became chairman of
British Steel in 1973, and was knighted in the same year.

He was Vice-President of the Royal Society, 1971-2.

In 1977 the government, in response to complaints from industry
about a shortage of qualified engineers, invited Finniston to set up
a committee of enquiry into British engineering. In 1979 the
committee delivered the "Finniston Report", one of whose
recommendations was that universities should offer engineering
degrees (BEng and MEng) rather than just science degrees (
BSc). In 1981 he founded the Prison Reform Trust.

He certainly was. No biblical epic was worth watching if Finlay Currie
wasn't in it to act as a sort of living imprimatur of quality.Indeed
we did some research on him about eight years ago and found a living
relative!

Jennifer Pizer from New Zealand. Posted 10 Jul 2002.
My name is Jennifer Pizer nee Currie, my Grandfather was Finlay Currie
the actor. My father George was the only child of Finlay and Maude. In
1963 my father was flown from N.Z by the BBC to appear on This Is Your
Life: Finlay Currie with Eammon Andrews.
We have recently obtained a copy of this programme from the BBC in
London. When my father was in London he was given a wonderful set of
photographs,which I now have, of Finlay in most of his films.
My father died 17 years ago, and my brother and I feel we know very
little about Finlay and his early life, so any information would be
great.

We believe he was born in Edinburgh in 1878, his Father was in the
Seaforth Highlanders at the time. When I was in London in January of
200I managed to find where my Grandmother Maude is buried. If anyone
could give me any information on where Finlay is buried I would be
very grateful. I did visit the BBC archives and a very helpful young
woman did look for information for me but none of the obituaries
mentioned where he was buried. I know he died in a rest home near his
home in Gerrards Cross Buckinghamshire in 1968. I look forward to
hearing from anybody who may have any information on Finlay. My
children Catriona and Conan live in London and would be happy to meet
with anybody who could help us.

Hello Jennifer, although I can't help you with info about your
Grandfather's resting place but there is a wonderful website full of
Scottish ex-pats who seem to know everything about everyone remotely
Scottish, and I am sure you will find a lot of answers there. your
Grandfather was a wonderful old actor and I think he was in every
picture made in Scotland. Good Luck, Davy.

(Murchadh's comment: Note how this idiot didn't give the website URL!)

I'm sorry I don't have any information on Finlay Currie, but I would
like you to know that as soon as our family saw his name on the
credits we knew it was going to be a good film. Who could ever forget
the film about India and those immortal words "Ah pity the man who
hears the pipes an' wisnae born in Scotland". And then that
performance in "Ben Hur". He stole the show as far as I was concerned.
Good luck in your quest.

My father always said Finlay was his fourth cousin, born in Edinburgh
- his mother was Annie Currie who worked in the Post Office - I have a
copy of his birth certificate if this of any help.

Jack Hayhurst. Posted 29 Jan 2003.
I can update Jennifer Pizer re Finlay, and put her in touch with my
cousin who knows quite a lot more. Can I have her email address ?

Jennie Pizer from New Zealand. Posted 6 May 2003.
Thank you for the information you have given me.Please pass on my
e-mail address to any one who may have information on Finlay
Jennie

The remorseless hunt for Finlay's darkest secrets goes on!

Murchadh.
