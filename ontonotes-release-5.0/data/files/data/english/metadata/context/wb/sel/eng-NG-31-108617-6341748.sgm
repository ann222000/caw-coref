I've got data on pretty much all of those already; the thing at the top
is one of the final designs related to the WS-606A Avro Of Canada
program... that thing was supposed to be VTOL and have superior
perfomance to a SR-71: http://www.laesieworks.com/ifo/lib/AVRO-WS606A.html
Ever do a vacuformed one? Those make the resin ones look easy.

They did do some work on stuff on things like that; the biggest problems
with trying to track down reality from complete fantasies are dual:

1.) Just about any complete loon who had any wacko idea in Nazi Germany
could probably get the okay from some aspect of that fucked-up
government to keep up the research and get some marks thrown at it...in
the wild hope it might pan out.
2.) It's way too easy to make a buck off of  "Secret Nazi Flying Saucer
Programs" in the post WW II years.

Any UFO research requires a dispassionate analysis of the "signal to
noise" ratio in it.
In the case of the Nazi saucers, that ratio is around  99% noise for the
above two reasons.

"B5 Shadow Fighter assembly instructions:
1.) Remove the Shadow Fighter from the bubble wrap it came shipped in.
2.) Use a Dremel tool to excavate a hole in the Shadow Fighter's nose
where the terrifyingly ppowerful eenergy pulse shall emerge as it spasms
like it's orgasming while attacking Narn fighters.
3.) Carefully wash the Shadow Fighter with lukewarm water and mild
detergent to ready it for painting, and remove the mold release agents.
4.) Paint the damn thing any way you want, but make sure it's really
scary looking."

BTW... _this_ model is worth the price; this is a real beautiful piece
of work:
http://home.woh.rr.com/howlinwolf/page_3.htm
This  model fits together in no time flat, is easy to paint, big, and
will knock your everlovin' socks off when done and painted.
Even the veination on all the parts lines up when they are assembled,
and it needs almost zero filling to get it in superb looking shape. I
had mine ready to paint inside of two hours after getting it, and it's
the centerpiece of my model collection over the television set... really
superb piece of work on his part.
Here's his homepage: http://home.woh.rr.com/howlinwolf/page2.htm
Unfortunately he doesn't appear to make his "Shadow Warrior" creature
anymore, which is a pity, because you should have seen the work he put
into that...dozens of beautifully cast resin pieces that not only let
you build a foot-wide Shadow creature, but let you pose it in any way
you wanted by his breaking its legs and arms down into their subsections
at all their pivot points.
When he announced he was going to issue that, I wrote him saying: "I
don't even want to ask how much that's going to cost...but you know
full-well I'm going to have to have one after seeing what you did with
the Shadow Ship."
His reply was: "It's going to cost around $70.00."
My reply was: "Are you out of your ever-loving fucking mind? It'd be
worth twice that much!"
Still, I got one for only $70.00...despite my best efforts to get him to
increase the price. :-)

...Yeah, yeah, there's obviously exceptions to the rule, where you
need something solid that doesn't need to ever be lit up from inside.
On the other hand, that kit also needed to have a "semi-trans" version
made where you could see the pilot inside through the membrane.

...But I stand by my previous dislike of most, if not all, solid chunk

I keep wondering about something though... we only took over half of
Germany; the Soviets got the other half, and I wouldn't be at all
surprised if they got their hands on some things we never knew about.
Considering how our bombing attacks trashed the place, a lot of projects
probably had most of their documentation destroyed, so unless you
actually could find someone who had worked on the project, you might
never know that even existed.
An example of that is the "Peenemunde Arrow" project fore a MRBM that
work started on at the end of the war.
The Soviets got Grottrup and some of the other Peenemunde team working
on it, and had them complete the design, which although never built as a
MRBM, became the basis for the R-7's boosters. We'd never know  that the
Germans had been working on it during the war except for the fact that
German rocket engineer Rolf Engel mentioned the story of it to G. Harry
Stine in 1976, and it figures heavily in one of the chapters of his book
"ICBM".
Although von Braun and his team had come up with the design in late 1944
or early 1945, he never mentioned it in any of his writings...probably
due to the fact that as well as being responsible for our first
satellite, it would mean he had some unintentional input on Sputnik 1
also. :-D
There are two German wartime programs I always wanted to get more data
on; "The Horse And Rider", which was a Peenemunde program to use a
A4/V-2 to launch a ramjet powered cruise missile (via Hermes II this
turns into Navaho, and in the Soviet Union leads directly to the Burya
and Buran ramjet powered intercontinental cruise missiles), and some
sort of super SAM named "Vergeltung" which sounds suspiciously like a
Wasserfall scaled up to V-2 proportions, or some V-2 derivative for SAM
work.
I've only heard of Vergeltung once, but The Horse And Rider is fairly
well known... it's just there is no data on it out there, other than a
pretty inaccurate attempt to take a stab at its design, by some secret
weapons enthusiasts in Germany

I'll sure agree with you on that one; I built a Contrail Models vacuform
1/72 scale M-52 "Bounder" bomber, and that was pure hell
My first resin kit was Voyager 1, and other than all the photoetch
parts, it was no problem at all.
I've got a resin Proton and N-1 sitting in front of me right now, and
neither was particularly difficult, despite the huge size of the N-1.
I think OM's comment is about the ease of building innards into the
vacuform ones. I once had a vacuform Ba-349 Natter model that I
literally had all the innards in; motor, fuel tanks, recovery parachute
and even all the wooden framework of the fuselage structure.

...Vac-form kits - especially the garage types - were bigger over in
Europe, the FSE, and it's Iron Curtain states. For them, it was easier
to get the thin sheet plastic and use a simple shop vac over a mold to
produce kits than it was to get the resins. Nowadays it's flipflopped,
but assembling vac-form kits was an art unto itself. Ironically, many
who are experienced with these kits have found equal challenge with
the more complex papercraft kits that computers have made far easier
to design and release.

...Yeah, but he doesn't have one of *MY* "Holy Grails", the Aurora
"Fantastic Voyage" cartoon ship, the Voyager. This kit was one of the
rare occasions where Aurora failed to do a reissue of a kit that sold
out within a few *weeks* of release. Reportedly due to some licensing
snafu between Filmation and Aurora, alas. and those same issues kept
Polar Lights from looking at a retool. This is a kit that left lots of
room for interior builds, and boxed, unbuilt versions are about as
rare as black diamonds that originated here on Earth. The only ones I
see on eBay are built-up ones in piss-poor shape at prices that are
ridiculous.

...Jeez, I had one of these circa 1969. One of the local now-defunct
discount chains purchased a warehouse full of kits, and several of
these were amongst the lot. I also got the Atlas ICBM kit *and* a
first issue of the same kit revamped for the Friendship 7 marketing
blitz. Also got the Atlas space station kit - the one with the diamond
delta shuttles on both sides - and the Convair TSTO shuttle that about
six months later got reissued with an old "Tom Corbett" kit as the
"Space Pursuit" set.

...PE parts are interesting, because you have to make sure you use the
right paints over that brass. While none of the kits I've built have
PE parts, I helped someone rebuild an old wooden R/C model of a WWI
destroyer - supposed to represent the USS Texas, but the tower and
stack placement was seriously off - and he decided to make and use PE
parts to replace some stick-and-string railings. He'd used some paints
he'd picked up from an artist's supply house instead of a *real* hobby
shop, and either the paints wouldn't dry totally or they'd dry but
become so brittle that they'd flake off if you breathed on them.

Not really -- fueling of operational V-2s was automated and quite quick.
There was none of this business of sitting on the pad for hours while the
launch crew works through an inch-thick checklist.  When erecting the
rocket immediately makes you a potential target for air attack, you figure
out how to do these things rapidly. :-)

For that matter, the Thor IRBM went from horizontal and empty in its
"coffin" shelter to vertical, fueled, and lifting off in 15 minutes.

LOX/alcohol or LOX/kerosene launch preparations don't have to be slow.

...The key to building them is one I learned when I had my Mattel
Vac-U-Form back in the 60's: sometimes you need to build an internal
skeleton to help hold things together. I did a couple of ME-109's from
a single-plate press, and the plastic was so thin that if I hadn't
added thin styrene strips inside the wings or put rods from port to
starboard inside the fusilage, the wings would have drooped and the
sides would have caved in if you picked it up too tight. Again, as
with papercraft and/or origami, it's an art that takes skill,
patience, and a delicate touch.

shrink-wrap compression, and whether or not the kit has been assembled

It wasn't "automated" in the modern sense; it was done by people rolling
trailers around at attaching fueling hoses to it:
http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/procedure.html
As that article points out, if you try to keep it loaded with LOX for
over one hour the valves freeze.
According to Bill Gunston's "Rockets and Missiles" from the arrival at a
resurveyed site to launch was around four hours.
In this case it can be assumed that the V-2 SAM would be under either
visual or radar control from the ground like Schmetterling or
Wasserfall, so the site doesn't need to be surveyed, but even then you
are probably talking an hour or two to get the missile and its control
equipment set up and ready to go.
About the only way to speed this up would be to used fixed bunker sites,
like were originally planned for the A4 missile.
But they'd be sitting duck targets for low level air attack, as the V-2
SAM wouldn't have the maneuverability to engage something like a Typhoon
or P-47 at low altitude.
Something along the lines of the later A6 design with storable
propellants would make more sense, but a combination of Wasserfall for
high altitude bomber engagement and Schmetterling for low/medium
altitude work was a lot better idea than either of these two ideas.
The Soviets were impressed enough with Wasserfall to turn out some
copies after the war as the R-101 SAM:
http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/r101.htm
This never panned out, but technology from it led directly to the "Scud"
missile.

It's probably due to the fact it's partially assembled.
That was considered about the rarest model in the world around 1970.
Here's some more on it: http://fantastic-plastic.com/ITCF-108RAPIERPAGE.htm
You can see what happened...ITC is going to do a model Navaho...then
Navaho gets canceled; so they take the booster and launcher and stick a
"F-108" on it.
Then the F-108 gets canceled.
Despite the canards, that thing looks nose-heavy.
And what the hell is going on with those air intakes, anyway? :-\

&gt; ...The key to building them is one I learned when I had my Mattel

&gt; a single-plate press, and the plastic was so thin that if I hadn't
&gt; added thin styrene strips inside the wings or put rods from port to
&gt; starboard inside the fusilage, the wings would have drooped and the

Try this honker in 1/72 sometime:
http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/bomber/m-50.htm
The thing's fuselage was damn near as big as a Monogram B-52's.
Luckily, Contrail made it out of pretty thick plastic, so it was at
least sturdy.
The resin kit that really surprised me was a 1/35 scale Swedish "S" tank.
I was expecting it to be murder to build, but other than the individual
track links, it was not at all difficult.

I keep picturing something like a Lippisch P-13 hanging on the side of a
V-2.
Ranks right up there with the Soviet "Golem" submarine-towed missile
containers. Can't find any data on those either, or photos of the German
"Prufstand XII" V-2 submarine towed launching container that was under
final construction at the Schichau dockyard at Elbing when the war ended
that was the Golem's inspiration.
You know, I doubt this is a real thing, but the design is really clever:

You use a electric motor on the converted gun carriage to spin the
rotors up to ramjet ignition speed.

&gt;&gt; [the Revell cylindrical Space Station]

&gt; What really annoys me is that the local hobby shop once got three or four
&gt; of those in -- obviously from the back of somebody's warehouse, with a bit
&gt; of water damage to the boxes -- and with near-criminal lack of foresight,
&gt; I only bought *one*. :-(
">

I think my older brother may have had one, but can't be sure.
You just bought one?
And you saw what happened then, didn't you?
The Commies bought one of those from that very same hobby shop, studied
it, and started designing Mir! ;-)
You should have bought all of them, built one, and then given the rest
to Boy Scouts whose loyalty could be trusted to prevent them from
falling into enemy hands.
...but _not_ Boy Scouts who were trying to get merit badges in Shortwave
Radio... I suspect a good 10% of those were Red Moles in the 1960s.
On a serious note, after the Navy showed everyone their wonderful
cutaway model of a  Polaris submarine, Revell and Renwal model companies
promptly issued model kits based on it, and Mr. Commie did get his hands
on some of those, and started working on  the "Yankee" class missile
submarine based in part on the model's internal design.
http://cs.finescale.com/forums/689504/PrintPost.aspx
To set this story straight; the Revell one is smaller (I've had both,
and still have a Revell one) but is almost exactly identical to the
Renwal one in internal layout. The Renwal one's detail is not as crisp,
but it includes some crew members to help create a sense of scale. Both
are based on some big cutaway model the Navy once used at a press
conference and then as a recruiting aid... they sent it around the
country in a trailer; I saw it as a kid; it had lights all over the
inside that would illuminate parts of it as a recorder told you what
they were.
They should have just sent it to Moscow.
Red Moles in the Navy Recruiting Office.
Probably all with Boy Scout merit badges in Shortwave Radio.
On the Renwal one the reactor is also cut away so you can see the
primary water circulation loop on its heat exchanger.
Comparing the Revell model to the cutaway of a Benjamin Franklin class
submarine in my "U.S. Submarines Since 1945" book shows that although
Revell made some slips, the internal layout is around 85-90% correct.
What really may have gotten on Rickover's nerves is Revell's proclivity
to tell you what every part was on the instruction sheet.
Including such goodies as the SINS navigation system gyro buckets, big
launch stabilization gyro, missile ejection steam generators, and loads
of goodies back in the engine room.

Anyway, I've dug out all my old rocket books, so I'll start looking.
OM mentioned he had heard of this concept by that same name in the mid

I'm really surprised you've never heard of this...it's pretty obscure,

research from at least the 60s onwards..

...The new generation of CAD-designed papercraft kits are far better
than some of the DIY ones I did when I was a kid. There was one book
on how to create your own satellite models - including a bunch of
TRW's early small satellites that were probably the inspiration for
D&amp;D dice - and those kits were a pain in the butt to cut and assemble,
especially since you had to draw out the design on the paper yourself.
The Xerox copiers that just became available at the local libraries
wouldn't let you use your own paper, and besides the roller mechanism
would let card stock or even cheap construction paper run through it.
