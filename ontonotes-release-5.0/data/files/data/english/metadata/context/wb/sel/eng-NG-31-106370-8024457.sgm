I would note that those defects have been removed by Amendments to the
Constitution.

The Second Amendment could just as easily be removed if it is seen to be
a defect.

Personally, in the interests of long-term sustainable governance, I
would prefer a Court that respects the rule of law, even when the law is
egregiously wrong.  Legislation is the province of the legislature, not
of the courts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Maybe they should not commit crimes.

&gt;&gt; You mean like the crimes of escaping their white slave masters, or

Hey Herb, you don't get it. I hope &quot;ultraman&quot; will forgive me if I
explain it to you for him.

You see, the constitution is a LIVING document! That means that as
society progresses (and we all know what &quot;progressive&quot; means) the
document needs to &quot;evolve&quot; with society. The way it does that is by
congress passing new laws that redefine the rules by which government
operates. If everyone agrees (pretends) that the new laws are valid,
then the new laws in effect become the &quot;new&quot; constitution! There have
been so many examples lately that we can't even count them. Search and
seizure without warrants, Holding prisoners without charges,
wiretapping half the phone calls and ALL the internet traffic in the
country, ex post facto laws, assumption of guilt, and most important
of all, deep infringements on the right to keep and bear arms. That's
how the highest law of the land &quot;lives&quot; and &quot;grows&quot; don't you know.
So long as Congress, courts, lawyers, judges, law enforcement and
administration officials ALL agree that the newly passed law is the
law of the land, who is left to object? And just in case (as in the
gun-free school zone law) somehow the Supreme Court declares the new
law invalid, it's simple! You just pass it again! Pretty soon the
opposition runs out of money and gives up. Sweet!

That is how America lives and evolves!

&quot;prof&quot; Jonez is right! Congress passes laws and the judicial branch up
to the Supreme Court interprets the law. Of course some laws are
merely passed by decree rather than by legislative procedures. Those
would be the laws passes by &quot;executive orders&quot;. These require no
elected officials other than the president to become law. They don't
even have to be made public and many of these laws are secret until
they are needed.  In any case laws passed by Congress which the
Supreme Court REFUSES to review obviously stand as they are no matter
how they might go against the provisions of the Constitution!

It's all about &quot;giving those in power the tools they need&quot; and the
&quot;fluidity&quot; necessary to effectively rule a nation.  Anyone who doesn't
know this much is simply a whack-militia-nutter!

A right was expanded by Rove v Wade, namely the right to prevent the
government from interfering with one's bodily automony.  (This is often
called the right to privacy and includes things like the freedom to take
contraceptive measures without governmental interference.)  This right
essentially invalidates any state laws that abridged it.

Not quite the same thing as &quot;creating&quot; a law.

&gt;&gt; Wouldn't you agree that a law was essentially created, by &quot;Roe V Wade&quot;?

&gt; A right was expanded by Rove v Wade, namely the right to prevent the
&gt; government from interfering with one's bodily automony.  (This is often
&gt; called the right to privacy and includes things like the freedom to take
&gt; contraceptive measures without governmental interference.)  This right
&gt; essentially invalidates any state laws that abridged it.

&gt; Not quite the same thing as &quot;creating&quot; a law.

And Parker will have as dramatic an effect on RKBA if affirmed by the
Court explicitly -- it will also have on if just denied Cert (which
essentially
says that Parker is correct.)

Miranda and the modern 4th Amendent decisions had this affect on arrests,
searches, and interrogations.

Not necessarily, not even if you disagree with Roe but are still logically
about
it.

Roe can be a terrible decision but still have been correct to extend
protections
(not the law) for a human or civil right.  Roe might have come down just the
opposite and extended protections for the right of unborn babies.

2nd Amendment cases about making sure the protections of the Constitution
are required for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms which is explicitly
enumerated
by that amendment.

Roe deals with rights not even explicitly numerated but that doesn't mean
such
rights do not exist (9th Amendment and other places in the Constitution).

RKBA is specifically enumerated and explicty protected by the Bill of
Rights,
the 2nd in specific, but also the 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th, and 14th Amendments,
and the specific portions of the body and the entire structure and
philosophy
of the Constitution.

No &quot;gun law&quot; is Constitutional unless and until it can pass strict strutiny.

Funny thing is, no gun law can or likely ever will do that.

None of the CDC, the National Academy of Sciences of Sciences, nor DoJ
was able to find that ANY gun control reduces VIOLENT CRIME,
SUICIDE or ACCIDENTS in any significant manner.

Don B. Kates and Gary A. Mauser, &quot;Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and
Suicide? A Review of International Evidence&quot; (June 6, 2006). ExpressO
Preprint Series. Working Paper 1413.
http://law.bepress.com/expresso/eps/1413
http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6426&amp;context;=expresso
&lt;&lt;In this connection two recent studies are pertinent. In 2004 the U.S.
National Academy of
Sciences released its evaluation from an review of 253 journal articles, 99
books, 43 government
publications and some empirical research of its own. It could not identify
any gun control that had
reduced violent crime, suicide or gun accidents.(15) The same conclusion was
reached in a 2003
study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's review of then-extant
studies&quot;(16)

(15) Charles F. Wellford, John V. Pepper, and Carol V. Petrie (eds.),
FIREARMS AND VIOLENCE: A CRITICAL REVIEW
(National Academy of Sciences, 2004). It is perhaps not amiss to note that
the review panel,
which was set up during the Clinton Administration, was almost entirely
composed of scholars who, to the extent
their views were publicly known before their appointments, favored gun
control.

Preventing Violence: Firearms Laws&quot; (CDC,

The above represent two nearly fatal flaws in the original Constitution,
but these flaws were a product of the times.

You show your ignorance by failing (or acting) as if you don't understand
this simple point.

Had the Constitution not included these terrible errors it could not have
been created and then later served to provide the foundation on which
the underlying social ills could also be corrected.

The Liberals continue to look incredibly short sighted, self-interested, and
dishonest (at least the Liberal politicians themselves look dishonest.)

Even now, they cannot get it through their pointy little heads that leaving
Iraq before stabilization is just ensuring that 1) Al Qaeda or some
pro-Iranian
regime will take over and 2) We will have to eventually GO BACK in there
militarily.

Also who wants to give up the AMAZING strategic position on Iran?

Had some military advisor been queried by the President in 2002 about
&quot;What strategic position would we need to engage Iran successfully?&quot;

That advisor might have answered: &quot;Well, in a perfect world we would
NOT want to operate from the bottleneck of the Straits of Hormuz
and the Persian Gulf, no even solely from Saudi Arabia.&quot;

&quot;Ideally we would surround them; that is have forces and bases in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and the places to the north.  While we might get
some help in the north, there is of course NO WAY either the
Afghans or Iraq would let us base there.&quot;

Ahem, bases in Iraq and Afghanistan SURROUND Iran.

That is if the Libs don't piss away this advantage with infighting
that harms America.

&gt; A right was expanded by Rove v Wade, namely the right to prevent the

&gt; called the right to privacy and includes things like the freedom to take
&gt; contraceptive measures without governmental interference.)
">

And there is no right to privacy found anywhere in the Constitution. The
justices just made it up. Said the rest of the Constitution taken as a
whole casts &quot;shadows of freedom&quot; or some-such double-speak bullshit and
said the right to privacy is implied by those shadows.

I have no problem with a right to privacy. If we as a society value such
a right, then I'm on board. It just needs to be done properly, through
the amendment process. Not by judicial decree by nine folks in black
robes.

&gt; Ahem, bases in Iraq and Afghanistan SURROUND Iran.

&gt; That is if the Libs don't piss away this advantage with infighting
&gt; that harms America.

W made sure that we have no allies for any fight in the Middlel East.

W insured that a base for Al Qaeda in Iraq and a pro-Iranian majority
there at the same time.

W turned a victory in Afghanistan into a debacle with the resurgent
Taliban.

W broke the army we had into the army we wish we didn't.

And now you want to fight Iran?

It's unamended... and stands ready to serve the original cause, still valid
today, that an armed citizenry be a balance against an armed government, and
that the federal government is specifically DENIED the power to even
infringe upon the rights of the citizens to own and carry firearms.

If the power of government is not limited by the Constitution's specific and

&gt;&gt; &gt; Wouldn't you agree that a law was essentially created, by &quot;Roe V
&gt;&gt; &gt; Wade&quot;?

&gt;&gt; A right was expanded by Rove v Wade, namely the right to prevent the
&gt;&gt; government from interfering with one's bodily automony.  (This is
&gt;&gt; often called the right to privacy and includes things like the
&gt;&gt; freedom to take contraceptive measures without governmental
&gt;&gt; interference.)

&gt; And there is no right to privacy found anywhere in the Constitution.
&gt; The justices just made it up. Said the rest of the Constitution taken
&gt; as a whole casts &quot;shadows of freedom&quot; or some-such double-speak
&gt; bullshit and said the right to privacy is implied by those shadows.

&gt; I have no problem with a right to privacy. If we as a society value
&gt; such a right, then I'm on board. It just needs to be done properly,
&gt; through the amendment process. Not by judicial decree by nine folks in
&gt; black robes.

You pointless whining is noted.  And yet the right to privacy stands.

The discussion was whether Roe v Wade created a law.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We must prepare for a long hard battle. So much of what we have

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could be destroyed by the heinous decision of right-wing activist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; judges who chose to ignore more than 60 years of precedent

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And that precedent ignores the Constitution itself. I'd much rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a court looking to the Constitution than 60 years of erroneous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; precedent.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Constitution that didn't consider Negroes to be fully human ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; The same one that allowed Slavery to thrive to 100+ years?
&gt;&gt;&gt; The Ass Rag that condoned the idea that Women were too stupid,
&gt;&gt;&gt; impressionable and hysterical to be allowed to Vote?

&gt;&gt; I would note that those defects have been removed by Amendments to the
&gt;&gt; Constitution.

&gt;&gt; The Second Amendment could just as easily be removed if it is seen to
&gt;&gt; be a defect.

&gt; Perhaps it isn't defective, and merely been misinterpreted and misapplied
&gt; all
&gt; these years ... and guess which branch of the U$ Gov't handles issues of
&gt; legal interpretation ...?

&gt;&gt; Personally, in the interests of long-term sustainable governance, I
&gt;&gt; would prefer a Court that respects the rule of law, even when the law
&gt;&gt; is egregiously wrong.

&gt; Spoken like a True Amoral Totalitarian.

&gt;&gt; Legislation is the province of the legislature, not of the courts.

&gt; And when the legislature is a bunch of racists, bigots, idiots and fascist
&gt; criminals ?

And when the courts as well as corrupt?
You have laid down the exact reason why an armed citizenry is the last
desperate resort to liberty.
