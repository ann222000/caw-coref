Neighbour claims our computer equipment causes interference

Apparently (I was out) our neighbour came to our house this morning
saying that her TV has been having problems, and after speaking to her
son, is saying the thinks its our computer equipment causing the
problems.  She said it was better her coming to us first, as she's going
to go to Ofcom and we'll get a fine as it's illegal.

My background is that I'm a software engineer with an electronic
engineering degree, work with PCs on a daily basis and electronic
circuits on a reasonably regular basis.  My dad is also an ex-Radio
Amateur (still licensed, just not active).  Consequently I feel that
whilst I'm certainly no expert on RF and TV interference, I do have a
bit of knowledge about the principles of these things.

Apparently her son also &quot;knows about these things&quot;.

We live in an urban road with houses both sides and another road a short
distance behind us.  Our house is a semi and the neighbour is the other
half of the semi.

We get on okay with our neighbour and it was a bit of a surprise for her
to come around with such a direct and accusing tone.  We've not had any
problems before.

The equipment we have in the house are 1 cable modem, 2 wireless routers
(1 being on 24/7 along with the cable modem) and a PC + TFT, 2 DECT
phones, Humax PVR, CRT TV (7 years old), basic stereo etc.  Add to that
the usual fridge, freezer, microwave, boiler etc....  My work laptop
(rarely at home) has WiFi and Bluetooth.

I've not spoken to her, but apparently it often happens around 7:30pm.
Our PC and 2nd WiFi router are turned off most of the time (weren't on
at all last night) - but are located on the party wall.

I do not believe she has a roof-top aerial.  Our front (shared) chimney
has a TV aerial (ours) which isn't connected as the cable fell off a
while back.  We replaced it with an aerial in our loft which gives
excellent (digital) reception from our local Guildford transmitter.
There is also a larger horizontal H-style shaped aerial (FM?) which I
don't think goes anywhere.  We have a 'hidden' satellite dish mounted on
the rear (shared) chimney but no receiver connected.  Other than that,
I've never noticed any other aerials - hence, I believe she must have a
loft mounted aerial.

Firstly, I've no reason to suspect that its our equipment at fault.
Could be her's, could be another neighbour.

What I have offered to do, purely to try and diffuse the situation
(which I'm not quite sure whether is now wise), so to go round and see
the problem in action, and then turn off our electrics and see if it
goes away.  My wife says it was all fuzzy when she went round just now,
and that she says it is terrible in an evening at about 7:30...pretty
much constant.

Ofcom says:
&quot;We cannot investigate terrestrial TV or radio interference if:

* You do not have a rooftop aerial. Set-top or loft aerials are
much less effective than a properly-fitted rooftop aerial and are the
most common cause of reception problems. Please contact an aerial
installer for details.&quot;

My concern now (after offering to turn off electrics etc) is that if her
aerial is at fault, then we may be the source of the interference, but
the problem is with her poor installation.  I don't want to provide
'proof' to her that it's us, if it's her installation at fault.

Anyway - is there any advice people can give with this?  We want to keep
things civil between us all, but don't want to be setting ourselves up
for a claim that we need to pay for a new aerial for her!

Thanks

David

Well, of course you know that that won't happen. All you'll get is advice,

When people decide that they've got to confront someone they are nervous and
so they psyche themselves up over a period of days or weeks. The result is
often that they come across as far more agressive than they really intend.

Very true. The cause usually turns out to be totally unexpected by all
parties.

I suggest you turn off your likely culprits one at a time and then turn off
your mains at the consumer unit as part of this demo. Invite the neighbour
in to see that your mains is off. Demonstrate it.

The hard fact is that if a proper aerial will solve her problem then it's up
to her to get one. You have to make this clear from the outset. You have to
be very firm about this. Don't make any offers like 'we'll pay half' because
it's an admission of liability.

What you have here is a person with a TV reception problem. With no evidence
whatsoever they have decided to blame next door's computer. This sort of
thing happens all the time. It's human nature and a lack of a scientific
education. The starting point is that she has interference, not that your
computer is to blame. Remember that. Take the line that you will, as a
neighbourly favour, eliminate your own equipment from her enquiry so she can
then look elesewhere.

I'd be astonished if this turned out to be anything to do with your
equipment.

Keeping in with the neighbours can be tricky but I'd start by asking her son
to justify his claims.  Approach it from the &quot;I know nothing, please help us
sort this out for you&quot; angle so as not to raise ire.

&quot;Around 19:30&quot; also sounds very odd.  Any chance there are any radio hams in
the area?  We used to have a radio ham neighbour and for a short while his
system affected out TV.  Since he was slightly deaf, it was possible to sit
in the garden and watch the TV picture fluctuate in time to the sounds
coming from his ham equipment!  Since it only ever affected one set, and
this was rented at the time, we got the set replaced and no more problems.

I suppose it's possible that your computer equipment might be affecting
their TV but since it only seems to have started lately, and you don't
mention any new equipment that you've bought, I doubt that is the problem.
FWIW, CRT computer screens can affect AM radios - we used to be able to tell
roughly what was on screen on our lab computer by the slight squeals from
the radio.  FM was unaffected though.

There's also the possibility that someone very close is a model railway
enthusiast (oops, sorry Bill, there's that word again).

Nowadays many model Railways are controlled using DCC (Digital Command
Control).  This works on the basis that the rails are connected to a low
voltage supply, on which is superimposed the High Frequency DCC signal.
Thus any number of locos can be controlled on the same tracks at a time.

It is known that a poorly wired layout can cause interference, specially
to a poor aerial installation.  There's been regular discussion on the
DCC forums about such interference.

Regularly at 1930 suggests that the MR fan is possibly running his
layout to a timetable.

If you or your neighbour knows of any MR fans, a friendly call from your
neighbour should work wonders.  They are usually almost as friendly as
folk on this newsgroup!

It's pretty silly threatening to get Ofcom involved at this stage. Do as
you suggest, and go round and try and see if there is any interference -
first with everything of yours turned on, as normal. If the interference
lasts long enough, see if it goes away when you turn it off (if this
won't cause you any problems). Try to get someone else to turn it off,
so you can see the results for yourself.

If the problem occurs regularly, at the same time, it's possibly when a
central heating boiler is firing up for the first time that evening. [My
pervious oil-powered boiler fired an unsuppressed spark plug for up to
30 seconds when the boiler was cold, and caused very severe
interference. An in-line resistive suppressor cured it.] However, you
would expect more bursts of spasmodic interference until switch-off
time. Of course, if timer is set only for a short 'on' time (say 15
minutes), you might only see the first (and only) burn. Check what your
neighbour's boiler timer is set to - and yours too, of course.

Let us know what your findings are.

As a radio amateur, I was once accused of regularly interfering with a
TV set each evening, when I was 300 miles away for six weeks! Neighbours
do get some strange ideas at times.

Welcome to the world of dealing with Joe (fuck-wit) Public;-(

Don't get involved. If you do anything and or touch anything of hers
everything else that happens in this sad sods life will be your fault.
Go ahead and let them get Ofcom in, and boy I know one of their staff
who preserved his sanity be getting early retirement from that thankless
job!..

If their son know what he was talking about he would do something about
her less than ideal aerial system!

But then again there are an AWFUL lot of pratts out there and I for one
am glad that I have a very small public to deal with these days!...

Call the old cow's bluff and let her go to Ofcom you have nothing to
fear or hide or worry about!...

Check that they are properly set to use UK frequency ranges, some are
manufactured to use US frequencies by default.  I can't remember the details
now, but I used to have an SMB Barricade that required this.  Also this may
have to be done any time the router is set back to factory defaults for any
reason.

US frequency ranges are the same as UK ones, but without channels 12 and
13.  In Japan they're allowed an additional channel 14.  Therefore a US
router is legal in the UK, but a UK router is not legal in the US
(without configuring it to drop channels 12 and 13).

Quite possible that your neighbour has problems that you know nothing about
at all - e.g. health or family.  Having had some neighbour problems in the
past I think you would be very wise to restrict your helpfulness to the
minimum you could reasonably get away with.  You are on a hiding to nothing:
either you are to blame or else you have to tell her that her son is talking
rubbish.  The fact that you have some relevant knowledge won't help and will
probably only make her more suspicious that you are not telling the whole
truth.  Good luck!

I don't think I'd want to go over there personally. It's almost an admission
of guilt. The thing that would concern me about the situation is if she
finally relents and gets a bad aerial installer, she'll probably have the
same problems anyway even with a new huge high gain and rubbish cable into
the loft.........Even if someone comes and does a good job it might not cure
the problem if it's an electrical inteference problem.............

Well, I popped over there on Friday evening around 7 to see what the
problem was, and to demonstrate us turning the electrics off.

What I saw was a very poor analogue signal on a reasonably new (she said
2 years) large TV (with a Freeview box below apparently unused).  Quite
a bit of snow (difficult to watch), very poor/choppy Teletext.
Apparently around 7:30pm she'd then see lots of jagged lines etc -
probably the interference she was talking about.  She demonstrated some
other channels which were much better (don't think perfect, but
certainly perfectly watchable)

To set in her mind it's not us causing it, I phoned my wife and got her
to turn all the circuits off and then the main switch.  Made no
difference to the picture (as expected).

I explained that I'd be looking at a problem with her aerial, aerial
lead or tuning (we have Crystal Palace and Guildford/A31/Hog's Back
transmitters locally).  From experience, my freeview box pointed at the
Hog's Back will auto-tune a couple of channels from Crystal Palace even
though it's a different polarisation and about 90 degrees to the side.
It might be the same with that particular channel being picked up from
the other transmitter - would explain why the other channels were okay.
Didn't want to start asking whether she'd retuned recently etc.

She was quite pleasant, not really accusing - more just couldn't explain
why about a week ago things started getting worse.  She said this
happened a few years ago and she called Ofcom out who checked all her
equipment and said it was fine.  Shortly afterwards the problem went
away so she told Ofcom not to follow it up.

I explained that weather can have a big effect on reception - but really
couldn't provide good explanation why it would be okay for a couple of
years and then be a problem again.  Similarly couldn't answer the
&quot;no-one's touched the aerial so why would it be a problem now, and why
did it get better before?&quot; question.

I recommended that she probably gets someone to look at the aerial and
lead and that might be tuning problems (as the other channels appear
pretty good).

She seemed happy that I'd taken a look and I think convinced it's
nothing to do with us.  Hopefully that'll be the end of it. ;)

She told me that her husband didn't agree with things being stuck on the
roof, so it was put in the loft (and then said &quot;I assume that thing up
there is yours then&quot; ;).  Nothing I could do would convince her that
putting it on the roof would give the best reception, especially as &quot;it
worked fine for years&quot;.

At least it being in the loft, her son can take a look and replace
easily.  I'm getting excellent (digital) reception from our local
transmitter with a loft mounted aerial.  I fitted it after our old
aerial's cable fell off (which we've now scapped).  For &lt; £30 I fitted a
new one to the loft to an old cable which was already there (previous
people ran it to the back bedroom from downstairs (presumably the Sky
box giving an extra feed).  Ideally would have wanted to replace that
cable but due to the position of where the cable came out the soffits,
it was hugely easier to use the old cable there (which was in good
condition) than rewire.  Had the signal been poor using that cable, I'd
have had to replace it, but its been okay for months now.  It'll
certainly be the first place I look if we ever get problems though.

He probably doesn't agree with the laws of physics either.

Anyway, I sometimes take part in a conversation that goes something like
this:
&quot;There's nothing wrong with the aerial.&quot;
&quot;There is, it's feeling faint. It needs some fresh air.&quot;
&quot;What are you on about?&quot;
Well if you'd let me put it outside where it can breathe it would be a lot
happier. It would appreciate the daylight as well.&quot;

I don't smoke, though.  TV signals certainly belt in here (analogue is
close to 80dBuV on my 'half way up the wall' mounted Blake DMX5W).
Don't understand the problems with DAB reception from the Cambridge
Mux.  Indoor piece of string brings in good reception, outdoor mast
mounted dipole brings in nothing.  I've tried moving it up &amp; down the
mast but no difference.  Peterborough mux is at full signal.

Well, D1 from Sandy on 11D is adjacent to Cambridge on 11C, but I'm
still 9 miles from t' Heath, so I wouldn't have thought it would
overload that much.

Wouldn't have thought so, you sure its not overloading something else
like a distribution amplifier?. If you are where I think you are the
signals from Madingley aren't that hot there...

No amps involved, straight from aerial to tuner.  I'm just outside St.
Neots (Beds side of A1) and I know Madingley ain't great here.  But
originally, I had the DAB dipole in a cupboard and it worked ok.  Even
better when put horizontally!  Just expected better results outside.
I'm surrounded by a lot of trees, which don't help.  Also got it fine
using a diplole when I lived in Bedford (roof mounted).  I'm not that
fussed about it, but if it's there, I want to pick it up.

Is it worth picking up;?..

I suspect that the front end of the DAB radio can't cope with the
adjacent channel, but since I refuse to have a DAB radio here on sound
quality grounds and theres no need for one, I can't comment any
further....

I suspect that your dipole is sometimes when in a certain position
discriminating against the wanted .. and unwanted signals...

The only reason I want to pick it up is for XFM, which ain't on
Freeview.  I'm gonna fiddle with it again today, if no success, I'll
just wait 10 months until the new local mux from  t' Heath comes
on-air.  That will have XFM on it, and THREE versions of Chiltern FM!

Don't matter now, coz I fixed it :-)
DAB dipole moved to bottom of mast, signal strength 50%, signal
quality 100%.  OK, DAB ain't great by any stretch, but my Arcam tuner
really does get the best it can from the low bit rates.  My previous
tuner (Cambridge Audio) was bloody awful.  As for a Sky dish, think
there's too many trees here to see a satellite.  The bloke above me
said the Sky bloke couldn't get a reliable signal because of the
trees, and the trees don't belong to me :-(
