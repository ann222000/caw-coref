&lt;&lt;JUVENTAS: The goddess who protected the IUVENES, men of military age. She had a shrine in the cella of MINERVA in the great temple on the Capitoline, and a temple close to the Circus Maximus. {HEBE} &gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;When the son Theseus gave the children of Heracles sanctuary in Marathon, causing a war with Eurystheus, IOLAUS, by then an old man, armed himself with weapons which he took from the walls of the temple. Despite protests that he was too old and weak to fight, IOLAUS jumped into a chariot, and cast a shadow over him. When the shadow lifted IOLAUS was revealed as a stalwart youth. He pursued and captured Eurystheous and took him back to Alcmene, mother of Heracles, to give her the privilege of deciding the fate of her son's enemy. But some say IOLAUS cut off Eurystheus' head and Alcmene then gouged out his eyes with a spike.&gt;&gt;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;{HEBE} is the YOUNGest daughter of Zeus &amp; Hera. {HEBE} was
the goddess of YOUTH and the servant of the Greco-Roman gods.

The only known account of her dealing with a mortal involved IOLAUS, the
nephew and former charioteer of Hercules. IOLAUS, now elderly, was about
to engage in personal combat with King Eurustheus, a cousin of Hercules
who the demigod also had to serve during his Twelve Labours for
immortality. IOLAUS requested to {HEBE} that he have his YOUTH again
for one day so that he could fight Eurystheus, and this {HEBE} granted.

&quot;{HEBE}, the most beautiful of the goddesses, walks forever in Olympus
beside her mother Hera, goddess of marriage&quot; [Pindar, Nemean 10.15]

&quot;I am no worshipper of Hygia, who was the daughter of that old herb
-doctor Asclepius ... but rather of {HEBE} ... who had the power of
restoring gods &amp; men to the vigour of YOUTH. She was probably the
only thoroughly sound-conditioned, healthy, and robust YOUNG lady
that ever walked the globe, and whenever she came it was SPRING.&quot;
-- [Henry David Thoreau 1817-1862, Walden]

On the 14th anniversary of Anne Hathaway's death [August 6, ­1637]

Ben Jonson was BURIED UPRIGHT leaning against the WALL
of his Westminster Abbey crypt as requested:

[BE] [RE]
[HE] [VE]

'TWO FEET BY TWO FEET WILL do for all I want'. - Ben Jonson
------------------------------------------------------------­----

Ben Jonson (1573-1637), dramatist and poet, is the only person buried
in an upright position in Westminster Abbey. He was educated at
Westminster School at the expense of one of the masters there, William
Camden. He possibly attended St John's College, Cambridge and then
went into trade as a bricklayer for a short time. He fought with the
English troops in Flanders and on returning to London he married, but
no children survived him. He became an actor &amp; playwright. In 1598 he
killed a fellow actor in a duel but escaped hanging and was imprisoned
as a felon for a short time. This incident does not seem to have
affected his reputation. His play 'EVERy Man in his Humour' included
Shakespeare in its cast. Jonson was a well-known writer of masques
and a tutor to Sir Walter Raleigh's son. He became Poet Laureate
in 1619 (although it was not a formal appointment).'

Jonson always seemed to be poor, in spite of gifts from royalty, and he
died in great poverty in a house near the Abbey. One story says that
he begged '18 inches of square ground in Westminster Abbey' from King
Charles I. Another story says that 'one day, being railed by the Dean
of Westminster about being buried in Poets' Corner, the poet is said to
have replied 'I am too poor for that and no one will lay out funeral
charges upon me. No, sir, six feet long by two feet wide is too much
for me: two feet by two feet will do for all I want'. 'You shall have
it' said the Dean'. So Jonson was buried standing on his feet in the
northern aisle of the Nave and not in Poets' Corner. At this period
the design on the Nave floor included several lines of stones measuring
eighteen inches square (the rest being in a lozenge pattern), to which
Jonson was obviously referring in his conversation with the Dean. The
simple inscription 'O RARE Ben Johnson', was said to have been done
at the expense of JACK YOUNG who was walking by when the grave
was cOVERed &amp; gave the MASON 18 pence to cut it. The inscription has
also been ascribed to Sir William D'Avenant, Jonson's successor as Poet
Laureate, on whose own gravestone in the Abbey the words 'O RARE...'
also appear. Jonson's original stone was moved in the l9th century
to the base of the wall opposite the grave to preserve it.&gt;&gt;

O RARE Ben IOSONN
-------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;Four Epytaphs made by the Countes [sic] of Oxenford,
after the death of her YOUNG SONNe, the Lord Bulbecke, &amp;c.­&quot;

Idall, for *ADON*, ne'er shed so many tears:
Nor Thet' for Pelid: nor Phoebus, for Hyacinthus
Nor for *ATIS*, the mother of Prophetesses:
As for the death of Bulbecke, the Gods have cares.
At the bruit of it, the Aphroditan Queen,
Caused more silVER to distill from her eyes
Than when the drops of her cheeks raised Daisies:
And to die with him, mortal she would have been.
The Charits, for it break their Peruqs of gold:
The Muses and the NYMPHS of CAVEs: I behold&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The Renaissance abounded with visual images warning of the
d­anger of (female) lust. See the picture of Lechery or Excess
from Andrea Alciato's Book
of Emblems (1531), a work which went through many editions
in Shakespea­re's time. In particular, Alciato depicted pictorially
The Amulet of Venus
in which Venus covers ADONIS with LETTUCE,
a symbol denoting the exhaustion of the female geni­tals .&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

{HEBE}: the daughter of Zeus and Hera. Legend has it that
she was born not of their union, but of a very strange conception:
when Hera having been invited to dinner by Apollo, ate of some
wild LETTUCE and in this manner became pregnant.

{HEBE} above all others symbolized YOUTH - vivacity,
élan &amp; beauty which characterize the tender period of human life.
Her chief duty was to offer nectar and ambrosia to the gods.

Ambrosia was the food that kept the gods eternally young &amp; protected
them from the attrition of time. Thus the gods remained strong and
beautiful, while {HEBE} was the personification of eternal YOUTH.
She lost her position as cup-bearer of the gods, however, as the result
of a fall which exposed her to the eyes of all in a rather indecent posture.
Her nakedness shocked the gods, and this unseemliness being considered
ill-matched to the manners of the Olympians, she was henceforth deemed
unfit to perform her former duties. She was soon replaced by Ganymede,
distinguished among mortals for his extraordinary beauty, who charmed
even Zeus himself. Zeus is said either to have ordered an eagle to
seize Ganymede and bring him to Olympus, or else to have carried
the YOUTH off himself, in order to take him into his service.

{HEBE}, of course, continued to live with the gods after being replaced.
She, together with Ganymede, the Graces, Harmony, Aphrodite and possibly
Artemis, was one of the Olympian dancers. The dance was accompanied by
the music of the Muses and Apollo's lyre. {HEBE}'s relationship with her
mother was very strong; indeed, she helped Hera with all her chores.
When her mother had to depart, {HEBE} prepared her chariot.
She also attended to her brother, the warlike Ares,
whenever he returned from battle.

{HEBE} also marked the reconciliation between Hera &amp; Hercules, who was
of course Zeus' son by another woman. When on his death the hero was
admitted to Olympus as a god, {HEBE} was first betrothed to him &amp;
later married him. From this union were born two children, Alexiares
&amp; Anicetus. This marriage guaranteed Hercules' eternal YOUTH,
safe from all ills, thanks to the ambrosia {HEBE} fed him.
Legend has it that Hercules intervened with his wife
to have his nephew IOLAUS restored to YOUTH.

Book IX Ovid's Metamorphoses, 1567 -- Arthur Golding

Now whyle that Iole made
Report of this same woondrous tale, and whyle Alcmena (who
Did weepe) was drying up the teares of Iole weeping too,
By putting to her thomb: there hapt a sodeine thing so straunge,
That unto mirth from heavinesse theyr harts it streight did chaunge.
For at the doore in manner even a very boy as then
With short soft Downe about his chin, revoked backe agen
To YOUTHfull yeares, stood Iolay with countnance smooth and trim.
Dame {HEBEE}, Junos daughter, had bestowde this gift on him, ...
Entreated at his earnest sute. Whom mynding fully there
The giving of like gift ageine to any to forsweare,
Dame Themis would not suffer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
{HEBE}, Cup-bearer of the Gods

&lt;&lt;After Hercules died, became a god, and ascended to Mount Olympus,
he married yet again, to the goddess {HEBE}, the gods' cup-bearer,
pouring and bringing them wine.

{HEBE} was worshipped as a goddess of pardons or forgiveness;
freed prisoners would hang their chains in the sacred grove
of her sanctuary at Phlius.

Now the gods, seated by the side of Zeus, were holding assembly
on the golden floor, and in their midst the queenly {HEBE} poured
them nectar, and they with golden goblets pledged one the other...
Homer, Iliad 4.1

And mighty Heracles, the valiant son of NEAT-ankled Alcmena, when
he had finished his grievous toils, made {HEBE} the child of great
Zeus and goldshod Hera his shy wife in snowy Olympus. Happy he!
For he has finished his great work and lives amongst the undying
gods, untroubled and unaging all his days. Hesiod, Theogony 950
