FULFILLMENT OF THE COVENANT OF MOSES

Passing of Mosaic Law
Matthew 5:17-18, &quot;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say
unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no
wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&quot;

There are two points in Jesus' statement.
1) He came to fulfill the Law, and
2) &quot;Till heaven and earth pass,&quot; the law will not pass away until all is
fulfilled.

This second part has two parts:
a) &quot;till heaven and earth pass;&quot; and,
b) &quot;until all is fulfilled.&quot;

Both parts of this second clause must be fulfilled before Mosaic Law
passes away.

A Preterist asked:
&quot;Jesus came to fulfill the law. He specifically stated WHEN the Mosaic
Law would pass. It would pass when &quot;heaven and earth pass&quot; and when &quot;all
(prophesy) be fulfilled.&quot; If heaven and earth did not pass, or if all
prophesy has not been fulfilled, why, dear reader, are you not keeping
the Mosaic law?&quot;

The question suffers from serious fallacy, as will be demonstrated.

A Preterist said, &quot;Jesus said it would not pass, and must be obeyed,
until these things happen.&quot;

Jesus did not say &quot;it would not pass, and must be obeyed,&quot; these words
are not in the scripture; they were composed by the person making this
false statement.

My Answer to this Question is in two parts:
Part One, The Gentiles
Part Two, The Jews

Part One, The Gentiles

Some tell us that Jesus meant &quot;until the heaven and earth pass away you
must observe the Law of Moses and offer animal sacrifice for your sins.&quot;

Is that what Jesus said?

Jesus statement contains three parts:
a) He came to fulfill the Law
b) Till heaven and earth pass,
c) Not the smallest part of the Law will be removed, till all be fulfilled

It is inferred by His statement, that when all is fulfilled AND heaven
and earth pass away THEN the Law will pass away.

Contrary to Preterist Doctrine,
1) Jesus did fulfill the Law's demand for sacrifice
2) Heaven and earth have NOT passed, and
3) NOT one jot or tittle has passed from the Law

1) &quot;Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain
one new man, so making peace. Ephesians 2:15, Colossians 2:14, Romans
6:14, Gal 3:13 and 5:18, &quot;But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not
under the law.

The fact is:
It Was His Death As The Lamb of God Which Removed Us From The Law--not
that a jot or tittle has passed from the law.

The question, &quot;if the Law has not passed, then why aren't you offering
animal sacrifice for you sin&quot; is based on illogic and a wrong
interpretation of His Word.

To attempt to answerer this question one accepts the false premise that
Jesus meant &quot;until the Law pass away you must observe the Law of Moses
and offer animal sacrifice for your sin.&quot; And, that for the Law to pass
away the heaven and earth must pass away.

To refute the false premise and wrong interpretation of His Word
contained in that question, one must correct them before attempting to
answer that question. Actually, once the fallacy is exposed and the
wrong assumption corrected, then there is no question.

First, if the assumption were correct, (that the law remained in force
until the heaven and earth passed away [according to Preterism, in AD
70]) then the Gentiles would have been required to keep the Law until
the destruction of Jerusalem.

Contrary to the Preterists fallacy, the Gentiles were never required to
keep the Law of Moses.

Acts 15:1-33, (This is a Must read.)
Luke relates that certain men attempted to get the gentiles to obey the
Law of Moses.

24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have
troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be
circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send
chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the
same things by mouth.
28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no
greater burden than these necessary things;
29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from
things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep
yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.

Note v 24 &quot;Have Troubled You with Words, Subverting Your Souls, saying,
Ye must be circumcised, and Keep The Law: to whom we gave no such
commandment...&quot;

Some men had been attempting (even as some do to this day) to require
others to obey the Law of Moses.

Please note the phrase &quot;and Keep the Law.&quot; Up to the time Luke is
describing, the Gentiles had not been required to keep the Law of Moses.

At that time, according to the false Doctrine of the Preterists, the
earth had not &quot;passed away.&quot; The heaven and earth had not yet passed
away at the time which the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; was written, and the
Apostles knew of Jesus' words.

Now, the contention of some is that since the earth has not yet passed
away, then the Law is still in force. According to this false
interpretation of Jesus words, the Law of Moses must have been in force
during the time of the writing of the Book of Acts, and when Paul and
Barnabas brought this question to the Apostles in Jerusalem.

Did the Apostles require the Gentiles to keep the Law of Moses? No! &quot;We
gave no such commandment.&quot; v 24.

If the Apostles and Holy Ghost had interpreted Jesus words in the same
way the Preterists do, then they would have answered the same way the
Preterists do: that &quot;you must keep the Law of Moses, be circumcised and
offer animal sacrifice, until the heaven and earth pass.&quot;

But, They Did Not!

The Apostles did not tell us that we need to continue to make animal
sacrifices until the earth passed away, because they knew Jesus did not
say that.

Conclusion, Part One:
a) Before Salvation came to the Gentiles they were not required to keep
the Law of Moses;
b) Then after Salvation came to the Gentiles, they were not required to
keep the law before AD 70, and were never required (according to Acts
15:1-33) to keep the Law of Moses
c) Therefore, This question is based on fallacy and is an intent to
deceive.

Part Two, The Jews

The question, &quot;If the Law of Moses has not passed away then why don't
you practice animal sacrifice,&quot; is based, in the very least, on a fallacy.

It is impossible to answer the question except by allowing the wrong
assumption. The option; is to correct the wrong assumption. Actually,
once the fallacy is exposed, there is no question.

The false assumption is: that the law has passed away, and that that is
why we don't practice animal sacrifice; or, that if the heaven and earth
have not passed away, the Law has not passed, and then we must practice
animal sacrifice. The obvious intent of the question is to convince you
that both the Law and the Heavens and earth passed away in AD 70.

Jesus said, &quot;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say
unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no
wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Mat. 5:17-18.

His statement has three parts:
a) Till heaven and earth pass
b) One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law,
c) Till all be fulfilled

In the context of His speech, &quot;all&quot; includes the prophecies of his
second coming. In direct contradiction of the sophistry on which the
question is based:
1) All Prophecy has NOT been fulfilled
2) Heaven and earth have NOT passed away
3) NOT a jot or a tittle has passed from the Law

His death as the Lamb of God fulfilled the Law's demand for sacrifice.
&quot;Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which
was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross&quot;
Colossians 2:14

&quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law,
but under grace.&quot; Romans 6:14, &quot;IFyou are under Grace, you are not under
the Law...&quot;

&quot;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse
for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.&quot;
Gal 3:13 and 5:18, &quot;But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the
law.&quot; Eph 2:15. &quot;IF you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law...&quot;

The false premise, from which the Preterists begin their question, is
that the ONLY reason we do not practice the Law of Moses and offer
animal sacrifice is because the Law has passed away, and for that to
have occurred, the heaven and earth must also have passed away. This is
delusion.

The Law of Moses is not practiced for two reasons, Because:
a) Faith in Christ's Death as the Lamb of God brings salvation--the Law
does not; and,
b) because Christ fulfilled the demand of the Law for sacrifice, IF you
accept His Sacrifice. Gal. 3:13.

Those Jews who do not accept the Sacrifice of the Lamb of God are still
under the Law, However:
a) God has removed the Temple, and
b) God removed the Levite Priesthood.

Even if a Jew, or any person, wished to obey the Law of Moses, without a
Levite Priest he cannot.

The Preterists begin their false doctrine by basing it on a wrong
interpretation of His Word:
a) That when Jesus said, &quot;This generation shall not pass away until all
is fulfilled...&quot; He could have ONLY been speaking to the men who heard
His words... Mat 24:29.
b) Therefore, (according to Preterism) All prophecy was fulfilled in AD
70; the Lord did come, and heaven and earth (by a mythical definition)
passed away, and therefore The Law has passed.

They use their fallacy (the heavens and earth have passed and all has
been fulfilled) in an attempt to convince you that unless their wrong
assumptions are accepted as true then you must obey the Law of Moses and
replace Christ with animal sacrifice.

Conclusion, Part Two:

a) The death of the Lamb of God fulfilled

&gt;&gt; have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must
&gt;&gt; be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such
&gt;&gt; commandment: 25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one
&gt;&gt; accord, to send
&gt;&gt; chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
&gt;&gt; 26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
&gt;&gt; Christ. 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also
&gt;&gt; tell you the
&gt;&gt; same things by mouth.
&gt;&gt; 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you
&gt;&gt; no greater burden than these necessary things;
&gt;&gt; 29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and
&gt;&gt; from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep
&gt;&gt; yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.

&gt;&gt; Note v 24 &quot;Have Troubled You with Words, Subverting Your Souls,
&gt;&gt; saying,
&gt;&gt; Ye must be circumcised, and Keep The Law: to whom we gave no such
&gt;&gt; commandment...&quot;

&gt;&gt; Some men had been attempting (even as some do to this day) to require
&gt;&gt; others to obey the Law of Moses.

&gt;&gt; Please note the phrase &quot;and Keep the Law.&quot; Up to the time Luke is
&gt;&gt; describing, the Gentiles had not been required to keep the Law of
&gt;&gt; Moses.

&gt;&gt; At that time, according to the false Doctrine of the Preterists, the
&gt;&gt; earth had not &quot;passed away.&quot; The heaven and earth had not yet passed
&gt;&gt; away at the time which the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; was written, and
&gt;&gt; the Apostles knew of Jesus' words.

&gt;&gt; Now, the contention of some is that since the earth has not yet
&gt;&gt; passed away, then the Law is still in force. According to this false
&gt;&gt; interpretation of Jesus words, the Law of Moses must have been in
&gt;&gt; force during the time of the writing of the Book of Acts, and when
&gt;&gt; Paul and Barnabas brought this question to the Apostles in Jerusalem.

&gt;&gt; Did the Apostles require the Gentiles to keep the Law of Moses? No!
&gt;&gt; &quot;We gave no such commandment.&quot; v 24.

&gt;&gt; If the Apostles and Holy Ghost had interpreted Jesus words in the
&gt;&gt; same
&gt;&gt; way the Preterists do, then they would have answered the same way the
&gt;&gt; Preterists do: that &quot;you must keep the Law of Moses, be circumcised
&gt;&gt; and offer animal sacrifice, until the heaven and earth pass.&quot;

&gt;&gt; But, They Did Not!

&gt;&gt; The Apostles did not tell us that we need to continue to make animal
&gt;&gt; sacrifices until the earth passed away, because they knew Jesus did
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; say that.

&gt;&gt; Conclusion, Part One:
&gt;&gt; a) Before Salvation came to the Gentiles they were not required to
&gt;&gt; keep
&gt;&gt; the Law of Moses;
&gt;&gt; b) Then after Salvation came to the Gentiles, they were not required
&gt;&gt; to keep the law before AD 70, and were never required (according to
&gt;&gt; Acts 15:1-33) to keep the Law of Moses
&gt;&gt; c) Therefore, This question is based on fallacy and is an intent to
&gt;&gt; deceive.

&gt;&gt; Part Two, The Jews

&gt;&gt; The question, &quot;If the Law of Moses has not passed away then why don't
&gt;&gt; you practice animal sacrifice,&quot; is based, in the very least, on a
&gt;&gt; fallacy.

&gt;&gt; It is impossible to answer the question except by allowing the wrong
&gt;&gt; assumption. The option; is to correct the wrong assumption. Actually,
&gt;&gt; once the fallacy is exposed, there is no question.

&gt;&gt; The false assumption is: that the law has passed away, and that that
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; why we don't practice animal sacrifice; or, that if the heaven and
&gt;&gt; earth have not passed away, the Law has not passed, and then we must
&gt;&gt; practice animal sacrifice. The obvious intent of the question is to
&gt;&gt; convince you that both the Law and the Heavens and earth passed away
&gt;&gt; in AD 70.

&gt;&gt; Jesus said, &quot;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
&gt;&gt; prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say
&gt;&gt; unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in
&gt;&gt; no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Mat. 5:17-18.

&gt;&gt; His statement has three parts:
&gt;&gt; a) Till heaven and earth pass
&gt;&gt; b) One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law,
&gt;&gt; c) Till all be fulfilled

&gt;&gt; In the context of His speech, &quot;all&quot; includes the prophecies of his
&gt;&gt; second coming. In direct contradiction of the sophistry on which the
&gt;&gt; question is based:
&gt;&gt; 1) All Prophecy has NOT been fulfilled
&gt;&gt; 2) Heaven and earth have NOT passed away
&gt;&gt; 3) NOT a jot or a tittle has passed from the Law

&gt;&gt; His death as the Lamb of God fulfilled the Law's demand for
&gt;&gt; sacrifice. &quot;Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
&gt;&gt; against us, which
&gt;&gt; was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his
&gt;&gt; cross&quot; Colossians 2:14

&gt;&gt; &quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
&gt;&gt; law, but under grace.&quot; Romans 6:14, &quot;IFyou are under Grace, you are
&gt;&gt; not under the Law...&quot;

&gt;&gt; &quot;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
&gt;&gt; curse
&gt;&gt; for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
&gt;&gt; tree.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Gal 3:13 and 5:18, &quot;But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under
&gt;&gt; the law.&quot; Eph 2:15. &quot;IF you are led by the Spirit, you are not under
&gt;&gt; the Law...&quot;

&gt;&gt; The false premise, from which the Preterists begin their question, is
&gt;&gt; that the ONLY reason we do not practice the Law of Moses and offer
&gt;&gt; animal sacrifice is because the Law has passed away, and for that to
&gt;&gt; have occurred, the heaven and earth must also have passed away. This
&gt;&gt; is delusion.

&gt;&gt; The Law of Moses is not practiced for two reasons, Because:
&gt;&gt; a) Faith in Christ's Death as the Lamb of God brings salvation--the
&gt;&gt; Law does not; and,
&gt;&gt; b) because Christ fulfilled the demand of the Law for sacrifice, IF
&gt;&gt; you accept His Sacrifice. Gal. 3:13.

&gt;&gt; Those Jews who do not accept the Sacrifice of the Lamb of God are
&gt;&gt; still under the Law, However:
&gt;&gt; a) God has removed the Temple, and
&gt;&gt; b) God

While Glenn makes a beautiful case, given the loopholes in his version
of the bible one can run circles with &quot;the law&quot; on whether or not to
follow it.  Let's see what the scriptures say.

Mat 5:17 &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Torah or the
Prophets.1 I did not come to destroy but to complete.
Mat 5:18 &quot;For truly, I say to you, till the heaven and the earth pass
away, one jot or one tittle shall by no means pass from the Torah till
all be done.1 Footnote: 1Lk. 16:17.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There are two points in Jesus' statement.
&gt; 1) He came to fulfill the Law, and
&gt; 2) &quot;Till heaven and earth pass,&quot; the law will not pass away until all is
&gt; fulfilled.

&gt; This second part has two parts:
&gt; a) &quot;till heaven and earth pass;&quot; and,
&gt; b) &quot;until all is fulfilled.&quot;
">

You see, this is one problem with KJV, The Torah is called, &quot;the law&quot;
and that muddles things up.  While the Torah contains the law of
Mosheh, that is only one part of the five books.  It also contains
covenants with Adam and Noah in Genesis but no mention is made of that
here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Both parts of this second clause must be fulfilled before Mosaic Law
&gt; passes away.
">

Rom 3:31 Do we then nullify the Torah through the belief? Let it not
be! On the contrary, we establish the Torah.1 Footnote: 1See 7:12.

If we go before &quot;Moses&quot; to Noah, we find the original law that the
Messiah fulfilled.
If we examine the Covenant with Noah we find out it was a lot more
then just a promise not to destroy the earth,  I'll just highlight the
more important issues you've missed.

Gen 8:21 And      smelled a soothing fragrance, and      said in His
heart, &quot;Never again shall I curse the ground because of man, although
the inclination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and never again
smite all living creatures, as I have done,
Gen 8:22 as long as the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold
and heat, and winter and summer, and day and night shall not cease.&quot;

Now everybody reads this part and knows the sign of the Rainbow as the
covenant.
But this Covenant continues and Noah is told to cover the earth with
his descendant.

Gen 9:2 &quot;And the fear of you and the dread of you is on every beast of
the earth, on every bird of the heavens, on all that creeps on the
ground, and on all the fish of the sea - into your hand they have been
given.

Now this is pretty important because we know as long as Animals are
given to our hands, God's promise stands true.  But there's more,

Gen 9:3 &quot;Every moving creature that lives is food for you. I have
given you all, as I gave the green plants.
Gen 9:4 &quot;But do not eat flesh with its life, its blood.
Gen 9:5 &quot;But only your blood for your lives I require, from the hand
of every beast I require it, and from the hand of man. From the hand
of every man's brother I require the life of man.
Gen 9:6 &quot;Whoever sheds man's blood, by man his blood is shed, for in
the image of Elohim has He made man.

Now this is the most important part Did you read that blood was
required for the life of man by every mans brother?  Who is every mans
brother?

Mar 3:35 &quot;For whoever does the desire of Elohim is My brother and My
sister and mother.&quot;1 Footnote: 1Mt. 12:50, Lk. 8:21.

Because we were made in the image of Elohim, we are to blameless
before the Father.  To be the brother of the Messiah it is required
that we do the will of the Father in heaven.

Rom 7:11 For sin, having taken the occasion through the command,
deceived me, and through it killed me.
Rom 7:12 So that the Torah truly is set-apart, and the command set-
apart, and righteous, and good.

The fact of the Matter is that the law of Moses doesn't come later
until after this law called by Paul, The Law of SIN.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A Preterist said, &quot;Jesus said it would not pass, and must be obeyed,
&gt; until these things happen.&quot;
">

I would say you must do as the Messiah taught, to repent and obey the
commands.
Mat 15:3 But He answering, said to them, &quot;Why do you also transgress
the command of Elohim because of your tradition?

Mar 7:8 &quot;Forsaking the command of Elohim, you hold fast the tradition
of men.&quot;
Luk 17:10 &quot;So also you, when you have done all that you were
commanded, say, 'We are unworthy servants, we have done what was our
duty to do.' &quot;
Rev 14:12 Here is the endurance of the set-apart ones, here are those
guarding the commands of Elohim and the belief of      .

Here in Revelations we see that those set apart are those who guard
the commands and have the belief of the messiah.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some tell us that Jesus meant &quot;until the heaven and earth pass away you
&gt; must observe the Law of Moses and offer animal sacrifice for your sins.&quot;
&gt; Is that what Jesus said?
&gt; It is inferred by His statement, that when all is fulfilled AND heaven
&gt; and earth pass away THEN the Law will pass away.

&gt; Contrary to Preterist Doctrine,
&gt; 1) Jesus did fulfill the Law's demand for sacrifice - agreed
&gt; 2) Heaven and earth have NOT passed, and - agreed
&gt; 3) NOT one jot or tittle has passed from the Law - agreed
&gt; 1) &quot;Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
&gt; commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain
&gt; one new man, so making peace. Ephesians 2:15, Colossians 2:14, Romans
&gt; 6:14, Gal 3:13 and 5:18, &quot;But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not
&gt; under the law.
">

Again you make the mistake of leaving out important parts of this
doctrine.
Sin separated us from Elohim in the flesh and it is by his spirit that
we are now rejoined to the body of Israel.  So let's put that into
context for the reader:

Eph 2:11 Therefore remember that you, once gentiles1 in the flesh, who
are called 'the uncircumcision' by what is called 'the circumcision'
made in the flesh by hands, Footnote: 11 Cor. 12:2.
Eph 2:12 that at that time you were without Messiah, excluded from the
citizenship of Yisra' l and strangers from the covenants of promise,
having no expectation and without Elohim in the world.
Eph 2:13 But now in Messiah       you who once were far off have been
brought near by the blood of the Messiah.
Eph 2:14 For He is our peace, who has made both one, and having broken
down the partition of the barrier,
Eph 2:15 having abolished in His flesh the enmity - the Torah of the
commands in dogma - so as to create in Himself one renewed man from
the two, thus making peace,
Eph 2:16 and to completely restore to favour both of them unto Elohim
in one body through the stake, having destroyed the enmity by it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The fact is:
&gt; It Was His Death As The Lamb of God Which Removed Us From The Law--not
&gt; that a jot or tittle has passed from the law.

&gt; To attempt to answerer this question one accepts the false premise that
&gt; Jesus meant &quot;until the Law pass away you must observe the Law of Moses
&gt; and offer animal sacrifice for your sin.&quot; And, that for the Law to pass
&gt; away the heaven and earth must pass away.

&gt; To refute the false premise and wrong interpretation of His Word
&gt; contained in that question, one must correct them before attempting to
&gt; answer that question. Actually, once the fallacy is exposed and the
&gt; wrong assumption corrected, then there is no question.
">

This is a correct statement if the writer had known which Covenant he
was speaking of when Paul wrote of the Law of Sin.  Elohim must punish
sin and because of that we are worthy of death.  The Lamb came to
destroy the law of Sin that we may be rejoined by the spirit of Elohim
and the two brought back together after the first death.

Rom 5:12 For this reason, even as through one man sin did enter into
the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men,
because all sinned -
Rom 5:12 For this reason, even as through one man sin did enter into
the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men,
because all sinned -
Rom 5:13 for until the Torah, sin was in the world, but sin is not
reckoned when there is no Torah.
Rom 5:14 But death reigned from Ad am until Mosheh, even over those
who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of
Ad am, who is a type of Him who was to come.
Rom 5:15 But the favourable gift is not like the trespass. For if by
the one man's trespass many died, much more the favour of Elohim, and
the gift in favour of the one Man,       Messiah, overflowed to many.

It clearly says that death and sin are what entered at Adam and the
Messiah became our sacrifice for all.

&gt; FULFILLMENT OF THE COVENANT OF MOSES
&gt; Passing of Mosaic Law
&gt; Matthew 5:17-18, &quot;Think not that I am come to destroy the
&gt; law, or the
&gt; prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For
&gt; verily I say
&gt; unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
&gt; tittle shall in no
&gt; wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&quot;
">

My take on it is simple. The heavens and the earth cannot
pass away before the Law is fulfilled. Since I believe the
heavens and the earth can *never* really pass away, but only
its current fallen state, I believe the Law of Moses *must*
have its fulfillment at some point in time.

And this fulfillment must continue to be worked out until
its full program is completed, before even the current state
of the heavens and earth is finally changed into its eternal
form. In fact, I believe that this final change coming to
the heavens and the earth is part of this fulfillment of the
Law of Moses.

The fulfillment of the Law of Moses, of every signification
of the dots and tittles of the Law, began to be fulfilled in
Christ. Every command was fulfilled in Christ's
righteousness and in Israel's unrighteousness. This means
that even though a relative few were obedient under the Law,
as a whole the nation failed under the Law, and every
command under the Law was therefore fulfilled in Israel's
failure and in their failure to accept Jesus as their
Messiah.

The righteousness of Christ fulfilled the Law because he
displayed the moral character that the Law pointed to, a
righteousness that was intended to be fulfilled in Christ
and not in Israel under the Law itself. Therefore, the Law
and its commands began to be fulfilled when Christ appeared
and continues to be fulfilled in all those who have received
Christ's spirit and righteousness. In the end humanity will
be resurrected into an eternal form, and heaven and earth
will also receive an eternal form, when the age of sin
passes away from existence.

The statement that God will not curse the ground or smite all living

The covenant God made with the Fathers, the Law of Moses, is

When I say it has &quot;passed away,&quot; I'm saying it has lost its
effectiveness. God no longer honors that contractual system.
One of the parties has failed to keep his part of the
bargain. And so the whole agreement is off. Israel failed to
observe the Law as a nation. And now Israel no longer has a
system by which to hope for national blessing (except for
Christ).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

We can definitely agree on that word--&quot;superceded.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, the covenant is not in a state of &quot;non-existence&quot;

Yes, no longer a system honored by God. Israel may go back
to practising it. But God no longer honors it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's correct. And that's why they continue to claim to be
under that system. But it is a *dead* system!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Even though the Law was designed to be a continuing
&gt;&gt; contract, it could fail.

Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; As I said, the Law of Moses was specifically given to
&gt;&gt; Israel
&gt;&gt; alone. And if it failed, it wasn't even good for Israel.
&gt; I do agree with your point. It was never given to
&gt; Gentiles, and expired
&gt; with the ratification of the New Covenant. It is just
&gt; that, even if it
&gt; is null, it still exists. It is of value ONLY as a tutor,
&gt; now.
">

I don't know what kind of &quot;tutor&quot; it is, because Paul used
that term with regard to a time when it was still effective.
But the Law is certainly still in the Christian Bible and
contains a testimony as to how God acted in one particular
time in history. It's a valid record of what God is like.
And it helps us understand how preparation had been in the
works in anticipation of Christ's coming. All of the works
under the Law that purified from sin and tried to instill
holiness was an acknowledgment of the imperfections of the
Mosaic system and of the need to find a holiness that will
last in the coming Christ.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and sane, reason we should believe ANYTHING the bible says/

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; SOL?

does
&gt; &gt; not

&gt; &gt;&gt; Why, then, are you wasting your time - and obviously your mind, on such
&gt; &gt;&gt; fairy tales, fantasies and fabrications?

&gt; &gt; It's there but you can't see it.

&gt; &gt; But you'll see Him.

&gt; Oh ... you mean like the &quot;pretend&quot; black cat, that's in a totally darkend

God is Holy, and His People should be holy.

Under the Old Covenant, we attempted to be holy (follow His Law) by the

Under the New Covenant we want to live holy lives because we know Him

It does. It exists as a testimony to Israel's eternal

Yes, as long as we don't think the Law is still an

indeed under the law.  I could point out a dozen scriptures where the
Messiah said to &quot;Obey the Commandments&quot; and you will reply by saying
that You prefer Paul over the Messiah.

I will point out a dozen scriptures where Paul said &quot;Obey the
Commandments&quot; and you will cherry pick one of three scriptures and say
that you don't have to obey.

Finally, you'll say that when the Messiah died he stated, &quot;it is
completed&quot;. And you will say ... see, the law is dead and I don't have
to obey.  Regardless of what scriptures say you will find a way to
justify yourself without the law and say that the Messiah will redeem
you without good works and without the law.

Because you are lawless you will do anything to reason from your
belief to keep your Satanic SUNday worship.  You have no desire to do
the will of the Father in heaven and believe that you can continue
your SUN worship because that is your God.  The SUN after all doesn't
give you laws and you have chosen to worship the created instead of
the Creator.  You consider the SUN LORD.   You worship your God on
SUNday instead of the Sabbath that was established forever.

Finally when you become desperate because you can't argue out of
scripture you will make the statement that the Law is only for the
Jews.  You'll say that is was for one specific tribe and nobody else
and your right.  The law is only for the children of Elohim and
clearly you are a child of the SUN LORD.

Your heart is hard because you choose man made traditions of the SUN
LORD over the tradition of the one true Elohim of Scriptures.  You
make believe and reason because you and every Sabbath breaking Sun
Worshipper must be right and are unable to simply repent and sin no
more.

The fact that the KJV has flaws doesn't mean that you can't still
arrive at the truth using the KJV but it does lack a certain amount of
clarity was my point.  One example is calling the Torah, &quot;the law&quot; and
not being specific because the Torah is much more then just, &quot;the
law&quot;.

&gt; &gt; of the bible one can run circles with &quot;the law&quot; on whether or not to
&gt; &gt; follow it.  Let's see what the scriptures say.

&gt; Which will be fine, as long as you don't confuse Oranges and Apples, or
&gt; take words out of their context...

What like you do?  Here is a simple statement that I took that clearly
states the Messiah completed the work of the Torah and not to do away
with it.

&gt; &gt; Mat 5:17 &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Torah or the

You're using a circular argument that says completed means done away
with.  Completed does not mean the law is made void.

&gt; &gt; You see, this is one problem with KJV, The Torah is called, &quot;the law&quot;
&gt; &gt; and that muddles things up.
&gt; Your thinking is muddled up... But Jesus thinking is not:

Since your SUN LORD must be right.  You're the one who is fighting
against clear scriptural teachings, not me.  I quoted a scripture and
your response is that my thinking is muddled?  SUN worshipper hate the
entire scriptures that tell them to repent and go and sin no more and
obey the commands.

&gt; &gt; required for the life of man by every mans brother?  Who is every mans
&gt; &gt; brother?

&gt; Not &quot;blood&quot; is required, but YOUR Blood is required.

&gt; Which has nothing to do with Keeping the Law of Moses, since you have

&gt; without keeping the Law of Moses. (see below.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I would say, that if you live by the Law, you will be judged by the Law,
&gt; NOT the New Covenant -- after all, isn't that what Paul said?.
">

Now you bring up yet another fatal flaw in your logic.

1) The law is perfect and yet you wish to kill that perfection

Jas 1:25 But he that looked into the perfect Torah, that of freedom,1
and continues in it, not becoming a hearer that forgets, but a doer of
work, this one shall be blessed in his doing of the Torah.

Psa 19:7  The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
Psa 19:7 The Torah of      is perfect, bringing back the being; The
witness of      is trustworthy, making wise the simple;

2) You are not under the new covenant!  The new covenant will be
established in the reigns of heaven.  You are without the law, I agree
with you completely.

I love the fact that you quoted the new covenant and like all law
breakers left out the important verse to follow that reads

Jer 31:36 &quot;If these laws vanish from before Me,&quot; declares     , &quot;then
the seed of Yisra' l shall also cease from being a nation before Me
forever.&quot;

Clearly you are not in the new covenant because His laws are not in
your mind and heart when you say they are dead or void, if they had
been you would have remembered the Sabbath to keep it set apart.

Heb 8:10 &quot;Because this is the covenant that I shall make with the
house of Yisra' l after those days, says     , giving My laws in their
mind, and I shall write them on their hearts, and I shall be their
Elohim, and they shall be My people.
Heb 8:11 &quot;And they shall by no means teach each one his neighbour, and
each one his brother, saying, 'Know     ,' because they all shall know
Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.
Heb 8:12 &quot;Because I shall forgive their unrighteousness, and their
sins and their lawlessnesses I shall no longer remember.&quot;

The law is not on your heart and mind and that is why you disregard
them and say you are not under any law, lawless one.

Heb 10:16 &quot;This is the covenant that I shall make with them after
those days, says     , giving My laws into their hearts, and in their
minds I shall write them,&quot;

Here is the description of you:

Heb 12:17 For you know that afterward, when he wished to inherit the
blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance,
though he sought it with tears.
Heb 12:18 For you have not drawn near to a mountain touched and
scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness and storm,
Heb 12:19 and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of words, so that
those who heard it begged that no further Word should be spoken to
them,1 Footnote: 1Ex. 20:19.
Heb 12:20 for they could not bear what was commanded, &quot;If even a beast
touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot through with an
arrow.&quot;

And here is the New Covenant in heaven

Heb 12:21 And so fearsome was the sight that Mosheh said, &quot;I
exceedingly fear and tremble.&quot;
Heb 12:22 But you have drawn near to Mount Tsiyon and to the city of
the living Elohim, to the heavenly Yerushalayim, to myriads of
messengers,
Heb 12:23 to the entire gathering and assembly of the first-born
having been enrolled in heaven, and to Elohim the Judge of all, and to
the spirits of righteous men made perfect,
Heb 12:24 and to       the Mediator1 of a new covenant, and to the
blood of sprinkling which speaks better than the blood of Heb el.
Footnote: 1See 8:6.
Heb 12:25 Take heed not to refuse the One speaking. For if those did
not escape who refused the warning on earth, much less we who turn
away from Him from heaven,
Heb 12:26 whose voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised,
saying, &quot;Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also the
heaven.&quot;
Heb 12:27 And this, &quot;Yet once more,&quot; makes clear the removal of what
is shaken - as having been made - so that the unshaken matters might
remain.
Heb 12:28 Therefore, receiving an unshakeable reign, let us hold the
favour, through which we serve Elohim pleasingly with reverence and
awe,
Heb 12:29 for indeed, our Elohim is a consuming fire.

You don't even know what covenants Jesus completed because all you
want to do is be lawless and without the law.  I agree that you are
not under any law and that you are lawless.  Enjoy your lawless
freedom on earth

Open up a Strong's Concordance and you will find the
instances of English words, yes. But on the side of each
word you will find a number that references a Greek word,
which can be found in the back of the book. When you look up
each English word, it is given in a partial context, and the
reference at any rate is given so you can look up the

I find it interesting that other people are more interested in what
other books say besides the scriptures.  I wouldn't be to worried
randy since all you have to do is get e-sword and download free copies
of all those books you mentioned.

Mat 7:21 &quot;Not everyone who says to Me, 'Master, Master,' shall enter
into the reign of the heavens, but he who is doing the desire of My
Father in the heavens.
Mat 7:22 &quot;Many shall say to Me in that day, 'Master, Master, have we
not prophesied in Your Name, and cast out demons in Your Name, and
done many mighty works in Your Name?'
Mat 7:23 &quot;And then I shall declare to them, 'I never knew you, depart
from Me, you who work lawlessness!'1 Footnote: 1 See v. 15.
Mat 7:24 &quot;Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does
them, shall be like a wise man who built his house on the rock,

LAWLESSNESS means not under the law because you believe it's been
voided somehow.

I wish that some of you guys would take the time to make a better case
for why you can ignore the Sabbath when I just tore apart this one.

Heb 4:9 So there remains a Sabbath-keeping for the people of Elohim.

Act 17:2 And according to his practice, Sha'ul went in unto them, and
for three Sabbaths was reasoning with them from the Scriptures,

Act 20:6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened
Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven
days.

Look at all the references to Paul keeping the Law.. ignore them as
always.

Rev 14:12

(ESV)  Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep
the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.

(KJVR)  Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

(The Scriptures 1998+) Here is the endurance of the set-apart ones,
here are those guarding the commands of Elohim and the belief of
.

Ignore your scriptures at your own peril.

as you can see 'fulfilled' has nothing to do with eradication or

one perfectly reaches capacity and it is sustained.

the christian propaganda reinterpretion of this passage claims that

&gt; &gt; LOL  -- a 'Concordance' is merely a listing of instances

&gt; &gt; words in an English translation and tells us NOTHING about
&gt; &gt; the lexemic
&gt; &gt; approximations in context.

&gt; Open up a Strong's Concordance and you will find the
&gt; instances of English words, yes. But on the side of each
&gt; word you will find a number that references a Greek word,
&gt; which can be found in the back of the book. When you look up
&gt; each English word, it is given in a partial context, and the
&gt; reference at any rate is given so you can look up the
&gt; context in more detail.

&gt; So whatever you meant by your claim, it seems misleading.

&gt; &gt; You are completely befuddled about your Bible tools

&gt; your core dilemma i supsect is in your presumption of a 'new covenant'

">

In reality, the Torah covenant is at the heart of the renewed covenant.
The basic difference for us in our relationship to Torah today and what
the people's relationship to Torah was prior to Messiah, is that at that
time they addressed God's Law through the Levitical and Aaronic
priesthoods, but today it is through the Melchisedekian priesthood.

But the idea that it is somehow 'easier' today is false.  Messiah showed
us that under the Melchisedekian priesthood of the Renewed Covenant, the
bar was not lowered as so many believe, but raised.

Messiah said, &quot;It is written: 'Do no murder' but I say if you hate a man
in your heart then you have murdered him already.&quot;  and &quot;It is written,
'Do no adultery' but I say to you if you lust in your heart then you
have already committed adultery.&quot; and finally, &quot;be ye perfect as your
Father in heaven is perfect.&quot;

Further scripture reveals that even Saul/Paul was a zealous keeper of
the Torah, and he took a cue from Messiah's teachings to interpret &quot;do
not muzzle the ox which treads the grain&quot; to mean that one should
provide for people whose entire life was given to reaping the harvest of
souls in the spreading of the Good News.

Today, all of Torah is a Halacha of spiritual interpretation.  The
verbatim has ceded to the metaphor, and where the letter once showed the
way to death, the Spirit now reveals the way of life.  This is why
Jeremiah's covenant was not truly the 'new' covenant, but the 'renewed'
covenant.  Torah Law, but under the Melchisedekian (rather than
levitical or Aaronic) priesthood.

I already showed you that it did. I provided passages from
Matthew that used the word in the sense of prophetic
fulfillment. It's strange that you fail to recognize that!

I have no dilemma. My &quot;presumption&quot; is based on Matthew's
reference to &quot;fulfillment,&quot; which uses the word &quot;pleroo.&quot; I
wrote...

&quot;Matthew 1:22  All this took place to *fulfil* what the Lord
had spoken by the prophet...
Matthew 2:17  Then was *fulfilled* what was spoken by the
prophet Jeremiah...
Matthew 4:14  that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah
might be *fulfilled*...&quot;

&quot;All these use the word pleroo. As you can see, they refer
to
a prophetic fulfillment. The word can be used in terms of
fulfilling righteousness, fulfilling the Law, or filling to
capacity, as you say. It has to do with a complete filling.&quot;

In the context of prophetic fulfillment, &quot;pleroo&quot; was the
correct word to use.

They don't all have the same fulfillment. The prophecy of
Christ will be fulfilled when Jesus comes back, at the end
of the Jewish Diaspora. The fulfillment of the Kingdom Age
will be fulfilled when Jesus sets up his eternal Kingdom.
The prophecy of the Levitical priesthood was fulfilled under
the old covenant, as long as that covenant was still in
force.

books are important. They don't take the place of

You would be lawless under the Law of Moses if it was still
in effect. If it was not still in effect, you would not be
lawless under that system of law. Paul said circumcision
counts for nothing. Paul said there was no special day
anymore, including the Sabbath Day. Paul said that Christ
was the ultimate sacrifice, making all other sacrifices
under the Law superfluous and in fact useless. Jesus made it
clear following his resurrection that everything written in
the Scriptures pointed to him and was fulfilled in his
redemptive death.

Reference was made to Jewish feasts not because they were

Paul observed vow-making because it is still okay to make
vows, eg marriage vows. However, Paul kept his vow-making
within the traditional observance of the Law, not because he
felt the Law was still valid, but rather, so as to pay
respect to his fellow Jews, who continued to observe the
Law. He wished to maintain peace among his own people,
