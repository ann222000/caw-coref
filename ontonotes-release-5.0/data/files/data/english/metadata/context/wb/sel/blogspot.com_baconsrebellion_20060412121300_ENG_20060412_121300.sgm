The RTD reported in 05 that Candidate Kaine said he supported the
Marriage amendment 'as written' that marriage is between one man and one
woman only.

Governor Kaine said he will vote against the amendment and encourage
others to do so.

A politician ran for public office saying one thing and did something
different in office. Shocked, I'm shocked, I say!

So, why did Gov. Kaine wait six days to change his tune on new taxes
for transportation? What happened in those six days? Why didn' t he
announce the flip six minutes after he won? Go figure.

Maybe we ought to have dunking pond for politicians. If they get
tested as candidates and drown, the voters know they would have been
truthful. If the candidates live, the voters know they will lie.

When did the current wording come into being? Not just a week ago, I
assure you.

The wording of the amendment has been the same for over a year (2
General Assembly sessions).

The fact is that it doesn't change Virginia law. Everything the
amendment does is already in the Code. It simply protects our law from
activist judges.

People who oppose it would oppose it regardless of the language.

There you go...all the loonies aren't in the bin ...or in the House
either.

Hey boys & girls, my marriage and those of my children and of my
friends are quite safe without the "protection" of some weirdo "Marriage
Amendment."

Anon 12:00: The Marriage Amendment doesn't protect your marriage in
an ex post facto fashion. It protects the institution of marriage in
Virginia - based on our civilization - for future generations.

I can tell you based on my 43 years of experience in my marriage that
the institution will survive based on what the parties put into it.

Based on my 42 years of experience as a lawyer, I can tell you that
no law in Christendom will turn a bad marriage into a good one nor will
it change people's behavior. We have had laws against "cohabitation" for
over 200 years--yet they still do it. Imagine that!

The "Marriage Amendment" is a silly effort to politicize a moral and
religious issue. No man made law will protect the "institution" of
marriage. If a man and a woman are truly committed to each other in
wedlock, then their "institution" is safe. By attentive parenting they
can instill their values in their children and preserve their cultural
and religious values for their progeny.

What others do in their own relationship should not affect them. This
"Marriage Amendment" is pure hypocracy.

Governor Kaine and candidate Kaine have been and are consistent on
this issue. He has said consistently that he would support "a" marriage
amendment that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He has
said that he supports allowing some legal agreements between unmarried
couples, although not civil unions. Since the proposed Marshall/Newman
amendment outlaws all legal recognition of any unmarried relationships,
Kaine opposes this proposed amendment just as he opposed HB 751 (which
put in the Virginia Code some of the same language voiding private
contracts that the Marshall/Newman amendment seeks to put in George
Mason's bill of rights).

The line Kaine has drawn here is not unlike the line he has drawn on
bills to outlaw certain abortion procedures; he said he would support a
constitutional bill that banned so-called "partial birth abortions," but
opposed the bill that passed that did not meet this standard.

As other posts point out, there is much more to the proposed
amendment than a simple definition of marriage.

campaigns in the past, and I am now the campaign manager for the
statewide campaign against the Marshall/Newman amendment.

So I guess poor Tim was misquoted by the RTD. Because the quote isn't
a poltical waffle but a clear statement that he supported the amendment
as written - as did Jerry Kilgore. Darn those lying journalists.

Anon: If the institution of marriage includes two men, two women, one
man and four women or fourteen, an adult parent and child, a brother and
sister, some people and an animal of their choice - then it won't
protected.

The Commonwealth has a compelling interest to define marriage for the
common good - which means keep it between one man and one woman. The
judges made the issue political the same way they did abortion by
legislating from the bench.

Have we been having a big problem with activist state judges in
Virginia? It has totally escaped my notice, if indeed there's something
going on. Indeed, my general impression is that the judiciary in
Virginia is fairly "conservative" (in the sense of not particularly
adventuresome). I stay reasonably well informed, so I'll be pleased to
find out what I've missed. Apparently it was absolutely seismic because
I keep hearing this phrase, "activist judges." On my long list of things
I'm not worried about in Virginia are my marriage being undermined by
contracts or other arrangements between non-heterosexual couples and
Activist Judges. Show me that I'm dreadfully naive.

References to the laws of other states are not permitted. They've got
their own problems.

NoVA Scout--There's no reasoning with someone who has to use all
three names!

He says marriage is between ONE man and ONE woman...I guess that
rules out divorce and remarriage and therefore disqualifies George Allen
from public office since he fits in there....Pity.

Anon 12. I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Bowden and don't hold
his 3 names against him, especially since one of them is "Atticus". But
my point is that whenever I ask the "why?" question about the content,
need and location of this amendment, the only answer I get (from several
sources, BTW) is "activist judges." So if we can establish that current
state law is clear and that we in Virginia don't have an activist
judiciary, we can just call the whole thing off, I assume.

If the perceived problem is federal (as opposed to Virginia) judges,
then this thing isn't any protection in any event.

I suppose some will point to the Massachusetts situation, but that is
a different underlying law and a far different state judiciary.

NoVa Scout: I agree with you that there isn't a sense of urgency for
the Marriage Amendment in VA this year. But, since the legislators put
it on the table, I will support it. We vote on it in Nov regardless.

The fact that most Virginia judges are okay today doesn't mean they
will be tomorrow. Look at what happened to Sandra Day O'Connor between
86 and 05 (or was it 04?) on the right to sodomy.

JAB: I though O'Connor was a good Justice throughout her tenure. She
was always well-prepared and had excellent clerks. She was a handful for
counsel in oral argument. A very smart judge, an excellent citizen and
patriot. You misinterpret the Court's decisions if you find anywhere in
its jurisprudence a "right to sodomy." All the cases dealing with this
issue have addressed limits on state action.

Now, why do you think Virginia's judges are going to find favor in
permitting homosexual marriages?

My gripe with the legislature is why, on an issue you and I agree is
not urgent, the members of the GA thrust this Politically Correct, but
absolutely substandard piece of drafting in our faces on the November
ballot. Since we agree there was no urgency, let's you and I start a
movement to oust all those who voted for it. How many of these folks
will have to move on if we succeed?

NoVa: You are the lawyer. You may have read the whole body of the 86
and 04(?) decisions on sodomy. O'Connor went the wrong way on the last
vote. Virginia's judges could do the same sooner or later.

There was some wording - I don't recall and don't want to take the
time to look up now - about right to private relations blah blah that
reads like a right to sodomy.

I don't have the urgency to fight politicians about the Marriage
Amendment for its timing. Since it is on the table, I'll support it.

JAB: The Court (including the lower courts) have never recognized a
"Right to Sodomy." To use that phrase, with no link to text, is
deliberately provocative and misleading. And whether the timing bothers
you, certainly the sloppy drafting must drive you, a man of precision,
quite wild. If there's one thing we ought to be able to expect of
legislators, it's precise legislative and constitutional drafting. You
and I, as conservatives concerned about the integrity of fundamental
documents like the Virginia Bill of Rights, certainly can join forces in
holding these slothful incompetents to account and getting some new
troops in to do the job right. Voting for their slipshod handiwork would
only encourage them.

of these days base on my unlawerly understanding of the law. <
