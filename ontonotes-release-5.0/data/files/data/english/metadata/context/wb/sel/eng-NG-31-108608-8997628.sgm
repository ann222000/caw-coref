Beware: the Next Giant Asteroid Belt is Overdue

Welcome to asteroid news, the free! subscription service, that offers
the best choice of book's and magazines, newsletters, education and
strategies to stave pending catastrophes. In addition, the book's
articulate all the aspects of asteroid collision, the pending dangers
and man's ability to circumvent this potential impact, through aero-
space technology and jet propulsion and investigates the race to find
&quot;habitable planets&quot; in New Solar Systems. Visit:freewebs.com/asteroidz

Meteorite Crash in Peru

People watch a crater in Carangas, Puno, Peru, Monday, Sept. 17, 2007,
caused by a supposed meteorite that crashed in southern Peru over the
weekend causing hundreds of people to suffer headaches, nausea and
respiratory problems. Visit:freewebs.com/asteroidz

Local residents told reporters that a fiery ball fell from the sky and
smashed into the desolate Andean plain near the Bolivian border
Saturday morning. However, experts are not completely certain that
there was no contamination, by the&quot;toxic&quot; fumes emanating from the
crater, which is some 65 feet wide and 15 feet deep.

[snip crap]

Asteroid 99942 Apophis (2004 MN4) is about 320 meters in diameter,
masses 4.6x10^10 kg, and enjoys a 323.587 day solar orbit.  It sprints
past Earth on select Friday the 13ths and will deliver 1480 megatons
from 12.59 km/sec (mv^2)/2 impact if it cuts things too close.  On 13
Friday 2029 Apophis will drift by within 22,500 miles of the surface.
Its next major snuggle will be 13 Friday 2036. 2036 hit or miss is a
wild card - nobody knows how Apophis' orbit will be affected by
happenstance while skimming the Earth and moon.

1) A 22,500 mile sruface miss in 2029 is uncomfortably close to the
22,300 mile altitude of geosynchronous satellites.  How's that for
happenstance?  Whack!  Satellites or orbital debris.
2) Within Apophis' range of possible fly-by distances quietly
simmer a large number of gravitational keyholes some 2000 feet
across.   Keyholes allow major orbital changes from tiny changes in
approach.

WHAT DO YO PLAN TO DO about staving off pending catatrophe?  One
doubts strongly worded petitions, prayer, or Space Scuttle missions
will be relevant.  Does the US have a 1480 megatonne bomb inventoried?

There's more than one Asteroid Belt?
Beware: the Next Giant Planet is Overdue.
Crawl back in your woodwork.

10 megatons at a turning point oughta do it. Put the bomb in a kinetic
impactor and hit it on the side that most displeases you. Kinetic
impact will give a good push, and thermonuclear ablation will give a
big push.

Or wait and see.
