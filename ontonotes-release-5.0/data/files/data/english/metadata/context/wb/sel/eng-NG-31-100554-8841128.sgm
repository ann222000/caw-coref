Actually, this has nothing to do with the credibility of the newspaper.
Rather it has to do with the ownership structure and the value of the paper.

That has nothing to do with it.  All newspapers in the US are
struggling with declining circulation and ad revenue, even the Wall
Street Journal, and they can't provide the desired 25% return on
investment that public investors demand.  OTOH most newspapers can
generate 15% ROI, which many private investors think is perfectly
acceptable.

In the US the most popular newspaper sells about 2.5M copies per
issue, but the most popular one in Britain sells &gt; 3M, in Japan, 10M,
despite those nations having much smaller populations.

I believe that you're mistaken that the liberal leanings of newspapers
are affecting circulation. It has a lot more to do with people getting
news from TV, radio (NPR is strong despite its liberal leanings) and the
internet.

I would like for you to support your assertion that liberal leanings
have anything to do with it.

BTW, the New York Times has a circulation of just over 1.1 million,
while the Wall Street Journal has a circulation of just over 2 million.
And USA Today is nearly 2.3 million. So the NYT is not the paper with
the biggest circulation in the nation.

You're right.  When I moved to San Diego county twenty plus years ago,
the Union Tribune was a conservative paper; one of the rare ones.

I quit them about two years ago.  Helen Copely retired, leaving the
paper in the hands of her son David, whose alternative lifestyle adds a
new lean to the rag.  Editorials from him, and others included
prolifically, finally drove me away.  Just about everything wrong in
this country is touted by the UT as how things should be.  I couldn't
stomach it any longer.

They now call and send invitation cards saying, &quot;We want you back.&quot;  I
told the last telephone solicitor, &quot;I want the old UT back.&quot;  She
wasn't amused.

To what do you attribute the rapid decline in newspaper subscriptions?
Conversely why do you think more balanced new sources like C-SPAN and Fox
News are rapidly growing?

As for me personally I stopped subscribing to the Times shortly after the
current editor took over.  I have not problem with their editorial comments,
since they are the opinions of the editor staff.  What I have a problem with
is how those opinions ends up in the way headlines are presented and how
opinion shows up in new reports in the form of innuendo and placement of
articles and omissions.

I. E every bit of bad news on the economy for the past six years is on the
front page, while good news about the fantastic unmatched growth in todays
economy ends up on page four, in the business section.  I now read on two
daily papers rather than four, formally

Newspaper subscriptions are falling all over the country, regardless of
liberal or conservative bias.

C-SPAN and Fox News are TV news, rather than printed news. People are
turning to the internet and TV more for news rather than more in-depth
reporting as found in newspapers. More and more advertising dollars are
going to the internet. These dollars would have been spent on print
media, like things mailed to people and in magazines, newspapers and
newspaper inserts. Not that there are not ads in print media, just fewer
than there would have been.

Anecdotal?   Obvious you are entitled to you own opinion.  Newspapers do
surveys of former subscribers.  They KNOW from those responses, that the way
they are reporting the news, is one of the major causes driving down
subscriptions and ad dollars.

Look at what happened to the LA Times after the Tribune newspapers took over
and it shifted toward the Chicago Tribunes liberal bias.  Currently the LA
times is selling off some of it subsidiary papers.  If you read any of the
LAT papers you will see they are changing the WAY news is reported on its
pages.

After all they are a business trying to acquire and maintain customers, like
any viable business, and adjusting there 'product' to reflect that fact,
rather then allowing staff to follow their personal agendas, learned in
journalist school loaded with liberal profs.

That's funny, when I dropped my local paper, I didn't hear a word from
them. And, just because someone says he dropped the paper because of the
supposed bias, that doesn't mean it is the real cause. It could be that
the person lost his job and didn't want to say this. Or because of
subconscious factors. (That's not suggesting the former reader's info
isn't important, just not totally accurate.)

Anyway, show us the reports or links to them, then.

Otherwise, you aren't backing your claims. You showed us how well you
back your claims with your claim about the VIN having anything to do
with US content. Now, you have another chance to back your claims.

&gt;&gt;&gt; To what do you attribute the rapid decline in newspaper subscriptions?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Conversely why do you think more balanced new sources like C-SPAN and Fox
&gt;&gt;&gt; News are rapidly growing?
&gt;&gt; Newspaper subscriptions are falling all over the country, regardless of
&gt;&gt; liberal or conservative bias.

&gt;&gt; C-SPAN and Fox News are TV news, rather than printed news. People are
&gt;&gt; turning to the internet and TV more for news rather than more in-depth
&gt;&gt; reporting as found in newspapers. More and more advertising dollars are
&gt;&gt; going to the internet. These dollars would have been spent on print media,
&gt;&gt; like things mailed to people and in magazines, newspapers and newspaper
&gt;&gt; inserts. Not that there are not ads in print media, just fewer than there
&gt;&gt; would have been.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for me personally I stopped subscribing to the Times shortly after the
&gt;&gt;&gt; current editor took over.  I have not problem with their editorial
&gt;&gt;&gt; comments, since they are the opinions of the editor staff.  What I have a
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem with is how those opinions ends up in the way headlines are
&gt;&gt;&gt; presented and how opinion shows up in new reports in the form of innuendo
&gt;&gt;&gt; and placement of articles and omissions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I. E every bit of bad news on the economy for the past six years is on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the front page, while good news about the fantastic unmatched growth in
&gt;&gt;&gt; todays economy ends up on page four, in the business section.  I now read
&gt;&gt;&gt; on two daily papers rather than four, formally
&gt;&gt; Where do you read the NYTimes? Otherwise, how do you know what was on
&gt;&gt; every front page?

&gt;&gt; Yesterday's New York Times had one article about the economy. I did not
&gt;&gt; know that Silicon Valley have a lot of money to invest is bad news. I must
&gt;&gt; reread the article.

You have yet to show that this is responsible for the lower readership,
as opposed to people not reading newspapers as much because they get
their news from radio, TV, and the internet. Book sales are also down
over the last few years.

I never questioned that most news media is liberal.
