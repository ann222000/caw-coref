Review new 9/11 Truth films-

Discussion/Strategy-

Dramatic recent events/legislation/heightened promise of new false flag ops-

How do we extend the story beyond the towers to
the planned power grab by leaders to take over the country?
How does our government wield power. - nobody has
been held accountable for assassinations from JFK
and MLK to many foreign leaders, no action on the
lies of the current war. Bud’s interpretation is:
1 The crime is much bigger than the New York incident.
2 Fighting this is more like what the founders
went through fighting the English Empire.
Consider that the President, secret operations of
our government (all the 3 letter operations and
the Home land insecurity), Media, Military, Oil
interests, the Supreme Court, and most large
corporations are on the side of maintaining the current powers.
3 To get attention and make change will require
much more than we can dream. Appeals to what
values we hold dear for future generations may be
needed. Understanding personal vulnerability, will be part of the process.

Timing-
We have 12 hours- let’s cover agenda items, as
best we can, from the onset- providing there is
critical interest/people for the items- shelving
the ones there isn’t interest in for later- we
can also subdivide if there is a group very
interested in finetuning- newsletter, media
outreach, tabling materials, organizing the
rally/march, setting up the William Rodriguez event…

We will have breaks for food and socializing and
can intersperse previewing films, throughout the
day.  We can have a large circle- or smaller
conversation circles going in the backyard- and
have film reviewing in the house simultaneously
(they aren’t mutually exclusive. It depends on
who shows up when- I imagine we will be around
20- sometimes more, sometimes less- like a long regular meeting.)

This is a retreat, though- so we should be more
relaxed, and find time to rejuvenate ourselves,
reflect on what we have done, our resources and
capacities, how we can improve our capacities,
our hopes/visions, and how we can prepare
ourselves for the long haul (since our mission is
not something we are going to be able to pull off in just a year or two).

If people haven’t filled out the 9/11 Truth
Activist Directory forms- they should- so
everyone at the retreat can connect with one
another later. We may lose the internet and
should strengthen the bonds of our growing community.

Here’s the form, again (or you can do it online
at-&lt; https://www63.safesecureweb.com/fabfileonline/cc/volunteer.cfm &gt; https://www63.safesecureweb.com/fabfileonline/cc/volunteer.cfm
- and we should pass out hard copies on Sunday to
those who have filled them out.)

Everyone who fills it out will receive a hard
copy to assist in our organizing efforts-

Hola 911 Truthers!
Just a note from Quito y Cuenca, Ecuador. Thanks for all the incredible work you are doing... I am so proud! Looks like the agenda is full of tremendous proactivity! Please, to keep me in mind out here in your media outreach and alternative outreach... I am distributing the ¨Mysteries¨film with d-dollars attached for packaging- the folks are interested and hungry for the info- so refreshing....
Unfortunately we don´t have much in Español for distribution.
I hope to translate the top 12 reasons sometilme.
Also, am coming across some other opportunities- such as a test program for a radio show.
Would love to guest Bonnie Faulkner or others for commentaries.
I think there is a big market for english programming.
Also, have connected with some great very inexpensive rentals here in Quito and Cuenca if anyone cares for a visit.
Much Love!
Diane Ferchel

Hello Carol,

I have a couple of issues to share, if you think there might be interest.  The first is the income tax, and how knowledge of the law can enable anyone willing to take the time, to quit paying what is not actually owed.   It's a great way to personally stop funding the cheats and liars.  Take a look at the attached email.

Second,  I have G. Edward Griffin's presentation titled &quot;The Quigley Formula&quot; in which he exposes the roots of the cancer that has invaded America.   I feel it is important to at least be aware of the roots, even if they are extremely difficult to pull.

And,  are many members of the group Aaron Russo/America:Freedom to Fascism fans?  I have some copies of the $1 DVD available.

These issues are related to 9/11 at their foundation, and are a part of the larger cause of truth.

Let me know it you feel there is room to present and discuss these issues and how the crossover can aid the 9/11 truth effort.  I'm thinking about early afternoon, if can.

Peace, Live, and Liberty.

Dave L.
