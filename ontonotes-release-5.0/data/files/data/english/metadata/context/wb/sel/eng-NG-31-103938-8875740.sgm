Winter is coming... and if you're anything like me, the kitchen becomes a welcome source of &quot;entertainment&quot; during the long, dark days of the season. Thought you all might enjoy the interesting article below... KC :-)

Dr. Brian Wansink PhD of Cornell University's Food and Brand Lab is campaigning to end mindless eating. You know, munching entire tubs of popcorn without even being hungry. Nibbling on M&amp;Ms while waiting for someone. Unknowingly finishing the kid's leftovers. Just 100 extra mindless calories a day can contribute to gaining ten pounds of undesired body fat a year.

Dr. Wansink recommends we curb weight gain by making mindful decisions about the calories that end up in our mouths. Wansink reported we make about 250 food decisions a day. We decide not only what we eat (turkey or tuna sandwich? lowfat or regular mayo?), but also how much (half or whole sandwich?). He has determined that we eat 92% of what we serve ourselves. We generally stop eating when our plate is empty. That means, we eat with our eyes, not with our stomachs! Think about it: When do you stop eating? Chances are, you stop eating when your plate is empty (or when the TV show ends). We don't always stop when our stomach signals it is full.

To prove this point, Wansink masterminded an interesting experiment with a refillable soup bowl that never emptied. (It was refilled via hidden tubing connected to a big soup pot.) Compared to the group who ate from standard bowls, the 30 adults who (unknowingly) ate from the refillable bowls consumed about 73% more soup. And believe it or not, they did not rate themselves as feeling any more full. (How can you be full if the bowl still has half the soup in it???) Only two people realized the bowl refilled—one dropped his napkin (and noticed the tubing); the other tried to pick up the bowl (surprise!).

Wansink created another experiment to determine if serving size influences the amount of food a person eats. He arranged for a movie theater to announce “everyone gets free popcorn and soda today because it is “Illinois History Month.” The movie-goers were given five-day old popcorn (yucky). Yet, even though the popcorn tasted bad, the people still ate 35% more when they were given a big bucket of popcorn compared to a smaller bucket. They mindlessly ate the stale popcorn slowly (in contrast to a previous experiment in which the movie-goers quickly devoured fresh popcorn).

Based on these and other experiments, Wansink believes a simple way to cut calories (and control weight) is to buy smaller bowls, plates, and also glasses. He reports you’ll drink less if you pour your beverage into a tall, thin glass compared to a short fat glass. And you'll eat less pasta if it's served from a small dish rather than a large platter.

Wansink has noticed that mindless eaters fall into categories: those who—
• eat too much at meals
• graze mindlessly throughout the day
• over-eat at restaurants or special occasions,
• mindlessly eat at their desks or in their cars.

If you relate to one or more these areas (and if you want to lose body fat), your goal should be to focus on that bad eating habit. You don't have to change your whole lifestyle. You just might need to cook less dinner so there are no leftovers, or take the candy jar off your desk.

Wansink recommends mindless eaters commit to 28 days of changing their fattening eating habit. Then, after 28 days, they can go on to improve another bad habit (such as drinking less soda, or crunching on baby carrots instead of chips). On www.mindlesseating.org , Wansink offers a free chart to help monitor daily success. You might also want to read his book, Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think. Perhaps it can help you fight fat with less effort than a harder workout!

&quot;when do we stop eating?&quot; - when every slice of pizza is gone from the
platter at the Works!

peace with leaving the gazebo BEFORE all the coolers are empty?????
