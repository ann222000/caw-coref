Shakespeare and masonry
cf.: Shakespeare and Freemasonry by Peter Dawkins

The 1623 Shakespeare Folio has numerous references
that could be interpreted as referring to Freemasonry.

Although the word

&quot;apron&quot; appears four times,
&quot;brother&quot; 479 times,
&quot;brethren&quot; 18 times,
&quot;compass&quot; 32 times,
&quot;grave&quot; 185 times,
&quot;lodge&quot; 24 times,
&quot;mason&quot; two times,
&quot;masonry&quot; two times,
&quot;square&quot; 14 times,
&quot;master&quot; 646 times and
&quot;worshipful&quot; five times,

it would be difficult to find any masonic significance
in the greater majority of the usages or contexts.

And the Meanest of things are made more precious
when they are dedicated to Temples.

Maussolleion, One of the Seven Wonders of the World

by Murat M. Mayor, Ph.D., 32°

&lt;&lt;The word mausoleum, often meaning monumental tomb, comes from the
name Maussollos. The Maussolleion building is the monumental tomb
of Maussollos, son of Hekatomnos, who was the Persian Satrap for
Halicarnassus in Bodrum, Turkey, some 2,380 years ago and made famous
by writers in antiquity as one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
Using the Maussolleion as his inspiration and model, the famous
American architect John Russell Pope designed the headquarters of the
Supreme Council, 33°, Southern Jurisdiction, USA, in Washington, D.C.

A model of the building was reconstructed using the references of
remaining building elements and the information recorded by Roman writer
Pliny in his Natural History written in 1 A.D. The upper portion of the
building had 36 columns, 11 on the longer side and 9 on the shorter
side, forming an oblong plan. This area was covered with a stepped roof
of 24 levels, carrying a four-horse marble chariot on the top.
The total height of the building was about 164 feet.

The edifice had extensive decorations, and it was well known for its
sculptures. In 1857, British excavations, by the permission of Ottoman
Empire's Government, resulted in important findings which are now in the
British Museum. Groups of sculptures that once decorated the building
range from figures of human scale to colossal representations. The
largest group was the four-horse chariot at the top of the building.
There were sculptures of guardian LIONS at the lower steps of the
roof and human figures all around the facade. The famous Amazon frieze
of the British Museum comes from the podium (below the colonnade level)
of the Maussolleion itself.

The exterior of the building was white marble and bluish limestone,
while the lower part of the podium and the interiors were built of
greenish lava blocks measuring 1 by 3 by 3 feet. However, in 1495 the
Knights of St. John, using its stones to fortify the castle of St. Peter
in Bodrum, started a systematic demolishment of the building. In the
course of two decades, the structure was leveled to its foundations,
and its burial chamber discovered.

When I moved to Washington, D.C., I was excited to see the building
re-erected by our Scottish Rite Brothers in the heart of our nation's
capital. As a Scottish Rite Mason in the Valley of Washington, D.C.,
I was equally excited visiting the site of the Maussolleion in Turkey.
Today, the original site is a museum in modern Bodrum. I was proud
to see the picture of the House of the Temple of Washington, D.C.,
displayed with Masonic references at this ancient site in Turkey.

The original building's 27-feet-wide stairs led down to the sacrifice
area (180 square feet) and burial chamber (19 x 22 feet). Plug blocks
sealed the burial chamber, and the drainage and climate control
systems remain the most impressive elements of the ruins. The plug
blocks still have traces of repeated unsuccessful attempts by tomb
robbers. However, the tomb chamber was eventually entered through
a tunnel underneath the foundations.

The town of Bodrum, host city of the Knights of St. John, still
jealously preserves its unique Mediterranean architectural style as well
as the beauties of the Aegean Coast. The Maussolleion site is only one
of the city's many other ancient landmarks and museums. Certainly, one
of the most outstanding is the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology
in Bodrum Castle built by the Knights of St. John.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Little of ancient Greece looks quite so ornate as the Greek-style
temple barely a mile north of the White House on 16th Street. With its
great SPHINX-like LIONS staring out at the street and its Parthenon-
like temple perched above the oversize entryway, the Scottish Rite
Temple is modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus in Greece.&gt;&gt;

SPHINX. Lord Bacon's ingenious resolution of this fable is a fair
specimen of what some persons call ?spiritualising? incidents and
parables. He says that the whole represents ?science,? which is
regarded by the ignorant as ?a monster.? As the figure of the SPHINX
is heterogeneous, so the subjects of science ?are very various.?
The female face ?denotes volubility of speech;? her wings show that
?knowledge like light is rapidly diffused;? her hooked talons remind us
of ?the arguments of science which enter the mind and lay hold of it.?

She is placed on a crag overlooking the city, for ?all science
is placed on an eminence which is hard to climb.? If the riddles
of the SPHINX brought disaster, so the riddles of science
?perplex and harass the mind.?

You are a perfect SPHINX - You speak in riddles. You are nothing
better than a SPHINX - You speak so obscurely that I cannot understand
you. The SPHINX was a sea-monster that proposed a riddle to the Thebans,
and murdered all who could not guess it. (?dipus solved it, and the
SPHINX put herself to death. The riddle was this-

What goes on four feet, on two feet, and three,
But the more feet it goes on the weaker it be??
