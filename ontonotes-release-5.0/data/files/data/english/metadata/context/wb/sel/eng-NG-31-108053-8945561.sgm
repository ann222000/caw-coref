Hey all,

I am slowly getting the cabinet repainted.  I used Ralph Lauren &quot;Duke
Red&quot; as my color, based on the suggestions of the stencil makers over
at oleszakcreative.com.

I am a bit concerned with the color of the red, the old cabinet seemed
to be a deeper red...

My question is this.....  Can I sand the Latex like I sanded the
Primer?
If I do sand the red, how many times?, and what grade of sandpaper?

I sanded the crap out of the many light coats of the KILZ, to a very
smooth feel.  I then painted the black areas of the cabinet with Flat
Satin black, and WOW it looks good.  I let it dry for a day, masked
off the black and then applied the Red.  The links to the pics are
below.

Why are you going to sand it? to take the red off? or to apply another coat?
The red does look off a bit but it is awful hard to tell from a pic. Did you
apply a spot or two on it as a test before you sanded the original off? It
looks good though and will come together once you stencil the artwork. I
haven't read the other posts yet,how did you apply it?
I will be matching those colors soon myself as soon as i finish the Scramble
colors i am working on. but you are well on your way.
Are YOU satisfied with it, that's all that realy matters.

Keep in mind red will take at least 3 coats to get to the final color
depth.. perhaps even 4.  Also, red paints get darker as they dry.

I want to sand it to apply another coat.  I am not wanting to remove
it.  I am hoping it will darken up a bit with a few more coats.
I did spot check it, and it was closer to exact with the spot check,
but seems washed out now that it is on the cabinet.
I applied it with a 1.8 nozzle HVLP gun.

You can sand latex but you run the risk of balling/peeling the paint
if it isn't cured well enough.  Use water and sand lightly.

I am much more pleased today.  I alowed the cabinet to dry yesterday
and today till around noon.  The humidity and temps are just about
right.  It was 77 and the dewpoint was 56 with 47% humidty.  I sanded
it with 240 and didn't like the look.  I moved to way fine to 2000
grit.  I got a very fine dust sand from that, and then wet a towel
lightly and wiped her down.  I then painted again and the SECOND coat
really evened things out and deepened the color very nice.  I am going
to sand once more tomorrow and paint again.  Here are the pics from
today after the second coat.  Some are in full sun and some in the
shade.  Side note.  Furniture movers are sure a nice way to me these
things around.

Hey Nac,With latex paint you really shouldn't sand it.  By the time you hit
your fourth layer of red it will smooth all by itself.. also, with Williams
cabs you clear coat them in the end with a nice water based poly that you
can lightly sand with 400 grit between coats that will glass it up just like
factory.. don't sweat the small stuff at this point..  pay more attention to
getting a nice even color and sheen, the smoothness will work itself out
later for ya.

Ok, I didn't know that, I will not sand between these next two
coats.
I will paint the third coat tomorrow and then the last on Wednesday.
I did buy a can of Minwax Polycrylic - water based.  The Home Depot
I went to didn't have water based Polyurethane.  Is that polycrylic
ok
to use?  direct link to what I bought is here;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it with 240 and didn't like the look.  I moved to way fine to 2000
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; grit.  I got a very fine dust sand from that, and then wet a towel
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lightly and wiped her down.  I then painted again and the SECOND coat
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; really evened things out and deepened the color very nice.  I am going
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to sand once more tomorrow and paint again.  Here are the pics from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; today after the second coat.  Some are in full sun and some in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shade.  Side note.  Furniture movers are sure a nice way to me these
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things around.

The final coat of Duke Red is on the cabinet and it looks even all
over the place.  The feel of the cabinet is very good, but it didn't
really get very smooth.  I feels like 400-800 grit sandpaper.  Not
sure if I want to start stencil painting with that feel, as the next
two paints
will come from a can and not my HVLP gun.  They will finish
smooth.....So I think I am gonna sand it with 400 very lightly then
mist
wet a towel and wipe it down.  I have done that and the feel then
feels very smooth.

While waiting for the paint to dry today, I worked on the COIN DOOR,
and removed the rust and sanded the finish down on it.
I then resprayed with some awesome &quot;bedliner&quot; paint I found at
walmart.  I tried three different textures and found one that
looks super.  I made the mistake of not removing the red .25 plastic
coin slots and tapped over only.  I then removed one without
thinking to respray one area I missed and sprayed it black.  I
couldn't get the stuff off easily. Finally had to resort to laquer
thinner
and that of course ate into the plastic.  I saned the red pieces down,
sanded then with 2000 automotive paper with water, and then
put some polishing compound on my dremel soft wheel and they look
brand new....better than what they looked like...I highly
recommend that on any you have....

Pics tomorrow of the first stencil paint.

If you're getting bumpiness, you have your paint thinned incorrectly or your
air pressure is a little low in your gun.. Just as an FYI.   I use an HVLP
always too, but if I want a color like red to be glassy smooth, I thin it to
the consistency of heavy cream and up the pressure to 65 PSI.. yes, I know
it's not recommended but at that pressure you get the atomization level you
need to really spray it on nice and smooth..

I'd also recommend you give it more than 24 hours before you do the first
stencil.  You have a lot of latex on there that takes a while to cure.
