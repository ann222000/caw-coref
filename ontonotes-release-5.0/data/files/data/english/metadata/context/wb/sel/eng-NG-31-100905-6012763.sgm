Chapter One - Replacing Disbelief With Desire

"We were not sent into this world to do anything into which we cannot
put our heart." -John Ruskin

Embers of Passion

What is your dream? What makes you happy? Most of us go through life
accepting whatever happens along the way. We are reactive instead of
proactive. If you think that's not true, consider the last time you
were able to enjoy yourself without experiencing at least one guilty
thought.

There is always something or someone who is going to need you more than
you need yourself. It is good to be reliable, but when being reliable
turns into letting others control your life there is a problem.
Codependence refers to people who give up complete control of their
life in order to please others. Many who quickly and vehemently deny
they are codependent are also dreading Monday morning and returning to
work.

At work, they spend their day at a job they don't enjoy while
worrying about who they need to please before they go home. At home
they spend their hours making everyone else happy. It is a cycle of
misery or, even worse, deadened pain. Going through life feeling
nothing is sad business. It means that you don't bother to feel or
think or dream, because if you do, you might have to deal with the fact
you are unhappy.

Call it codependence or escapism or whatever else you want to call it;
the bottom line is that you have given up control.

When you begin to think about dreams, your whole focus begins to
change.

What is a dream? The formal definition says it is an experience of
envisioned images or other sensations that are normally outside the
control of the dreamer. But dreams that involve following a secret
passion are most certainly within your power to control.

Once you decide to take control of your life and emotions, and refuse
to settle for less than you want out of life, dreams are changed from
illusion to reality.

Sleep dreams involve the suspension of disbelief whereby you are
willing to accept anything that occurs as possible even if it appears
to be impossible. Now return to the original questions: What is your
dream? What makes you happy? When you unbind your thoughts and unchain
self-imposed restrictions, anything suddenly seems possible.

If you do not limit the possibilities with arbitrary constrictions, and
accept anything as possible, unlimited opportunities are revealed.
Disbelief in yourself stifles creativity, creates fear, discourages
reflection and stops effort. If you don't believe in yourself, then
why should anyone else?

Going to work everyday and hating what you do is a terrible state of
existence. But there are ways to change this kind of living. It begins
with free thought, leaves an imprint on your heart and soul and
cultivates a persistence that lives within you day and night.

Dreams are not just for the nighttime. Dreams are a way to balance the
emotional and physical desires that you hold within yourself. They can
define how you spend your days, relate to other people and pursue your
goals. Your life should be made of dreams, for dreams are the embers of
passion.

Burning Hearts

Traditional searches for a job involve standardized methods punctuated
with a clever approach every now and then. You decide what field you
want to work in, prepare a resume, apply at various places and hope for
the best. Often in desperation, people apply for jobs they don't
really want but will take if offered a position. That's how the
misery and loss of control starts.

Preventing this downward cycle is not hard, but it does take some
thought. You begin not with your mind, but with your heart. Burning
hearts can conquer almost anything.

A burning heart is a heart full of passion for life. It is a heart that
cares about the dreams created by the mind. It reflects a desire that
won't go away. You have a willingness to sacrifice for personal goals
in a burning heart. A burning heart is how you start deciding what kind
of job you really want to obtain.

You are looking for the job of your dreams, not the "it's the only
job I could get" work most are willing to settle for to pay bills.
You will recognize if you have a burning heart, because passion never
disappears. It may ebb or subside, but it will never go away. It is
usually found in statements made by people that begin, "....I wanted
to be a ...." or "...I really tried to find....." or even "...I
always regretted..."

The passion is still there, but it is buried under piles of mediocrity.
So how do you get past the inclination to go along with what the world
says you should do, as opposed to what you want to do with your life?

First, you have to pinpoint your passion, and to do this will require a
bit of creative thinking.  One of the most effective techniques for
generating new and creative thoughts is the process of mind mapping.

Mind mapping as described by Tony Buzan in The Mind Map Book is a way
to flowchart your thoughts. It takes the first grain of a thought and
expands on it until all possibilities are identified. It helps you to
quickly generate new ideas and encourages creative thinking through
association of thoughts. It is free form thinking with each new idea
generating another related idea, and so on and so forth.  This process
will be used throughout this book as a means of brainstorming new ideas
quickly and efficiently.

Pinpointing your passion is a lot more than just defining a job you
think you would like to do. The passion is a desire resulting from your
dreams for your life. It is finding the fuel for the fire that burns in
your heart. You know you have found your passion when several things
happen.

*

You are willing to give up a lot to pursue the dream
*

You are willing to do without to pursue the dream
*

You are willing to stop what you are currently doing to pursue
the dream

You may notice that pursuing the dream sounds like it requires a lot of
sacrifice. It does not and this is why: you are giving up things that
will not make you happy and successful for something that will. That is
not sacrifice. That is passion.

If you are not willing to give up time or money doing something you
dislike in order to achieve your life goals, then you have not found
the passion yet. If you insist on clinging to the familiar, your fires
are still smoldering. But if you are willing to forgo immediate success
or income and are willing to do whatever it takes to pursue your goal,
you have lit the fires of your burning heart. Once that happens, you
begin the process of believing in yourself.

Mahatma Gandhi is an example of a man who was willing to give up
everything to pursue freedom for the peoples of India. He endured much
physical and emotional pain in pursuit of his dream for the citizens of
his country. Some of us would believe he was willing to give up too
much. But Gandhi did not see his life as one of suffering, because
pursuing his dream was worth any sacrifice.

Gandhi wrote, "Suffering, cheerfully endured, ceases to be suffering
and is transmuted into an ineffable joy." If you have found your true
passion, identified your big dream, the actions needed to achieve them
will never be seen as a sacrifice or as suffering. Instead, you will be
living a life of joy.

Fire and Ice

Once you have identified your real life's passion, it is time to
stoke the fire. To pursue a passion requires a belief in yourself that
cannot be extinguished by people or circumstances. You must be willing
to face seeming defeat and difficulties. But if you have chosen your
dream honestly, nothing will stop you. You will have a burning heart
with passion, but an icy resolve that cannot be melted with negative
words or criticism.

Here are the initial steps that are absolutely essential to your
success:

*

Specifically identify the kind of position that will fulfill your
dream
*

Determine exactly how much money you want to make
*

Define what sacrifices you are willing to make
*

Always stay focused on the end goal and do not waver
*

Have faith in yourself that you will achieve your goal
*

Be confident that you can succeed by seeing your dream as already
being reality
*

Refuse to fear the unknown
*

Be persistent and refuse to accept defeat

It is important to understand that the items on this list are directly
related to your passion and are not related to need or other people's
opinions or any perceived limitations.

You must pinpoint what kind of position you want, not want you think
you can get. Set the money at what you want, not what you need to pay
bills. Set a goal that matches your passion and recognizes your
talents. Don't set a goal that limits you based on history or other
people's views - the past does NOT equal the future.

Believe in yourself with that burning heart and see the achievement of
your dream as real, not as an imagined thought. Picture yourself doing
exactly what you want. See yourself as successful. Have the courage to
be persistent and see "failure" as another opportunity for success. See
yourself on fire!

Exercises

Following are some exercises to help you identify your dream. Do the
exercises and refer back to what you write throughout the rest of this
book. These are the first steps towards getting the job and salary you
want.

Exercise 1: Do a mind map exercise to unlock your creativity and define
your whole being. Take a piece of paper and write in the middle "Dream
Job".  Now put a circle around it.  Draw at least 5 lines branching out
from that idea, and on each line write an idea that you associate with
"Dream Job". Now draw lines from each of those ideas and write down
everything you associate with them - words, memories, people, places,
things - anything that might help lead you to your dream job.  Let it
be a freeflow of ideas. Don't restrict yourself. Let associations be
added unhindered. You cannot make any mistakes here, just keep writing!

Exercise 2: Write down how much money you want to make. Write down an
exact amount.

Exercise 3: Make a statement that clearly expresses your faith in
yourself. Write down your dream as if it is already fulfilled. Write
the statement in a way that makes it clear you see yourself as
succeeding. Have it next to your bed and let it be the first thing you
read when you wake up and the last you say before going to bed. The
goal here is to reprogram yourself for success. This statement should
be as emotionally charged as possible. It should get you excited.

Exercise 4: Now write down everything that is in your way of pursuing
your dream and getting exactly what you want. Include those items that
indicate a lack of self-confidence or self-doubt. You can include
people who may discourage you from going after your dream, people who
are not positive influences, perceived limitations or lacks of talent,
education, etc. Anything that is a challenge should be listed.  Now, on
a separate piece of paper, write a statement that affirms the opposite
of each item you wrote in the first list. For example, if you wrote
down "I don't have the talent to be X" on the new piece of paper write
something like "I have the ability to develop any skill I set my mind
to developing."  The statement should nullify the original statement,
and MUST be positive.  The goal here is to eliminate all obstacles.
Once you are finished with the new list of positive affirmations, post
it beside your bed and read it every morning and night as well.

Exercise 5: Write a statement about yourself that indicates how you
want to be. Use this statement to banish all self-doubt. For example,
you may write, "Every day I am getting smarter and one step closer to
reaching my dream job."  The statement should be simple enough to
memorize.  Throughout the day say the statement to yourself, preferably
out loud.
