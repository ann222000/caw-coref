In Virginia, India seen as job-napper
Migration of 'call center' jobs resented

By M. Kalyanaraman
MSNBC

July 8 - When Thomas Magargal called his credit card company a few
months ago and wound up talking to someone in India, the 55-year-old
retired firefighter from Spotsylvania County, Va., says he was at a
loss to understand the person on the other end of the phone. He
demanded to speak to an American operator and eventually got his
business done. But when Magargal recently heard another of his credit
card companies had joined the trend of sending call center jobs to
India's cheap labor market, too, it was the last straw. Magargal
canceled his Capital One credit card and began agitating on behalf of
its laid-off Richmond, Va., workforce.

&quot;CAPITAL ONE makes millions of dollars here,&quot; he says. &quot;What is
the logic in giving work to foreign countries when the majority of
callers are in the United States?&quot;

The job losses in Virginia are part of a national trend,
according to Paul Saffo, who studies the impact of trends in
information technology for the Institute for the Future, a think tank
based in Silicon Valley. Saffo says in the past two and a half years,
U.S. companies have been outsourcing their call center services to
countries where labor is cheap to get the returns that will satisfy
their investors.

In India, where the wages are about $200 a month, call centers
now employ more than 140,000 people. And about 60 percent of this $8.4
billion industry is derived from U.S. corporations. By some estimates,
by 2006, call centers will provide more than a million jobs in India.

TRIMMING COSTS

Hamilton Holloway, a spokesman for Capital One, says the
company does outsource some of its operations to India but disputed
the idea that jobs were eliminated as a result. Holloway says Capital
One is only shifting the Spotsylvania operations to its main office in
Richmond, Va., a 45-minute commute.

The company's 650-odd workers in Spotsylvania have been asked
to decide by mid-August whether they want to switch to Richmond and
get $5,000 as transition allowance or leave the company and get
$3,000.

But employees say that as recently as a year ago, more than
1,200 employees worked at the Capital One center that is now closing
down.

One worker, who would speak to MSNBC.com only on condition of
anonymity, says the company has been on a campaign to force employees
to leave voluntarily, in part by setting new performance targets that
are unrealistic.

Holloway, the Capital One spokesman, says workforce numbers did
go down through attrition but denies any deliberate effort to force
people out.

The company decided it needed to &quot;reduce operating expenses and
consolidate the company's resources after evaluating our resources
based on the company's business,&quot; Holloway says.

HARD TO FIND JOBS

The loss of so many jobs in a predominantly rural area has many
people angry. The local newspapers are filled with unhappy letters to
the editor. Many people wonder what they will do to make ends meet.

Experts classify the credit card jobs like the ones at Capital
One as medium-skilled. Simple transactions and telemarketing are
low-end, while sophisticated IT help desks, data processing and legal
consulting are the high skilled ones.

Rosemary Batt, associate professor at Cornell University's
School of Industrial and Labor Relations, says such jobs employ 3
percent to 4 percent of the U.S. population, with salaries ranging
from $20,000 a year to $60,000, depending on skill level.

She also notes that technology has made these jobs footloose
and low-paying because they are difficult to unionize.

While the Communications Workers of America has about 100,000
members working in call centers run by big companies, the vast
majority are non-union jobs, which pay about 15 percent less.

A GLOBAL PULL

Steffanie Wilk, assistant professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, says these call centers,
whether in the United States or abroad, tend to migrate to
economically depressed areas with an educated population.

&quot;Companies can close down a center at a flick of a switch and
shift their computers to other places,&quot; she says.

In the early years of the telecommunications industry, these
call centers went to the South and to cities like Phoenix in the West
and the Dakotas in the Midwest. Eventually they migrated to
English-speaking foreign countries with well-educated workforces and
lower wage costs - Ireland and Australia and now India - where some of
the largest call center outsourcers are now located.

These jobs fall under different categories, and the exact
figures on job losses in the United States are not available.
Officials at the Department of Commerce said they did not have the job
figures and are trying to analyze the impact of outsourcing of call
centers. However, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that since
January 2001, 35,000 jobs have been lost in telemarketing bureaus
alone.

Chris Slevin, a spokesman for Global Trade Watch, a consumer
advocacy group founded by activist Ralph Nader, says the loss of these
jobs should really be looked at in terms of foreign trade.

&quot;When most people think about trade, they think of tariffs and
quotas on trade in goods,&quot; he says. &quot;Today's trade agreements are
increasingly focused more on the service industry, which includes the
trade in actual people, workers and granting foreign companies new
rights and privileges within the boundaries of other countries.&quot;

There have been attempts to bring legislation to prevent
outsourcing of these jobs. The New Jersey state Senate passed a bill
in December 2002 seeking to restrict outsourcing of jobs in government
contracts, but the state Assembly has so far not voted on it. A bill
that requires people who handle calls to identify themselves and their
location was introduced in the Assembly in May.

Saffo, the analyst from the Institute for the Future, says such
legislation is out of step in a globalized economy, but he expects
similar bills to come up even in Congress.

&quot;Any knowledge work, including law clerks, software,
secretarial work, is fair game in cyberspace,&quot; he says.

Passage to India
High-tech jobs moving abroad, lured by country's low costs, skilled
labor

By Steve Caulk, Rocky Mountain News
July 12, 2003

Denver high-tech businesses are chasing customers and competitors
halfway around the globe to India, where low costs have breathed new
life into struggling firms.

But Denver firms that have engaged in offshore outsourcing contend
that their strategies have actually preserved jobs. Even the term
&quot;outsourcing&quot; has been banned from public relations lingo when talking
about the subject.

Metro-area companies J.D. Edwards, Ciber and TeleTech have initiated
ventures in India this year, adding to the long list of U.S.
businesses that have found financial refuge overseas.

Businesses across the country have been taking advantage of India's
high-skilled, low-paid labor pool for years, much to the concern of
domestic labor advocates in the United States. And the practice has
increased, experts say.

By 2015, about 1.7 million U.S. jobs will have moved to offshore sites
that include China, Russia, the Philippines and, of course, India,
according to Forrester Research.

Chasing work to India

Mac Slingerlend, chief executive officer of Ciber in Greenwood
Village, makes a compelling case as he describes an incident that
occurred before Ciber's establishment of a joint venture with a
partner in India.

&quot;We have customers in the U.S. doing work in India who say, if (Ciber
consultants) can't help with that work, we'll lose it,&quot; said
Slingerlend. Ciber is a consulting firm that helps companies integrate
their computer systems.

&quot;American Express used to be a major customer of ours in Phoenix,&quot; he
said. &quot;They sent more than 50 percent of their software development to
India. We couldn't support the Indian development work, so not only
did we not get that work, but we lost the U.S. work at the same time.&quot;

&quot;One could put a reverse spin&quot; on the issue of job losses to other
countries, Slingerlend said. &quot;By having the ability to do work
offshore, we're actually retaining U.S. jobs.&quot;

Evolving Systems, a Douglas County telecommunications software firm,
estimates that its joint venture in India has saved the company 40
percent on software development costs due to the low cost of labor.

The figure is typical throughout the high-tech industry. The average
salary for a software engineer in India is $5,880.

One woman in India, working in the offshore call center for a major
U.S. telephone company, says she makes $6.50 for an 8 ½-hour shift, an
amount she considers unreasonable, especially when her Indian company
makes $4 per call. She asked not to be identified either by name or
company affiliation, but she goes by the name &quot;Michelle&quot; when dealing
with customers on the phone.

A 1 ½-year veteran at the call center, Michelle says she remains
enthusiastic about her work, but she notes that the salary puts a
single beer at the local pub outside her budget.

She receives a $1 bonus anytime she rings up a long-distance sale
during a service call.

Teaching U.S. accents

Typically, U.S. companies teach their new Indian partners to speak
with an American accent in hopes of putting customers more at ease.
Michelle has adopted a Southern lilt - one that she has &quot;lost&quot; a
couple of times during moments of impatience with angry customers.

&quot;Each of us goes through accent neutralization training for three or
four weeks,&quot; she said.

Since India is about 12 hours ahead of the U.S., companies often ask
offshore workers to work the graveyard shift.

"/> Hoffa, et. al can forget it. We had organizers at our company who
aligned themselves with the CWA almost four years ago. They made such a
joke out of the union organizing effort that almost nobody is interested
any more.

Among the funnier moments, these clowns refused to help an organizing
effort at one site because the organizers there were aligning themselves
with the IBEW. Needless to say, there's no more union organinzing at
that site, nor anywhere else.

The funniest moment was when they invited Jesse Jackson to speak for the
organizing effort at a rally. The membership of the group dropped like a
rock after that.

These guys are funnier than the three stooges, but don't stand a chance
of organizing even a coffee break. All they do now is whine.

Economic laws in action. Whenever there's a gap between the cost of work and
work performance, it will be exploited. If people in India do the same work for
the fraction of the cost, the economy will find a way to hire them, regardless
of any laws.

With the declining quality of education in the U.S., expect this trend to grow
exponentially.

If you want the jobs back, the right steps should be investing in education,
and stopping importing hordes of illiterate immigrants who drive domestic work
performance to the ground. I don't recall these matters being on the agenda.
Our elected officials and media have more important matters to discuss: gays'
marriages, abortions, etc.

Howdy, all:

Yes, jobs are being exported to India in record numbers. Not only
that, but many U.S. services businesses (particularly small hotels)
are being snapped up by Asian Indians. I'm all for everyone making the
most of being an American and being successful, but I absolutely
insist on being treated in a respectful, appropriate manner by
businesses, regardless of where the proprietors hail from.

For those interested, here's a description of what happened to me
recently at the Clarion Hotel in Savannah, GA:
http://www.complaints.com/june2003/complaintoftheday.june15.6.htm .
Talk about poor communications and inability to serve the customer
properly. Has anyone else had a similar experience to this?

Just for the record, I strongly discourage all smart consumers from
patronizing hotels that are part of the Choice Hotels International
chain. These hotels include Clarion Inns &amp; Suites, Comfort Inn,
Comfort Suites, Quality Inn, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn. The reason is
that most of these properties are locally-owned and operated. Since
they're locally owned, there's limited oversight by the corporate
headquarters and service can differ radically from hotel to hotel.
Especially when the owner/operators can't communicate properly and
make logical decisions.

Good luck,
CC

&gt;&gt;&gt; piece of software on one of our consulting projects, we outsorced it
&gt;&gt;&gt; to a company in India. I managed this subcontract and was very happy
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the quality of work. The cost was only a quarter of what it
&gt;&gt;&gt; would've cost us to develop this software internally. You simply can't
&gt;&gt;&gt; beat $20-$25 an hour rates for developers.

&gt;&gt; Why not just hire US developers at $20-$25 an hour? There are plenty
&gt;&gt; available. (I happen to be one of them.)

&gt;Where are you? California has a minimum wage for developers (guys
&gt;that write code, etc). It's like 40+ an hour.

As far as I know, the only government mandated minimum wage law is
just that - minimum wage. Other than tipped employees, all jobs are
covered by the same rate.

they'd have found out many of us would have been willing to take a pay cut
in order to remain employed. But, they tossed us out on the street, no

Once out out on the street looking for a new job, I found it hard to get
employers to consider me for the lower salary they were offering once they
knew what I had been making. I had a few frankly tell me they're hesitant
to hire people at a lower salary than they used to make as they feel that
the new employee will only be accepting the job as an 'interim' job while
they continue to hunt for something that puts them back at their previous
pay level.
Anyways, I am employeed again at a slightly reduced salary (-10%) which
doesn't bother me a bit. But, here at this new company I'm in, there are
already discussions of outsourcing the project I'm on, likely after 1st
Quarter of next year. So, it's a strong likelyhood that this second job of
mine will eventually go to India just like my previous one did. I see a
pattern forming here. Wonder what will happen to my *next* job?

"/> It is called competition in the workplace. That even exist here in the good
ole USA. Welcome to the real world. As far as the employors concern about
people who were making more money at their last job, the reason they think
that people will not be happy with a lower salary is called experience.
They know from experience that a lot of them will not be happy earning a
lower warge, and will use the job as a safe haven, until they find that job
paying what they use to make. If they hire them, the person is not going to
come up to speed right away, so there is also the matter of expense to the
company, i.e. the learning experience. There is also a small matter of
&quot;expense&quot;. If they hire you and you quit for a better paying job soon after
they hire you, they have to carry you on their books regardless of whether
you work there or not for a number of years.

live in Canada, because a Walmart is coming to the fringes of my small

$15 to $23 dollars an hour to $10 to $20 an hour. If not he said
they would sell their business , terminate all their employees, and
start up again a month or so later. All employees agreed to take the
cut. Their employer said he could not compete with Walmart unless
they did.

Those at the bottom end of the scale will be losing $5 an hour , or
approx. $800 a month on their wages. It's obscene. Walmart is the
largest retailer in the world and they are not only pauperizing their
work force, but this pauperization is spreading to corporations
formerly paying liveable wages.

that might be impossible,at the very least the set up should be
revolutionized. If not, workers' rights will continue to erode.

Mega corporations do not have built in morality,and deregulation has
lifted the controls so many of them do what they like and that is to
keep on maximizing their shareholders' profits at the expense of
whatever. . . Those controls need to be replaced so that the working
force gets gets some semblance of decency and respect for workers'
rights from many of these transnational corporations.

There is no doubt free trade produces more goods, but at what cost.
Workers' rights, human rights and envrionmental protection have gone
on the back burner, and the gap between rich and poor grows ever
larger.

Many, if not most of the new jobs being created are part time with no
unions and no benefits, and it will get worse.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is absolutely typical of corporate America today. As soon as
&gt;&gt;&gt; revenues and profit margins start to slip Joe Sixpack is immediately
&gt;&gt;&gt; blamed, while corporate execs take the money and run.

&gt;&gt; In the first place, a President of any company does not &quot;award&quot; bonuses
to
&gt;&gt; themselves, nor do they develop the other &quot;incentives&quot; they get for
being
&gt;&gt; President or any executive position. The Board members do that.

&gt; Typically, yes. But read the article cited above, it's an accurate
&gt; description of how Fiorina is paying herself these bonuses without
&gt; any kind of board (or stockholder) approval.

"/> Nothing in the article that was posted said that the compensation package
was one the board approved of, or did not approve of, and nothing in the
article said that Fiorina developed the compensation package.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Also, the
&gt;&gt; incentive packages are usually designed to award people based on the
&gt;&gt; performance of the stock. If earnings per share, i.e. net income
declines,
&gt;&gt; the stock price declines.

&gt; Another joke. HP's stock value is down 33% since the merger
&gt; with Compaq, and net income is essentially as flat as it was before
&gt; the layoffs.

&gt;&gt; Finally, if the stockholders of the company don't
&gt;&gt; like what their board is doing, they have the option to vote their
shares.
&gt;&gt; After all, the stockholders are the &quot;owners&quot; of the company.

&gt; And yet another joke, similar to &quot;a vote for a third-party candidate
&gt; is not a wasted vote&quot;.

"/> You may not like the way corporations are run, but the stockholders do have
the option. They may &quot;choose&quot; not to do anything about it, but that is
their decision to make. Similar to those who vote for third, fourth, and
other candidates who have no chance of winning. At least they vote, which
is more than can be said about a whole lot of other eligble voters in this
country.

I worked for a call center here for a bank and they pay very little to
workers here too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In Virginia, India seen as job-napper
&gt; Migration of 'call center' jobs resented

&gt; By M. Kalyanaraman
&gt; MSNBC

&gt; July 8 - When Thomas Magargal called his credit card company a few
&gt; months ago and wound up talking to someone in India, the 55-year-old
&gt; retired firefighter from Spotsylvania County, Va., says he was at a
&gt; loss to understand the person on the other end of the phone. He
&gt; demanded to speak to an American operator and eventually got his
&gt; business done. But when Magargal recently heard another of his credit
&gt; card companies had joined the trend of sending call center jobs to
&gt; India's cheap labor market, too, it was the last straw. Magargal
&gt; canceled his Capital One credit card and began agitating on behalf of
&gt; its laid-off Richmond, Va., workforce.

&gt;&quot;CAPITAL ONE makes millions of dollars here,&quot; he says. &quot;What is
&gt; the logic in giving work to foreign countries when the majority of
&gt; callers are in the United States?&quot;

&gt; The job losses in Virginia are part of a national trend,
&gt; according to Paul Saffo, who studies the impact of trends in
&gt; information technology for the Institute for the Future, a think tank
&gt; based in Silicon Valley. Saffo says in the past two and a half years,
&gt; U.S. companies have been outsourcing their call center services to
&gt; countries where labor is cheap to get the returns that will satisfy
&gt; their investors.

&gt; In India, where the wages are about $200 a month, call centers
&gt; now employ more than 140,000 people. And about 60 percent of this $8.4
&gt; billion industry is derived from U.S. corporations. By some estimates,
&gt; by 2006, call centers will provide more than a million jobs in India.

&gt; TRIMMING COSTS

&gt; Hamilton Holloway, a spokesman for Capital One, says the
&gt; company does outsource some of its operations to India but disputed
&gt; the idea that jobs were eliminated as a result. Holloway says Capital
&gt; One is only shifting the Spotsylvania operations to its main office in
&gt; Richmond, Va., a 45-minute commute.

&gt; The company's 650-odd workers in Spotsylvania have been asked
&gt; to decide by mid-August whether they want to switch to Richmond and
&gt; get $5,000 as transition allowance or leave the company and get
&gt; $3,000.

&gt; But employees say that as recently as a year ago, more than
&gt; 1,200 employees worked at the Capital One center that is now closing
&gt; down.

&gt; One worker, who would speak to MSNBC.com only on condition of
&gt; anonymity, says the company has been on a campaign to force employees
&gt; to leave voluntarily, in part by setting new performance targets that
&gt; are unrealistic.

&gt; Holloway, the Capital One spokesman, says workforce numbers did
&gt; go down through attrition but denies any deliberate effort to force
&gt; people out.

&gt; The company decided it needed to &quot;reduce operating expenses and
&gt; consolidate the company's resources after evaluating our resources
&gt; based on the company's business,&quot; Holloway says.

&gt; HARD TO FIND JOBS

&gt; The loss of so many jobs in a predominantly rural area has many
&gt; people angry. The local newspapers are filled with unhappy letters to
&gt; the editor. Many people wonder what they will do to make ends meet.

&gt; Experts classify the credit card jobs like the ones at Capital
&gt; One as medium-skilled. Simple transactions and telemarketing are
&gt; low-end, while sophisticated IT help desks, data processing and legal
&gt; consulting are the high skilled ones.

&gt; Rosemary Batt, associate professor at Cornell University's
&gt; School of Industrial and Labor Relations, says such jobs employ 3
&gt; percent to 4 percent of the U.S. population, with salaries ranging
&gt; from $20,000 a year to $60,000, depending on skill level.

&gt; She also notes that technology has made these jobs footloose
&gt; and low-paying because they are difficult to unionize.

&gt; While the Communications Workers of America has about 100,000
&gt; members working in call centers run by big companies, the vast
&gt; majority are non-union jobs, which pay about 15 percent less.

&gt; A GLOBAL PULL

&gt; Steffanie Wilk, assistant professor at the University of
&gt; Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, says these call centers,
&gt; whether in the United States or abroad, tend to migrate to
&gt; economically depressed areas with an educated population.

&gt;&quot;Companies can close down a center at a flick of a switch and
&gt; shift their computers to other places,&quot; she says.

&gt; In the early years of the telecommunications industry, these
&gt; call centers went to the South and to cities like Phoenix in the West
&gt; and the Dakotas in the Midwest. Eventually they migrated to
&gt; English-speaking foreign countries with well-educated workforces and
&gt; lower wage costs - Ireland and Australia and now India - where some of
&gt; the largest call center outsourcers are now located.

&gt; These jobs fall under different categories, and the exact
&gt; figures on job losses in the United States are not available.
&gt; Officials at the Department of Commerce said they did not have the job
&gt; figures and are trying to analyze the impact of outsourcing of call
&gt; centers. However, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that since
&gt; January 2001, 35,000 jobs have been lost in telemarketing bureaus
&gt; alone.

&gt; Chris Slevin, a spokesman for Global Trade Watch, a consumer
&gt; advocacy group founded by activist Ralph Nader, says the loss of these
&gt; jobs should really be looked at in terms of foreign trade.

&gt;&quot;When most people think about trade, they think of tariffs and
&gt; quotas on trade in goods,&quot; he says. &quot;Today's trade agreements are
&gt; increasingly focused more on the service industry, which includes the
&gt; trade in actual people, workers and granting foreign companies new
&gt; rights and privileges within the boundaries of other countries.&quot;

&gt; There have been attempts to bring legislation to prevent
&gt; outsourcing of these jobs. The New Jersey state Senate passed a bill
&gt; in December 2002 seeking to restrict outsourcing of jobs in government
&gt; contracts, but the state Assembly has so far not voted on it. A bill
&gt; that requires people who handle calls to identify themselves and their
&gt; location was introduced in the Assembly in May.

&gt; Saffo, the analyst from the Institute for the Future, says such
&gt; legislation is out of step in a globalized economy, but he expects
&gt; similar bills to come up even in Congress.

&gt;&quot;Any knowledge work, including law clerks, software,
&gt; secretarial work, is fair game in cyberspace,&quot; he says.

&gt; Passage to India
&gt; High-tech jobs moving abroad, lured by country's low costs, skilled
&gt; labor

&gt; By Steve Caulk, Rocky Mountain News
&gt; July 12, 2003

&gt; Denver high-tech businesses are chasing customers and competitors
&gt; halfway around the globe to India, where low costs have breathed new
&gt; life into struggling firms.

&gt; But Denver firms that have engaged in offshore outsourcing contend
&gt; that their strategies have actually preserved jobs. Even the term
&gt;&quot;outsourcing&quot; has been banned from public relations lingo when talking
&gt; about the subject.

&gt; Metro-area companies J.D. Edwards, Ciber and TeleTech have initiated
&gt; ventures in India this year, adding to the long list of U.S.
&gt; businesses that have found financial refuge overseas.

&gt; Businesses across the country have been taking advantage of India's
&gt; high-skilled, low-paid labor pool for years, much to the concern of
&gt; domestic labor advocates in the United States. And the practice has
&gt; increased, experts say.

&gt; By 2015, about 1.7 million U.S. jobs will have moved to offshore sites
&gt; that include China, Russia, the Philippines and, of course, India,
&gt; according to Forrester Research.

&gt; Chasing work to India

&gt; Mac Slingerlend, chief executive officer of Ciber in Greenwood
&gt; Village, makes a compelling case as he describes an incident that
&gt; occurred before Ciber's establishment of a joint venture with a
&gt; partner in India.

&gt;&quot;We have customers in the U.S. doing work in India who say, if (Ciber
&gt; consultants) can't help with that work, we'll lose it,&quot; said
&gt; Slingerlend. Ciber is a consulting firm that helps companies integrate
&gt; their computer systems.

&gt;&quot;American Express used to be a major customer of ours in Phoenix,&quot; he
&gt; said. &quot;They sent more than 50 percent of their software development to
&gt; India. We couldn't support the Indian development work, so not only
&gt; did we not get that work, but we lost the U.S. work at the same time.&quot;

&gt;&quot;One could put a reverse spin&quot; on the issue of job losses to other
&gt; countries, Slingerlend said. &quot;By having the ability to do work
&gt; offshore, we're actually retaining U.S. jobs.&quot;

&gt; Evolving Systems, a Douglas County telecommunications software firm,
&gt; estimates that its joint venture in India has saved the company 40
&gt; percent on software development costs due to the low cost of labor.

&gt; The figure is typical throughout the high-tech industry. The average
&gt; salary for a software engineer in India is $5,880.

&gt; One woman in India, working in the offshore call center for a major
&gt; U.S. telephone company, says she makes $6.50 for an 8 ½-hour shift, an
&gt; amount she considers unreasonable, especially when her Indian company
&gt; makes $4 per call. She asked not to be identified either by name or
&gt; company affiliation, but she goes by the name &quot;Michelle&quot; when dealing
&gt; with customers on the phone.

&gt; A 1 ½-year veteran at the call center, Michelle says she remains
&gt; enthusiastic about her work, but she notes that the salary puts a
&gt; single beer at the local pub outside her budget.

&gt; She receives a $1 bonus anytime she rings up a long-distance sale
&gt; during a service call.
