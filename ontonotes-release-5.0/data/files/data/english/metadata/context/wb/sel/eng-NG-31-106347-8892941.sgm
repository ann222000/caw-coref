I recently had some dark blue Marley tiles laid in my kitchen (the
label on the box the contractor left said they were 'semi-flexible').

Today I noticed a few thin white lines on them. The only thing I'd
ever dragged over the floor was a polythene mop-bucket, which I
thought was far too soft to scratch them, so I thought these lines
must be something I could clean off.

So I tried to remove the lines with a mop and Flash liquid, and when
this didn't work, I rubbed them with the sort of plastic scouring
sponge you use for non-stick pans. I thought that since it was
plastic
on plastic, it couldn't do any harm.

Now the floor has lots of large pale patches that I can only assume
must be thousands of tiny scratches made by this scouring sponge.

Is there any way I can polish them off? I've only had this floor for
a
few weeks and I'd hate to think I've messed it up for good.

Marley's own site has nothing about floor tiles, so anything anyone
here can suggest would be very welcome.

Thanks in advance

Martin

IME it's often residue from cleaning products that discolours vinyl
flooring. The abrasives are fine enough to penetrate and leave a dull
haze. It seems unlikely the abrasive you used would have scratched them.
I'm sure it'll all look the same in 6 months time

You can use the scrubber pads to polish metal, so it's not a stretch
to think it could affect vinyl tile.  They make a bunch of different
types/colors of scrubber pads.  Check the 3M web site for Scotchbrite
pads and pick the least abrasive one.
