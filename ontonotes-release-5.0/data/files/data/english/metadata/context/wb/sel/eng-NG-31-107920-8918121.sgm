Following the (well received) interview with Albert2, BMW explains how
it has prepared for next week's race at Fuji.

On the weekend of 30th September the Formula One circus will stop off at
Fuji in Japan – a race track where none of the current crop of F1 cars
has so much as completed a lap. And yet by the Friday morning before the
Japanese Grand Prix the set-up of the BMW Sauber F1 Team cars will
already be very close to optimum. Advanced simulation programmes and the
expansion of the team's computer capacity on the back of support from
Intel have been key to making this possible. However, experience has
also played a critical role.

In late 2006 the simulation experts at the BMW Sauber F1 Team received
the data on the new Fuji circuit as a CAD (Computer Aided Design) file
from the race organisers in Japan. On the basis of this data, one of the
team's experts started by using a computer programme to establish the
probable ideal line around the track. This process saw the circuit
divided up into 500 to 800 segments through two stages. The radii for
each individual segment were determined, allowing the experts to
numerically define the ideal line.

The image of the circuit was then expanded to take on a further
dimension, the engineers feeding the gradient profile of the race track
into their computers. Inclines and downhill sections have a significant
effect on the cars' speed – especially on long straights.

&quot;In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need
to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox
ratios and brake specification in advance,&quot; says Willy Rampf, Technical
Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team.

The engineers' next move is to define the car's mechanical set-up.
First, they use values taken from comparable circuits to establish
weight distribution. Then the spring and damper settings are finalised,
once again on the basis of empirical values. As Rampf explains: &quot;It is,
of course, an advantage that the Fuji race is scheduled so late in the
year. We have collected a wealth of data with the F1.07 over the course
of the season that we can use here in Japan.&quot;

The next piece of technology thrown into the ring is the lap simulation
software. This highly specialised computer programme has been developed
by the BMW Sauber F1 Team engineers and allows the crew to simulate lap
times. Here the team starts by testing the car – in virtual form, of
course – with various levels of downforce. The car is set up with a
certain configuration, and the programme calculates the lap time that
this will deliver. In this way, the engineers can determine the optimum
downforce for the new circuit.

A medium level of downforce has turned out to be the best compromise for
Fuji. Another wave of numerous detailed wing settings will then be
compared with one another shortly before the race in pursuit of further
optimisation.

Now the focus shifts to working out the ideal gear spacing for the GP
weekend. The top speed projected for Fuji – between 320 and 330 km/h on
the long straights – prompts the engineers to set seventh gear first.
This is followed by first gear. Here, an important consideration is
whether first will only be used when pulling away from the start line or
later in the lap as well. The remaining five gears are calculated on the
basis of the engine's output curve.

The lap simulation software is able to deduce the wear on the brakes
from the levels of downforce on the car and the characteristics of the
track. In simple terms, the key is to discover if the brakes are
subjected to high, medium or low loads. The experts use these results to
select the materials for the brake discs and pads and to finalise the
specification of the brake callipers. Simulation technology also helps
the engineers to establish the amount of cooling air required by the
brakes. Brake ventilation plays an important role in aerodynamic
efficiency: the smaller the vents, the greater the downforce generated
by the car.

Even the most sophisticated computer processes cannot provide an answer
to two major unknowns: one is the grip offered by the asphalt of the
track surface, the other the level of tyre wear. Over to Rampf: &quot;It is
only during practice after completing some long runs – i.e. ten laps or
so at a time with both tyre compounds – that we see how the tyres
actually behave out on the track.&quot;

This information provides the basis for the first strategy meeting of
the race weekend, which takes place after the first two free practice
sessions. Here, all the data collected so far is analysed and
optimisation measures implemented. This data is also inputted into the
strategy simulation programme, which uses the full breadth of
information available to calculate all possible race strategies. It then
shows the engineers – to the second – how fast a one, two or three-stop
strategy would be. Adding to the team's deliberations are factors such
as the weather forecast and track characteristics, which will dictate
how difficult it is to overtake. These conclusions are then examined and
any new information brought to the table in the subsequent strategy
meetings which take place on the Saturday and before the race on the
Sunday.

&quot;Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using
the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the
actual values,&quot; says Rampf, indicating just how precise these
calculations can be.

&gt;&gt; it has prepared for next week's race at Fuji.

&gt; Albert2 complicates things too much... :-P
">

Here is the interview with Albert2

http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=32868

The BMW Sauber F1 Team has a worker of superhuman diligence within its
ranks. His name? Albert2. Based in Hinwil and powered by Intel
technology, this supercomputer makes a significant contribution to the
team's success on the race track. Albert2 is a mathematical genius of
literally huge proportions. But, as he tells us, a day off does not
figure in his calculations.

How long have you been on the payroll at the BMW Sauber F1 Team?
Albert2: Ever since my father Albert took his well-earned retirement in
December 2006. So you could say that the connection with motor sport
runs in our family.

How would you define your role within the team?
Albert2: As I work around five times more quickly than my father, my
boss – our Technical Director Willy Rampf – has given me some important
jobs to do. My main strengths lie in the field of Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD), which is extremely important in the development of
front, rear and auxiliary wings, for example. Before an idea from the
engineers is tested in the wind tunnel, I simulate the effects of a new
component on the car's performance. And that saves the team a lot of time.

If you do such an important job, why do you sit – almost hidden away –
in the basement of the wind tunnel building in Hinwil?
Albert2: There is a very simple reason why. When you weigh 21 tonnes and
measure ten metres in length, things would get rather tight in a normal
office. Besides, it's not where you're sitting that matters, but what
you can do for the team.

How closely do you work with your colleagues?
Albert2: Formula One is a team sport, in which you have to work
hand-in-hand with one another. I link up with the wind tunnel, for
example, at many different stages of the development process. Because we
spend our time concentrating on similar tasks, some people think that we
are actually working against each other. But that is far from the case.
On the contrary, we support each other's work. The wind tunnel tells
everybody if I was right with my estimates. At the end of the day, if
Nick Heidfeld or Robert Kubica improve their speed then we will both be
smiling, so to speak.

Are you a keen sportsman yourself?
Albert2: Being a man of few words and with my, shall we say, statuesque
physique, I can come across as rather ponderous at first – but I'm quite
a sprightly chap really. My 512 Intel Xeon 5160 processors allow me to
run 12,288,000,000,000 calculations per second. To put that into
perspective, every one of the 1.3 million inhabitants of Munich would
have to multiply two eight-digit numbers every three and a half seconds
over the course of a whole year to generate the same performance. So to
answer your question, I'm rather better at mental exercise than physical
sport.

Can you give us some concrete examples of what you do?
Albert2: In the wind tunnel, for instance, there is practically no way
you can simulate how a tyre deforms through a corner. It is pretty much
impossible to generate these heavy loads artificially. By contrast, I
work with a model of the BMW Sauber F1.07 consisting of 100 million
cells, all of which interact with one another. This kind of simulation
is a straightforward job for me. I exert pressure on the tyres and
highlight the areas of the car affected. In this way, you can see fairly
quickly what kind of effect the tyre deformation through corners will have.

Do you keep an eye on what the team's rivals' computers are up to?
Albert2: Of course, that's all part of Formula One. But I have no reason
to worry. A supercomputer was recently unveiled in England, but it is
much slower than me. It can only process eight teraflops – i.e. eight
trillion floating point operations per second. As I said earlier, I can
get through almost 12.3 teraflops.

Do you ever take any time off?
Albert2: No. For a supercomputer there is no such thing as controlled
working hours and we don't have any workers' representatives to look
after us. I work day and night to bring about improvements, and that's
the way I like it. For me, being shut down would be the biggest insult.
I wouldn't know what to do with myself. And anyway, who would take me
away on holiday with them? I'm hardly a slimline laptop, after all!

No. Try understanding the article.

It is a simulation with many missing variables. The point being made is
that they aim to be within one percent in order to be able to make good
predictions of many settings as a starting point for FP1.

Actually, I did read (and understand) the article.  Most of the
article is fairly generic stuff about the use of simulators for setup
information for all circuits, so the reference to a 1% margin of error
on the laptimes applies equally to Fuji as it does to Monza or
Silverstone.  I was expressing surprise that they consider a 1% margin
of error on a lap time to be anywhere close to acceptable on a track
that they understand.  At the very least they have the info from last
year's hotlaps to tell them how quick they will be this year.  I bet
most round here could say that for a given track which was covered in
1m30 last year that the likely hotlap time this year would be 1m29,
which isn't far off from the 1% margin of error.  Thus they are
spending the money to give them a system which simulates a lap to a
degree of accuracy which is only marginally better than an amateur
stab in the dark.

However, I do appreciate that simply calculating a lap time isn't by
any means the reason why they do the sim.  They run the sim so that
they can lock out many of the potential variables about the car's
required performance in advance of arriving on site, and that of
course can be priceless.

You don't seem to appreciate that the laptime itself is of no
significance. They are using it to illustrate to you how close the
simulation comes to the real deal.
