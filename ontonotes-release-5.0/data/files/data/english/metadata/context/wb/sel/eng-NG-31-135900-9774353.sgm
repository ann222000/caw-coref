Hi,

Current status with 1 week of voting to go :

# 1 AGEod's American Civil War - The Blue and the Gray : 57 points
# 2 AGEod's Napoleon's Campaigns : 33 points
# 3 Carriers at War : 29 points
# 4 Advanced Tactics : 25 points
# 5 Commander : Europe at War : 15 points
# 6 Making History - The Calm &amp; The Storm 2.0 : 9 points
# 6 Guns of August 1914-1918 : 9 points
# 8 Air Assault Task Force : 6 points
# 8 Silent Hunter 4 : 6 points
# 8 Theatre of War : 6 points
# 8 Strategic Command 2 - Weapons and Warfare : 6 points
# 8 Cose Combat : Modern Tactics : 6 points

And another thing : I've now received two emails from developers/
publishers who said they'd love to vote, but can't because of the fear
of offending someone so I propose the following : they send me their
vote by email, it won't be counted for the purposes of the election
above but if enough of them mail me to make it significant I'll post
the separate result as well. Their anonymity will, of course, be
respected.

Greetz,

Huh?  I'm offended already.  This is about buyers-users-customers.  You
know, *us*.

I'm tempted to say they can vote in our best-game election just as soon
as they give *us* a voice -  a friggin' *vote* - in *their* decision
making process; IE, whether to fuck us with DRM or not, or whether a
patch should / should not be issued, or whether blanket free upgrades
should be doled out.

Other than that ... Wow, big numbers for AGEOD.  *Viva La France*.  Well
deserved.

LOL

This is first class materiel.

After your, Eddy's and many other's HARRANGE on this ng... I doubt that any
activation based game will get near top 5 or ten? anytime soon...

I wanted to ignore this altogether. Developers shouldn't vote but Eddy is
doing this to collect more votes - in any case numbers are trivial just as
this ng is becoming with stance of some people here.

Some time before Eddy was sarcastic about SC2 - and said &quot;there is no ads to
be seen&quot;. Way to go Eddy. Why is that nececary?
I will give you answer: probably that game is adverrtised on a forum and BFC
is not owner of Battlefront.com like your pals at Staten Island :)

So alltogether, this voting is big farce. This newsgroup has flushed
objectivity long time ago down the toilet and have become Matrix supporting
ng and activation based publisher bashing Inc.
But that is your thing and for you to be proud of. Kisinger school? :)

But, to give an opposite example, the Academy is (all?) composed by members
coming from the movie industry, who get to see the movies for free (*) - and
their votes are the only ones that count for... uhm... the Academy Awards.

(*) Full disclosure: I both get games for free to review *and* I buy them. I
generally buy the ones that I would have bought anyway, like I did this year
with AGEOD ACW and a bunch of other titles (AATF, BCT, JT's Campaign
Series...) However I must admit that I play, and thus I'm able to judge in
our little award, a lot of games I haven't paid for.

We allow the permanently unemployed to vote on how tax payer's money
is to be spend too.

In this election we allow guys who contribute to this ng 2 times a
year to vote (no offense guys) but you wouldn't allow a decade long
regular like Erik Rutins to give his opinion *as a gamer* ?

And were do you draw the line ?

Does a guy who has created scenarios/done beta testing for a game
count as a &quot;developer&quot; too ? Or is money the only criterium ?

It's academic anyway as no developer/publisher has voted yet because
they're afraid their *honest* opinion is going to create too much
fallout.

But what they would like to know is how their fellow developers/
publishers rate their work, that's why they asked me for a separate
(and secret) vote totally separated from the open vote we have in
here.

Brad Wardell's &quot;Ten New Years Resolutions for the Game Industry&quot; for 2008

1. Stop with the obnoxious DRM. If people are going to pirate your game,
they're going to pirate it. Reward the people who buy your games. Make it
more convenient to be a customer than to be a thief.

2. Don't release games until they're finished. People will forgive you for
moving a date back for quality, they don't forgive you for rushing out an
unfinished game.

3. Don't forget that not everyone has brand-new hardware. Make sure your
games will work on the hardware that people have today.

4. Fun trumps graphics. Nintendo is doing well because they remember that
games are supposed to be fun. The latest blood spatter particle effect won't
beat out a fun game.

5. Expansion packs should not be glorified patches. This is like #2. If your
game does have bugs, fix them in an update, don't charge for them in the
form of an expansion pack.

6. Help Jack Thompson find a real hobby.

7. Please make a sequel to Planetscape: Torment.

8. Make better user manuals.

9. We don't need every movie to have a game tie-in.

10. Don't make me be on-line to play your game if it's a single player game.

And same here: 2 out of 3. I bought AGEOD ACW and AATF. And I would have
bought Napoleon's Campaigns, too, but my chef editor was quicker than me in
obtaining a copy :o)

I didn't include AGEOD NC, even if I liked it very much (for the nosy: my
final mark on my magazine was 8/10 :o) ), because I feel that the period
really needs a complex diplomatic model - that the engine just now lacks -
thus not allowing for a full campaign &quot;a-la&quot; Europa Universalis. Also, I
like more the wide operational manuvres allowed by the nature of the ACW,
while the Euro theatre is more &quot;cramped&quot;. The latter, however, is more
matter of a personal taste.

I think we should allow Erik to give his opinion as another one of us
idiots who wastes too much time reading newsgroups.

I think the value of this poll is that it is exactly what it pretends to
be.  Simple rules, everything in the open.

From a practical standpoint, if you look at the results, I have no doubt
that the cream is rising to the top.  If in some future poll, there is
evidence of someone trying to skew the results, it will be right here
for all of us to see.

Should by vote for COTA last year not count, because I hadn't yet
purchased the game?  There were several posts this year that gave points
to games people hadn't bought, on the basis of reviews and discussion.
Do you want to restrict that?

In fact, it seems like the &quot;honest developers&quot; (to misquote you) agree
that pimping their own game would cost them more than the award would be
worth.  They are probably right, and I respect their opinion.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

That's the beauty of voting in the open : it's hard to screw with.

On the 'Net there are 3 places where you can vote for wargame of the
year. In here, at GameSquad and at The Wargamer. I'm not paranoid, but
this is the only one where I'm 100% sure there's no tampering.

It's not about voting for your own game but more like :

- Developer X worries that a vote for a game at another publisher
would be frowned upon by his current publisher.

- Publisher Y worries that a vote for a game would be construed by
other developers at that publisher as playing favourites.

&gt;&gt; *EVERYBODY FUCKING HATES DRM*.

&gt;Brad Wardell's &quot;Ten New Years Resolutions for the Game Industry&quot; for 2008

&gt;1. Stop with the obnoxious DRM. If people are going to pirate your game,
&gt;they're going to pirate it. Reward the people who buy your games. Make it
&gt;more convenient to be a customer than to be a thief.

&gt;2. Don't release games until they're finished. People will forgive you for
&gt;moving a date back for quality, they don't forgive you for rushing out an
&gt;unfinished game.

&gt;3. Don't forget that not everyone has brand-new hardware. Make sure your
&gt;games will work on the hardware that people have today.

&gt;4. Fun trumps graphics. Nintendo is doing well because they remember that
&gt;games are supposed to be fun. The latest blood spatter particle effect won't
&gt;beat out a fun game.

&gt;5. Expansion packs should not be glorified patches. This is like #2. If your
&gt;game does have bugs, fix them in an update, don't charge for them in the
&gt;form of an expansion pack.

&gt;6. Help Jack Thompson find a real hobby.

&gt;7. Please make a sequel to Planetscape: Torment.

&gt;8. Make better user manuals.

&gt;9. We don't need every movie to have a game tie-in.

&gt;10. Don't make me be on-line to play your game if it's a single player game.

&gt; http://forums.galciv2.com/?AID=171737

&gt;I think that I agree with... uhm... them all :o)

Damn, that list makes me want to run out and buy the GalCiv2 expansion
pack. &lt;g&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would we deny the vote to guys who've been posting here as long as
&gt; &gt; &gt; we have, just because they happen to be a developer/publisher ?

&gt; &gt; *Because* they happen to be developer / publishers.

&gt; We allow the permanently unemployed to vote on how tax payer's money
&gt; is to be spend too.

&gt; In this election we allow guys who contribute to this ng 2 times a
&gt; year to vote (no offense guys) but you wouldn't allow a decade long
&gt; regular like Erik Rutins to give his opinion *as a gamer* ?
">

Of course not, for the same reason that every honest contest like this
disallows participation by employees or families of employees.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And were do you draw the line ?
">

I'm not sure exactly where the line is drawn, but developers,
publishers, and employees of the very entities whose products are being
rated are *clearly* over the line.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Does a guy who has created scenarios/done beta testing for a game
&gt; count as a &quot;developer&quot; too ? Or is money the only criterium ?
">

I'd say the sticking-point is a vested financial interest in the
product.  A developer or publisher lives or dies by the success of his
products.  A beta-tester gets exactly nothing if Game X he tested is
successful.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's academic anyway as no developer/publisher has voted yet because
&gt; they're afraid their *honest* opinion is going to create too much
&gt; fallout.
">

Damn straight.  And who puts any stock in their votes anyhow?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But what they would like to know is how their fellow developers/
&gt; publishers rate their work, that's why they asked me for a separate
&gt; (and secret) vote totally separated from the open vote we have in

Fine by me.  If they want to hold a separate contest for &quot;Best
Catfood&quot; ... knock themselves out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &quot;Best of&quot; contests should be about the votes of people *who paid for the
&gt; &gt; privilege*,

&gt; So if a developer would have bought some other game he'd be eligable
&gt; again to vote for that game ? See how murky this gets ?
">

Or if he &quot;buys&quot; a copy of his own game?  Come now.  It's not &quot;murky&quot; at
all; publishers and developers and people with *obvious* conflicts of
interests should be ineligible.

How could we take them seriously, anyhow?  What, like we're going to
believe Jim Rose when he grimly and objectively decides that DISTANT
GUNS is simply The Best Darn Wargame EVER?

Yeah.  Whew.  How credible.  &lt;g&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; not those with a vested financial interest in swaying the
&gt; &gt; context.

&gt; I doubt our election gets them a single additional sale - from what I
&gt; hear it's more a matter of personal pride to get a good score in here
&gt; - the feeling of their work being appreciated by the hardcore
&gt; wargamers in here.
">

How about this as a compromise; developers and publishers can vote - but
they're not allowed to vote for their own product?

OK. Fine. We all hate DRM.

But, it's not quite democratic as you may think so. If it was then we could
say that Nazi paintings on jewish shops &quot;ACHTUNG JUDEN!&quot; which just
attracted lowly German scum to take the brick and throw it at such
windows...
So as much as you think that publishers are NAZI toward you as a customer,
vice versa you are NAZI toward them!

So you call those publishers NAZI and their DRM - NAZI DRM. It's about copy
protection as you already know, not about GAME! HR is honest just as I am
and he looks at GAME in first place!
Maybe some more people here!

So you cannot accuse me that I am not buying Matrix Games and I was known to
be not so kind to them. I buy all games that I like. 50$ for me is really
nothing now (in high school that was a lot of money LOL).

But how many of you here have bought activation based game lately, say in
this year? 80% of you here have bought none! So this contest would be better
called &quot;Non DRM based wargames contest - WGOY&quot;.

Eliminating activation based games from your sphere of interest is not
really smart thing. Just because of this annoyance that they put to you as a
customer. It's a mere game for 50$.
Not many games in fact stays on my hard drive so much. Lately I've been
playing only MTW2 as it is just so damn fun! LOL (I finished Turkish, Moors
campaign, and just started Byzant :)

So no Sir, I would not be a NAZI toward publishers who use activation based
games because I look at game first and second at copy protection.

My knighthood forbids me to punish such a small game companies just like
that :)

&gt; And same here: 2 out of 3. I bought AGEOD ACW and AATF. And I would
&gt; have bought Napoleon's Campaigns, too, but my chef editor was quicker
&gt;  than me in obtaining a copy :o)

&gt; I didn't include AGEOD NC, even if I liked it very much (for the
&gt; nosy: my final mark on my magazine was 8/10 :o) ), because I feel
&gt; that the period really needs a complex diplomatic model - that the
&gt; engine just now lacks - thus not allowing for a full campaign &quot;a-la&quot;
&gt;  Europa Universalis. Also, I like more the wide operational manuvres
&gt;  allowed by the nature of the ACW, while the Euro theatre is more
&gt; &quot;cramped&quot;. The latter, however, is more matter of a personal taste.
">

To change the topic a little...

I wonder if this could be useful as a test of the vote-timing arguments.
ACW is clearly well ahead of NC.  How much of this is because ACW has
been out longer?

For myself, certainly part of the reason that Napoleon didn't get any
points from me is the fact that I haven't yet purchased it (probably
next month, when the English box comes out).  But I also have reasons
(based on the subject matter, and my experience with Birth of America)
that I believe that, even after I have plenty of game time on both
titles, I will still stand by my rating of ACW as my favorite game of
this year.

Especially if these two remain as the #1 and #2 at the end of voting, it
would be really interesting to known whether NC gains ground through the
course of 2008.

Yeah, which is why the Academy Awards are mere bullshit, from a paying
customer or movie fan point of view.

Check out the IMDB's top 250 movies of all time; of the top twenty
films, how many of them won the Academy Award for Best Picture the year
they came out?

I count *five*.

I don't have a problem with developers, modder or whatever voting,
even if they do vote for their own game. My one caveat would be that
they have to do it in public. If they aren't willing to stand up for
their vote like everyone else here, they don't deserve the right to
cast one.

If it gets to be a problem, IE: we suddenly have 20 people that
nobody's ever heard of, all voting for the same games, we can always
change things. I'm a big fan of not trying to legislate things that
aren't a problem yet so lets just let everyone vote.

BTW, as a person who has a monetary stake in games I've made or helped

I and others like me have created.

are THE VERY LAST ONES to be bothered by DMR schemes? 90% of the pirated

Nice to see your absence has not changed your attitude. You are right
in your not-too-subtle inferences of course: only pirates, who dowload
cracked software with the DRM already removed, can *possibly* be
annoyed by intrusive copy protection.

Oh wait...

OTOH, please do vote. You've got just as much right to vote as any
other wargamer, IMO.

Well, in case of Distant Guns it is that great notion that pirates not just
that cannot get the cracked game, LOL, they even cannot be annoyed by it's
DRM schemes because they don't want to give a nickel for any game.

But when we come to money milking Blizzard &quot;I get no life&quot; World of Warcraft
all pirates get in the line and actually get the game and pay monthly fee to
play it. So developer just need to use a right stick and a right carrot, but
not give anything for free.

Exactly - a good start would be including something in the game that
can't be pirated - like a decent printed manual (how much did the advent
of PDF-only manuals contribute to piracy, I wonder...) or

developers to have sufficient imagination to look a little bit beyond
biting the hand that's feeding them.
