First Nations' Sovereignty Versus The Rights Of The States

When the Europeans established Jamestown 400 years ago this year,
they came with the intention of creating a new American empire in
the land of our fathers.

At times, the relationships between the European's and our
native forefathers were good, and at other times, those
relationships were strained or broken. To get a better idea of
the level of civility and type of co-existent living maintained
between our First Nation ancestors and the Europeans who settled
our lands, take a look at the chapter that describes the early
days of Jamestown here:
http://www.myrezspace.com/index.php?/My_Rez_Space/2007/04/21/ ).

What Federal Recognition By The U.S. Government Originally Meant

Federal recognition of our independent Tribal Nations has always
been a point of contention between our people and the states, as
well as with the citizens of the United States.

Some Tribal nations have always received federal recognition from
the U.S. government – recognition that our people constituted
independent nations within a larger nation. Just as Rome is a
legitimate, independent nation within the boundaries of Italy,
our tribes are recognized as legitimate, independent nations
within the boundaries of the United States.

Within the American legal system, our First Nations are
considered to be &quot;domestic&quot; or &quot;dependent nations,&quot; meaning that
we have a special relationship with the U.S. Federal Government.
We have recognition as &quot;sovereign&quot; nations, whose governments
predated the existence of the United States.

Our sovereign status and our special relationship with the U.S.
Government is supported by treaties, the U.S. Constitution, U.S.
Supreme Court decisions, and federal mandate. Under the rules
that govern our First Nations governments and our status within
the U.S. legal system, only the U.S. Congress can override the
rules currently in place. Despite this agreement, most of the
actual authority has been transferred to the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, under the care of the U.S. Department of Interior and
defined as a &quot;trust relationship.&quot;

As a federally recognized &quot;dependent nation,&quot; we are entitled to
write our own laws and enforce our own laws through our own
justice system. As a federally recognized nation, we are able to
collect our own taxes and provide our own government services.

As sovereign nations, our First Nations tribal governments have
always had the same benefits that have been given to federal,
state, county and local governments around the country. All of
these governmental entities do not have to pay taxes to one
another. It is just the way that it is done. Under our special
trust relationship with the federal government, we also do not
have to pay federal, state or local taxes on transactions
processed within our jurisdictions... That is the way it was
intended anyway.

Broken Trust

But, as history has told us, in the latter half of the nineteenth
century the U.S. Government wrote and signed many treaties with
our Tribal Nations. Then, within decades, the U.S. Government
would break those treaties and insist on a new treaty. Even in
our modern age, many governments have felt that any treaty that
was once worth writing was also worth breaking presently.

During the 1950's, the U.S. Government broke its trust
relationship with 109 tribes through a process called
&quot;termination.&quot; In effect, the U.S. Government terminated the
special trust relationship they had held with these 109
individual tribes and declared that the tribes would no longer
receive federal recognition or protection.

Terminated, But Not Broken

Although the &quot;termination&quot; process only displaced about three
percent of the Native American population in the United States,
it still impacted nearly 16% of the tribes that previously had
federal recognition.

Over the last half-century, the members of &quot;terminated&quot; tribes
have been fighting to regain their federal recognition as
independent, sovereign nations within the borders of the United
States.

Many tribes have succeeded in their quest to restore their trust
relationship with the U.S. Government and their status as
federally recognized nations. In 1977, the Confederated Tribes of
Siletz won restoration, followed by the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua
Indians in late 1982, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde
Community in November 1983, the Confederated Tribes of Coos,
Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians in 1984, the Klamath Tribes in
1986, and the Coquille Indian Tribe in 1989.

In total, 562 tribes currently maintain their federally
recognized status within the United States. As of April of 2007,
six more tribes in Virginia have cleared the first hurdle towards
restoration by getting a bill out of the House Natural Resources
Committee authorizing such a move. The bill currently awaits
approval by the full House of Representatives in its climb to
legal precedent.

In order to get their bill out of committee, the Chiefs of these
six tribal nations within the borders of Virginia had to agree to
give up their sovereign right to operate casinos or other
gambling operations on their tribal lands. See, the white man's
government is always changing what it means for us to be a
sovereign nation. Of course, the Congress will expect these six
First Nation tribes to honor their agreement, despite the fact
that the Congress was the first to break the treaty by
implementing &quot;termination&quot; in the 1950's.

The Tax Man Knocks...

For generations, it was acceptable for our tribes to own our own
stores and to sell products without any state or federal taxes on
those transactions. After all, we were independent nations with
governments that only had to answer to the Bureau of Indian
Affairs in Washington, D.C. And, we have always held that special
relationship with the federal government that exempted our
government from any federal, state and local taxes, just as other
government entities in the United States.

Starting in the 1960's and progressing through the 1990's,
individual tribal nations began to get a handle on this thing
called capitalism – you know, the American way. We finally
started making some real money. Then it started happening...

Some of our First Nation tribal governments and business entities
began to find themselves toe-to-toe with state governments and
state troopers. We started seeing the state police swooping in to
shut down our businesses and take our stock on the premise that
we were not collecting state taxes on our transactions.

The contention between our First Nations and state governments
across North America began to grow. By law, we have always been
able to open our own stores and sell products without state or
federal taxes applied to those sales. After all, we are a
sovereign nation within a nation, with our own laws and law
enforcement.

Our tax-free designation was all fine and dandy with the state
and federal governments for generations, that is, until we
actually started selling a lot of products and making a lot of
money from sales to their citizens. Because our tribal
governments permitted our tribes to sell gasoline and cigarettes,
and our businesses were exempted from charging state or federal
taxes, we were able to sell those items at a considerable
discount from the prices offered in nearby municipalities.

Soon the taxman began to realize how much money he was losing
when &quot;his citizens&quot; began shopping in &quot;our stores&quot; in great
numbers.

The taxman was happy letting us sell our products without his
taxes, so long as we remained poor and destitute, but as soon as
we began making serious money that would allow us to better
provide for our people, suddenly the state's taxman felt we
should share our newfound wealth with him!

We Are Sovereign Nations... Or Are We?

The tax-free purchases made in our shops have made our tribal
enterprises very attractive to the over-taxed American and even
Canadian citizens.

Cigarettes and gasoline are two of the most heavily taxed
products in North America, so U.S. and Canadian citizens rushed
to our stores to buy our goods tax-free.

In most states, tag agencies set their auto tag prices by county.
When citizens from one county rush over to another county -- or
even from one state to another -- to buy cheaper auto tags, the
states and counties don't raid their neighbors stores to recoup
their lost taxes. But, when state governments see that they are
losing tax money to the tribal shops, they are quick to move in
and to force the tribes to renegotiate an agreement with the
state, so that the state will return the goods the state took
from our tribal governments. I am not saying this happens
everywhere, but it certainly did happen in some cases in Oklahoma
when the Oklahoma Tax Commission targeted the Tribal Smoke
Shops.

Although we are sovereign nations, we seem to be a little less
sovereign than the state's other neighbors.

As a result of Oklahoma's actions, it became law in 1991 that
Tribal Smoke Shops must pay taxes to the Oklahoma State
Government for any sales transacted with Oklahoma residents.

Later the U.S. Congress passed laws stating that when a buyer
crosses a boundary to buy cigarettes or gas, then the Tribal shop
must collect taxes for the neighboring state. However, the Senate
bill exempted tribes from having to collect taxes for the states
when those transactions are conducted over the Internet.

The ironic thing about this legal precedent is that the tribal
nations must collect taxes for sales to state residents, but if
those same residents cross state lines to buy goods, then the
neighboring state is not required to collect taxes for the
buyer's home state.

As a result, any Oklahoma citizen can cross the border into Texas
and buy their goods and the Texas retailer is not required to
collect taxes for the State of Oklahoma. But if that same
Oklahoma resident drives to the tribal reservation to buy goods,
then the tribe must collect taxes for the State of Oklahoma.

Are the tribal nations less sovereign than the states? It would
seem so.

Sovereign Nations, Indeed

In the American judicial system, we First Nations' tribes are
promised sovereign status within the U.S. legal system, but in
practice, we are a little less sovereign than our State
neighbors.

Our dispossessed nations, who are seeking reinstatement after
termination, may just find that they need to sign away more of
their own rights in order to gain recognition they seek.

For now, 562 nations within the First Nations' umbrella have
their status as sovereign jurisdictions recognized by the U.S.
Federal Government, and hopefully our status will be protected by
the U.S. Government forevermore. But, if the past is any
indication of the future, we will remain independent nations, so
long as it remains the U.S. Government's whim to allow it to
continue.
