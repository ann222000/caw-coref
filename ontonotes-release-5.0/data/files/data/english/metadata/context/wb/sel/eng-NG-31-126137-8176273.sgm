Too reel for words
Forget Television, Tom Verlaine has some silent movies you ought to see. And
hear.
by Serene Dominic
7/11/2007

Rock 'n' roll has produced few mystery men as inscrutable as Tom Verlaine,
the guiding light behind the seminal art-punk rock band Television. Early
on, CBGBs compatriot Patti Smith sealed his fate as a keeper of secrets in
an October 1974 issue of Rock Scene when she wrote that Verlaine's &quot;long
veined fingers&quot; were &quot;reminiscent of the great poet strangler jack the
ripper.&quot;

Since then he's been leaving a trail of unsolved cases that have infuriated
fans and critics for decades. How come the only official release of
Television's twin guitar epic &quot;Little Johnny Jewel&quot; was on a 45 you had to
spin both sides to hear in its entirety? What were the arms of Venus de Milo
doing on Broadway, on &quot;tight toy night&quot; no less? What the hell is a &quot;tight
toy night&quot;? Or &quot;Yonki Time&quot;? Why did Verlaine release an album called Cover
and then never put the title anywhere on the cover forcing Warner Brothers
to make a sticker? Did he think we wouldn't get the joke? Would it have sold
more copies if he'd named it Sticker? Why didn't Richard Lloyd show up for
his own farewell concert in Central Park last summer? Why did so many of his
brilliant solo records go unnoticed?

All admittedly dumb queries but nonetheless ones that will remain unanswered
as I'm only allotted 15 minutes to chat with Verlaine by phone and under
direct orders not to talk about the &quot;old days.&quot; Fine by me, since I'm not up
to interrogating one of my musical heroes as if he were an enemy combatant -
last month's free concert in Central Park, where Jimmy Ripp filled in for a
bedridden Richard Lloyd, would seem to be the last word on Television for a
while.

And besides, there's plenty else to talk about. There's uh, light bulbs. And
this latest project he's undertaken with guitarist Ripp, who has played on
and off with Verlaine since 1984 when he cowrote the college radio hit &quot;Five
Miles of You.&quot;

Taking time out from a late afternoon rehearsal, Verlaine seems relaxed and
nonplussed about what is essentially a low-key, low-pressure project,
scoring new instrumentals for old European silent films ranging from Brumes
d'Automne, a 1928 character study of a woman who burns some old letters as
her memories come alive on the screen, and Ballet Mécanique, a 1924 short by
cubist painter Fernand Léger that the American Film Institute called one of
the most influential works in the history of experimental film. (Not your
typical tying-Pauline-to-the-railroad-tracks silent fare.)

&quot;We've been doing this show since 1998 in various museums. Not more than
three a year,&quot; Verlaine says. &quot;We did it in Seattle, Portland and San
Francisco, but we've never been able to do it in Hollywood. It's like
there's no venue there that wants to do it. It's really strange. We've never
had an offer.&quot;

That the film capital of the world wants nothing to do with Frenchmen
obsessed with shapes and turn-of-the-century chick flicks should probably
come as no surprise. Maybe it's the way that people watch films today - with
one on hard-drive, the other on iPhone - that makes silent films seem so
problematic.

&quot;Could be,&quot; he laughs uneasily. &quot;I don't know what people do anymore. So
many people have grown up playing video games they're so used to things
jumping like crazy all the time. I don't know if they have the patience to
watch a film that doesn't do that.&quot;

One of the few American films featured, The Life and Death of a Hollywood
Actor, owes much to German expressionism and avant-garde French cinema.
&quot;When you see it,&quot; Verlaine says, &quot;you see a lot of little special effects
and most of this is from cardboard bottles director Slavko Vorkapich's made
and shot in his kitchen. So the creativity going on there was really pretty
amazing. The whole film cost $96 to do.

&quot;And there's a horror film based on Edgar Allen Poe's story The Fall of the
House of Usher, which is really actually kinda spooky.&quot;

Had Verlaine been a longtime fan of these films?

&quot;No, I hadn't seen any of them in my life except the Ballet Mécanique I saw
in the '60s.&quot; Verlaine was tapped to add his creative fire to these early
experimental films by the Douris Corporation, a foundation in Columbus,
Ohio, and the exclusive worldwide distributor of the Rohauer Collection, one
of the largest and best collections of film art. The prints that the Douris
Corporation have provided for this show are in excellent condition and a DVD
of the films with Verlaine's soundtrack is due out in the fall. (The show's
called Live in Concert: Tom Verlaine &amp; Music for Film.)

&quot;I guess I don't know how these copyrights work,&quot; he says with some
puzzlement. &quot;I guess anyone can take these films and throw a soundtrack on
them and sell them. I actually saw some of them on a cable TV show one night
with some kinda noise band playing a soundtrack. I think they were more or
less using it as a background to throw noise against.&quot;

As for his own recording career, he ended a 14-year drought with a pair of
albums on Thrill Jockey last year. &quot;I've gotta start another record late
summer. (Pause) It's so hard to know what to do - everything's so damn
different now. Basically people are just saying don't bother doing a CD.
Make some tracks at home and put 'em on the Internet. Don't bother going to
a studio. You can do this or that and it's all going to be this one giant
database of sound.

&quot;Just getting used to the sound of digital stuff is a whole different
ballgame. It's exhausting to mix digitally; after two hours I don't want to
hear it,&quot; he laughs. &quot;Even if it sounds good it just sounds bad. Nothing
like listening to tape, which actually contains much more detail.&quot;

Once during an interview, Byrds founder Roger McGuinn explained to me that
the difference between digital and analog sound is like the difference
between an incandescent light bulb and a fluorescent one. The fluorescent
one is cycling, going on and off 60 times per second. But the incandescent
bulb, because the coil is cooling down, still glows. Similarly, digital
sound fools your ears that it's continuous sound but there are holes in it
like 44.1 thousand times a second.

Verlaine suddenly perks up. &quot;It's been proven that digital sound makes
people more irritable. They've actually done tests on people who listen to
CDs for two hours and it's not good for your nerves. Just like fluorescent
bulbs. Did you hear Australia has this legal movement to get rid of light
bulbs because they're not as energy efficient as the flickering jobs? But
they don't realize fluorescent lights have a poisonous gas in them. If you
break a fluorescent light you get that white powder, you don't want that
crap anywhere near you. You don't want to breathe it, all that shit's going
in the dumps - where is all that powder gas going? Christ!&quot;

&quot;These movements to get rid of light bulbs, it's like going digital too.&quot;

Suddenly I realize I'm talking light bulbs with the guy who put one on the
cover of his 1994 instrumental record, Warm and Cool. And silent movies with
the guy who wrote, &quot;I remember how the darkness doubled.&quot; For the moment all
would seem all right in the world ... fluorescent gases notwithstanding.

Tom Verlaine and Jimmy Ripp perform with several films, starting at 8 p.m.,
Friday, July 13, one show only, at the Detroit Film Theatre, inside the DIA,
5200 Woodward Ave., Detroit; 313-833-3237.

Guitarist gets to create the sound of silents
Musician writes scores for '20s films
July 12, 2007

BY JOHN MONAGHAN

FREE PRESS SPECIAL WRITER

Guitarist Tom Verlaine admits that he was far from a movie geek when he
started working with the Rohauer Collection, a cache of early films for
which he was asked to add scores. In fact, he had heard of very few of the
silent movies when he first got a copy of the catalog.

&quot;I said, 'Whoa, we've got to narrow this down a bit,' &quot; says the musician
and composer, who is still best known for his work with rock band Television
in the mid-1970s. &quot;Finally, they started to send me short movies, and I
picked the six or seven that I thought would work, that had enough mood
changes to be interesting.&quot;

Verlaine brings those films, all silent-era experimental works, and his
scores to the Detroit Film Theatre on Friday as part of a summer program of
music and movie events.

A second guitarist, Jimmy Ripp, joins him in the 70-minute performance.
&quot;He's much more adept at effects,&quot; Verlaine says of Ripp, &quot;using echoes and
reverbs, the more spacey kind of things, while I play more the melodies.&quot;

Since its 1999 New York premiere, the show has played in more than a dozen
venues around the world. A DVD of the films with Verlaine's music is
scheduled for release by Kino in the fall.

The films, most shown in 35mm prints, come from key visual artists of the
1920s, including Man Ray, Fernand Leger and Hans Richter. Robert Florey, who
codirected &quot;Life and Death of 9413 -- Hollywood Extra&quot; (1927), introduced
the Marx Bros. to the movies in &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; two years later.

Verlaine says to expect a mix of different styles, both in the films and
their scores. &quot;On the one hand, you've got Man Ray's 'L'Etoile de Mer,' a
more romantic, rhythmic piece, followed by 'The Fall of the House of Usher,'
which is an early horror film with special effects. So right there, you've
got different moods happening.

&quot;Anyone coming for some weird rock show will definitely be surprised,&quot;
Verlaine says. &quot;We play while seated in the audience, with the first couple
of rows roped off, or in the orchestra pit, so we're literally invisible
during the show.&quot;
