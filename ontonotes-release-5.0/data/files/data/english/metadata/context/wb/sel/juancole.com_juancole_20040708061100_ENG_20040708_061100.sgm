George W. Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the
experience necessary to be president.

The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience
necessary to be president when he ran in 2000, so this sort of cheap
shot just hoists him by his own petard. Let's just remember a seminal
Bush moment in 1999:

' Bush fails reporter's pop quiz on international leaders

November 5, 1999

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is enduring sharp
criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot
spots, but President Bill Clinton says Bush "should, and probably will,
pick up" those names.

The front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination
faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy
Hiller, a political reporter for WHDH-TV in Boston.

Bush

Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, India and
Pakistan. Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on
the leader of Taiwan, referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui
simply as "Lee." He could not name the others.

"Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan?" Hiller
asked, inquiring about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who seized control of the
country October 12.

"Wait, wait, is this 50 questions?" asked Bush.

Hiller replied: "No, it's four questions of four leaders in four hot
spots." . . .

Bush, in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan, also
said: "The new Pakistani general, he's just been elected -- not elected,
this guy took over office. It appears this guy is going to bring
stability to the country and I think that's good news for the
subcontinent."

Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments
on Pakistan's recent coup.

"I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country --
the world's oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover
as "good news," Gore said. "Further, I find it even more disturbing that
he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear
weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush's comments.

"It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of
democratically elected governments," said David Leavy, spokesman for the
National Security Council.

Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was, he seems
to have confused coup-making with "taking office," and moreover went on
to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the
installation in power of the Pakistan military, then the world's
strongest supporter of the Taliban, would bring "stability!" Musharraf
made his coup in part because of the military's anger over Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif's willingness to back down from confronting India
over Kashmir, so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger.

I can't tell you how ominous I found Bush's performance in that
interview. I still remember him stuttering about "the General," unable
to remember Musharraf's name. He obviously had no idea what he was
talking about, though he demonstrated a number of ill-fated instincts.
He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy, equating
dictatorship with "stability." And, he didn't think he needed to know
anything about South Asia, with its nuclear giants and radical religious
politics--the latter a dire security threat to the US. He couldn't tell
when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less. Musharraf
went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002, risking war
twice that year. Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after
September 11, under extreme duress from the US, elements of his military
continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated
in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself. This was the body that
Bush proclaimed was bringing "stability" to the region in fall of 1999.

So, one answer to Bush's charge about Edwards is that if it had any
merit, Bush should have declined to run himself.

Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign
affairs now than Bush did then. Indeed, given how Bush has rampaged
around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the
potential to blow back on the US, one might well argue that Edwards
knows more now than Bush does.

This is what Edwards' campaign literature said about his positions:
"Edwards believes that the U.S. must be an active leader to help resolve
conflicts, from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the
peace process in Northern Ireland. Edwards is a strong supporter of
Israel, and believes that the U.S. has a vital role in promoting peace
between the Israelis and the Palestinians."

I don't see Bush doing any of this.
