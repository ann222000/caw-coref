Remember, this will show you how 'deadly' the president of America really IS
to the United States of America and her people.  Personally, I feel it is
too late for the American people to "figure it out".  However, I am just a
man.  The American people, including the American military if necessary, can
remove Bush from office before he is finished intentionally destroying
America.  But you no longer can sit back and watch it all on Bush's Fox
News, you MUST stand up and force Bush from the office he stole.  You may be
arrested, but if enough people care, and rise up to save America, perhaps it
can still be done, no matter how late it is.

THE AGENDA OF ISLAM:A WAR BETWEEN CIVILIZATIONS
by Professor Moshe Sharon

There is no Fundamental Islam

"Fundamentalism" is a word that came from the heart of the Christian
religion. It means faith that goes by the word of the Bible. Fundamental
Christianity, or going with the Bible, does not mean going around and
killing people. There is no fundamental Islam. There is only Islam full
stop. The question is how the Koran is interpreted.

All of a sudden we see that the greatest interpreters of Islam are
politicians in the western world. They know better than all the speakers in
the mosques, all those who deliver terrible sermons against anything that is
either Christian or Jewish. These western politicians know that there is
good Islam and bad Islam. They know even how to differentiate between the
two, except that none of them know how to read a word of Arabic.

The Language of Islam

You see, so much is covered by politically correct language that, in fact,
the truth has been lost. For example, when we speak about Islam in the west,
we try to use our own language and terminology. We speak about Islam in
terms of democracy and fundamentalism, in terms of parliamentarism and all
kinds of terms, which we take from our own dictionary. One of my professors
and one of the greatest orientalists in the world says that doing this is
like a cricket reporter describing a cricket game in baseball terms. We
cannot use for one culture or civilization the language of another. For
Islam, you've got to use the language of Islam.

Driving Principles of Islam

Let me explain the principles that are driving the religion of Islam. Of
course, every Moslem has to acknowledge the fact that there is only one God.
But it's not enough to say that there is only one God. A Moslem has to
acknowledge the fact that there is one God and Mohammed is his prophet.
These are the fundamentals of the religion that without them, one cannot be
a Moslem. But beyond that, Islam is a civilization. It is a religion that
gave first and foremost a wide and unique legal system that engulfs the
individual, society and nations with rules of behaviour. If you are Moslem,
you have to behave according to the rules of Islam which are set down in the
Koran and which are very different than the teachings of the Bible.

The Bible

Let me explain the difference. The Bible is the creation of the spirit of a
nation over a very, very long period, if we talk from the point of view of
the scholar, and let me remain scholarly. But there is one thing that is
important in the Bible. It leads to salvation. It leads to salvation in two
ways.

In Judaism, it leads to national salvation - not just a nation that wants to
have a state, but a nation that wants to serve God. That's the idea behind
the Hebrew text of the Bible.

The New Testament that took the Hebrew Bible and moves us toward personal
salvation. So we have got these two kinds of salvation, which, from time to
time, meet each other.

But the key word is salvation. Personal salvation means that each individual
is looked after by God, Himself, who leads a person through His word to
salvation. This is the idea in the Bible, whether we are talking about the
Old or the New Testament. All of the laws in the Bible, even to the minutest
ones, are, in fact directed toward this fact of salvation.

Secondly, there is another point in the Bible, which is highly important.
This is the idea that man was created in the image of God. Therefore, you
don't just walk around and obliterate the image of God. Many people, of
course, used Biblical rules and turned them upside down. History has seen a
lot of massacres in the name of God and in the name of Jesus. But as
religions, both Judaism and Christianity, in their fundamentals, speak about
honouring the image of God and the hope of salvation. These are the two
basic fundamentals.

The Essence of Islam

Now let's move to the essence of Islam. Islam was born with the idea that it
should rule the world.  Let's look, then, at the difference between these
three religions. Judaism speaks about national salvation - namely that at
the end of the story, when the world becomes a better place, Israel will be
in its own land, ruled by its own king and serving God. Christianity speaks
about the idea that every single person in the world can be saved from his
sins, while Islam speaks about ruling the world. I can quote here in Arabic,
but there is no point in quoting Arabic, so let me quote a verse in English.
"Allah sent Mohammed with the true religion so that it should rule over all
the religions."

The idea, then, is not that the whole world would become a Moslem world at
this time, but that the whole world would be subdued under the rule of
Islam.

When the Islamic empire was established in 634 AD, within seven years - 640
- the core of the empire was created. The rules that were taken from the
Koran, and from the tradition that was ascribed to the prophet Mohammed,
were translated into a real legal system. Jews and Christians could live
under Islam provided they paid poll tax and accepted Islamic superiority. Of
course, they had to be humiliated. And Jews and Christians living under
Islam are humiliated to this very day.

Mohammed Held That All the Biblical Prophets Were Moslems

Mohammed did accept the existence of all the Biblical prophets before him.
However he also said that all these prophets were Moslems. Abraham was a
Moslem. In fact, Adam himself was the first Moslem. Isaac and Jacob and
David and Solomon and Moses and Jesus were all Moslems, and all of them had
writings similar to the Koran. Therefore, world history is Islamic history
because all the heroes of history were Moslems.

Furthermore, Moslems accept the fact that each of these prophets brought
with him some kind of a revelation. Moses, brought the Taurat, which is the
Torah, and Jesus brought the Ingeel, which is the Evangelion or Gospel -
namely the New Testament.

The Bible versus the Koran

Why then is the Bible not similar to the Koran? Mohammed explains that the
Jews and Christians forged their books. Had they not been changed and
forged, they would have been identical to the Koran. But because Christians
and Jews do have some truth, Islam concedes that they cannot be completely
destroyed by war [for now].

Nevertheless, the laws are very clear - Jews and Christians have no rights
whatsoever to independent existence. They can live under Islamic rule
provided they keep to the rules that Islam promulgates for them.

Islamic Rule and Jihad

What happens if Jews and Christians don't want to live under the rules of
Islam? Then Islam has to fight them and this fighting is called Jihad. Jihad
means war against those people who don't want to accept the Islamic superior
rule. That's jihad. They may be Jews; they may be Christians; they may be
Polytheists. But since we don't have too many Polytheists left, at least not
in the Middle East - their war is against the Jews and Christians.

A few days ago, I received a pamphlet that was distributed in the world by
bin Laden. He calls for jihad against America as the leader of the Christian
world, not because America is the supporter of Israel, but because Americans
are desecrating Arabia with their filthy feet. There are Americans in Arabia
where no Christians should be. In this pamphlet there is not a single word
about Israel. Only that Americans are desecrating the home of the prophet.

Two Houses

The Koran sees the world as divided into two - one part which has come under
Islamic rule and one part which is supposed to come under Islamic rule in
the future. There is a division of the world which is very clear. Every
single person who starts studying Islam knows it. The world is described as
Dar al-Islam (the house of Islam) - that's the place where Islam rules - and
the other part which is called Dar al-Harb - the house of war. Not the
"house of non-Muslims," but the "house of war." It is this house of war
which has to be, at the end of time, conquered. The world will continue to
be in the house of war until it comes under Islamic rule. This is the norm.
Why? Because Allah says it's so in the Koran. God has sent Mohammed with the
true religion in order that the truth will overcome all other religions.

Islamic Law

Within the Islamic vision of this world, there are rules that govern the
lives of the Moslems themselves, and these rules are very strict. In
fundamentals, there are no differences between schools of law.

However, there are four streams of factions within Islam with differences
between them concerning the minutiae of the laws. All over the Islamic
world, countries have favored one or another of these schools of laws. The
strictest school of law is called Hanbali, mainly coming out of Saudi
Arabia. There are no games there, no playing around with the meanings of
words. If the Koran speaks about war, then it's war.

There are various perspectives in Islam with different interpretations over
the centuries. There were good people that were very enlightened in Islam
that tried to understand things differently. They even brought traditions
from the mouth of the prophet that women and children should not be killed
in war.

These more liberal streams do exist, but there is one thing that is very
important for us to remember. The Hanbali school of law is extremely strict,
and today this is the school that is behind most of the terrorist powers.
Even if we talk about the existence of other schools of Islamic law, when
we're talking about fighting against the Jews, or fighting against the
Christian world led by America, it is the Hanbali school of law that is
being followed.

Islam and Territory

This civilization created one very important, fundamental rule about
territory. Any territory that comes under Islamic rule cannot be
de-Islamized. Even if at one time or another, the [non-Moslem] enemy takes
over the territory that was under Islamic rule, it is considered to be
perpetually Islamic.

This is why whenever you hear about the Arab/Israeli conflict, you hear -
territory, territory, territory. There are other aspects to the conflict,
but territory is highly important.

The Christian civilization has not only been seen as a religious opponent,
but as a dam stopping Islam from achieving its final goal for which it was
created.

Islam was created to be the army of God, the army of Allah. Every single
Moslem is a soldier in this army. Every single Moslem that dies in fighting
for the spread of Islam is a shaheed (martyr) no matter how he dies, because
- and this is very important - this is an eternal war between the two
civilizations. It's not a war that stops. This war is there because it was
created by Allah. Islam must be the ruler. This is a war that will not end.

Islam and Peace

Peace in Islam can exist only within the Islamic world; peace can only be
between Moslem and Moslem.

With the non-Moslem world or non-Moslem opponents, there can be only one
solution - a cease fire until Moslems can gain more power. It is an eternal
war until the end of days. Peace can only come if the Islamic side wins. The
two civilizations can only have periods of cease-fires. And this idea of
cease-fire is based on a very important historical precedent, which,
incidentally, Yasser Arafat referred to when he spoke in Johannesburg after
he signed the Oslo agreement with Israel.

Let me remind you that the document speaks of peace - you wouldn't believe
that you are reading! You would think that you were reading some science
fiction piece. I mean when you read it, you can't believe that this was
signed by Israelis who are actually acquainted with Islamic policies and
civilization.

A few weeks after the Oslo agreement was signed, Arafat went to
Johannesburg, and in a mosque there he made a speech in which he apologized,
saying, "Do you think I signed something with the Jews which is contrary to
the rules of Islam?" (I have obtained a copy of Arafat's recorded speech so
I heard it from his own mouth.) Arafat continued, "That's not so. I'm doing
exactly what the prophet Mohammed did."

Whatever the prophet is supposed have done becomes a precedent. What Arafat
was saying was, "Remember the story of Hodaybiya." The prophet had made an
agreement there with the tribe of Kuraish for 10 years. But then he trained
10,000 soldiers and within two years marched on their city of Mecca. He, of
course, found some kind of pretext.

Thus, in Islamic jurisdiction, it became a legal precedent which states that
you are only allowed to make peace for a maximum of 10 years. Secondly, at
the first instance that you are able, you must renew the jihad [thus
breaking the "peace" agreement].

In Israel, it has taken over 50 years in this country for our people to
understand that they cannot speak about [permanent] peace with Moslems. It
will take another 50 years for the western world to understand that they
have got a state of war with the Islamic civilization that is virile and
strong. This should be understood: When we talk about war and peace, we are
not talking in Belgium, French, English, or German terms. We are talking
about war and peace in Islamic terms.

Cease-fire as a Tactical Choice

What makes Islam accept cease-fire? Only one thing - when the enemy is too
strong. It is a tactical choice.

Sometimes, he may have to agree to a cease-fire in the most humiliating
conditions. It's allowed because Mohammed accepted a cease-fire under
humiliating conditions. That's what Arafat said to them in Johannesburg.
When western policy makers hear these things, they answer, "What are you
talking about? You are in the Middle Ages. You don't understand the
mechanisms of politics."

Which mechanisms of politics? There are no mechanisms of politics where
power is. And I want to tell you one thing - we haven't seen the end of it,
because the minute a radical Moslem power has atomic, chemical or biological
weapons, they will use it. I have no doubt about that.

Now, since we face war and we know that we cannot get more than an
impermanent cease-fire, one has to ask himself what is the major component
of an Israeli/Arab cease-fire. It is that the Islamic side is weak and your
side is strong. The relations between Israel and the Arab world in the last
50 years since the establishment of our State has been based only on this
idea, the deterrent power.

Wherever You Have Islam, You Will Have War

The reason that we have what we have in Yugoslavia and other places is
because Islam succeeded into entering these countries. Wherever you have
Islam, you will have war. It grows out of the attitude of Islamic
civilization.

What are the poor people in the Philippines being killed for? What's
happening between Pakistan and India?

Islamic Infiltration

Furthermore, there is another fact that must be remembered. The Islamic
world has not only the attitude of open war, but there's also war by
infiltration.

One of the things which the western world is not paying enough attention to
is the tremendous growth of Islamic power in the western world. What
happened in America and the Twin Towers is not something that came from the
outside. And if America doesn't wake up, one day the Americans will find
themselves in a chemical war and most likely in an atomic war - inside the
U.S.

End of Days

It is highly important to understand how a civilization sees the end of
days. In Christianity and in Judaism, we know exactly what is the vision of
the end of days.

In Judaism, it is going to be as in Isaiah - peace between nations, not just
one nation, but between all nations. People will not have any more need for
weapons and nature will be changed - a beautiful end of days and the kingdom
of God on earth.

Christianity goes as far as Revelation to see a day that Satan himself is
obliterated. There are no more powers of evil. That's the vision.

I'm speaking now as a historian. I try to understand how Islam sees the end
of days. In the end of days, Islam sees a world that is totally Moslem,
completely Moslem under the rule of Islam. Complete and final victory.

Christians will not exist, because according to many Islamic traditions, the
Moslems who are in hell will have to be replaced by somebody and they'll be
replaced by the Christians.

The Jews will no longer exist, because before the coming of the end of days,
there is going to be a war against the Jews where all Jews should be killed.
I'm quoting now from the heart of Islamic tradition, from the books that are
read by every child in school. The Jews will all be killed. They'll be
running away and they'll be hiding behind trees and rocks, and on that day
Allah will give mouths to the rocks and trees and they will say, "Oh Moslem
come here, there is a Jew behind me, kill him." Without this, the end of
days cannot come. This is a fundamental of Islam.

Is There a Possibility to End This Dance of War?

The question which we in Israel are asking ourselves is what will happen to
our country? Is there a possibility to end this dance of war?

The answer is, "No. Not in the foreseeable future." What we can do is reach
a situation where for a few years we may have relative quiet.

But for Islam, the establishment of the state of Israel was a reverse of
Islamic history. First, Islamic territory was taken away from Islam by Jews.
You know by now that this can never be accepted, not even one meter. So
everyone who thinks Tel Aviv is safe is making a grave mistake. Territory,
which at one time was dominated by Islamic rule, now has become non-Moslem.
Non-Moslems are independent of Islamic rule; Jews have created their own
independent state. It is anathema.

And (this is the worst) Israel, a non-Moslem state, is ruling over Moslems.
It is unthinkable that non-Moslems should rule over Moslems.

I believe that Western civilization should hold together and support each
other. Whether this will happen or not, I don't know. Israel finds itself on
the front lines of this war. It needs the help of its sister civilization.
It needs the help of America and Europe. It needs the help of the Christian
world. One thing I am sure about, this help can be given by individual
Christians who see this as the road to salvation.
