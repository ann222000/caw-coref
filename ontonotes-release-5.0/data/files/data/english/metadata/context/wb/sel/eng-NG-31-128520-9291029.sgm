Just to let everyone know, there is or can be a form of tablature for every insturment that involves fingerings except perhaps keyboards.  When I played trumpet in hight elementary school, there were little pictures with three circles-open indicating valve up, closed indicating valve down-over the notes in the front of the beginner's book.  Reeds had a row of 10 or 11 smaller circles-10 in a row and one of to the side for the octave key.
Once the music got to even quarter notes, the tab was to slow to use--but if one accidental came along, I imagine it could help.

I knew of players wo would write the fingering in above the noes in varios scales-a form of tab.

... with my younger students, once I show them how Tab
is used (most of them are aware of it before they come
to me), I have them Tab their own pieces ... I also
chart out the notes on the staff with the notes on the
guitar in various posiTIons ...

Kids will pick up reading notation pretty quickly if you have them work with it in a few different ways.

After the first few lessons, I make students do their own tab if they want tab for something. I'll give them the note names and what string it is on and let them figure out where the note goes.  This seems to help them learn the fretboard more quickly.
The book I use for beginning students has backing tracks included on a CD.  Every few songs, I make them write their own melody to fit the backing tracks, and they have to write that in standard notation.  (Although I did once have a student decided to play a melody up around 9th position so I let her get away with tabbing it since we hadn't covered ledger lines yet.)
A lot of students learn quickly with flashcards- I've got 5 year olds who can ID notes from low E to high C as well as most common musical symbols because the flashcards are a game to them.

On the other hand, I teach a band class at an Elementary and Middle school that specializes in working with kids with learning disabilities, emotional problems, or physical handicaps.  I also have a few private students with reading issues. I try to find different ways to work with these kids.

varios scales-a form of tab.

Yes, we did this also in the string section of our community
orchestras.  The convention for us was Arabic numbers for fingers,
Roman numerals for position numbers.  We didn't indicate specific
strings (A vs. D vs. G vs. etc.) however.

Thus, a pencil is in every string player's instrument case, at least
those with sufficient experience to realize how much easier one's life
is made by being able to write down fingerings for one's part in the
arrangement.  Some even bring little springs or whatever to attach the
pencil to one's music stand.

On an aside, I am rereading Tony Levin's _Beyond the Bass Clef_.  I
just reached the chapter in which he says how important it is to be
able to hear in one's head the notes that one reads from sheet music.
He also describes the disadvantages of getting into the habit of
mapping the notes on paper to instrumental fingerings while completely
bypassing the ear.

In classical guitar, the string is noted by an arabic number with a
circle around it.
