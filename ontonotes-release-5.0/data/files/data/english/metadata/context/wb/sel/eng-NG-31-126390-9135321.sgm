this is my first time upgrading a mac, so was looking for some
clarification...

currently i have 2 macs in the house. since $200 is cheaper than $260,
i ordered the family pack, which it says is good for up to 5 users/
macs.

but that leaves with w/ 3 extra that i wont be using. can i give those
licenses to friends or family outside my network? i imagine there will
only be one install disc, but i could lend that and give them the
extra key, no?

thanks

Where did you order the family pack from? Did it not make the
requirements clear? From the ordering page on the online Apple store:

&quot;The Family Pack Software License Agreement allows you to install and
use one copy of the Apple software on up to a maximum of five (5)
Apple-labeled computers at a time as long as those computers are located
in the same household and used by persons who occupy that household. By
&quot;household&quot; we mean a person or persons who share the same housing unit
such as a home, apartment, mobile home, or condominium, including
student members who are primary residents of that household but reside
at a separate on-campus location. This license does not extend to
business or commercial users.&quot;

I don't think I could state it more clearly and explicity myself. Some
legalese can be pretty dense, but it looks to me like someone went to
quite a lot of trouble to write this in terms readable by &quot;normal
humans.&quot; I f you still need translation, the answer is just ...

No, you may not.

Admitedly, you asked whether you &quot;can&quot; instead of whether you &quot;may&quot;. I
took the liberty of answering the question that I assume you meant. The
answer to the other one is very different.

i see. so really, it may be possible that i could have bought just the
one-user license and installed it on both my desktop &amp; notebook. since
i dont use them both at the same time i imagine that would work.

but i can also imagine one saying that would be a violation, too. but
if its possible i probably wouldnt lose sleep over it... having bought
two macs &amp; an ipod in the last 10 months, i think its 'good enough'
for me to re-invest $130 in apple on more software.

evidently not clear enough, no. the copy at the top, where the &quot;Add to

Even using them at the same time wouldn't be an issue unless Leopard is
different to all the previous OS versions. The only issue is legality

His answer looked to me to be neither flippant nor arrogant.

There is a difference between &quot;can&quot; and &quot;may&quot;, and the difference
applies to your question, which wasn't clear as to which you actually

That's like saying &quot;I already bought three Toyotas, so I am entitled to
steal the fourth one.&quot;

I'm not telling you to steal or not to steal. I will tell you this,
however: real men steal at gunpoint, not in secret in their homes. If I
were going to steal Leopard (I've ordered a family pack) I would walk
into a retailer, guns a-blazing, take it off the shelf, maybe grab a
Mac or two (but if I stole multiple Macs along with Leopard I would be
sure to steal the family pack) and retreat, guns still a-blazing.

That's how a *real* man would steal Leopard.

survival of our genetic material ) over a period of time that is
constantly complicated by parameters and delimiters that define what
is right &amp; wrong.

There are no absolute right and wrongs.

If someone want to buy an OS and use it for themselves on 20 different
machines, then it's crazy to have to buy 20 copies of the same

You want to reward the people that created it, but One User Equals One
OS.
If the User's daughter wants to use that OS on one of those computers
that the Primary User normally uses, how is that different from
letting the daughter borrow the car...?

Software, i conceed, is a crazy thing, but at some point, you have to
turn your brain on to decide what is reasonable...!

Yes, and let's compare to a certain other company, shall we?  One Mac OS
X Family Pack licenses you to install on five Macs for only $40 per
machine at full list price, and it's widely available for less than list
price.  In contrast, Windows Vista Home Basic, the sparest and cheapest
version, retails for $177 at Amazon.com.  Even the upgrade price for
that version, $59, is nearly 50% more expensive per computer than the
Mac OS X Family Pack.

Which dictionary?

On Tiger, at least, the second bullet in the definition is &quot;each of

If you have some perverse reason for wanting to give away four copies
of OS X to neighbors, why bother paying for the family pack?  Either
way, you'll probably get away with it.

I was wondering the same. Odd how &quot;sure&quot; he is of how something is
legally. I'd have guessed he wasn't even a native speaker. This one sure
seems clear to me. The &quot;housing unit such as&quot; bit pretty much nails it
down (yes, the word &quot;unit&quot; does appear, in spite of Per missing it).
Legal-speak does indeed at times have non-obvious meanings, but this
doesn't have the usual flavor of such things. This does have the flavor
of something that a lawyer spent quite a bit of time making both clear
and bullet proof. Since Per is so sure of the legal meaning, I'd be
amused to see him try to argue this in an actual court instead of a
newsgroup, though the odds of that happening seem negligable.

Apparently we always use the first definition in some random dictionary
for legal purposes. So, according to my OED (20-some-odd volume paper
version that takes up several feet of my bookshelf and might as well get
some use on occasion), the first definition of &quot;condominium&quot; is &quot;joint
ownership or soverenity&quot;. Perhaps that makes the whole US a condominium
(that &quot;we, the people&quot; stuff), so anyone in the country counts. :-) I
don't think I'll try that line. IANAL, but at least I have been in
courtrooms enough to have a pretty good idea how that would fly. It
would not be found amusing. :-(

You are right on target.

There only reason for this thread is that some people would like to
'stretch' the license in a manner clearly not intended by Apple.

I fail to see why they bother with buying a family pack (IF they ever
actually do so) since they might as well go ahead and buy a single copy
and do with it whatever they wish.

If the matter should ever go to court you can be sure that it wouldn't
make any difference whether they had one or the other.

Using either a single or family license in a manner not sanctioned by
Apple would result in a guilty verdict.

My dad once told me not to leave the yard but I did anyway; actually, I
just put one foot outside the yard in defiance of his command and left
the other inside.

While I was getting spanked, I learned something valuable: I could claim
that I was still in the yard because my left foot was, but he could
claim that I was out of the yard because my right foot was...and his
claim prevailed.

The lesson was that the rules, their interpretation and penalty for any
violations of them were not made by me and I did not have the final say
in regard to the matter.

In many cases, though thankfully not all as some would claim, another
point is illustrated: the bigger party set the rules, and has first
claim on their interpretation. It falls apart quickly, though, as we did
away with corporal punishment for petty crimes.
