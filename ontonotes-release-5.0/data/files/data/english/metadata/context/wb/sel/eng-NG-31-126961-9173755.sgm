I had an appointment in South County yesterday morning, so I had my
first opportunity to drive the CA-133 and CA-241 toll roads. At peak
travel time in the morning, these toll roads were completely
free-flowing, with traffic moving along at about 75 MPH (a standard
pace for SoCal freeways when they're not choked with traffic). Because
my house is near one on-ramp and my destination was near another, I
was able to complete the entire 16-mile trip in under 20 minutes,
including stops at the toll plazas to pay cash (I don't have a FasTrak
transponder). That's only a couple of minutes longer than it takes me
to drive a mere 8 miles to work using surface streets!

It occurred to me that this must have been what it was like back in
the 40s and 50s when the first freeways were built. You see in the old
films of the period how the freeways are NEVER jammed, and traffic is
always flowing at full speed. I have read that driving on these
freeways was actually a PLEASANT experience; I can certainly use that
adjective to describe my trip on the toll roads yesterday.

The price for all this pleasure? A mere $2.75 each way! (If I'd had a
FasTrak, it would have cost only $2 each way). Now, to those of you in
Eastern states this might seem like a lot of money to pay for a toll,
but believe me it's a SMALL price to pay to avoid the nighmarish
congestion on SoCal's freeways! To drive the equivalent route on
freeways and surface streets would have easily taken 45 minutes to an
hour at 7:4AM. How much is YOUR time worth?

Of course, I was driving against traffic - most of the commuters on
the road live in Rancho Bufu Egypt or the Inland Empire and are
heading INTO Irvine, whereas I was heading OUT, but traffic was
flowing smoothly even in the other direction.

I wonder how long this automotive bliss will last? I watched them
build these toll roads back around the turn of the millennium. How
long before these, too, become so choked with traffic that they become
unusable? Already there are signs that the system is overloaded: the
last segment of CA-261/Jamboree Road, which is a 10-lane freeway
between Bryan Avenue and Barranca Parkway, regularly backs up from
Barrance all the way to Walnut, a distance of 2 miles. The 261 is only
about 9 years old, and already it is a MAJOR PITA to use!

Congestion pricing, already in place on the 91 toll lanes, will out of
necessity be instituted on the 133, the 241, and the 261 before too
long, which should stave off complete collapse for a time. Eventually,
however, even that won't be enough. It will be interesting to drive
these roads again in 5 or 10 years and compare the experiences.

I know the feeling...here in Houston, the Sam Houston Tollway is experiencing
growing pains on all four sides, and the next major project will be expanding
the South Sam - which was built with two lanes in each direction between
about a mile south of US 59 and a mile west of I-45 on the southeast side.
The construction on that will start next summer.  The Westpark Tollway is
already choked, since it was built on the old UPRR right of way that Metro
bought around the turn of the millennium - and at morning rush, it's a
parking lot from Texas 6 all the way in to between Fondren and the exit to
inbound 59.  Congestion pricing won't be far behind.

Your problems in Houston are exacerbated by the low (by SoCal
standards, at any rate) tolls you guys pay. One time we tried to
escape heavy afternoon rush hour traffic on the 10 (Katy Freeway) by
ducking off onto the Sam Houston tollway; we came across the flyover
ramp to find that the tollway was just as jammed as the freeway!

Clearly the Houston market will bear MUCH higher tolls than are
currently being charged. :)

That's $2.75 for a one way trip on the toll roads, for only one day. But if
I calculate the yearly cost...

($2.75 / 1 day) * (365 days / 1 year) works out to $1003.75 each year (that
isn't a leap year).

The FasTrak discount of $2.00 works out to $730 per year.

Double that if the toll roads are used in both directions, also on the
assumption that the toll isn't significantly increased with heavier traffic
conditions.

And to calculate the actual value beyond time saved, one would have to
figure out how much in gas they are wasting by not using the toll roads and
being stuck in freeway and surface streets traffic. But, with the current
gas prices, if they use even one extra gallon at $3.00+ per gallon, then the
toll roads are a good value after all.

That would depend on which way you went on the West Sam from the
Katy...southbound afternoons will back up from the mainline toll south of
Boheme, with the tollway still in its original (1988) configuration.  Lanes
have been added south of that, all the way down to the Southwest (US 59),
including the free section between 59 and Beechnut, and are being added along
the north leg of the West Sam from 290 over to 249.  (The final gap in the
Sam Houston loop, from the 59 Eastex to just south of the US 90 Crosby, will
start filling in in about a year...and maybe some day, there will be an
actual stack at the three freeway crossings that use surface feeders for
movements between tollway and freeway:  East Sam at 225 Pasadena Freeway,
South Sam at 288 South Freeway, East Sam at 90 Crosby Freeway (and possibly a
full connection with the Fort Bend Tollway, which is currently limited to
feeders).

HCTRA has raised the rates twice - on the original West Sam leg, the mainline
was 75c for EZTag and $1.00 for cash, which are now $1.25 and 1.50,
respectively.  Other exits have gone up anywhere from 35 to 60 cents.

I *always* use the Toll Roads when given the opportunity.  Traffic on I-5,
I-405, CA-91, and CA-55 is so often bad (and a crapshoot, esp the first two
routes) and I am *very* traffic-allergic... ironic, given that I live in
SoCal.

I have a FasTrak transponder and I'm actually on the &quot;free&quot; account, i.e.
it's set up to use the 91 Express Lanes at no charge under the arrangement
that I'm only to use it for the 3+ passenger lane (which has no toll
westbound and no toll eastbound except for peak afternoon use which is
half-toll).  I don't commute but head into OC once or twice month.  I pretty
much always have 2 other passengers with me so the arrangement works well...

From Riverside, where I live, I jump on CA-91 and get in the HOV lane, which
is usually a really big help.  Under most circumstances, you can do at least
the SL all the way out to the county line, where the Express Lanes start.  I
just stay in the HOV lane all the way til it becomes the HOV lane if I'm
headed to Anaheim or Newport Beach.

To way South OC, just jump onto CA-241 before the Express Lanes.  I'm also a
big fan of CA-73, that's another route with sparse traffic from what I've
experienced, and it's also a beautiful drive through the hills near the
coast.

In my experiences driving, CA-231, CA-133, and CA-73 have low volumes of
traffic...  but I don't tend to drive during rush hour...  this is more
during Saturday driving crush times when SoCal gets *huge* backups on
freeways.  The Toll Roads are great at those times.

I never understood why they did not build a direct connection ramp

Not that I've noticed...the Westpark is its usual parking lot at morning and
evening rush, but I came across the South Sam from I-45 to Fondren last week
at the afternoon stampede and had no problem in the EZTag lanes.  From what
I've seen, the EZTag lanes at the mainline toll plazas on the South and West
Sam are moving normally, save for a couple of spots around I=10 where the
reconstruction of the stack is continuing.

It depended on location.  Some new roads --expressways and regular
expansion--of the 40s and 50s were jammed the day they were opened, or
soon afterwards.  (Of course, some expressways never reached their
full potential.)

Also, during the 50s road construction resulted in nasty detours that
caused jammups.

&gt; I'm the same way. My solution is not to drive on freeways when I can

That's actually something that I never thought about, but I'm sure
*somebody* between the two transit agencies (OC &amp; Riverside Counties)
along with CalTrans has discussed the possibility of connecting the 91
express lanes with CA 241.

=======================

It would be a massive undertaking -- that is one *big* flyover between WB
CA-91 and SB CA-241...  I'm sure you'd need something similar for the EB
CA-91 Express Lanes traffic to get to SB CA-241 because they'd have to be
flown over the non-toll lanes to join with CA-241.

Likewise, the NB traffic on CA-241 would have to be flown over additional
lanes of traffic to get the FasTrak motorists to the Express Lanes directly.

Both of these tasks would be mucho dinero...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I had an appointment in South County yesterday morning, so I had my
&gt; first opportunity to drive the CA-133 and CA-241 toll roads. At peak
&gt; travel time in the morning, these toll roads were completely
&gt; free-flowing, with traffic moving along at about 75 MPH (a standard
&gt; pace for SoCal freeways when they're not choked with traffic). Because
&gt; my house is near one on-ramp and my destination was near another, I
&gt; was able to complete the entire 16-mile trip in under 20 minutes,
&gt; including stops at the toll plazas to pay cash (I don't have a FasTrak
&gt; transponder). That's only a couple of minutes longer than it takes me
&gt; to drive a mere 8 miles to work using surface streets!

&gt; It occurred to me that this must have been what it was like back in
&gt; the 40s and 50s when the first freeways were built. You see in the old
&gt; films of the period how the freeways are NEVER jammed, and traffic is
&gt; always flowing at full speed. I have read that driving on these
&gt; freeways was actually a PLEASANT experience; I can certainly use that
&gt; adjective to describe my trip on the toll roads yesterday.

&gt; The price for all this pleasure? A mere $2.75 each way! (If I'd had a
&gt; FasTrak, it would have cost only $2 each way). Now, to those of you in
&gt; Eastern states this might seem like a lot of money to pay for a toll,
&gt; but believe me it's a SMALL price to pay to avoid the nighmarish
&gt; congestion on SoCal's freeways! To drive the equivalent route on
&gt; freeways and surface streets would have easily taken 45 minutes to an
&gt; hour at 7:4AM. How much is YOUR time worth?

&gt; Of course, I was driving against traffic - most of the commuters on
&gt; the road live in Rancho Bufu Egypt or the Inland Empire and are
&gt; heading INTO Irvine, whereas I was heading OUT, but traffic was
&gt; flowing smoothly even in the other direction.

&gt; I wonder how long this automotive bliss will last? I watched them
&gt; build these toll roads back around the turn of the millennium. How
&gt; long before these, too, become so choked with traffic that they become
&gt; unusable? Already there are signs that the system is overloaded: the
&gt; last segment of CA-261/Jamboree Road, which is a 10-lane freeway
&gt; between Bryan Avenue and Barranca Parkway, regularly backs up from
&gt; Barrance all the way to Walnut, a distance of 2 miles. The 261 is only
&gt; about 9 years old, and already it is a MAJOR PITA to use!

&gt; Congestion pricing, already in place on the 91 toll lanes, will out of
&gt; necessity be instituted on the 133, the 241, and the 261 before too
&gt; long, which should stave off complete collapse for a time. Eventually,
&gt; however, even that won't be enough. It will be interesting to drive
&gt; these roads again in 5 or 10 years and compare the experiences.

I also expected the two tollways to connect when the 241 was built.  I
recall seeing something in the paper a few months ago saying a
connection between the 241 and the 91 Express Lanes was being looked
into.

I found this, mentioning a connection in 2030(!) (page 18):

This site also mentions the connector (page 13):

Yes, it is - but now that that portion is built, it's a relatively
small matter to build a couple more ramps that climb up from the
Express Lanes and join the exiting gigundo flyover. Surely such ramps
could pay for themselves in increased tollway usage?

2030? That'll be an entry in the &quot;Too Little, Too Late&quot; category, I
expect.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The proposed 91 Express Lanes connection with SR-241
&gt;scheduled for year 2030 creates a lane imbalance.

That &quot;lane imbalance&quot; must be why they didn't build the direct
connectors initially; they wanted a chance to add more Express Lanes
first. I also noticed that CTPC's franchise to operate the 91 Express
Lanes (since acquired by OCTA) expires in 2030, and that AB 1010 gives
authorization for tolls to be collected until 2030. Coincidence?

&gt;91 Express Lanes traffic growth has significantly outstripped
&gt;corridor traffic growth.

This is a slight tangent, but NO SHIT, SHERLOCK! The free lanes on the
91 have reached their full capacity and cannot accommodate additional
cars; OF COURSE the overflow is going to go through the Express Lanes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;While peak hour traffic growth have slowed somewhat, off-peak
&gt;and “shoulder” period traffic have grown dramatically.

[...]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Global (general purpose and 91 Express Lanes) daily traffic has
&gt;been redistributed to reflect higher non-peak period demand.

Again, DUH! Only so many cars can fit through the neck of the bottle
per hour; if there are more cars than that, they get delayed in long
traffic jams and come through later on, or the drivers plan ahead and
leave earlier. Both of these behaviors broaden the &quot;shoulders&quot; of the
curve.

How much is OCTA paying these consultants to tell us the obvious? :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Peak hour tolls have increased following the Toll Policy.

Translation: Congestion Pricing is having the desired effect,
spreading the same number of cars out over a longer period of time and
stabilizing traffic density at any given moment.

The problem with tolls is they rise, and always far faster than the
general rate of inflation.  Someday your grandson will be posting and
saying &quot;I remember seeing those films from the early 2000s when tolls
were only $2.75 for all that driving pleasure.  What is it now?  $20!
And the roads are logjammed&quot;
