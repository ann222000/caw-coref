Could someone walk me through the install process?

1. Front/Back?
2.Sides?
3. Cable tightening?

Just a general by-the-numbers would be OK.  And I would appreciate it.

Thanks.

Also, can the numerous screws that go across the back of the top (at
the trunk) be replaced?  Is there an easy way?

Start with the rear, I'd recommend using stainless screws as replacements
(and check/clean your drainpipes while the top is off), fit the top to the
header rail nice an' tight, then the cables.

CLEAN everything really well while it's apart. Taking the time to paint
the bow/header rail assembly if it's scarred or sommat rusty makes it bespoke.

I use a good contact adhesive on the front (header rail) and the middle
bow attachments. The little chrome "tabs" for where the top pivots (just
rear of the door) will keep from abrading the fabric, too. I didn't have
them, and now regret not hunting them down as an added protection: Frayed corners.

Oh, and I HIGHLY recommend fitting a Robbins top. Excellent quality, good
fitting instructions too.

But how do I do the replacement?  They bold in from the rear under a
very enclosed trunk lid and bulkhead.

Thank goodness there are only about 5 or 6, but several are
strategically placed and I'm not sure how to get them removed.  Drill
them from the front?

Thanks.

On my '78, all fasteners are in the "tray" just inside the top at the
rear. The "bolts" are threaded studs and part of the coachwork, covered with a flap
of upholstery material. An aluminum strip is fitted to "sandwich" the rear
of the top to the body. All I had to do was undo all the nuts/washers to
remove the old top and fit a new one.

ahh... sorry. Missed that bit. mia culpa.

After looking at the placement/accessability of the studs, my solution
would be to cut off the broken ones and drill through with a -small-
bit as accurately on centre as possible, increase bit size to furnish
a hole to run a 6mm (looks like 1.5 pitch) tap and replace the studs
with short (Very Short) bolts or screws. If time is not a factor, I'd
actually put longer (say 25 to 30mm) bolts in the tapped holes, set
with green Loctite, cut off the heads, clean the threads and so have
the "consistency" of the rest of the studs. ( I'm a bit of a nutter
about these types of things) Patience would be the most important tool
inna kit for this job.

HTH

Think I'm gonna go out and clean/anti-sieze mine today. That's not a
problem I want to find on next top replacement.

Thank you.

BTW, Doc, did you see my other post regarding the two red warning lights
above the gauges?  The one on the left keeps coming on and I have no idea
what that light means (or the other one for that matter).

Would you happen to know?

Thanks again for the advice on the studs.

I've messed mine about so much, I can't be sure which was which. They
should be Alt. warning, oil press. warning, heater fan on, and high
beam indicator.

I had some poxy speedo/tach guages in mine when purchased (US Ver. had
85 MPH max indicated speedo... Fed thought it would DIScourage
speeding... Heeheee-haahaaa-hoooohoooo!)

I just HAPPENED to have a set of REAL guages lyin' about (from a '69
GTV) so when I did the 1750 conversion, in they went. Oil press. guage
'n light are ~in~ the MECHANICAL tach, Gen &amp; HTR fan indicator lights
inna speedo.  High beam  (blue one) is the only working "jewel" on the
centre panel now. Replaced the round O/P guage inna center with a nice
VDO voltmeter... All much more practical and informative.

And rather bespoke, IMHO ;-}

My eyes aren't as good as they once were but the drawing I saw seemed to
mention 'low fuel pressure".  And it only said that in the listing at the
bottom for the lights.  I can't find it anywhere on the drawing.

I'm about to replace both fuel filters so we'll see.  It seems to be
charging ok but I'll be expecting either a voltage regulator or alternator
in the future if this doesn't work.

It does seem to be difficult to start so I am hoping the filters may help
this.

Thanks again for the advice on the top studs.  I'll get to work on that as
soon as it cools off.  Seems I'll have more time than I thought to work on
this.

What's "more time?" And may I have some please? ;-}

Has it the mechanical FI or EFI? Either way, look to a checkvalve/pressure
regulator as well. Find a mate with a fuel press. test guage and check it.
No sense "chasin' yer tail."

It's been YEARS since I knobbled on a mech. injection system, and can't
recall spec's (converted mine to Webers), but I'll try an' dig up the
numbers if needed. Certes they're onna web as well.
