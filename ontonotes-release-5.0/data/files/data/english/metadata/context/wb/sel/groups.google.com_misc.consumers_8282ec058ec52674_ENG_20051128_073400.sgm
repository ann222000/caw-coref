The differnce is big and for varried reasons. I am a member here and on
other NGs because I am for all intents and purposes &quot;homebound&quot; . Belive you
me I'd much rather be out in the field making 65k a year, or becomming
successful in my music interests. This 8k a year life isn't that much of an
incentive.
The newsgroups help to pass the hours of an otherwise very boring lifestyle.
Maybe you should try on a little compassion before one day in life you wind
up in these shoes bubba. lol I wonder if then you would remember your hate
filled words and cherish the help,assistance and compassion shown to you. I
very much doubt it tho:( Most self absorbed people don't tend to watch thier
back trail.

Is this a job offer? You have to be willing to pay me $30,000 a year or
more....and the work load must be really, really light. And only about 4
hours a day. Is there a job like this out there some where? If so, I would
take and not worry about getting SSI.

Increase SSI payments? I don't think so - my tax dollars at work:

Dis Colon Rectum. 1994 Jul;37(6):676-84. Risk of sphincter damage and
anal incontinence after anal dilation in obese patients. Neeley MI,
Rasmulen JO, Pendensen NR, Christien MJ. Department of Radiology,
Glostrup Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

Follow-up was performed two to six years after anal dilation surgery
for obesity-in-ano in 64 consecutive patients who had not undergone
additional anal dilation surgery. The patients all of whom were
classified as morbidly obese with BMI of &gt;40 had been characterized in
initial interviews as non-restrained binge eaters or minimally
restrained eaters. All patients shared a common problem of either
constipation or constipation/difficulty of fecal elimination due to a
combination of weight and size. The problems were exacerbated by the
physical and ergonomic difficulty the patients often encountered in
using normal lavatory facilities. SINCE NONE OF THE PATIENTS EXPRESSED
ANY DESIRE OR INTENTION OF LOOSING WEIGHT OR BEGINNING AN EXERCISE
PROGRAM, THE ANAL DILATION SURGERY WAS DESIGNED TO EASE THE PROCESS OF
DEFECATION.

All patients were interviewed and asked specifically about impairment
of flatus or fecal control and its possible relation to the anal
dilation. Anal dilation was followed by minor anal incontinence in 12.5
percent of the patients. Anal endosonographic follow-up was accepted by
40 patients, and sphincteric defects were found in 26 (65 percent) of
those. Two patients with anal incontinence had internal sphincter
defects. Sphincteric defects were also found in 22 of the 36 continent
patients who underwent sonography: internal sphincter defects in 18,
external sphincter defect in 2, and combined defects of both sphincter
muscles in 2. In conclusion, anal dilation surgery results in sphincter
damage in more than half of obese patients, but few of them develop
anal incontinence.

You seem to be suggesting that individuals who pursue certain
lifestyles such as uncontrolled overeating or cigarette smoking
shouldn't qualify for disability benefits on the basis of impairments
that can be linked to those lifestyles, e.g., diabetes, emphysema, and
heart disease.

Every few years this issue is raised and discussed briefly at
roundtables and conferences, but it is invariably concluded that a
cause-and-effect relationship is too difficult to determine in the
individual case. E.g., does this 40-year-old person's disabling
emphysema come from his 20-year history of smoking, or his genetic
makeup, as his non-smoking father died from emphysema at 55?

You probably know that since 1996, a person cannot qualify on the
basis of drug addiction or alcoholism per se, even though the medical
community continues to view these as medical impairments. You can
still qualify on the basis of impairments that are associated with
drug addiction or alcoholism, e.g., liver disease and Korsakov's
psychosis. Prior to 1996, you could e.g., qualify merely on the basis
of uncontrollable drinking that prevented you from getting out of bed
the next morning to go to work.

Also, at one time, you could qualify solely on the basis of obesity
per se. If your weight reached a certain level for your height, your
case was automatically allowed, even if your obesity had not caused
yet any health problems. Today, obesity is viewed as an additional or
secondary factor, e.g., on your ability to walk, etc.

Such narrow minded people!
I worked many years before my physical condition warranted me to stop
working a &quot;9-5&quot; job. In fact, the Doc who examined me for my SSD
application, stated that he was amazed that I worked as long as I did under
the physical limitations that I face.
btw! I still work part time in my own business...which the SSA knows about
because I told them when I went in and applied for SSDI.

As I found out recently, there are always two sides to every story...

Very VERY cool. Thanks for the link! I can relate to the authors opinions
and having that bit of know about in my brain takes me one step closer to
good conversation. :)
I just got back from the social service lady's office then spent 45 minutes
on the phone with Social Security. Why? ok you pulled it out of me! I run
around telling folks I am legally blind. I get a lot of grief from people
who don't know enough about medicine or the law yet think they are experts
on my disability and how slickly I am at pulling the wool over poor ol Uncle
Sam. It really sticks in my craw sometimes. Anyway the social worker, in our
conversation while we were talking about SGA stuff tells me that &quot;I don't
think you would qualify for the higher SGA that is afforded to the blind&quot;
WHAT????? I was stupyfried. I mean sure I have this seizure disorder but my
main issuse has allways been the vision impairment. Or so I thought.
So I called the Social Security Administration as soon as I get home and we
dig through the files, after the obligitory verification process. It turns
out that my Disability Determination was decided due to the neuralogical
disorder. Wow. Nine years I've been thinking that the main reason played
second fiddle to my sight.
Oh well I wont be able to work and recieve the higher amount SGA for
blindness but I did clear up that question I kept asking Jack a couple weeks
ago:-)
I can now go clean toilets or some other low paying job and not worry about
losing my health insurance. I told the lady that all this time I had not
looked for work because I was worried about sticking my rump out in the
asile and hollering &quot;kick it kick it!&quot;
Also told her about my attempt to make a music CD and was told that it was
not a problem. Sales from that count just like a home business only they
don't count the hours you put into it like they would a nine to fiver type
employment.
I am sooooo relieved. Now when I have the meeting with the Vocational
rehabilitation guy about the mechanical licenes for these songs I want to
play I wont need worry about how much information I am inadvertantly giving
away.
btw Should I have put this in a sepperate post for others to gain
encouragement?

"/> EXACTLY. Ive even done most of them. Of course they are becoming very
low-paying jobs. It doesnt take long for a company to realize that the
telecommuting guy they never see can be replaced with someone overseas
for 1/10th of the pay.

But telecommuting is sweet. Lots of pros (and cons). I would be glad to
work up some for your introduction lecture. And some of the advantages
that a place like a computer store could expect by donating equipment to
the cause.

Its wonderful of you to take it on like this. Its definetly the time for
a recognition push but of course someone has to make it happen. Good
luck.

Mechanical licenses----How much is that per minute? Do you pay to another
artist, or do you receive from your CD manufacturer/distributor?

I think &quot;Hammer&quot; was &quot;discovered&quot; selling his CD's out of his car trunk. I guess
regional touring and local radio airplay is the only way to build up demand,
unless you get feature spots on MTV,... but who watches MTV anymore since the
mid-90's?

There's an 8-10.00 one time set up fee and .85 cents per track under 5
minutes. Anything over 5 minutes is $1.65 per minute. I have nine songs on a
ten track CD that are not of my own creation. total cost for the minimum
burn limit is $451.41 (only one song is over 5 minutes)
Now this is at the Harry Fox Agency. they have a pretty good web site where
you don't have to be registered to find songs and figure out your costs. I
am , now, a registered &quot;producer&quot; . HFA is only involved in processing the
royalty rights and distribution of monies. And they cover quite a good
number of the artists.
It's been a real learning process going to that site. It seems that &quot;by law&quot;
you are not even alowed to play and sing songs to a private group of friends
live unless you have the licenses. Bean counters and lawyers rule this
musical world it seems.
I wonder if Hammer produced all his own CDs and the tracks on them or if any
of his material was copyrite protected prior to his being discovered. If so
the legal eagles would've lunched first before he got his break i think.

NEW FAT-FRIENDLY POTTIES ENDANGERING THE SKINNY!
By David Languel International Herald Tribune

Skinny people are falling into enormous toilets -- and fat folks are to
blame says advocacy group.

&quot;Manufacturers are making toilets bigger to accommodate the increasing
size of American behinds,&quot; says June Markham of People Advocacy Today
&quot;As a result, slim people have to perch on the edge of the seat and are
in danger of falling into the water and hurting themselves on the edge
of the seats. If you manufacture a toilet the size of a hot tub to
cater to big fat cheeks, bad things are going to happen.&quot; This is an
ergonomic nightmare for normal people.

Markham says outsized toilets are being installed in thousands of
hotels and restaurants and to date, more than 200 thin people have
fallen off their perch on the seat and plunged into the water. Some
have sustained back injuries. A class action suit is being considered
but Markham refuses to discuss specifics.
&quot;Thank goodness there have been no serious injuries so far,&quot; she says.
&quot;But it's only a matter of time before we have a lawsuit. One client
was staying at a motel that had a toilet seat big enough to accommodate
three normal people. Unfortunately she fell into the water and
accidentally flushed at the same time. 'It was really disgusting,' she
told me. 'It was like being caught under a toilet version of Niagara
Falls.' Ironically it was the threat of legal action from fat advocacy
groups that prompted many hotels and restaurants to install supersize
commodes to begin with. Some restaurants now offer adult versions of
&quot;kiddy seats&quot; to allow normal sized clients to use the bathroom
facilities.

Recently, the AMA published a report indicating that longer hypodermic
needles were now needed to penetrate the extra layers of buttock fat in
obese patients.

&gt; There's an 8-10.00 one time set up fee and .85 cents per track under 5

&gt; ten track CD that are not of my own creation. total cost for the minimum
&gt; burn limit is $451.41 (only one song is over 5 minutes)
&gt; Now this is at the Harry Fox Agency. they have a pretty good web site where
&gt; you don't have to be registered to find songs and figure out your costs. I
&gt; am , now, a registered &quot;producer&quot; . HFA is only involved in processing the
&gt; royalty rights and distribution of monies. And they cover quite a good
&gt; number of the artists.
&gt; It's been a real learning process going to that site. It seems that &quot;by law&quot;
&gt; you are not even alowed to play and sing songs to a private group of friends
&gt; live unless you have the licenses. Bean counters and lawyers rule this
&gt; musical world it seems.
&gt; I wonder if Hammer produced all his own CDs and the tracks on them or if any
&gt; of his material was copyrite protected prior to his being discovered. If so
&gt; the legal eagles would've lunched first before he got his break i think.

&gt;&gt; Mechanical licenses----How much is that per minute? Do you pay to another
&gt;&gt; artist, or do you receive from your CD manufacturer/distributor?

&gt;&gt; I think &quot;Hammer&quot; was &quot;discovered&quot; selling his CD's out of his car trunk. I
&gt;&gt; guess
&gt;&gt; regional touring and local radio airplay is the only way to build up
&gt;&gt; demand,
&gt;&gt; unless you get feature spots on MTV,... but who watches MTV anymore since
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; mid-90's?

In the area of CDs there are PoD arrangements (print on demand) that make
it very easy. Record your stuff, upload it, and you get a webpage where
people can order one. The other company handles the credit card junk,
burning the CD, shipping it, etc. Then they send you your markup over the
base price (whatever you set that to).

OBVIOUSLY the initial sites where its cheap or free to get setup have
drawbacks that dont match up to the serious music CD sites. But the point
is that with such sites exisiting, ANY musician, artist, writer,
designer, programmer can find out if their stuff has appeal by just
uploading their stuff to a PoD site for CDs, books, posters, mousepads,
mugs, t-shirts. Even people who only ever did 1 song, or 1 doodle art
they did on everything in school, or 1 story they wrote that everyone
liked, should pop it up on the net instead of wondering forever.

have shopped for.

Yes I agree. Yet these companies have to be sure that the material they are
selling for you is not copyrited. I think they cover thier legal rump by
having you sign a release stating you will take full responsibility. Now I
can't site one instance where a big named start went after a virtual nobody
but the opposite senerio is quite common. Fer instance the Belgin guy who
suited Madonna (guess it was a couple years ago) . Still if you produce
music it had better be your own creation or your butt is hanging out there
for the lawyers to feed upon. I only have one song that is mine lock stock
and barrel the other nine songs are other peoples stuff.
Interestingly enough &quot;Cover songs&quot; do quite well on web sites like cdbaby
and itunes. Buy the rites to one song, produce it and upload it to them and
they will sell the crap out of it for ya. I read on CDbaby just recently
where a guy made ten grand off of a cover song.
Works this way... person goes looking for a song and finds a list of
everyone who &quot;produced&quot; it. original artist that they remembered is there
plus some other person. they dl that one too. if they like it they may even
dl other songs by that artist. and the numbers keep adding up
Not a bad way to do things.
Me on the other hand is trying to produce an entire CD at once. Gonna cost
me almost 500 bucks just for the rites and we aint talking about ink, paper,
labels and blanks to do this all &quot;in house&quot;. I've written to all the big
corps about my idea and tried to get permissions to no avail except to be
told &quot;do it the legal way &quot; and &quot;we are just pencil pushers&quot;&lt;sic&gt;
I'm close tho. got a few more irons in the fire warming up. :)

"/> I recall reading an article reporting that the average American ass in
the late 1940s was 18 inches wide, and in 1999 was 21 inches wide.
Some movie theaters, concert halls, etc., have remodeled their seats
to accommodate the wider ass.

Must've read it in a mag, because I can't find any reference to it
online. And I also wonder if the story is apocryphal; 21&quot; seems awful
wide for an average ass.
