Road Chips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&quot;Dirt Roads&quot;

What's mainly wrong with society today is that too many Dirt
Roads have been paved.

There's not a problem in America today, crime, drugs, education,
divorce, delinquency that wouldn't be remedied, if we just had more
Dirt Roads, because Dirt Roads give character.

People that live at the end of Dirt Roads learn early on that life
is a bumpy ride.

That it can jar you right down to your teeth sometimes, but it's
worth it, if at the end is home...a loving spouse, happy kids and
a dog.

We wouldn't have near the trouble with our educational system if
our kids got their exercise walking a Dirt Road with other kids,
from whom they learn how to get along.

There was less crime in our streets before they were paved.

Criminals didn't walk two dusty miles to rob or rape, if they
knew they'd be welcomed by 5 barking dogs and a double barrel
shotgun.

And there were no drive by shootings.

Our values were better when our roads were worse!

People did not worship their cars more than their kids, and
motorists were more courteous, they didn't tailgate by riding
the bumper or the guy in front would choke you with dust &amp; bust
your windshield with rocks.

Dirt Roads taught patience.

Dirt Roads were environmentally friendly. You didn't hop in your
car for a quart of milk, you walked to the barn for your milk.

For your mail, you walked to the mail box.

What if it rained and the Dirt Road got washed out? That was the
best part, then you stayed home and had some family time, roasted
marshmallows and popped popcorn and pony road [sic] on Daddy's shoulders
and learned how to make prettier quilts than anybody.

At the end of Dirt Roads, you soon learned that bad words tasted
like soap.

Most paved roads lead to trouble. Dirt Roads more likely lead to
a fishing creek or a swimming hole.

At the end of a Dirt Road, the only time we even locked our car
was in August, because if we didn't some neighbor would fill it
with too much zucchini.

At the end of a Dirt Road, there was always extra springtime
income, from when city dudes would get stuck, you'd have to hitch
up a team and pull them out. Usually you got a dollar... always
you got a new friend... at the end of a Dirt Road.

It's time to tell Congress to stop hurting your healthcare
Did you know that your family's healthcare is in jeopardy and it's up to
you to ProtectYourHealthcare   ?
Right now, Congress is creating a 'new' kind of health insurance - with
no protections, no guarantees and no limits on prices. Under
Washington's plan, insurers won't be required to keep money in the bank
to pay your claims, but they will be able to raise your rates when you
get sick - or whenever they want. Worst of all, insurers will also take
away every single health protection you have in your state, from direct
access to your OB/GYN to your right to appeal. Visit
and tell Congress to stop hurting
your healthcare now!

College Chips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two friends signed up for college. When they looked at their
schedules, the first friend noticed he had Logical Reasoning as a class.
Not knowing what it was, he went to the class and asked the teacher what
logical reasoning was.

The teacher than proceeded to explain:

&quot;Do you have a weed eater?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the guy.

&quot;You have a weed eater, which means you have a lawn, which means you
have a house, which means you have kids, which means you have a wife,
which means you're straight.&quot;

When he got out of class, he met with his friend who asked him what
logical reasoning was about.

&quot;Well,&quot; said the guy. &quot;Do you have a weed eater?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; replied the friend.

&quot;Well, there you go...then you're gay!&quot;

Poker Chips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While playing poker in a local poker joint, George an avid player,
noticed that in the last few days, one of the players had done extremely
well. So well in fact that George felt compelled to approach the old man
and ask him what his secret was. The old timer looked at him for a
second then said &quot;I'll tell you, but when you play me you have to fold
to me when every time I'm in the pot with you.&quot;

George thinks it over for a while, then reluctantly agrees.

The man says &quot; first of all see John over there, he scratches his head
whenever he is bluffing.&quot;

George says &quot;oh.&quot;

The old man continues &quot;See the man at the end of the table, that's
Jimmy, when he has an ace, his nose flares a little bit. Now, Jeff over
there, he always looks down when he has a great hand.&quot;

George says &quot;wow, thank you.&quot;

They start playing and at the end of the night George is broke. He
corners the old timer and exclaims &quot;why did you tell me those lies, I
lost all my money.&quot;

The old timer says &quot;I'm sorry, your right I did tell you lies to get you
to help me win.&quot;

George says &quot; well, what was your secret to success then.&quot;

The old timer replies &quot; I made the same deal with Jimmy, Jeff, and John
that I did with you&quot;.

A handyman was working for a Synagogue had asked for a raise and was
turned down. He decided to quit and went out to look for work. First he
went to a Catholic church and was told that in order to work there he
would have to answer one question. The priest asked, &quot;Where was Jesus
born&quot;? The man answered, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;, and was thrown out.

He then went to a Baptist church. The minister told him that in
order to get a job there he would have to answer a question. He was
asked, &quot;Where was Jesus born&quot;? The man answered, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. He was
tossed out.

Walking away he met the rabbi who was looking for him. The rabbi
exclaimed, &quot;The board approved your raise. Please come back
immediately&quot;. The man said to the rabbi, &quot;I will come back only if you
answer a question. &quot;Where was Jesus born&quot;? The rabbi says, &quot;Bethlehem&quot;.

Cries the man. &quot;I knew it was in Pennsylvania&quot;.

Life

On the first day, God created the dog and said:
&quot;Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at
anyone who comes in or walks past.
For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.&quot;
The dog said: &quot;That's a long time to be barking.
How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?&quot;
So God agreed.

On the second day, God created the monkey and said:
&quot;Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh.
For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.&quot;
The monkey said: &quot;Monkey tricks for twenty years?
That's a pretty long time to perform.
How about I give you back ten like the Dog did?&quot;
And God agreed.

On the third day, God created the cow and said:
&quot;You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer
under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family.
For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.&quot;
The cow said:&quot;That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty
years.
How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?&quot;
And God agreed again.

On the fourth day, God created man and said:
&quot;Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life.
For this, I'll give you twenty years.&quot;
But man said:&quot;Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty,
the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten
the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?&quot;
&quot;Okay,&quot; said God, &quot;You asked for it.&quot;

So that is why the first twenty years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy
ourselves.
For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family.
For the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the
grandchildren.
And for the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at
everyone.
Life has now been explained to you.

Wayward Rabbinical Students

Two rabbinical students were caught by the Rabbi gambling
and drinking in the company of undesirable characters before
the sun set on the evening of the Sabbath. The Rabbi called
them into his study the next day.

Both confessed to having given in to weakness, and admitted
that they deserved punishment. The Rabbi thought and then
went into his kitchen and brought back two bags of dried peas.

&quot;Put these in your shoes,&quot; he told them, &quot;and walk on them
for a week, to remind yourself how hard life can be when
you turn away from the Law.&quot;

A few days later the two students met. One was limping terribly,
had dark circles under his eyes, and looked very tired.
The other seemed much as he had been the week before.

&quot;Hey,&quot; said the first. &quot;How is it that you are walking so freely?
Didn't you do as the Rabbi told us and put the peas in your shoes?&quot;

&quot;Of course I did,&quot; said the other. &quot;How could I disobey the Rabbi?&quot;
He started to walk away, paused, and then said, &quot;But I boiled them
first.&quot;

Hey Working Person...... this is JUST for Y O U !!!!!!

Psalm 23 ........For the Work Place

The Lord is my real boss, and I shall not want.
He gives me peace, when chaos is all around me.
He gently reminds me to pray and do all things without
murmuring and complaining.

He reminds me that he is my source and not my job.
He restores my sanity everyday and guides my decisions
that I might honor him in all that I do.

Even though I face absurd amounts of e-mails, system
crashes, unrealistic deadlines, budget cutbacks,
gossiping co-workers, discriminating supervisors and an aging
body that doesn't cooperate every morning, I still will not
stop---
for He is with me! His presence, His peace, and! His
power will see me through.

He raises me up, even when they fail to promote me.
He claims me as His own, even when the company
threatens to let me go. His Faithfulness and love is better than
any bonus check.

His retirement plan beats every 401k there is!
When it's all said and done, I'll be working for Him a
whole lot longer and for that, I BLESS HIS NAME!!!!!!
Bless you!

Welcome to Buffalosjokes and Thank You for joining us. My
name is Buffalo and I have the watch.

Dear Buffalo,

As you know, I have been writing poetry on military life over the
last two years, and as I have gone along, I have been sending some in
for you to share. Well, I am very happy to say, that I am in the final
stages of work. I have roughly five poems left to finish, and I should
be all set. Of course I have said that before and then get inspiration
to start another one, so who knows... I may just have to do a volume
two! I am adding in my personal thoughts and feelings and sharing how
some of the writing came to be, or the reasons some of them were
written. A few will I will be adding a few pictures to as well, so it
will be some thing truly very touching.

A month ago, when I went to my new civilian doctor, I was waiting in
the exam room, bored so I looked for something to read. There was very
little to look at other than the normal posters on the walls and a few
official medical magazines, but hidden behind those was a issue of TIME
Magazine. I grabbed it and was touched by the photo of three soldiers
over in Iraq. I cringed a bit when I looked at the date as it was from
over 16 months old, but hey, it was something to look at. Well inside
there was a photo that touched my heart, a young soldier, in full
uniform, sitting loading a ammo box with fresh ammunition. He had a warn
look on his face and I noticed he even had what looked like blood
splattered on his flack jacket. His expression held my attention for a
long time, and try as I did to look thru the rest of that magazine I
could not help but go back to that picture. I had to write about the
emotions I saw on his face... the only paper was the towels from the
dispenser so I grabbed a few and started writing. It took a while and I
actually had to put the original draft on hold and on the anniversary of
the USS COLE bombing, while my husband and I were watching the news of
that awful day he went thru aboard her... I became inspired again
regarding the picture.

I am in the process of awaiting permission to use the photo in my book
along with the poem. But I want very much to share this with you and
those who read the chips each day. Inspiration for my writing comes at
odd times and from simple things just as this one did. I hope you and
every one else like this one. On a quick side note, I am in the process
of looking for a publishing company for my work. I have had one offer,
but am going to make sure I scan the field for the best offer... you
see, something I plan to do is use 10% of what I would earn to form a
special fund of some kind for veterans. Something I have planned on from
the beginning, just have to work on details of it all...

Have a great day.

A SOLDIER&quot;S THOUGHTS

I sit here as I get prepared to go to battle once again

And I can not help but think of what we have seen

So many times I wonder if anyone really cares what we are doing

All I have heard is the shouts when people here scream

Don't they appreciate what our nation is doing?

Don't they understand we are against terrorism no matter where?

Don't they even understand we are trying to really help them?

Why cant they just understand we are doing a mission and we really do
care?

A bomb exploded only 5 feet from my truck this morning

It blew up the one that was ahead of my team

And I all I can see in front of me is what happened

And all I can remember right now is the very loud scream

I did my best to save one of the soldiers who was thrown from it

That is why this blood is on my flack jacket I wear

And I will forever remember calming the young man down some

Simply by reassuring him that I was right there

Yes I have many questions of just what I am doing

But I can not honestly say we don't belong over here

For the terrorists bombed that great nation of ours

And we need to stand strong to terrorism and not live in fear

Is it so wrong for us to be such a caring nation?

Is it wrong for us to want them to be free?

Don't these people understand that the price of freedom...

Means to take a stand against the enemy?

My command says that we are doing the right thing here

But I heard from my family the protests on war have begun

And I want so much for people to understand we are fighting

A war that no matter what ... simply must be won

I understand that I may be severely wounded

And I understand that there is a chance I may not even survive

But I can't walk away like some people are asking

I don't care if I come out dead or alive

I know that may sound cold hearted to some people

And I honestly don't want anyone to think I believe I should die

But I just want people to understand what we are doing

I want them to understand all the reasons why

I am here fighting for our nations freedoms

And I am here fighting for other countries freedoms as well

And I must tell you that not a day will go by us

When we over here don't think of the day those towers both fell

For we believe that this cause of freedom is a good one

And we believe in independence in all lands

And I must say that it feels good when a child says thank you

And even better when an older man shakes your hands

There are some people over here who have said thank you

And that far out weighs the negative you have seen on tv

And remember I am just one simple soldier

But there are a whole lot of others here that are serving like me

All we want is to share in our freedoms

To rid this world of the terrorism that has already taken so many lives

And we pray each day as we do battle with some of the insurgents

That this new nation now beginning will be one that survives

So please, keep saying a prayer for my fellow soldiers

And if you could, can you say one for me just as well

Remember I am simply a simple soldier fighting for this world's freedom

In a war that feels more like I am living in hell

Ask god to protect us as we all do our duty

And please remember to think of those who are serving at home too

For we all have answered the call to fight for our nation's freedom

It is something we have all sworn to continue to do

And say a prayer for the families of all those we have lost here

Know that their sacrifice is something none of us will ever forget

And I feel honored and privileged serving my nation

It is not something I will ever look back on and regret

God bless all of those back home in America

God bless the other nations who are in this war on terrorism too

And may He be there no matter what or when we need Him

May God always bless us to do our very best for all of you.
