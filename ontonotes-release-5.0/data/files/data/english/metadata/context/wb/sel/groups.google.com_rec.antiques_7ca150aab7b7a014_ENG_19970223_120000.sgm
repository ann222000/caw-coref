"/> Ask a grandma but don't let her convince you to toss the skillet in the
fireplace! This method does work but it is risky at best and Murphy's
law will surely come into play with your most expensive items and cause
them to warp or crack.

A better way that does not take any special tools is to put your
skillets in a self cleaning oven and use the controlled heat to burn
off the gook. Be sure to remove any wood handles first!

After that, it's just a matter of scrubbing off the ash with a
stainless steel scrub pad and lots of soap an water. (note: don't use
the brass or copper scrub pads because they will rub off on the iron)

Good luck

"/> Are you planning to *use* the item, or just display it?

If you are planning to use one, do *not* use any soap or cleanser on it. This will completely ruin any seasoning previous owners have done to the item. Either try to &quot;bake&quot; the stuff off at very high heat or use steel wool and warm water and lots of elbow grease. Be sure to dry the pot thoroughly so that new rust doesn't form and give it a light coat of vegetable oil spray.

If you already stripped off the seasoning, you'll have to start all over again. Coat the pan liberally with oil and put it in a hot oven for about an hour. Let it cool, then wipe the oil off. Coat the pan inside and out, and if it has a lid, do the lid as well. *Never* use soap on the seasoned pan. Usually, you can just wipe it out when you're done cooking; if something must be removed just scrub it out under warm plain water.

I have several iron pans that have been in my family for a long time, and I wouldn't trade an iron pan for the most expensive no-sticks in the world. But could someone please tell me why my big Griswold with the &quot;large&quot; symbol on the bottom is so collectable? It doesn't cook any better than the Lodge's I've gotten from the Service Merchandise...

"/> I don't agree.

First off, if you have just purchased the piece, chances are you don't
know where it has been and what it has been used for. My stepmother
uses hers to slop the pigs!

Second, many times the gook is so thick that it won't scrub off evenly
and you will end up with the iron burnished in some spots instead of
the original and desirable black tone. This devalues the piece.

Finally, many of the older folks that I have talked with report that
they cleansed and reseasoned their iron on a yearly basis.

If you have the old family iron, then, at least, you know where it's
been and the grease has a pedigree that you can trust.

To answer your question about Griswold and why it is collectable, it's
old and is some of the finest iron cookware casting of the twentieth
century. Look at the smooth interior of your skillet and compare it to
the unpolished surface on your new Lodge skillets. There is a great
difference. It is possible that you have a carbon build up that
obscures this. I have had Griswold skillets of the large logo variety
that were nearly mirror finsh on the inside.

To sum up, when cleaned and seasoned correctly, both cooking properties
and collector's value of the piece are improved and it in no way
damages the iron.

Enjoy your skillets
Glenn

"/> Yes, and I'll admit that was what I was thinking in my response. You're right that people use things for surprising reasons, and given that I will bow to your better judgement.

"/> Aha. I always thought the mirror finish was simply because of the age of the pan. I figured if I kept my Lodge for 75 years it would eventually develop such a finish. Unfortunately, what you are saying makes an awful lot of sense. I'm afraid I'm now going to have to haunt those dreadful &quot;country&quot; stores to look for the better class of pan.

"/> I will, thanks. And I will *definitely* picture your grandmother and her pigs when I take a &quot;new&quot; pan home to clean!

Thanks very much for the helpful info.
