MIAMI (AP) - Nearly a half-million people were ordered to evacuate as
Hurricane Frances swirled toward Florida on Wednesday just weeks after
Charley's devastating visit, threatening to deliver the most powerful
one-two punch to hit a state in at least a century.

Those planning to ride out the storm snapped up canned food, water and
generators, while military helicopters and planes were flown out of
the area and Cape Canaveral's Kennedy Space Center said it would close
on Thursday.

The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for about 280
miles of Florida's Atlantic coast - from Florida City near the state's
southern tip to Flagler Beach about 20 miles north of Daytona Beach. A
hurricane watch means those areas could start feeling hurricane
conditions within 36 hours.

Forecasters said the still-strengthening Category 4 storm could hit on
Labor Day weekend as early as Friday night, less than three weeks
after Charley raked Florida's western coast with 145 mph wind, causing
billions of dollars in damage and killing 27 people.

&quot;I can't emphasize enough how powerful this is. If there's something
out there that's going to weaken it, we haven't seen it,&quot; hurricane
center director Max Mayfield said.
(unquote)

Looks like this hurricane is aimed, more or less, at crossing Florida
in the direction of Grumman's house in Port Charlotte. Of course,
it's strength will probably diminish by the time it might get there.
Hang on Grumman. Hang on Lynne.

30 August 2004. I've had electricity for a while, but still no phone
service. It would appear my server is defunct, as well, but I haven't
been able to find out for sure. Meanwhile, the MCI truck providing free
access to the Internet has left the area. I'm now at a local library,
making this entry. My time is about up, so that's it, for the nonce.

Let's see. If it's likely that electricity, phone, and water are
going to be out, my idea would be to fill the bathtub and have a store
of drinking water on hand, then exit to the public library or school
gymnasium. Problem is, the cat would be stressed, even in a carrier.
How about a Hurricane Party at a secure location with a few others and
pets? Okay, if the hurricane is coming down the alley to bowl another
strike, stay in the house with the cat, unless the whole thing is
going to get flattened, and have emergency cellphone, light, and
radio. If the bathtub has water in it, you can make do with lying on
the floor next to it in a fetal position.

Question is, If the govt. has already paid Grumman for the missing
roof after the last hurricane, is it going to be possible to be paid
again after this hurricane? bb

Looks like it's likely to hit the other side of the state from Bob, and though
he may have some nasty backlash weather it shouldn't be too severe. More than
likely, it's the Central Florida area which will get hit twice if Frances makes
landfall where they say it might.

Oh, I do hope not, Ann. I've been thinking about you. I just heard, I think
on CNN, that they're thinking of making the roads out of Jacksonville one
way because of the vast number of people coming through from the south.
Please take care.

My mother had an evening flight out of Sarasota (to England) this evening. I
hope she got off ok. But many flights into Florida are being cancelled,
which means there are no planes to take people elsewhere.

Fingers crossed for you and Bob and your loved ones and pets,

Hi, everyone. Yeah, looks like more fun here. I spent the morning
tying down various items in the yard that high winds could blow into
mine or someone else's house, mostly aluminum siding and the like.
I'm set for Frances, I think. I'm now at a friend's. I still have no
phone!

Will return to Internet as soon as possible after Frances to let you
all know what happened. Good luck to any others who might be hit,
like the lady north of me in Florida.

Searching for live web-cams in Central Florida just now, I find a
couple that may be of interest.

On the West Coast, one is at St. Petersburg:

one at the top of a bank in Downtown Tampa:

One the East Coast, at Daytona Beach, the newspaper has very good
storm tracking displays at:

plus a web-cam at the end of the pier facing north:

The Cape Canaveral web site shows a large cam picture:

Mobile free-lance web-cam operators housed in a motel room are
temporarilly shut down, but may be up and outside tomorrow morning:

Right now it's night, so daylight pictures won't be available until
morning. It looks like this hurricane is so big it will cover the
entire state.

Thanks for your kind thoughts, Lynne and David. It now looks more clearly like
Jacksonville will once again get a pass from the eye of the storm, though we
will likely have yucky weather. It's already been raining off and on, though
the sun is out right now. Won't probably start to feel it in earnest till
tomorrow. Time to rent some movies, perhaps?

Having lived in Orlando for about 13 years or so prior to moving here, I have
many friends in the Central Florida area, for whom and for whose homes I am
concerned. Happy to know my best friend and her mom have driven up to Tennessee
to watch it all from a sister's house.

I believe all will be well here, though we might still lose power in a
thunderstorm. Who knows? But I don't feel nearly as at-risk as I felt earlier
this week when the line was much closer to a direct hit for us.

Bob -- grateful to know you are safe and at a friend's.

Best regards,

Ann Carrigan

Some notes from the north side of The Tempest:

I was up till about 3 this morning. Aside from occasional bursts of
rain, and a generally creaky sound coming from the roof (only mild
winds here so far), the Big Event was mostly something shown on TV,
coming to you live from southern counties, and a quick scan of media
web sites. You can watch a streaming feed at  , my
alma mater as it were, in Orlando.

Yesterday there was this strange sense of foreboding, but the surreal
kind, like watching an older but well-done suspense movie. I tried to
help my neighbor get his car started, then offered to be backup to get
his wife to the airport in the morning, but asserted that I very much
doubted there would be a flight.

This morning, a tornado just west of here, moving westward. Our
newscasters were showing the exact streets in Doctors Inlet that were
affected. Power flickered off and then on again at almost exactly 9am.
It's gray, the treetops are dancing but not bent sideways or anything,
and it's between rain sessions. I came into work to check the
overnights ratings and stuff.

If there is danger in our area it will likely be from lightning later
on and possibly more tornados.

Mostly I just feel a sense of concern for so many others in my state,
especially those who have gotten socked twice in three weeks. And then
worrying about the longer-range impact of the devastation -- the
possible collapse of the citrus industry from a double whammy, and all
those people facing job losses. A lot to think about; it's truly
humbling to be able to sit here, employed, safe, dry.

Truly,

&quot;One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they follow.&quot;

(Tried to work it back around to Shakespeare)

Ann

Yes, a lot of pelting rain indeed. It's almost midnight, and the wind has been
gusting. I tend to jump and make sure the window isn't about to smash in, but I
guess it's not as bad as it sounds. The roof creaks. I'm sleeping downstairs
tonight! The power has flickered a few times and was off for 15 minutes this
evening, but where I am I don't feel in danger. There were several tornados
this afternoon around the area. Lots of uprooted trees.

I will do well if I get anywhere near a whole night's sleep tonight, as it's
been a bit rough to do so.

I won't be happy till Frances is downgraded to a cirrus cloud over Indiana.

It finally feels over -- at least for me. A lot of people just got power back,
even in the Jax area, today or the night before. As for the rest of the state
-- it'll be a while before it's business as usual, even for those who haven't
lost their dwellings.

We even had sun (before more rain) today. It seemed to be a teasing sun,
&quot;anything happen while I was on vacation?&quot;

I feel guilty for popping up on HLAS just to talk about the weather...and of
course Bob when he was missing. But I missed all the Shakespeare Festivals this
year, and I haven't read anything related to the subject. I did get the DVD's
of &quot;Titus&quot; and &quot;Revenger's Tragedy&quot; from Poor Yorick. I'm glad to say
&quot;Revengers&quot; held up to my initial opinion -- at least for me.

Best regards,

Ann
