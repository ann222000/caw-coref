Well, they can ask the Japanese, who took a bath the last time.  But
remember the important lesson of Banking 101:  If you find someone owing
you a little money, then you've found a debtor; if you find someone owing
you a lot of money, then you've found a partner.  Whom are they going to
sell their poison-laced crap to if our economy takes a dive?

By the end of 2006, China's foreign direct investment had reached US$73.33
billion, distributed over 163 countries and regions in the world, the
overseas Chinese fund enterprises has hit 10,673. This year, China's foreign
direct investment continues to develop rapidly. It is expected to reach
US$16 billion by the end of this year, up by thirty percent more than last
year.

Chen Jian, Assistant Minister of China's Ministry of Commerce, said at the
&quot;Chinese and Foreign Enterprises International Congress&quot; that China's
foreign investment has changed from a single &quot;green field investment&quot;
approach to a variety of ways including cross-border mergers and
acquisitions, recently formed a diversified market structure. In 2006,
China's (non-financial) foreign direct investment reached US$16.13 billion,
up by 31.6 percent more than 2005. It moved up from seventeenth in 2005 to
the thirteenth on the world list, the purchase method of direct investment
reaching US$ 4.74 billion and making up 36.7 percent of the total foreign
direct investment.

The latest research report published by the Ministry of Commerce shows that,
at present, China's foreign direct investment has four main characteristics.
The first is the diversification of regions within which China invests. In
2005, for the first time, China's investment in Latin America exceeded all
of Asia, made its way up to first place, and continued at the top in 2006.
The second is the enhanced general strength of Chinese international
enterprises. The third is the gradual formation of an all-round, widespread,
and multi-level investment structure. The fourth is a pick up in the
development of cross-border mergers and acquisitions, becoming one of the
most important methods of current foreign investment.

Don't wait too long, it's one tough language for gwailo to learn. Those I

In Africa, China Trade Brings Growth, Unease
Asian Giant's Appetite for Raw Materials, Markets Has Some Questioning Its
Impact on Continent

By Craig Timberg
Washington Post Foreign Service
Tuesday, June 13, 2006; A14

JOHANNESBURG -- Every time newspaper publisher Trevor Ncube visits his
native Zimbabwe, he said, there seem to be more Chinese. He sees them
shopping at boutiques, driving fancy cars, picking up their children from
elite private schools.
And as in much of Africa, Ncube said, China's reach into Zimbabwe's economy
is equally pervasive: The roads are filled with Chinese buses, the markets
with Chinese goods, and Chinese-made planes are in the skies. Chinese
companies are major investors in mining and telecommunications. The
government in Beijing, meanwhile, is a crucial backer of Zimbabwe's
authoritarian president, Robert Mugabe.
&quot;They are all over the place,&quot; said Ncube, 43, who owns newspapers in
Zimbabwe and South Africa. &quot;If the British were our masters yesterday, the
Chinese have come and taken their place.&quot;
Such unease appears to be rising across Africa as Chinese become powerful
players -- and, in some places, the dominant ones -- in economies across the
continent. In a pattern replicated across the world, China's voracious
appetite for raw materials is helping push sub-Saharan economies to their
fastest growth in three decades, and inexpensive Chinese-made products are
suddenly available across the continent. Yet many Africans say the influx,
while offering consumers more affordable goods, has not improved their
economic situation and has hurt local companies.
African and Western activists say China's increasingly close ties to the
troubled governments in Angola, Nigeria, Sudan and Zimbabwe are undermining
efforts to nurture democracy and improve human rights.
When Chinese President Hu Jintao toured Africa in April, he implicitly
responded to concerns about his country's growing role on the continent.
&quot;China's development will not bring a threat to anyone but, instead, will
only bring more opportunities and space for development to the world,&quot; Hu
told the Nigerian National Assembly, according to news reports.
He also reiterated China's policy of making business deals without any
expectation that governments will improve democracy, respect human rights or
fight corruption. He told reporters in Nairobi, the last stop of his tour,
that China follows &quot;a policy of noninterference in other countries' internal
affairs.&quot;
China's overall trade with Africa rose from $10.6 billion in 2000 to $40
billion last year and continues to increase, according to Chinese government
statistics. Sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth rate, meanwhile, has nearly
doubled over the same period, from 3 percent to an estimated 5.8 percent
this year, the best since 1974, according to the International Monetary
Fund. Among the major factors, analysts and economists say, is the
increasing trade with China.
&quot;Those places that are energy-rich and mineral-rich are awash in cash,&quot; said
J. Stephen Morrison, head of the Africa program for the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, speaking from his office in Washington. &quot;And that
is driven in part by these new, rapid-growth Asian economies.&quot;
China has spent billions of dollars securing drilling rights in Nigeria,
Sudan and Angola, and has exploration or extraction deals with Chad, Gabon,
Mauritania, Kenya, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Ethiopia.
The Chinese also have become investors in the booming copper industry in
Zambia and Congo. They have been major buyers of timber in Gabon, Cameroon,
Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea and Liberia. Chinese companies were widely
criticized for keeping former president and war crimes suspect Charles
Taylor flush with cash and prolonging Liberia's devastating civil war. The
Chinese also have helped push up the prices of other African exports such as
platinum, iron and coal.
Across Africa, meanwhile, Chinese companies have outbid other foreign firms
on construction projects, winning contracts to pave highways, build
hydroelectric dams, upgrade ports, lay railway tracks and build pipelines --
all of which stand to help Chinese companies more effectively transport
African resources.
Chinese companies have developed a reputation for going where others won't
because of political, environmental or ethical concerns, or because profit
margins are too slim. State-owned companies in China, analysts say, have the
ability to forgo short-term profits in pursuit of the government's long-term
strategic interests.
Infrastructure improvements often are explicitly traded for raw material
contracts. In Angola, where the government has done little to alleviate
poverty or stimulate democracy since the end of a devastating civil war in
2002, China has promised $2 billion in aid as part of a deal for oil rights.
Human rights activists say that influx of cash has stiffened the
government's resolve against outside pressure -- mostly from the West -- to
reform.
Countries that sign deals with Chinese companies also win diplomatic
protection. China, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has
threatened to use its veto power to block sanctions against Sudan, which
U.S. officials and others accuse of committing genocide in its Darfur
region. China also resisted efforts by the United Nations to investigate and
punish Mugabe for a &quot;clean-up campaign&quot; last year in which police destroyed
slums and markets, depriving 700,000 Zimbabweans of either their homes or
their jobs.
China has been a significant supplier of jet fighters, military vehicles and
guns to Zimbabwe, Sudan and other repressive governments.
&quot;Wherever there are resources, the Chinese are going to go there,&quot; said
Peter Takirambudde, head of the Africa division for Human Rights Watch.
&quot;They see no evil. They hear no evil. That's very bad for Africans.&quot;
The Chinese influx does have benefits to African economies. Commodities used
in manufacturing, such as oil, copper and platinum, are surging
