On Saturday, the largest demonstration in the history of California occured in Los Angeles, the immigrant rights demonstration estimated by police (who anyone who has been to any demonstration knows make the smallest possible estiamtes) at a half-million and the march organizers as one million. And where did we read about it? Not on the front page of the San Jose Mercury News , whose major front page story was about "Apple at 30." An immigrant rights march of 5,000 in San Jose did make the front page of the local section with pictures and a decent sized article ; reading that article carefully one could find exactly a half sentence in the fifth paragraph mentioning the demonstration in Los Angeles.

And was the Mercury News unique in this regard? I doubt it. On the online edition of the New York Times today, those million people don't make the "main story headlines" on the top of the page, but are confined to the smaller one-line headlines in the "National" section. And what is that headline, as reflected in the article ? "Los Angeles Immigration Rally Draws Thousands." Thousands! A march they estimate as a half-million people in the article gets described as "thousands"! An event which wasn't even important enough for the Times to cover itself; the article is an AP article And, by the way, this was an immigrant rights rally, not an "immigration" rally. The marchers were not advocating "immigration," they were advocting rights for immigrants.

The Washington Post ? Even worse. Even though this march, and other massive marches around the country, were aimed at opposing specific legislation currently before Congress, the story does not appear on the Post online front page anywhere, even in the fine print. If you click on "National," when you get to that sub-page, down in the fine print under "More News" you find the story, once again an AP story. Nothing the Post deemed worthy to cover.

A truly disgraceful performance. Democracy? These people wouldn't know "democracy" if they tripped over it. Or if it stared them in the face, as it did on Saturday in Los Angeles and elsewhere.

this downplaying or ignoring protests was a BIG lesson the policy elite learned from the protests against the denial of civil rights and the war of aggression on vietnam: do not amplify protest - it simply encourages it. do not let the public know how much protest is going on - that's bad for business.

sheldon wolin, a berkeley prof, made the point that the modern state does not want active citizens, just soldiers and taxpayers. it is so true.

i even remember an article by edward said some years ago in which he listed dozens of the (often local) protests going on all over the homeland. i was dumbfounded. this is the old, old, old conspiracy of silence (a true conspiracy if there ever was one!)

I think that there is a connection between this and the hiring of that racist, Ben Domenech, by the Washington Post.

The connnection is that papers like the Post, the NYT and the Mercury News do not see their readership growth being fueled by Latinos. They are losing the competition with Latino newspapers, just as Latino television networks are beating the so-called mainstream local stations.

(And, note, that I emphasize Latinos here, because my impression is that they have been the drivewheel of these protests.)

So, Latinos are being written off. So, instead, a paper like the Post decides to try to reach out to white fundamentalist racists to expand their audience.

Of course, there are other factors, limited knowledge of Latino politics and culture, limited interest, ignorance, in other words.

this indeed was a huge demo . keeping in mind the one in chicago 2 weeks ago which was quarter million plus size and many others around the country of various sizes ignoring these does tell you how pathetic has national MM become when it comes to citizen's protests against rulers .

there are many cross currents here and difficult to see how will it evolve . among the organizations involved there is a sizable presence of groups with fealty to dems ( expect least the neocon wing of dems for example hillary will attack bush from right on this ) with in the rank . even when the people realize there is strong racist underpinning to the right's so called immigration reform will it lead to next logical step of questioning the system is a big question .

add to that based on what i saw in SF ( 20 some people have been on fast since tues [ will end it tomorrow ] in front of federal building / in small tents on the side walk ) most of visible left has been pretty much missing . race and class has ( not totally ) some thing to do here .
so much is possible . hypothetically at least .

Why is it racism when someone speaks out against illegal immigration? Since 'illegal' is the key word, why shouldn't it be a felony? Legal Mexican immigrants make up a large portion of the U.S. and have made great contributions to our society. However, there is obviously a problem w/ illegal immigration in this country.

What do you suggest we do about it?

hi tribe one simple solution will be to abolish borders !
if you really want to think about legality perhaps a good starting point will be the very white presence on these americas .
just food for thought . what exists on the ground is reality .

'hi tribe one simple solution will be to abolish borders !'

Although I think that would be great if we could have a borderless society, I think it would mean sure disaster in the long run.

Mexico obviously has a higher poverty level than the U.S. on average and an even more crooked government than the U.S. (hard to believe).

I am not for a fence between Mexico and the U.S., but I am for a more controlled way of allowing people equal access to the U.S..

Do you have any less drastic ideas than no borders?
