Hi,

I need some advice in choosing and placing speakers in our bar. The
room is about 55'x16' (18m x 5m). Walls are concrete blocks and there
is a suspended ceiling. We will just be playing CDs, no live bands
yet.

Thanks !

Need to know the requirments. Do you just want something playing in the background,
or do you want people to be there and say, this sounds good.
Levels, population. type of music, stc. Stereo/mono?

I would use lots of smallish speakers, broken up into &quot;zones for individual
control of volume
many smaller speakers  will give more even coverage and add a couple of sub
woffers and the sound can be quite impressive
check the EAW line up

They have one of the only multidirectional speakers out there. I heard one at
a ball game. I was impressed with the sound. This was a fill in speaker. Model UM42.
They certainly make a good selection of speakers if one can afford them.
Many places don't want to spend a lot of money. The budget was also

Greg, remember you are talking to King George who demands that you sacrifice
everything important to buy the best equipment.  It doesn't matter if you
don't have the funds available and go bankrupt to get the best. To him,
sound reinforcement is a god to sacrifice to.  Sound reinforcement is a
master to be served instead of a tool to serve.  Sound reinforcement is God
and he is the high priest.

His idea about small speakers spread around the bar is a good idea given the
concrete block walls.  Given that this is probably a startup business (the
impression I get) and money has to be spent in many areas, EAW is probably
an extravagant choice.  Behringer is probably a better choice to get started
or shop around the pawn shops for some better brands at low prices.

No dancing, but good sounding background music. We expect people will
come here to speak to each other, laugh... we hope it'll be party-like
on week-ends, and maybe more quiet on week days.

Music will be eclectic... no classical but world, rock, electronic,
pop etc... The music selection is going to be a distinctive feature of
our place so people need to be able to hear it clearly, but also to be
able to talk to each other, so it will never be very very loud.

And lastly, we have a small budget, 1000 to 1500$ max.

I have been thinking about small speakers, but what kind exactly ?

I have looked at Behringer CE1000 or S1020, Yorkville Coliseum, at
Mackies  also but the srm450 are too expensive.... Would 4 of such
speakers be enough or should I go for 6 or 8 smaller speakers ?

Those are far too large for your needs. They'll have the ability to deafen your
customers.

What you need is more smaller speakers. JBL's Control One is entirely adequate to
the task of background music and is small and unobtrusive. You can pick them up
really cheap sometimes too.

I didn't really get the location.

The Tannoy suggestion looks good. If
it were me, I would whip up my own speakers. The Behringer suggestion
may be a good one. I also look for bargains from MCM company. Stay
away from piezo units. I would want something like 5 small pairs for the place,
in stereo. Usable speakers are scarce below $100 ea. Position the units toward
the floor if mounted high near a ceiling. MCM also has subwoofer kits, and parts.
One 12 inch sub should provide moderate levela of bass. With the MCM kits,
you can do it for $500. Its not common to get or hear stereo. You need speakers within 10 to 15 feet
from the peoples ears to perceive stereo, but I like it. Thats what I would do.
Mono might be better for very high SPL levels.

Wiring, amplifiers... part two.

Bare concrete blocks are good for sound. With thick coats of paint they become
just smooth hard walls. Muraled sound absorbors can be placed in problem
areas. If you paint bare concrete block, spray it, don't roller it.

Bands?? That will be another system.

play the radio instead &lt;g&gt; here's why:

http://www.ascap.com/licensing/generalfaq.html

An amendment to the Copyright Act, designed to clarify and expand the scope
of the exemption for certain performances of music in food service, drinking
and retail establishments by means of radio and television transmissions,
became effective on January 26, 1999. (Public Law No. 105-298, which amended
17 U.S.C. 110(5).)

The amendment law applies only to performances by means of
radio-over-speakers or televisions, only if no direct charge is made to see
or hear the performances, only if the performances are not further
transmitted beyond the establishment where they are received, and only if
the original transmission is licensed by the copyright owners -- that is,
the radio or television station, cable system or satellite carrier is
licensed by the copyright owners or their performing rights organizations.

The scope of the exemption in the old law had been unclear, and led to much
litigation. The new law contains objective standards which will enable both
music users and copyright owners to determine whether particular
radio-over-speaker and television performances are exempt from copyright
liability. Two types of music users are exempt, under different standards: a
food service or drinking establishment(defined as &quot;a restaurant, inn, bar,
tavern, or any other similar place of business in which the public or
patrons assemble for the primary purpose of being served food or drink, in
which the majority of the gross square feet of space that is nonresidential
is used for that purpose, and in which nondramatic musical works are
performed publicly&quot;) and an other establishment (defined as &quot;a store, shop,
or any similar place of business open to the general public for the primary
purpose of selling goods or services in which the majority of the gross
square feet of space that is nonresidential is used for that purpose, and in
which nondramatic musical works are performed publicly&quot;).

A food service or drinking establishment is eligible for the exemption if it
(1) has less than 3750 gross square feet of space (in measuring the space,
the amount of space used for customer parking only is always excludable); or
(2) has 3750 gross square feet of space or more and (a) uses no more than 6
loudspeakers of which not more than 4 loudspeakers are located in any 1 room
or adjoining outdoor space; and (b) if television sets are used, there are
no more than 4 televisions, of which not more than 1 is located in any 1
room and none has a diagonal screen size greater than 55 inches.

An other establishment is eligible for the exemption if it (1) has less than
2000 gross square feet of space; or (2) has 2000 or more gross square feet
of space and satisfies the same loudspeaker and television set requirements
as for food service or drinking establishments.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I need some advice in choosing and placing speakers in our bar. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; room is about 55'x16' (18m x 5m). Walls are concrete blocks and there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a suspended ceiling. We will just be playing CDs, no live bands
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks !
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beru

&gt;&gt;&gt;I would use lots of smallish speakers, broken up into &quot;zones for
&gt;&gt;&gt;individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;control of volume
&gt;&gt;&gt;many smaller speakers  will give more even coverage and add a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;sub
&gt;&gt;&gt;woffers and the sound can be quite impressive
&gt;&gt;&gt;check the EAW line up

&gt;&gt; They have one of the only multidirectional speakers out there. I heard
&gt;&gt; one at
&gt;&gt; a ball game. I was impressed with the sound. This was a fill in speaker.
&gt;&gt; Model UM42.
&gt;&gt; They certainly make a good selection of speakers if one can afford them.
&gt;&gt; Many places don't want to spend a lot of money. The budget was also
&gt;&gt; not mentioned.

&gt;&gt; greg

&gt; Greg, remember you are talking to King George who demands that you
&gt; sacrifice everything important to buy the best equipment.  It doesn't
&gt; matter if you don't have the funds available and go bankrupt to get the
&gt; best. To him, sound reinforcement is a god to sacrifice to.  Sound
&gt; reinforcement is a master to be served instead of a tool to serve.  Sound
&gt; reinforcement is God and he is the high priest.

&gt; His idea about small speakers spread around the bar is a good idea given
&gt; the concrete block walls.  Given that this is probably a startup business
&gt; (the impression I get) and money has to be spent in many areas, EAW is
&gt; probably an extravagant choice.  Behringer is probably a better choice to
&gt; get started or shop around the pawn shops for some better brands at low
&gt; prices.

&gt; I have been thinking about small speakers, but what kind exactly ?

&gt; I have looked at Behringer CE1000 or S1020, Yorkville Coliseum, at
&gt; Mackies  also but the srm450 are too expensive.... Would 4 of such
&gt; speakers be enough or should I go for 6 or 8 smaller speakers ?

&gt; Thanks !
&gt; Beru

unless this is a very low level &quot;background&quot; music application
I would get something more resilient than the behringers
the behringers are good as small speakers for small speaker jobs
like monitoring in a recording or background music
if you opening a club the behringers/yorkvilles/yamaha's/jbl/peaveys will be
on the curb within a month
cry 4 times or cry once
its your choice

&gt; &gt; Those are far too large for your needs. They'll have the ability to deafen your
&gt; &gt; customers.

&gt; &gt; What you need is more smaller speakers. JBL's Control One is entirely adequate to
&gt; &gt; the task of background music and is small and unobtrusive. You can pick them up
&gt; &gt; really cheap sometimes too. http://www.richersounds.com/showproduct.php?cda=showproduct&amp;pid;=JBL-C ...

&gt; Thanks, but aren't those going to lack bass  with such small woofers ?
&gt; would I need a sub, then ?
">

No.

Low bass will simply annoy your patrons. It will interfere with their conversation. They're there
primarily to socialise, not to listen to music I assume.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Equivalent to $49.95 each.

&gt; At that price I could buy 8 I guess.

&gt; Can you recommend amplifiers that would go well with those ?
">

Don't use lots of watts, again you'll just annoy the customers. You probably only need a couple of watts
per speaker for a comfortable level. I *hate* having to shout above the background music. It's a
conversation killer and will cause ppl to leave.

If you're using the standard 8 ohm speakers, you'll want the lowest power amp you can find most likely
that'll drive 2 ohms ( 4 speakers per channel) .

Whilst it has *far* more power than you need, the QSC RMX850 will do the job and is cheap. $320 here.
http://cgi.ebay.com/NEW-QSC-RMX-850-amp-amplifier-RMX850-FREE-SHIPPIN...

That'll be around $750 for your speakers and an amp which should fit your budget nicely.

Hi Beru,

As you said in one of your posts that music quality is important for
your venture you'll find that 1000-1500 USD for a whole system is
going to be really cutting it fine. Ideally you'd need a couple of
times that budget to bring in really high quality sound.  However, one
has to deal with the budget one's got.  You can always extend or
upgrade the system later when funds permit.

Do your dimensions for the bar you gave include the bar service area
or is it just the patron area?  How heigh are the ceilings?

First things first, Check to see what if any noise restrictions are
placed on the proposed bar, your local council (municiple authority)
should know.

Secondly, as Tim Perry pointed out in his post, you'll be limted to 4
speakers if you don't want to run the chance of having to face the
RIAA in court and cough up copyright royaltes.  Given the mood of the
RIAA of late and their litigation happy band of laywers I'd really
recommend keeping it down to 4 speaker cabs in total.

How much volume level do you really need?  Food for thought time! A
quiet restaraunt is around 50 dB SPL and a noisy factory is around 90
dB SPL which happens to a noise limit imposed in a lot of Australian
bars and clubs for live music these days.  110-120 dB SPL is the range
for most rock concerts. So In reality you'll probably find you won't
need to push it much over 100 dB SPL in your bar at any time.  If you
do then it's nice to have some headroom in your speaker system.

In real terms you'll probably seldom need to go over 90-95 dB SPL on
reasonably busy nights, that is assuming around 100 patrons at a time.

Unlike the others I'm not going to give you a list of specific speaker
models to go look at, as it's impossible to recommend speakers for a
room without hearing the room accoustics etc.  However there are a few
general concepts that will help you in finding a suitable set at the
right price.

I'd suggest looking at something with a 8-12&quot; driver and horn. I'd
suggest they be wired as 2 stereo pairs. Since each speaker will be
covering an area of around 4.5 x 5m (14.7 feet by 16.5 feet) you won't
need very high powered cabinets, something in the range of 100-150
Wrms should do the trick nicely depending on the effeceincy of the
speaker cabinet.

I'd really suggest talking with your local audio suppliers and see if
you can borrow a couple of speaker cabs to try out in the bar to see
how they sound in situ.

In a pinch you can use foldback wedges for this type of application,
though it's not a preferred method it does work and with careful
placement it can work quite well.

For a CD player, you'd probably be best off with a 5 platter type CD
player or a CD player jukebox such as a Pioneer.

Use a cheapo Behringer UB series mixer as a preamp (A UB802 would be
ideal with a single CD jukebox type player) as this will give you
basic tone shaping and the necessary signal gain to drive a power
amplier.

Power amp wise, I'd be checking the local pawn brokers, band rehearsal
rooms etc for a used Behringer, Biema or QSC amplifier.  Something
around 250-300 Wrms per channel should be fine.

One last area that needs to be addressed is speaker mounting brackets.
You'll need heavy duty brackets, don't skimp here as all you need is a
drunk patron to play at being Tarzan or a bracket to fail with the
result being an injured patron to discover the joys (read pain) of
lawsuits.

Cheers,
Ian

Swearing now, oh my.  A few facts time.  Cd players (domestic) put out
anywhere from 400mV to 1V rms at the output (I've measured a few
dozen) while professional grade units are invariable 1V rms output
mostly. Professional amplifiers require up to 2.75V rms to drive.
Secondly a pre-amp doesn't have to provide gain though I'd rather have
3-6dbV gain for a CD player.  The main reason however is for the basic
3 way tone control the UB802 has, otherwise you are entirely stuck
wthout anyway of frequency response adjustment using a direct CD to
power-amp and considerably reduced finesse in volume level adjustment.

You're the one who's clueless.  Having done a few thousand shows and

It it was actually that loud in a bar, employers would have to provide ear

All mains powered CD players have near identical output levels (or should do -

Very few do. How about you name a few ? Most are happilly driven to full power

Canada is a signatory to the Berne Convention on Copyright 1971 (and
amendments) which means that sooner or later it can and will be
applied if the local version of the RIAA nazi's decide to go after a
cheap source of revinue.  Which given the dramatic decrease globally
in turnover for the record companies won't take long.

An average level of 120dB would leave your ears ringing and hearing sensitivity
seriously depressed (temporary threshold shift) after only a couple of minutes.

An 'average' 120dB (as measured by most SPL meters) would imply peaks in the
130dB region.

I did a briefcase gig last week in a small club where the limit was 108
at the desk. 108db seemed less than loud at the mix position,  but up
front by the stacks it was shatteringly loud to me, those 'ugly bags of
water' sure do soak it up.

I may have incorrectly &quot;assumed&quot; they would have a dj spinning tunes
if its simply a cd feed, not being &quot;mixed by a dj&quot; a less durable speaker
may work out
if they are going to have a dj them you need(NEED) some really well built
durable speakers

but what I am reading this sounds more like a lounge than a club
so pretty much any small speaker and sub will give them basic sound
