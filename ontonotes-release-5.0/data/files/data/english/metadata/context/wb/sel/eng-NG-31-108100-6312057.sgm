The optimists (taken at a conservative gathering).

"72% of Americans feel good about what 2007 will bring for the country,
and an even larger 89% are optimistic about the new year for themselves
and their families, according to the poll. That fits with a long-term
trend suggesting that Americans are generally an optimistic lot. Polling
over recent decades is replete with optimism, and with a tendency for
people to feel more positively about their own situations than that of
the country overall."

The pessimists (taken at a liberal gathering).

"60% think the US will be the victim of another terrorist attack this
year, more than five years after the Sep 11 assault on New York and
Washington. An identical percentage think it is likely that bad guys
will unleash a biological or nuclear weapon elsewhere in the world.
There is plenty of gloom to accompany all of that doom. 70% of Americans
predict another major natural disaster within the United States and an
equal percentage expect worsening global warming. Fewer than one-third
of people, or 29%, think it is likely that the US will withdraw its
troops from Iraq."

The pessimists meet in a sealed bomb shelter and campfire smoke might be
a problem.

Oh yeah!  No smokers allowed.  Pessimists are mostly of the politically
correct persuasion.

This is pessimestic?  Pulling them out soon will only lead to a total waste

either retake Iraq or become a total Muslim nation.  Say goodbye to your
