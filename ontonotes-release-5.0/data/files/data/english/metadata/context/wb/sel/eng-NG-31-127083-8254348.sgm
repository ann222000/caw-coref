Things didn't go my way yesterday.   There were a thousand things I
should (there's that word) have done, but didn't do.   The weather
wouldn't cooperate for fishing and boating.  I didn't get nearly as
much completed on the yard work as I needed to.   But.....I didn't
smoke.  It was a beautiful day.

This morning I woke up feeling fresh.  Made some toast and treated
myself to some coffee (first in a week so as to not trigger cravings)
and enjoyed sitting on the deck watching the boats go by and the
waterfowl feeding on the sand crabs near the waterline.  I didn't
need to think about smoking.   It's another beautiful day.

Each and every day free of nicotine is a reason for celebration!!!
Had I been able to remember this wonderful feeling while lost in my
addictive relapse, I wouldn't have waited so long to get back!!!

The nicotine stains are almost all gone from my fingers now.  My
teeth are looking a little brighter.  My mouth tastes soooo much
better.   And....I'M FEELIN GOOD !!!!! (move over Michael Buble).

On my way to church now to sing with the choir and enjoy the
increased air supply that is slowly rebuilding.

Thanks for sharing Wayne, you making quitting sound so good
I am almost sorry I hibernated in my first few weeks. Keep up
the good spirit. What do you fish for?

Great post Wayne!

Now, by the sounds of it, some of that quit money needs to go towards
a new camera!

Enjoy singing today!

Cheers!

Congratulations on FWD, Wayne!  You sound very grounded and focused
with your quit and that really helps keep it real.  To help you
celebrate after Church, the Yodeling Gnomes will be at your place to
sing songs of smobriety with you to help you celebrate this
milestone.  But do keep them away from the water, they get *wicked*
when they get wet...&lt;G&gt;

Just make sure you don't puff to have the joys of quitting all over
again *haha*.   Generally I fish for anything in the water that
bites, but my usual goals are Rock Fish (Stripers), Flounder, and Sea
Trout (in that order).   All others either get tossed back, used as
cut bait, or put in the crab pots at the end of our pier.

Thank you.  My take on being positive is similar to the concept that
a craving to smoke will pass whether or not you smoke, so you might
as well not smoke.   The cravings will pass whether or not I bitch
about them, so I might as well not and try to stay focused on what
makes me feel good :-)

Hehe, I couldn't go through quitting again Wayne and I don't think
I will ever forget that and light up again. Sea fishing? I'd love that.
Just googled pics of stripers and they can be HUGE!!! Looks like
good fishing to me. For me it's mostly pike and walleye when the
season is open, but we didn't fish yet this year. *sigh. I think I need
to make a phone call. &lt;grin&gt;

Nice one Wayne!! I like your attitude fella. I wonder sometimes now why
I smoked at all...smoke free is so much better. The thing you need to do
now is keep reading and posting...all a big family here including the
fall outs. The trials and tribulations of life are so much easier to
handle once you have broken this horrible addiction. Keep on keeping on.
