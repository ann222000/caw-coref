Sun Bin, grandnephew of the &quot;Father of Modern China,&quot; Sun Yat-Sen,
reveals that a death threat against him by the CCP motivated his
announcement to firmly encourage Chinese to withdraw from the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP).

Last week, the Chinese edition of The Epoch Times had a three-day series
of exclusive reports about an alias &quot;Axiang&quot; who disclosed the recent
activities of the CCP Central Liaison Office in Hong Kong (the Liaison
Office). According to Axiang, the Liaison Office has interviewed him to
discover if Sun Bin is participating in the &quot;withdraw from the CCP
movement&quot; and indicated their intention to treat Sun the same way they
treated Albert Ho.

The Liaison Office hinted that last year's gang attack on Ho, the
Democratic Party Chairman and also Member of the Legislative Council of
Hong Kong, was because Ho protested the live organ removal of Falun Gong
Practitioners by the CCP and supported the Human Rights movement in China.

Sun Bin indicated that the very next day after the Epoch Times report,
he received three unidentified phone calls. The first one claimed to be
a Mr. Zhu from Shenzhen, whereas the other two refused to identify
themselves. All three of them conducted a similar conversation and
inquired about who &quot;Axiang&quot; is.

Sun says, &quot;I would like to thank Axiang. If it weren't for him, I might
have been killed without knowing who ordered it.&quot;

Sun believes that the CCP's suppression of the movement is an indication
of the fear and final struggle of the party prior to its disintegration.

He mentions that he's further aware of the evil nature of the CCP. In
particular, the CCP voluntarily disclosed that they perpetrated Albert
Ho's beating. He could not believe that the CCP would have treated a
member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council in such a despicable manner.
The cruelty is shocking.

Sun Bin encourages more people like &quot;Axiang&quot; to come out to expose how
the CCP has infiltrated and threatened Hong Kong. Only through exposure
will Hong Kong be protected.
