New 93:So how is it?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<POSTER> stagman </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2005-06-21T16:11:00 </POSTDATE>
Just wondering - now that the new 93 has been out for a couple of years, how
do owners feel about it?
I havn't been on this site since I sold my '94 900S in '03 and I'm curious
as to how well it has been received.
Is it better than the previous generation re: reliability, performance, cost
of ownership, etc.
What to the magazines say about it?

Thanks,

Tony

I have a 2004 9-3 Aero.  Overall I like the car a lot.  The only problem
is the passenger seat belt warning going on on hot days.  Hopefully
there will be a TB for this and a new sensor design.

There is a huge difference between the new 9-3 and the old 9-3.  In fact, I
don't think nary a single part was carried over from the old 9-3.

The reliability/quality leave much to be desired.  I had a number of initial
quality "bugs" all of which were quickly resolved by the dealer.  However,
as Dan mentioned, the passenger seatbelt warning indicator does come on in
hot weather.  My guess is they used a heat sensor and not a pressure sensor
in the seat.  This is fairly minor.

One other unfortunate quirk is the number of squeaks, rattles and buzzes in
the interior.  This is one thing engineering should have paid more attention
to, as it does distract somewhat from the overall experience.  Afaik, they
have not addressed this as yet (as of 2005 model).  Having owned Saabs in
the past, this is one thing that unfortunately has carried over. (although I
did notice the 9-5's have utterly silent interiors, aside from a noisy 6).
There are a number of owner web sites that detail how to fix these noise
issues on your own.  The dealer actually did fix at least one squeak for me
(the ACC fascia was squeaking like hell from day one).

The performance is incredible (having had the opportunity to really thrash
one around (not my own) I gained an immense appreciation for the car's
features and performance).  The cost of ownership, if new, is 0, given the
warranty/scheduled maintenance.

If you hold tight, the 2006 9-3 lineup (due in Sept) will add the sportwagon
(Combi) plus a new 250hp v6 (holden/gm global v6) engine option for all
9-3s.  Saab claims 0-60 mph acceleration of 6.9 seconds, with the V6.

If you're looking for the 6-speed manual gearbox, wait for the 2006s, as you
won't find a single 2005 with one (supply issues).

After some detective work on my aero, I discovered it was both the metallic
door trim and electric window control buttons that were rattling and
buzzing.  Low frequency vibrations seem abundant on the door (due to normal
engine operation and the audio speakers). As the warm weather has slowly
settled in, I figured the noises would get better, but the contrary has been
the case, even more have cropped up.

These buzzes/rattles have been frequently discussed at saabcentral.com.
Here is one guy's page I found detailing how to fix a good number of them:

While I haven't tried these fixes as yet, I may if I have time this weekend.

You know until I read this thread I assumed Saabs didn't rattle and squeak.

My '93 9k has a squeaky clutch action but I guess I need to grease something.

The noise of the brake light relay is mildy irritating when in town traffic

Went well.  Only had time to do two doors this weekend (i want to do the
rear doors next weekend).  I added another pic to the instructions to make
it more obvious.  I had misunderstoood the directions (for panel removal) on
the first door and ended up breaking the two plastic parts holding in the
door pulls (no biggie as the door handle still holds sturdy, at least for
now).

In any event, the door pull handle actually pops off fairly easily (at least
easier than what was described as a "bang").  I just used a small
screwdriver to gently unsnap the plastic.  Once off, just unscrew the torx
screws hidden deep within the sockets.

I'm still evaluating the actual effect on the door rattles, but sofar so
good.

see:

http://tools.longbowcg.com/saab9-3ss/buzzfix

I also added a pic of the foam i used.  I used a ridged urethane foam (1/2"
to 3/4" thick).  Makes for a snug fit when refitting the panel.
