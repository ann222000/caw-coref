Please keep on praying guys...it's looking so dire for that little girl.
Here's the latest from Tammy's mom.
:
Linda

Good morning to all.  The latest on Tammy is she is still in labor &amp;
delivery.  We are going on three days now and not with much hope.  Tammy has
been in alot of pain with all the mag that they are giving her and at such a
high dose.  She is not been able to eat or drink and keep it down.  We will
be talking with her doctor today to see if there is an alternative medicine
that she can take to stop the contractions.  Texas Children's Hospital  ICU
staff is there and is on alert for her delivery.  The doctor from TCH ICU
spoke with us and did not paint a pretty picture.  The chances are very
slim, but will give it their best shot. I feel that the doctor will say
today to take out the stitches of the cervex and let nature take is course.
Tam then has 2 choices, either a C section or natural birth.  She only has
this choice for the next 24 hrs, as the doctor then says she has to make the
choice for her, which will be a C section.  She said either delivery, the
baby has less than a 50% chance of making it.  Please keep her in you
prayers and hope they can come up with a different solution to stop the
contractions and give the baby a few more weeks. It is so tough when they
had the heart monitor on the baby and was doing a sonogram and watching the
baby move and them telling you she most likely will not make it.  Even the
doctor was wiping away tears.  Please pray!

love to all
sharon

It's the "less than 50%" that is very worrisome.  You are right, an
artificial womb would be such a good thing....I haven't heard from Sharon
today.  She and her husband are supposed to come for dinner tomorrow
night...I hope that will still be possible.  I left her a voicemail this
afternoon but haven't heard back.  I'm hoping "no news is good news", every
day that baby stays put is a little closer to living.

&gt; I wish science would finally come up with an artificial womb so tiny
&gt; babies like her can have another chance when the mom isn't able to
&gt; keep her.  Still, 50% isn't anything to be negative about.

You certainly have Scott, and it's a great thing to keep in mind.  Sharon
called me last night and said that they were afraid Tammy was getting an
infection and that they were getting ready to take the baby.  They had taken
Tammy off the magnesium to stop the contractions and were taking her into
delivery to remove the stitches from her cervix.  Sharon said they then
planned on giving her an epidural..they were going to try for a natural
childbirth.  Texas Children's ICU said that they had saved children from 23
weeks.  This child is 23 weeks, 4 days.  This is so heartwrenching, please
keep them in your prayers.  I haven't heard anything today, and don't want
to intrude.  If I haven't heard anything by tomorrow, I will call.

Sharon's latest e-mail:

I'm sure some of you have heard by now that Tammy had the baby at 2:17am
this morning.  I was there to help &amp; view the delivery.  I got to see my
beautiful little girl be born.  She had a short battle however.  Tx
Childrens Hospital ICU team took her immediately to put her on life support,
however their smallest tube would not fit her tiny throat and lungs, life
support was no longer an issue.  They wrapped her up and gave her to me,
which I talked, kissed, loved and gave her Gods blessing until her last
breath.  Oh to have her just those few minutes was priceless, even though I
knew all odds were againt her.  The doctor pronounded her in peace at 3:16
am..  I just thank God that Tammy was ok, as she had an infection starting
in her body, which was life threatening.  There was no other way out and I
thank God that I was choosen to witness the birth as Ray, Fred, Jason &amp; Rita
has just left 30 minutes prior.  They had been their for many, many hours.
The doctor assured them nothing was going to take place until tomorrow.  I
made a couple of phone calls for them all to return and they did, only
regreating that they every left. Ray named our little angel, Megan Michelle
Samour.

Thanks again for the many prayers and love
love to all

&gt;&gt; | high dose.  She is not been able to eat or drink and keep it down.  We
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; | be talking with her doctor today to see if there is an alternative
&gt;&gt; medicine
&gt;&gt; | that she can take to stop the contractions.  Texas Children's Hospital
&gt;&gt; ICU
&gt;&gt; | staff is there and is on alert for her delivery.  The doctor from TCH
&gt;&gt; ICU
&gt;&gt; | spoke with us and did not paint a pretty picture.  The chances are very
&gt;&gt; | slim, but will give it their best shot. I feel that the doctor will say
&gt;&gt; | today to take out the stitches of the cervex and let nature take is
&gt;&gt; course.
&gt;&gt; | Tam then has 2 choices, either a C section or natural birth.  She only
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; | this choice for the next 24 hrs, as the doctor then says she has to
&gt;&gt; make
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; | choice for her, which will be a C section.  She said either delivery,
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; | baby has less than a 50% chance of making it.  Please keep her in you
&gt;&gt; | prayers and hope they can come up with a different solution to stop the
&gt;&gt; | contractions and give the baby a few more weeks. It is so tough when
&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt; | had the heart monitor on the baby and was doing a sonogram and watching
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; | baby move and them telling you she most likely will not make it.  Even
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; | doctor was wiping away tears.  Please pray!
&gt;&gt; |
&gt;&gt; | love to all

There are no words to deal with such a sad passing of a young life.
You had a precious moment with her that can never be erased
from your mind.

&gt; I'm sure some of you have heard by now that Tammy had the baby at 2:17am
&gt; this morning.  I was there to help &amp; view the delivery.  I got to see my
&gt; beautiful little girl be born.  She had a short battle however.  Tx
&gt; Childrens Hospital ICU team took her immediately to put her on life
&gt; support, however their smallest tube would not fit her tiny throat and
&gt; lungs, life support was no longer an issue.  They wrapped her up and gave
&gt; her to me, which I talked, kissed, loved and gave her Gods blessing until
&gt; her last breath.  Oh to have her just those few minutes was priceless,
&gt; even though I knew all odds were againt her.  The doctor pronounded her in
&gt; peace at 3:16 am..  I just thank God that Tammy was ok, as she had an
&gt; infection starting in her body, which was life threatening.  There was no
&gt; other way out and I thank God that I was choosen to witness the birth as
&gt; Ray, Fred, Jason &amp; Rita has just left 30 minutes prior.  They had been
&gt; their for many, many hours. The doctor assured them nothing was going to

I know that baby's grandmother took such a joy in holding that baby in her
arms until God took her into His.  At first I was so worried that Sharon
would have to go through such pain being with Tammy in the delivery
room...but it seems that God had different plans and His grace, as always,
is best.

&gt; You certainly have Scott, and it's a great thing to keep in mind.  Sharon
&gt; called me last night and said that they were afraid Tammy was getting an
&gt; infection and that they were getting ready to take the baby.  They had
&gt; taken Tammy off the magnesium to stop the contractions and were taking her
&gt; into delivery to remove the stitches from her cervix.  Sharon said they
&gt; then planned on giving her an epidural..they were going to try for a
&gt; natural childbirth.  Texas Children's ICU said that they had saved
&gt; children from 23 weeks.  This child is 23 weeks, 4 days.  This is so
&gt; heartwrenching, please keep them in your prayers.  I haven't heard
&gt; anything today, and don't want to intrude.  If I haven't heard anything by

Linda:

Some hope for you all.

My first brother-in-law, Mark, was born at 22 weeks in 1968. He was one of
the first babies to utilise the Royal Melbourne Mothers Hospital's ICU and
humidicribs.

Mark may have crap eyesight, and be only 5'3" tall as a result of being born
so early... he may be prone to lung infections at the drop of a hat, but
he's still here. He's a lovely young man who went through some amazing
journey's during his gestation and after his birth. Staying in the hospital
until he was at the age when he should have been born, if his gestation had
have proceeded normally. He was always a very slight baby and child, but so
tenacious.

That's one story,

another is that one of my old friends was in a very similar situation with
her twins, one died and the other was born at 26 weeks gestation, again,
after a very traumatic period. Matty is now 22 years old and a father
himself.

Odds CAN be beaten and I continue to pray that Tammy and her baby will do
so.

Tamara

Oh Linda.... I'm so terribly sorry for each and every one of you.

My heart aches for all of you.
My soul hopes that Tammy and her husband recover from this grief with their
love for each other intact.

I will pray that both babies deaths meant something and were for a reason.

My love to all of you.
