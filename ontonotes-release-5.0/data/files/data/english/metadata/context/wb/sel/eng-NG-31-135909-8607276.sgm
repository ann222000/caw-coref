Netgear router won't configure with mac

I just bought a Netgear DG834G router , whilst I can configure it via
its web interface from an XP machine, it rejects the password when I try
to log on to the web interface from a Mac.  I've tried 3 different macs
(all 10.4.8) with Safari and Firefox on each.  Each time I enter tha
user name and password it comes back asking for the user name and password.

Anybody had this problem or know a solution?

2 hrs on the phone with Netgear elicited a promise of 'escalation' and a
callback, but my hopes aren't high.

I used to use a DG834 (until I got cable). I had the same problem
intermittently when I used Safari, but it worked reliably with Firefox.

It is possible that it has the same problem with recent versions of
Firefox, as I would have been using an older version at the time. I also
had no problem with Internet Explorer, so you might like to try an older
or different browser.

I have owned several Netgear routers (currently the WPN824), and have
never had that problem.

I own my second Netgear router and it works fine with the Mac.

It is sometimes not easy to configure the firewalls on Mac and router,
if you do it the first time. In that case, just switch the Mac firewall
to OFF. If you have Little Snitch on your Mac, switch that OFF too.
You may find out, that configuration is much easier, if you check
apple´s firewall settings and use them in the Netgear settings.

When that works, you may switch both back to ON and do the fine tuning.

I really don't see any need to enable the Mac's built-in firewall if
you're behind a router with its own firewall.

I do, however, see value in running Little Snitch behind a router
firewall, because Little Snitch notifies you of *outgoing* connection
attempts that you wouldn't see with just the router firewall.

You are right. It may remain switched off, if everything runs fine.
I did not see a problem so far. I have it enabled, because of my
powerbooks. If i go to a different location, it is switched on.

Right - it is amazing, how much traffic goes outside....

Yep I definitely would enable the built-in firewall on portables that
may end up on a network without a firewall. ; )
