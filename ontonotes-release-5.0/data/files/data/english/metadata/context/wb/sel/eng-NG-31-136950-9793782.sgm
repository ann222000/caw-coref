This is actually something I was going to ask the group to..Ive been losing
hearing in my right ear and there is alot of noise in it so ive been looking
into candles..anyway...this is a good site that is pro-candles
http://www.coningcompany.com/faq.html ..there are lots of sites against
it...no really good reasons not to except that there are not clinical tests,
studies, scientific blah blah blah.- so it must be bad for you..you know?
My little sister did it and she said that she was happy with how it
worked...she did it to relieve pressure in her ears when they did not
pop when her flight landed.

The candle creates a low-level vacuum and smoke (usually herbal or essential
oil) that pulls debris and wax out of the ear. Since the ear drum is only
skin and a semi-permeable membrane it can also pull out toxins from the
sinuses, eustacian tubes and tear ducts. People use them for sinus
issues/headaches/infections, allergies, cranial plate allignment, improved
hearing, vision improvement, detoxing the lymph system, and some say
they pull out negative energy and past traumas.
Most harm cases are from people not performing the candleing properly, they
burn themselves or set rooms on fire, But some say that their ears drums
have been perforated by it, wax dripped in and blocked ears, or the smoke
just burned everything inside. They are illegal in Canada.

Rebecca,

I don't think ear candling is illegal here in Canada.  I know a woman
who does reflexology and a whole host of other things which includes
ear candling.  As I think about it, she also teaches ear candling - I
have a friend who is thinking of taking the course.

I have never been, but I know people who have and thought it was very
helpful.  Though to remove wax build up Dr. Christopher teaches garlic
oil and ear and nerve formula with a gentle water (I think) flush on
the 7th day.

Hi Everyone,
Rebecca that was a great coverage on ear candling! Very thorough!
Dr. Christophers does sell ear candles. I use them and do them for
customers that ask. After I candle I use the garlic oil drops.

Thanks Rebecca!  I had no idea, given the number of people here (here
being Canada) that seem to use and/or do ear candling.  Not that I
take much comfort in a study by Doctors and ear specialists on whether
or not something natural will work...  Next time I see the right
people, I'll have to inquire as to how they get around this.
