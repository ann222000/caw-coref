SCIENCE FOR SALE: THE GLOBAL WARMING SCAM

Alaska is melting, at least according to the New York Times. Forests are
dying, thawing permafrost is causing pavements to buckle, and Native
American villages are crumbling. Times reporter Timothy Egan broke this
sensational story in the June 16 Sunday edition, complete with color
pictures of the buckling highways and eroding shorelines. The cause of
all these problems, according to Egan, is a seven-degree-Fahrenheit rise
in the average temperature in Alaska over the past 30 years. He
attributed the higher temperatures to global warming or Mother Nature's
"prolonged mood swing," implying that it might be reversible. But he
quoted scientists at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks saying the
changes were due to "indisputable climate warming."

Editorially, the Times didn't equivocate. It declared that Alaska is now
experiencing the long-anticipated effects of global warming. Columnist
Bob Herbert, its chief doomsayer, used the Alaska report to excoriate
the Bush administration for its lack of "urgency" on global warming. The
Times is miffed that the President "unsigned" the Kyoto Treaty and
prefers voluntary measures to reduce the putative cause of the
warming-greenhouse gas emissions.

On July 8, a Times editorial praised California's legislature for
passing a law that will require automakers to cut emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2). The editorial declared this was "unquestionably the most
important step" in curbing greenhouse gas emissions since Bill Clinton
signed the Kyoto Treaty in 1997. It cited warnings by "mainstream
scientists" that climatic, environmental, and economic catastrophes will
result if global warming goes unchecked. Citing Egan's June 16 article,
it said, the "astonishing seven degree increase" in temperatures in
Alaska shows "what we all have to look forward toâ€¦unless the Bush
administration follows California's example."

The Times Got It Wrong

But what used to be regarded as the paper of record got the Alaska
warming story wrong. Alaska's average temperature did not rise by seven
degrees over the past 30 years. The Times ran a correction saying that
it was 5. 4 degrees Fahrenheit, citing a study by the Center for Global
Change and Arctic System Research at the University of Alaska at
Fairbanks (UA/Fairbanks). But the Center's, and the Times', number was
still too high, according to Prof. Gerd Wendler at the Alaska Climate
Research Center.

Prof. Wendler says it is still "too great by a factor of two for the
1971 to 2000 period." He bases this on National Climate Data Center
information, gathered from four "first class weather stations"
professionally serviced by the National Weather Service. His
calculations have been replicated and verified independently. Professor
Wendler asked the Times for a correction on June 18, but it has failed
to run one or explain why it was sticking to the contested number.

On the Internet, Tech Central Station attributed the warming trend to a
spike in temperatures during the Great Pacific Climate Shift in
1976-1977, a pattern that has been repeated over the past 100 years.
Subtract those years, and there is no warming trend after 1977.
Professor (emeritus) Sue Ann Bowling, a climat-ologist with the
Atmospheric Sciences Faculty at UA/Fair-banks, confirmed to AIM that the
Pacific climate shift caused a "step change" in temperature trends
around 1976-1977.

Both Wendler and Bowling were mystified by the Times' num-bers. Wendler
speculated that his colleagues at the Center for Global Change may have
used an earlier time period or numbers from other stations. Other
scientists, speaking anonymously, think that the Center for Global
Change may have fudged the numbers to support its projections of future
change, which have temperature increases in Alaska doubling or even
tripling by 2100.

Wrong Numbers, Wrong Consequences

If the corrected numbers in the Times article are off by a factor of
two, does that mean that the Times' predictions of catastrophic
consequences are equally wrong? For the Times, along with environmental
activists, left-liberal politicians (and Senator John McCain) and those
"mainstream scientists" the Times likes to quote, it doesn't really
matter. When it comes to global warming, for this group "the debate is
over."

Likely presidential candidate Senator John Kerry, D-Mass., in his
opening statement at a recent congressional hearing, captured the mood
of this group by saying that it is now "time to shift the focus from the
science to the solution of climate change." By solution, Kerry means
mandatory reductions of CO2 emissions and other curbs on industry,
particularly automakers. Politicians like Senators Kerry, McCain and
Lieberman have all climbed on the global warming bandwagon, and one
source claims that twice as many climate change bills were introduced in
the 107th Congress as in the previous two sessions combined. State
officials, like California Governor Gray Davis and the Democratic
attorneys general of 10 other states are all impatient with Washington's
emphasis on voluntary controls. They want President Bush to support new
legislation to curb emissions.

Activists applaud these measures, but would prefer to launch a "new
industrial revolution" to fundamentally transform the way we "power the
global economy." This means "new fuels, new engines, new industrial
processes, and new ways to generate electricity" (but not nuclear
power). They urge Americans to "adjust to new realities" or go the way
of the dinosaurs. You can tell how serious the issue is getting when
trial lawyers start speculating about filing class-action lawsuits
seeking damages on behalf of individuals or even countries that claim
they have suffered from the effects of global warming.

A Failed Hypothesis

But the science on global warming, and its putative causes, is by no
means settled. The earth's atmosphere has both warmed and cooled over
the centuries without any human activity being responsible. Dr. S. Fred
Singer, president of the Science and Environmental Policy Project
(SEPP), points out that a study of CO2 and temperatures over the past
11,000 years that was analyzed in both Science and Nature in 1999 found
that the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere tends to follow, not precede,
a rise in temperature. Dr. Singer reminds us that "the bulk of the
temperature rise in the 20th century took place before 1940, while most
of the CO2 emissions took place after 1940 and coincided with a slight
climate cooling between 1940 and 1975." The satellite temperature
readings from 1979 through June 2002 have risen at the rate of only 0.1
degree Fahrenheit per decade or 1.0 degree per century.

The global warming advocates rely on projections of the earth's surface
temperatures derived from computer models to support their claims that
we are facing disaster if we don't take decisive action to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases. The increase projected for the 21st
century is 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit compared to an increase of 0.7E to
1.4EF in the 20th century. Advocates, like the authors of a recent
National Research Council report, claim that, "warming trends are most
clearly marked by surface temperature measurements-which have been
recorded daily at hundreds of locations for more than a century."
Critics don't dispute that some warming has occurred. They say the
surface temperature data are not a reliable measure of the increase,
citing the poor coverage of oceans and higher latitudes and the location
of many stations near urban areas, making the data susceptible to an
"urban heat island effect."

Satellite Data More Convincing

AIM has repeatedly pointed to the value of data collected by microwave
sounding units that fly on a constellation of National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites. These
TIROS-N satellites record temperature fluctuations in the lower
troposphere (up to about 5 miles) and the lower stratosphere (about 9-12
miles up), where the effects of greenhouse gases should be most
apparent. As the NRC report concluded, "if global warming is caused by
the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it should be evident
not only at the earth's surface, but also in the low-mid troposphere."

But it isn't. As noted above, satellite data show a 0.1EF increase per
decade since 1979, when the program was started-a dramatic difference
from the surface temperature trend. The satellite data correlate with
those collected by weather balloons using completely different sensors.
The coverage is global and extends over oceans and surface areas where
land-based systems are infrequent. Measurements are taken in atmospheric
layers above the effects of urban heat islands. The satellite sensors
are calibrated by NOAA's practice of putting new birds in orbit before
older satellites are retired. But global warming advocates generally
ignore satellite data. During the Clinton years, as reported in the
January-A 2000 AIM Report, Dr. D. James Baker, the Undersecretary of
Commerce who headed NOAA and "owned" the satellites, ignored these data
because they refuted the global warming hypothesis.

For global warming advocates, the chief culprit is greenhouse gas
emissions, and especially CO2, produced by burning fossil fuel. Deb
Callahan, President of the League of Conservation Voters, a
Washington-based political action group that funds "pro-environment"
candidates, says "carbon dioxide pollution" is to blame for all the
problems. Another advocacy group, Environmental Defense, labels carbon
dioxide "global warming pollution." This simply reflects the consensus
of global warming advocates who point to human activity, especially
fossil fuel burning, as (mostly) responsible for the warming trends.

To its credit, the Bush administration has tried to slow down the global

Al Gore inherited his money from a crook who was his father and probably
from kickbacks of the $10 billion that disappeared while he headed a
commission overseeing Russian investments.

EARLY IN the US presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore's attempt
to follow President Clinton into the White House was almost capsized by
allegations that he had turned a blind eye to corruption in Russia
despite frequent contact with that country's leaders.

The Vice President was vulnerable because between 1993 and 1998 he had
taken a leading role in formulating US policy towards Russia as chairman
of a joint commission on relations between the countries. The former
Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin was joint chairman.

Mr Gore had boosted the commission as evidence that he was a serious
international statesman and more than a decorative figure in the Clinton
White House. The claim blew up in his face last year when critics asked
why, if he knew so much about Russia, he only learnt from the newspapers
about the scandal over the laundering of $10bn in Russian money through
the Bank of New York.

Criticism of the Vice President over the Chernomyrdin-Gore commission
missed the real target, say sources in Moscow; he was telling the truth
when he said he knew a great deal about Russia. He could not publicly
explain, however, that his knowledge stemmed from the extraordinary
relationship between his father, Senator Al Gore Sr, and Armand Hammer,
the American multi-millionaire, who, after meeting Lenin, became the
Soviet Union's first foreign investor in 1921. Hammer also served,
according to secret Soviet documents since released, as the conduit for
laundering money to Soviet intelligence operations and Communist parties
abroad.

"The American press missed the point over the Gore-Chernomyrdin
scandal," a diplomat in Moscow said last week. "Gore had access to the
Soviet and then the Russian leadership long before he met Chernomyrdin
because of his father's links to Hammer and Hammer's high-level contacts
in the Soviet Union."

The Vice President is often presented as a wooden and somewhat simple-
minded clone of Mr Clinton. In fact his political background is far more
interesting and complex. His political career developed out of that of
his father, Senator Al Gore Sr of Tennessee, who gave up his position in
1971 to become head of the coal division of Hammer's oil company
Occidental Petroleum. His annual salary was $500,000.

The link between Hammer and Al Gore Sr was intimate and went back many
years to when he was a congressman from Tennessee. Hammer once said,
according to a US source, that he had Gore in his "back pocket".

As early as 1950, according to Edward Jay Epstein's superb biography of
Hammer (Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer, Random House, New
York, 1996) he made Congressman Gore his partner in a profitable cattle-
breeding business. Hammer needed political protection. J Edgar Hoover,
even before he became head of the FBI, had been tracking him as a
possible Soviet agent. For once Hoover was right, though that only
became clear in 1996 when the Russian government released secret
archives to Mr Epstein. In Congress Al Gore Sr helped to keep the FBI
off Hammer's back.

Hammer, who died in 1990, was notorious for advancing his business
interests by the systematic bribery of politicians and government officials.

He won an important oil concession for Occidental in Libya in 1967 by
paying a larger bribe than anybody else. Senator Gore Sr stood beside
him on the podium at the oilfield opening ceremony the following year.

Al Gore Jr, as freshman senator for Tennessee, inherited his father's
connection with Hammer and Occidental. In 1981, Hammer was his guest at
the inauguration of President Reagan, just as he had been the guest of
his father at five previous presidential inaugurations. The link with
Occidental was not broken by Hammer's death. As recently as 1996 the
Vice President, according to reports, played an important role in the
privatising of Elk Hills naval petroleum reserve in California, later
bought by Occidental for $3.5bn.

Unnoticed in the furore over the Vice President's association with
Occidental in the US was the degree to which he had also benefited from
Hammer's and Occidental's connections, before 1990, in Moscow. The two
potential scandals now threatening his presidential ambitions - his
relationship with Russian leaders and an over-close relationship with
Occidental - both originate in his family's involvement in the business
activities of Armand Hammer in the Soviet Union and the US.

Hammer left Moscow in 1929. The Soviet Union no longer needed him as a
showcase foreign capitalist - Lenin's motive for giving him the
concession to an asbestos mine in the Urals - or to secretly fund its
agents and sympathisers abroad. He had briefly owned a profitable pencil
factory, but ultimately lost money in the young Soviet Union.

His one remaining concession was to act as agent for selling art
treasures now owned by the Soviet state. Even that was not quite what it
seemed. His first attempted sale was of a supposedly lost Rembrandt
painting called The Circumcision of Christ, which turned out to be a
recent fake.
*******************
So you are welcome to admire Al Gore for his inherited and swindled
money.  Personally, I'd rather have more modest means and a reputation
for integrity.

It's a Joke, Right!

Andrew Bolt

March 02, 2007 12:00am

ANY day now, global warming will change from the world's biggest scare
to the world's biggest joke.
In fact, that moment could have come already. Last Monday, to be
exact.

That's when we saw a beaming Al Gore waddle on stage to the roar of
Hollywood's dream-makers to get his Oscar for An Inconvenient Truth.

It should have been for the former US vice president -- now the
world's most famous global warming alarmist -- his finest hour.

Here he was, receiving film's highest honour for his smash
documentary, in which he warns that within a century the seas will
rise up to 6m while monster hurricanes tear through what's left of our
cities.

Never mind that scientists reject such wild claims. Gore was getting
the endorsement that counts -- an ovation from the diamond elite of
showbiz and the media -- for preaching that only one thing could save
us from the apocalypse he imagines.

Use. Less. Dirty. Power.

And how wildly this Use Less preacher was cheered on Monday as he
stood there in his hair-shirt tuxedo. Cheered by actors who'd actually
flown in by private jet. By actresses who'd driven up in stretch
limos. By agents with solarium tans glowing under the brightest
lights.

Ahem. Speaking of lights, Al, a small problem. But one so very
typical.

At almost the very instant Gore was handed his Oscar for best
documentary, The Tennessean, his home state paper, reported he'd in
fact won an Oscar for hypocrisy.

Billing records of the Nashville Electric Service revealed that the
local Gore mansion -- a 20-room, eight-bathroom behemoth with a well-
lit heated pool -- used more electricity each month than the average
American household used in an entire year.

Use Less Gore had so many lights burning, heaters running, computers
humming and gadgets whirring that he burned up 221,000 kilowatt-hours
of electricity last year, or more than 20 times the national household
average.

Worse, he was using more electricity now than he did before he made An
Inconvenient Truth to hector us into making do with less.

And this isn't even counting all the power he uses for his other two
homes, and his endless flights around the world, in private jets and
civil, to flog his film.

Gore's staff, sensing a PR disaster the size of the Exxon Valdez,
rushed to explain away this great oil spill.

Unfair, wheedled spokesman Kalee Kreider. See, Gore and his wife tried
to offset their "carbon footprint" by buying their power through the
local Green Power Switch program.

"They also use compact fluorescent bulbs and other energy efficiency
measures and then they purchase offsets for their carbon emissions to
bring their carbon footprint down to zero.".

But time is also up for this kind of easy virtue. Let's work through
those three common excuses.

So Gore has low-energy light bulbs.

And he still uses all this power? My god.

So Gore uses the local green power program.

But isn't that green power just an add-on to the Nashville Energy
Service's main source of base-load power -- gassy coal-fired power
plants?

And doesn't the NES's green methane-burning plant still need to burn
some dirty coal to work properly? Don't its emissions still contribute
to global warming?

And so we get to Gore's final excuse -- the get-out-of-jail card of so
many of our warming prophets of doom, from Alarmist of the Year Tim
Flannery to that Jeremiah of the airport lounge, David Suzuki: Gore
buys carbon offsets.

That actually means he pays other folk to use less dirty power
themselves, or take out the carbon dioxide he pumps out. It's a bit
like paying someone to starve so you can gorge.

But there are at least four problems with such offsets, the first of
which is very particular to Gore. And that is Gore buys his offsets
through Generation Investment Management, whose chairman is . . . Al
Gore.

What's more, GIM's business is not to itself remove carbon from the
air, but, it says, to "buy high quality companies at attractive prices
that will deliver superior long-term investment returns".

Oh, and by the way, those companies have to be green. Some are even
wind farms, although even they -- don't kid yourself -- produce some
greenhouse gasses.

So Gore isn't so much buying offsets as investing in fashionable
companies for profit. Lucky him. Rich him.

The second problem with his offsets is that if global warming really
is going to fry us to Hell, shouldn't Gore cut emissions, rather just
be carbon neutral?

Third problem is that even green groups now doubt many carbon offsets
actually work.

For instance, the most common offset scheme -- especially here -- is
to simply plant trees, often in places where people would probably
plant them anyway.

But trees die and rot, and when they do they release much of the
carbon they've trapped back into the air.

As Prof. Oliver Rackham, the Cambridge botanist and author, says:
"Telling people to plant trees is like telling them to drink more
water to keep down rising sea levels." What goes in will come out.

Besides, who checks these schemes to see they do what they claim? The
band Coldplay, for instance, last year found that most of the trees of
the mango plantation it planted in India to offset its world tour had
actually died.

And, lastly, there's a moral problem. Offsets are really best suited
for people rich enough -- like Gore -- to afford them.

They let the rich pay someone else to use less so they can use more.
And so the aristocrat can party on under the chandeliers, while the
power-rationed peasants sit out in his dark.

Of course, one hypocrite like Gore shouldn't discredit an entire
cause. Yet it can't be an accident that global warming attracts more
hypocrites than most faiths.

There's Tim Flannery, criss-crossing the world by jet to tell us to
use less oil.

There's British PM Tony Blair lecturing Britons to cut their
emissions, but declaring it "unreasonable" to expect him therefore to
stop flying off on his overseas holidays.

And there's Prince Charles booking out all of a jet's first and second
class to fly to New York to accept a green award from Gore.

Ah, Gore again. Which reminds me of Laurie David, one of the producers
of Gore's An Inconvenient Truth.

David, too, demands we save the world by cutting our gasses, yet turns
out to be as addicted to private jets as her friend Al.

Asked recently to explain such inconvenient hypocrisy, David
spluttered: "Yes, I take a private plane on holiday a couple of times
a year."

But -- and here's where she shows she's nobler than you -- "I feel
horribly guilty about it."

See? The global warming faith is more about how you feel than what you
actually do. Even the makers of An Inconvenient Truth demonstrate
that. What a circus.

So what is the moral in this carnival of hypocrisy?

It's that global warming is an apocalyptic faith whose preachers
demand sacrifices of others that they find far too painful for
themselves.

It's a faith whose prophets can demand we close coal mines but who
won't even turn off their own pool lights. Who demand the masses lose
their cars, while they themselves keep their planes.

It's the ultimate faith of the feckless rich, where a ticket to heaven
can be bought with a cheque made out to Al Gore. No further sacrifice
required.

Except, of course, from the poor. While Gore's lights burn brightly,
for you the darkness is coming.

Meanwhile, we have the likes of Rude "Rudy," who can only

subject.

"Rudy" does not want to discuss anything subjectively.
Or, he would. Rather than just hurl ad hominem Bullshit
into the mist of Al Gorism.

It has been well established for decades that the Gore family
is rife with Hypocrisy when it comes to true conservation.
They have tons of skeletons in their closet. Al Gore is
continueing his Daddy's Legacy.

Way back in the mists of time when the elite wanted to
practice their debauchery upon gentle maidens, they
could go to the Pope and/or Church and buy "Indulgences."

The elitist Mr. Al Gore is now "buying" his own version.
Interesting that it turns out he is even running that scam
for his own profit.

Al Gore?  He is preaching to us to conserve energy while just one of his 3

home.  I won't get into how much fuel his extensive private jet trips
consume.  I do what I can to keep the environment clean but I don't get all
crazy about it like the Al Gore Disciples do.

If we all lived Al Gore's lifestyle the global oil reserves would last 10
years at best.  If someone wants to tell me how I should sacrifice for the
good of the plant I expect them to walk their talk.  The really disgusting
thing is that he is justifying this absurd use of energy by buying carbon
credits to offset his huge energy consumption.  You know what he is really
saying to us common folks?  He is too rich to be expected to conserve
energy.  Can you say  hypocrite?

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-6446087,00.html

This whole global warming movement is a massive money grab.  It cuts across
party lines and national borders.  Al Gore isn't building 10,000 square foot
mansions, buying and paying upkeep on 3 high end homes and paying $30,000
annual electric bills on a government pension.  He is making a fortune off
this crap he is shoveling.  As are multitudes of others.  These guys (on
both sides of the argument) are like sharks in a feeding frenzy right now.
As soon as the food (aka cash) is gone they will move on to some other
environmental emergency to milk for all it is worth.

Twenty-five years ago these same so called experts were telling us the
biggest threat to mankind was global cooling.  That didn't pan out for them
so now it is global warming and they have a few numbers to crow about and
they are trying to grab as much money as they can as quick as they can
before the data swings the other way and undercuts their predictions.

It's worse than you think:  he "buys" his "carbon offsets" from himself --
read the following from today's WSJ:

The Tennessean reported that Gore buys "carbon offsets" to compensate for
his home's use of energy from carbon-based fuels. As Wikipedia explains, a
carbon offset "is a service that tries to reduce the net carbon emissions of
individuals or organizations indirectly, through proxies who reduce their
emissions and/or increase their absorption of greenhouse gases." . . .

But how Gore buys his "carbon offsets," as revealed by The Tennessean
raises serious questions. According to the newspaper's report, Gore buys his
carbon offsets through Generation Investment Management:

Gore helped found Generation Investment Management, through which he and
others pay for offsets. The firm invests the money in solar, wind and other
projects that reduce energy consumption around the globe . . .

Gore is chairman of the firm and, presumably, draws an income or will make
money as its investments prosper. In other words, he "buys" his "carbon
offsets" from himself, through a transaction designed to boost his own
investments and return a profit to himself. To be blunt, Gore doesn't buy
"carbon offsets" through Generation Investment Management--he buys stocks. .
. .

Meanwhile, Gore runs around the country and the world trumpeting "climate
crisis" and blaming man's use of carbon-based energy--burning thousands of
gallons of jet fuel as he goes. His efforts have served to put climate
change at the top of the national and even global agenda, driving up the
value of the stocks and companies viewed as "green" or environmentally
friendly. Companies like those his investment management firm invest his own
and other peoples' [sic] money in. (You can see a list of Generation
Investment Management's holdings here, courtesy of the U.S. Securities &amp;
Exchange Commission.)

Here ya go:

A few facts you might want to consider before buying into the "global
warming" snake oil Gore is selling:

# Since 1895, the media has alternated between global cooling and
warming scares during four separate and sometimes overlapping time
periods. From 1895 until the 1930's the media peddled a coming ice
age. From the late 1920's until the 1960's they warned of global
warming. From the 1950's until the 1970's they warned us again of a
coming ice age. This makes modern global warming the fourth estate's
fourth attempt to promote opposing climate change fears during the
last 100 years.

# The National Academy of Sciences report reaffirmed the existence of
the Medieval Warm Period from about 900 AD to 1300 AD and the Little
Ice Age from about 1500 to 1850. Both of these periods occurred long
before the invention of the SUV or human industrial activity could
have possibly impacted the Earth's climate. In fact, scientists
believe the Earth was warmer than today during the Medieval Warm
Period, when the Vikings grew crops in Greenland.

# What the climate alarmists and their advocates in the media have
continued to ignore is the fact that the Little Ice Age, which
resulted in harsh winters which froze New York Harbor and caused
untold deaths, ended about 1850. So trying to prove man-made global
warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are
warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to
winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.

# Something that the media almost never addresses are the holes in the
theory that C02 has been the driving force in global warming.
Alarmists fail to adequately explain why temperatures began warming at
the end of the Little Ice Age in about 1850, long before man-made CO2
emissions could have impacted the climate. Then about 1940, just as
man-made CO2 emissions rose sharply, the temperatures began a decline
that lasted until the 1970's, prompting the media and many scientists
to fear a coming ice age.

# A letter sent to the Canadian Prime Minister on April 6, 2006 by 60
prominent scientists who question the basis for climate alarmism,
clearly explains the current state of scientific knowledge on global
warming. The 60 scientists wrote: "If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew
what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not
exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary." The
letter also noted: "'Climate change is real' is a meaningless phrase
used repeatedly by activists to convince the public that a climate
catastrophe is looming and humanity is the cause. Neither of these
fears is justified. Global climate changes occur all the time due to
natural causes and the human impact still remains impossible to
distinguish from this natural 'noise."

# In 2006, the director of the International Arctic Research Center in
Fairbanks Alaska, testified to Congress that highly publicized climate
models showing a disappearing Arctic were nothing more than "science
fiction."

# "Geologists Think the World May be Frozen Up Again." That sentence
appeared over 100 years ago in the February 24, 1895 edition of the
New York Times.

# A front page article in the October 7, 1912 New York Times, just a
few months after the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, declared that
a prominent professor "Warns Us of an Encroaching Ice Age." The very
same day in 1912, the Los Angeles Times ran an article warning that
the "Human race will have to fight for its existence against cold." An
August 10, 1923 Washington Post article declared: "Ice Age Coming
Here."

# By the 1930's, the media took a break from reporting on the coming
ice age and instead switched gears to promoting global warming:
"America in Longest Warm Spell Since 1776; Temperature Line Records a
25-year Rise" stated an article in the New York Times on March 27,
1933.

# The media of yesteryear was also not above injecting large amounts
of fear and alarmism into their climate articles. An August 9, 1923
front page article in the Chicago Tribune declared: "Scientist Says
Arctic Ice Will Wipe Out Canada." The article quoted a Yale University
professor who predicted that large parts of Europe and Asia would be
"wiped out" and Switzerland would be "entirely obliterated."

# A December 29, 1974 New York Times article on global cooling
reported that climatologists believed "the facts of the present
climate change are such that the most optimistic experts would assign
near certainty to major crop failure in a decade." The article also
warned that unless government officials reacted to the coming
catastrophe, "mass deaths by starvation and probably in anarchy and
violence" would result. In 1975, the New York Times reported that "A
major cooling [was] widely considered to be inevitable."

# On February 19, 2006, CBS News's "60 Minutes" produced a segment on
the North Pole. The segment was a completely one-sided report,
alleging rapid and unprecedented melting at the polar cap. It even
featured correspondent Scott Pelley claiming that the ice in Greenland
was melting so fast, that he barely got off an ice-berg before it
collapsed into the water. "60 Minutes" failed to inform its viewers
that a 2005 study by a scientist named Ola Johannessen and his
colleagues showing that the interior of Greenland is gaining ice and
mass and that according to scientists, the Arctic was warmer in the
1930's than today.

# According to data released on July 14, 2006 from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the January through
June Alaska statewide average temperature was "0.55F (0.30C) cooler
than the 1971-2000 average."

# In August 2006, Khabibullo Abdusamatov, a scientist who heads the
space research sector for the Russian Academy of Sciences, predicted
long-term global cooling may be on the horizon due to a projected
decrease in the sun's output.

When John Kinney talks, all I smell is bullshit.

The hoax of the doctrine of man-made global warming that is being
foisted upon the world by decree, and the junk science that is
manipulated to support it, represents a creeping fascism whose agenda to
stifle open debate betrays the fact that climate change hysteria is a
farce intended to crush freedoms and further centralize global power.

In an article we published in November about global warming being
primarily caused by the sun, we commented somewhat tongue in cheek that
people who express doubts about global warming would soon be compared to
holocaust deniers by the media and other self-appointed cultural
kingpins who demand total adherence to orthodox religion style beliefs
about climate change.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Here's what we wrote:
">

The assertion that global warming is man made is so oppressively
enforced upon popular opinion, especially in Europe, that expressing a
scintilla of doubt is akin to holocaust denial in some cases. Such is
the insipid brainwashing that has taken place via television, newspapers
and exalted talking heads - global warming skeptics are forced to wear
the metaphoric yellow star and only discuss their doubts in hushed tones
and conciliatory frameworks, or be cat-called, harangued and jeered by
an army of do-gooders who righteously believe they are rescuing mother
earth by recycling a wine bottle or putting their paper in a separate
trash can.
It's not longer a joke.

The Boston Globe's Ellen Goodman wrote an op-ed last week denouncing
anyone who dares dissent against the God-like authoritative status of
the IPCC UN report on climate change.

I would like to say we're at a point where global warming is impossible
to deny. Let's just say that global warming deniers are now on a par
with Holocaust deniers, though one denies the past and the other denies
the present and future.

This assault betrays what's at the heart of the global warming agenda -
a cadre of control freaks who can't respond to the overwhelming evidence
that the Sun and other long term natural cycles are responsible for
climate change and thus have to resort to vile propagandistic
personality attacks to sway the court of public opinion.

During a debate on the BBC's Question Time program, a panelist's appeal
for viewers to simply look at both sides of the argument and consider
other causes besides the man-made explanation was met with boos and
cat-calls from the audience and the speaker was shouted down. It's now
treated as sacrilegious to even question the force fed dogma that leads
the automatons to endlessly repeat what has been brainwashed into them
by the establishment media like a broken record.

"We can't afford to have this debate," they scream, arguing that the end
is nigh and unbelievers need to be metaphorically burned at the stake of
public opinion in the interests of human survival.

But for those with memories and the nerve to actually think for
themselves, the climate doomsayers have been proven wrong throughout the
decades. In the late 60's and early 70's, the in-vogue hysteria about
climate change and how it spelled the end for humanity as we know it
revolved around the concept of global cooling. Again, this arose out of
a misunderstanding of long term temperature fluctuations and the fact
that the earth was at the end of the cycle of the Little Ice Age.

Writer John Bender has done an excellent job of compiling quotes from
environmental "authorities" of past decades who told us that the sky was
falling yet have been completely discredited with hindsight. Keep these
dire proclamations in mind when you hear yet another "repeater"
regurgitate the brainwashing that he or she has been indoctrinated with
by the establishment.

The continued rapid cooling of the earth since WWII is in accord with
the increase in global air pollution associated with industrialization,
mechanization, urbanization and exploding population. -- Reid Bryson,
"Global Ecology; Readings towards a rational strategy for Man", (1971)

The battle to feed humanity is over. In the 1970s, the world will
undergo famines. Hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to
death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. Population
control is the only answer -- Paul Ehrlich - The Population Bomb (1968)

I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000 --
Paul Ehrlich in (1969)

In ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large
areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of
dead fish. -- Paul Ehrlich, Earth Day (1970)

Before 1985, mankind will enter a genuine age of scarcity . . . in which
the accessible supplies of many key minerals will be facing depletion --
Paul Ehrlich in (1976)

This [cooling] trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest
of the century -- Peter Gwynne, Newsweek 1976

There are ominous signs that the earth's weather patterns have begun to
change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline
in food production - with serious political implications for just about
every nation on earth. The drop in food production could begin quite
soon... The evidence in support of these predictions has now begun to
accumulate so massively that meteorologist are hard-pressed to keep up
with it. -- Newsweek, April 28, (1975)

This cooling has already killed hundreds of thousands of people. If it
continues and no strong action is taken, it will cause world famine,
world chaos and world war, and this could all come about before the year
2000. -- Lowell Ponte "The Cooling", 1976

If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder
for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder by
the year 2000...This is about twice what it would take to put us in an
ice age. -- Kenneth E.F. Watt on air pollution and global cooling, Earth
Day (1970)
The IPCC is a political body, not a scientific organization, therefore
its proclamation is purely intended at achieving a political agenda. The
document they released on February 2 that was devotedly afforded days of
intense coverage by the compliant establishment media was a political
manifesto based on a scientific undertaking that has not even been
completed. How empirical is a "scientific experiment" whose conclusions
are announced before tests have even been completed? The document
immediately states that the "scientific" research is being edited to
conform to the already released political summary.

â€œChanges (other than grammatical or minor editorial changes) made after
acceptance by the Working Group or the Panel shall be those necessary to
ensure consistency with the Summary for Policymakers or the Overview
Chapter,â€‌ states the brief.

The U.N. has confidently announced "case closed" on man-made global
warming because they are editing their own uncompleted report to mirror
their pre-conceived conclusion. Hardly "independent" is it?

John Kinney as gospel. Too funny.

A letter sent to the Canadian Prime Minister on April 6, 2006 by 60
prominent scientists who question the basis for climate alarmism,
clearly explains the current state of scientific knowledge on global
warming. The 60 scientists wrote: "If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew
what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not
exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary." The
letter also noted: "'Climate change is real' is a meaningless phrase
used repeatedly by activists to convince the public that a climate
catastrophe is looming and humanity is the cause. Neither of these
fears is justified. Global climate changes occur all the time due to
natural causes and the human impact still remains impossible to
distinguish from this natural 'noise."

"Global Warming" Stopped in 1998

Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter has noted that there is indeed a
problem with global warming - it stopped in 1998. "According to
official temperature records of the Climate Research Unit at the
University of East Anglia in the UK, the global average temperature
did not increase between 1998-2005. "...this eight-year period of
temperature stasis did coincide with society's continued power station
and SUV-inspired pumping of yet more carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere," noted paleoclimate researcher and geologist Bob Carter of
James Cook University in Australia in an April 2006 article titled
"There is a problem with global warming... it stopped in 1998." See:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2006/04/09...

In 2006, the director of the International Arctic Research Center in
Fairbanks Alaska, testified to Congress that highly publicized
climate
models showing a disappearing Arctic were nothing more than "science
fiction."

By BBC science correspondent Christine McGourty

New research has found that parts of the ice sheet that covers West
Antarctica may be getting thicker, not thinner, as scientists have feared.
***************
CNN transcript:

CAFFERTY: OK.

NYE: So other parts of Antarctica are getting colder, yes, and this is
where people say, Wow, this climatology business is complicated. And it
is. That's why everyone is reluctant to definitely to assert that this
disintegration, or collapse, or fracture of this ice shelf is definitely
related to global climate change.
**************
New Research Indicates the Earth May Be Cooling

After a decade of warnings that the Earth's temperature may be rapidly
warming, and that this supposed warming may result in a surge of
catastrophic flooding and lethal storms, it now appears that we may be
in for global cooling instead.

The mammoth west Antarctic ice sheet, which contains enough water to
lift the world's sea levels by 20 feet, isn't melting after all.
Instead, it's actually thickening and Antarctica itself is getting cooler.1

A new study by researchers from the California Institute of Technology's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of California at Santa
Cruz, published in the respected journal Science, found that the ice
sheets of Antarctica, far from melting, actually are expanding by some
26.8 billion tons of ice a year.2

The scientists, Ian Joughlin, a geologist at CIT, and Slawek Tulaczyk, a
professor of earth sciences at UC Santa Cruz, speculate the thickening
ice sheets are repeating a pattern that occurred from 1650 -1850 when
the Earth went through what became known as the Little Ice Age.3

The study's lead author, limnologist Peter Doran, an expert on the study
of fresh water at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is worried
about the cooling's impact on the environment.

Doran says cooling temperature not only is reducing the amount of fresh
water feeding into Antarctica's lakes, but it's also making the surface
ice thicker so plankton that use sunlight for energy are getting less
sunlight. And that, he says, is bad news for the life forms that depend
on plankton for food.

"The ecosystem would continue to diminish, and eventually it would
essentially go into a deep sleep - like a freeze-dried ecosystem," Doran
said in a January 21 interview with Richard Harris, a science reporter
for National Public Radio.4

Doran noted that only a  few years ago the National Science Foundation
was seriously considering moving its campsites away from lakeshores to
escape higher lake levels caused by the melting water.

"We went into this project with the idea that global warming was going
to hit us any time now, and we kept waiting for the warm summers to come
and they never came," Doran said. "It just kept getting colder and
colder, and that's the story."

The new Antarctica studies show just how prescient the Bush
Administration was last year when it announced it was would not send the
1997 Kyoto Treaty to the Senate for ratification.

Supporters of Kyoto - including most environmental groups and former
presidential candidate Al Gore - have argued that the Earth's
temperature will increase by up to eight degrees over the next century
and that this warming will unleash a chain reaction of environmental
disasters.

A global warming fact sheet circulated by the National Resources Defense

Important words being "parts of", hm?

Last week in the midst of all the tornado damage, injuries and deaths, one
woman on a radio interview commented that in the midst of all the
destruction, an expensive crystal bowl was untouched in a building that
was otherwise totally destroyed.  In other words, "parts of" the building
were not totally destroyed by the tornado.  That doesn't mean there wasn't
a tornado.

You and your cronies dearly love the intellectually bankrupt habit of
focusing on the parts while ignoring the big picture.  For example, you
yourself make a big deal over Clinton's peccadillos, while all but
applauding baby Bush's general and much more worrisome assault on US
lives, jurisprudence and civil liberties.

The climate of earth is a very complicated system.  There is evidence that
suggests that global warming could trigger an ice age that would help
offset the warming effects of greenhouse gases, but with udesirable
effects on human cultures. There are planetary models that suggest that
the carbon cycle in the atmosphere may be more sensitive to small changes
than common sense might tell us, with effects that could eradicate
higher-order life on the planet.

Global warming is not a "scam", it's a demonstrably real, very complicated
situation.  The long range payoff is skewed by the potentially disastrous
effect of pumping too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Sensible rational people have to be concerned about the changes, even if
you are not.  The public question has quickly metamorphosed from whether
global warming exists to how to manage the effects.  My own expectation is
that big business interests, now that they've begun to understand that
ignoring the issue is not useful, will begin to find solutions. Some
governments and businesses are already trying.

Anyway, I've played enough URL tag with you on this one.  Next week is
going to be very busy for me so I won't be able to visit in your playpen
for a few days.

&gt; CNN transcript:

&gt;   CAFFERTY: OK.

&gt; NYE: So other parts of Antarctica are getting colder, yes, and this is
&gt; where people say, Wow, this climatology business is complicated. And it
&gt; is. That's why everyone is reluctant to definitely to assert that this
&gt; disintegration, or collapse, or fracture of this ice shelf is definitely
&gt; related to global climate change.
&gt; **************
&gt; New Research Indicates the Earth May Be Cooling

&gt; After a decade of warnings that the Earth's temperature may be rapidly
&gt; warming, and that this supposed warming may result in a surge of
&gt; catastrophic flooding and lethal storms, it now appears that we may be
&gt; in for global cooling instead.

&gt; The mammoth west Antarctic ice sheet, which contains enough water to
&gt; lift the world's sea levels by 20 feet, isn't melting after all.
&gt; Instead, it's actually thickening and Antarctica itself is getting
&gt; cooler.1

&gt; A new study by researchers from the California Institute of Technology's
&gt; Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of California at Santa
&gt; Cruz, published in the respected journal Science, found that the ice
&gt; sheets of Antarctica, far from melting, actually are expanding by some
&gt; 26.8 billion tons of ice a year.2

&gt; The scientists, Ian Joughlin, a geologist at CIT, and Slawek Tulaczyk, a
&gt; professor of earth sciences at UC Santa Cruz, speculate the thickening
&gt; ice sheets are repeating a pattern that occurred from 1650 -1850 when
&gt; the Earth went through what became known as the Little Ice Age.3

&gt; The study's lead author, limnologist Peter Doran, an expert on the study
&gt; of fresh water at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is worried
&gt; about the cooling's impact on the environment.

&gt; Doran says cooling temperature not only is reducing the amount of fresh
&gt; water feeding into Antarctica's lakes, but it's also making the surface
&gt; ice thicker so plankton that use sunlight for energy are getting less
&gt; sunlight. And that, he says, is bad news for the life forms that depend
&gt; on plankton for food.

&gt; &quot;The ecosystem would continue to diminish, and eventually it would
&gt; essentially go into a deep sleep - like a freeze-dried ecosystem,&quot; Doran
&gt; said in a January 21 interview with Richard Harris, a science reporter
&gt; for National Public Radio.4

&gt; Doran noted that only a  few years ago the National Science Foundation
&gt; was seriously considering moving its campsites away from lakeshores to
&gt; escape higher lake levels caused by the melting water.

&gt; &quot;We went into this project with the idea that global warming was going
&gt; to hit us any time now, and we kept waiting for the warm summers to come
&gt; and they never came,&quot; Doran said. &quot;It just kept getting colder and
&gt; colder, and that's the story.&quot;

&gt; The new Antarctica studies show just how prescient the Bush
&gt; Administration was last year when it announced it was would not send the
&gt; 1997 Kyoto Treaty to the Senate for ratification.

&gt; Supporters of Kyoto - including most environmental groups and former
&gt; presidential candidate Al Gore - have argued that the Earth's
&gt; temperature will increase by up to eight degrees over the next century
&gt; and that this warming will unleash a chain reaction of environmental
&gt; disasters.

&gt; A global warming fact sheet circulated by the National Resources Defense
&gt; Council indulges in some particularly heated rhetoric, direly predicting
&gt; that: &quot;Sea levels will rise, flooding coastal areas. Glaciers and polar
&gt; ice packs will melt. Heat waves will be more frequent and more intense.
&gt; Droughts and wildfires will occur more often. And as habitat changes or
&gt; is destroyed, species will be pushed to extinction.&quot;5

&gt; Gore, ignoring the advice of several key Clinton Administration
&gt; officials, took a last-minute flight to Japan in November 1998 to sign
&gt; the Kyoto Protocol even though the Energy Information Administration,
&gt; the official forecasting arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, found
&gt; that meeting the treaty's requirements could increase gasoline prices by
&gt; up to 66 percent and electricity prices by up to 86 percent, and throw
