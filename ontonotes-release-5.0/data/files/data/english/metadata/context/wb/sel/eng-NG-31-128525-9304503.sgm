&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, middle school is a different game. My kids attend schools that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are pretty diverse (grade school is 28% white, 42% black, 24%
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hispanic, 5% Asian, and middle school is 36% white, 31% Black, 15%
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hispanic, 18% Asian, with the majority of the &quot;black&quot; population
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; actually children
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of Caribbean and African immigrants). There's very little racial
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; namecalling or social segregation at the grade school, but at middle
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; school some of the kids start to pay more attention to it. It's not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; real serious or ugly

&gt; &gt;&gt; Have you any idea how odd it can sound to an outsider that you even
&gt; &gt;&gt; know those percentages, Kathy? Someone sorted the students and
&gt; &gt;&gt; someone else has published the results. Even if the students'

&gt; &gt;&gt; form it's bizaare and potentially divisive that it's asked at all!

&gt; &gt; It is likely to be a government requirement to provide such
&gt; &gt; statistics.

&gt; How does anyone of mixed race work out what to put? They're most likely to
&gt; identify with the culture they feel they belong to before their skin colour,
&gt; right?

It's a self-identification issue.  So I don't know how people work it
out!

The biggest minority in the US is still african-american, and our
culture tends to designate &quot;mixed race&quot; as african-american.

&gt; &gt; In all of the schools I've ever registered our children in, it's been
&gt; &gt; the law that that section must be filled in. I don't find it bizarre
&gt; &gt; or divisive at all. In many of the school districts I've been in,
&gt; &gt; there have been specific financial advantages to having these sta-
&gt; &gt; tistics maintained by the school. And I'm not understanding why it
&gt; &gt; would be divisive. I can go to any school event and make a quick
&gt; &gt; estimate of my own and be pretty close.

&gt; Of course you could, but why would you want to?

&gt;  *Why* are their financial advantages to being labelled a particular race?
&gt; It's divisive that it's true at all. (Adding to the points Doug mentioned.)
">

I don't know the details of this, but I'll give two examples:

1) private non-profit schools in the US are _required_ to report this
in order to retain their non-profit status.  Being a non-profit is
financially advantageous for the school since then the school
doesn't pay taxes.

2) The formula by which public schools get funded in some states
includes taking into account things like the following:  percent of
low income students,  percent of certain classes of minority
students,  cost of living in the location of the school.

This may or may not be a bad thing (that those things get taken
into account) but it is a true thing!

To be honest, while I've heard that gang activity is on the rise, I
don't know much about it.  I was always under the impression that
gangs were territorial.  And I don't know if an increase in gangs
necessarily correlates to an increase in racism among young people.

Well, I believe you!

Seriously, the percentage of low income students and cost of living in the
school location, say, seem important enough on their own without bringing
ethnicity into it. I mean, the reason why selected minorities are the
targets of affirmative action in the first place is because those ones fare
badly socio-economically as a group. The minorities that don't do badly are
left to get on with it.

I wrote two more paragraphs on the pros and cons of identifying ethnic
groups for the purpose of treating them differently from other groups before
deciding they would contain absolutely no new concepts for people who have
grown up immersed in discussion of the issues of racism and methods for
combating socio-economic disadvantage!

But I do wonder if identifying whole ethnic groups as being disadvantaged
helps or hurts those members of the group who don't fit the stereotypes in
the long run. And does it create additional resentment amongst the various
targeted minority groups when they have to compete for preferment based on
quotas rather than the circumstances of each individual.I can't help feeling
discrimination is perpetuated by a system that carefully identifies its
disadvantaged folk by race rather than the underlying social issues because
while they overlap, they aren't synonymous.

Anyway, I was just struck by the whole concept of thinking about a school's
student population in terms of percentages based on race and what a cultural
disconnect that caused for me. I'll shut up now!

It's hard to articulate! I suppose I was thinking about it terms of my son's
primary school which hasn't a large number of students. Listing percentages
could easily identify various children by the process of elimination.
Obviously the Sudanese families are easy enough to identify on sight but to
me it would be like saying the school had 5% Greek Orthodox, 6% Jewish, 3%
Hindu etc... that is, personal details that are no one's business but that
of the families of the children.

There are several  younger grades children receiving help because English is
a second language for them but they come from three or four different
countries so it's not an ethnicity issue so much as one directly related to
immigration. When it comes to collecting personal information from groups I
think it should be done only if there is a very good reason and if the data
compiled is used wisely.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Doug mentioned.)

&gt; &gt; I don't know the details of this, but I'll give two examples:

&gt; &gt; 1) private non-profit schools in the US are _required_ to report this
&gt; &gt;   in order to retain their non-profit status.  Being a non-profit is
&gt; &gt;   financially advantageous for the school since then the school
&gt; &gt;   doesn't pay taxes.

&gt; &gt; 2) The formula by which public schools get funded in some states
&gt; &gt;   includes taking into account things like the following:  percent of
&gt; &gt;   low income students,  percent of certain classes of minority
&gt; &gt;   students,  cost of living in the location of the school.

&gt; &gt;   This may or may not be a bad thing (that those things get taken
&gt; &gt;   into account) but it is a true thing!

&gt; Well, I believe you!

&gt; Seriously, the percentage of low income students and cost of living in the
&gt; school location, say, seem important enough on their own without bringing
&gt; ethnicity into it. I mean, the reason why selected minorities are the
&gt; targets of affirmative action in the first place is because those ones fare
&gt; badly socio-economically as a group. The minorities that don't do badly are
&gt; left to get on with it.

&gt; I wrote two more paragraphs on the pros and cons of identifying ethnic
&gt; groups for the purpose of treating them differently from other groups before
&gt; deciding they would contain absolutely no new concepts for people who have
&gt; grown up immersed in discussion of the issues of racism and methods for
&gt; combating socio-economic disadvantage!

&gt; But I do wonder if identifying whole ethnic groups as being disadvantaged
&gt; helps or hurts those members of the group who don't fit the stereotypes in
&gt; the long run. And does it create additional resentment amongst the various
&gt; targeted minority groups when they have to compete for preferment based on
&gt; quotas rather than the circumstances of each individual.I can't help feeling
&gt; discrimination is perpetuated by a system that carefully identifies its
&gt; disadvantaged folk by race rather than the underlying social issues because
&gt; while they overlap, they aren't synonymous.
">

Well, you certainly aren't the only one to wonder this!  This has been
an ongoing debate in the US for decades, and at this point the
movement is certainly toward eliminating race based affirmative action
programs in the US.

I don't find the issue completely cut-and-dried myself.

But it is easy to justify extra help for members of
discriminated-against minority groups.  After all, presumably someone
who is in a discriminated against minority group has more hurdles to
overcome than someone of the same economic status who _isn't_ in the
discriminated against minority group.

On the other hand, there are those who would argue that most
affirmative action programs benefit middle-class minority members, and
that discrimination against middle-class minority members is now so
minor that such people should't receive the benefit of such programs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyway, I was just struck by the whole concept of thinking about a school's
&gt; student population in terms of percentages based on race and what a cultural
&gt; disconnect that caused for me. I'll shut up now!
">

I agree that it is bizarre.  But let me give you another instance of
why someone might want to do such a thing.  (This may convince you
more and more that public education in the US is going insane - I
won't argue with you on that.)

There is a series of examinations that students need to take.  By
federal law, schools where not enough students pass the exams are
penalized financially, and in other ways.  (Note that _students_ are
not penalized - in fact there are no consequences for the students for
doing badly on these exams, except that their schools get less money.)

Some allowances of various kinds are made for schools that serve
student populations that traditionally do badly on such exams.  One
such population is poor students.  But another such population is
african-american studens who, as a group, perform more poorly on such
exams than &quot;white&quot; students at the same economic level.

(These exams are driving most of public education at this point in the
US, which would be one thing if they were good exams, well thought out
at the national level.  But they are designed state-by-state,
generally poorly tested, often poorly thought out, and as they suck up
more and more resources, are not resulting in any improvements in
school-leavers.)

No, I'm not sure.  And the census bureau says I'm wrong and that
hispanics (if you treat them as a single minority group) passed blacks
in 2003 in terms of the size of the group.

&gt; Well, it does suggest that it is important to decide what &quot;race&quot; your
&gt; child belongs to.  By making that an important issue, it steers one
&gt; toward thinking of people in terms of their &quot;race.&quot;

&gt; Beyond that, racial classification is sort of the first step toward
&gt; racial oppression in the modern nation state.  I'll omit the obvious
&gt; example to delay the application of Godwin's law, but South Africa
&gt; made a fetish out of racial classification.  The US doesn't do
&gt; anything at the same level (and our racial classification is for
&gt; different purposes), nevertheless, it does raise the hackles of the
&gt; suspicious among us (which would include me).  (As in &quot;how convenient
&gt; to know who the &lt;fill in the blanks&gt; are when it is time to crack down
&gt; on them.&quot;)
">

I would argue, from a different perspective, that &quot;not thinking about
race&quot; is a particular privilege of those who belong to the race that has
historically been dominant in a society (you can substitute ethnicity,
nationality, or religion for race when thinking about societies where
those have been the point of contention). In other words, in the U.S.
it's easier for a white person to say, well, let's just forget about race.

For example, I suspect if you suggested removing racial
statistics-keeping from the census, school records, and so on, my guess
would be that it would provoke an uproar among minority communities. It
would be difficult, I would argue, to continue to study and combat the
inequality that continues to be an issue here, without such data. Not
compiling data on it is a sort of sticking one's head in the sand. And
until you can truly say that race is *not* an issue in this country,
perhaps it makes sense to continue steering people's attention to it.

Indeed. Here on this happy newsgroup, we are actual egalitarians.
Ergo, women get NOTHING more than men get. Neither one who
makes stupid choices gets sympathy here.

Then again, no one here is trying to get men legal rights to avoid
parenthood, because the men might drop the baybees into lakes
or dumpsters, thats more women's ( Susan Smith, et al ) thang.

Thanks for the further proof that WomenFirsters HATE equality.
