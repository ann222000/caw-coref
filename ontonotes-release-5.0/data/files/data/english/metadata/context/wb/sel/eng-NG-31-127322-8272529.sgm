What do you think of the following innovative options:

1. Conventional cap and trade with grandfathering and a fixed price
guaranteed by government
2. A carbon tax that is refunded based on output, eg limited to the
electric utility sector with output measured in kWh

Can you think of other ways to improve on cap and trade, or carbon tax
proposals?

And a quick list of undesirable policy features:

Price volatility
Windfall profits
Complexity
Easy to game the system

And desirable ones:

Equity
Polluter pays
Political feasibility (well connected polluters will throw a big fuss,
if they are made to pay)
Short term price stability
Long term flexible upward adjustment of price

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by a &quot;conventional cap and trade&quot;
with a fixed price. Do you mean that the government would sell an
unlimited number of short-term permits at an escape valve price? In
that case, you would really be talking about a hybrid system, rather
than a conventional cap and trade. Also, grandfathering under any cap
and trade system is far from efficient, though it may be necessary for
political reasons.

To avoid reinventing the wheel on this, I'll quote something I wrote
on the subject a few months back. My apologies in advance for any
economic jargon:

Two competing approaches have emerged in the effort to internalize the
cost of climate change in the price of carbon emissions. The first is
a price-based approach, where emitters of carbon pay a fixed price for
every ton of carbon they emit. Under such a system, firms will choose
to reduce emissions whenever emission abatement is available at a cost
lower than the level of the carbon price. The second approach fixes
the total quantities of emissions, and is a tad more complicated. In a
quantity-based approach, the quantity of permissible carbon emissions
is capped and firms are required to possess permits for each unit of
emissions. In most modern variants, these permits are tradable between
firms, and may or may not be bankable for use in future years. At the
start of the quantity-based system, permits are either auctioned off
by the government, distributed to firms based on the emissions of a
chosen baseline year, or distributed annually based on emissions in an
updating prior period. Firms with relatively high abatement costs will
choose to buy permits on the  market if the price of permits is lower
than the cost of abatement. Likewise, firms with low abatement costs
will reduce emissions and sell extra permits until the point at which
the cost of further abatement equals the market price of permits. In
an ideal world of perfect information and no transaction costs, the
equilibrium outcome of taxes and tradable permit systems would be
effectively identical, as both would result in firms abating to the
point at which price of emissions (either the price of a permit or the
marginal tax) is equal to the cost of abatement. In a world
characterized by uncertainties, however, taxes and tradable permits
can result in quite different outcomes.

In his classic 1974 article, Prices vs. Quantities, Martin Weitzman
pointed out that price-based and quantity-based approaches behave
quite differently when the costs of abatement are uncertain. The
relative effectiveness of each depends on the slope of the marginal
abatement cost and marginal benefits curve. If marginal abatement
costs are expected to be steep, e.g. each unit of emissions costs more
than the prior unit to abate, a price approach will tend to limit
potential deadweight loss that would occur under a quantity-based
mechanism by capping costs should marginal abatement costs prove
higher than expected, and allow for the optimal level of abatement
should abatement costs prove lower than expected. If the marginal
benefits curve is steep, however, a quantity-based mechanism can limit
the deadweight loss that would occur due to inefficiently high or low
abatement under a price-based mechanism. Thus steep marginal costs and
flat benefits of abatement would tend to favor a price-based
mechanisms, while flat marginal costs and steep benefits would favor a
quantity-based mechanism.

In the context of climate change issue, it is likely that price-based
mechanisms will outperform quantity-based mechanisms, at least in the
short term (Pizer 2002). Carbon dioxide is a classic example of a
stock pollutant, where the marginal damages of a unit of emissions is
solely a function of the existing concentration of CO2 in the
atmosphere and a single unit of emissions has a negligible effect on
the total stock. Hence the marginal benefits of abatement should be
relatively flat over the short term. Likewise, marginal abatement
costs are expected to be steep, as each additional unit of abatement
will be more expensive than the prior one, and there is little time
for innovation in abatement methods. If a pure quantity-based
mechanism is implemented and marginal abatement costs prove higher
than anticipated, firms could be forced to pay permit prices well in
excess of the social cost of carbon, leading to a loss of welfare. In
the long term, however, the situation changes considerably. Here,
marginal benefits of abatement are expected to be quite steep, as the
stock changes dramatically over time. Likewise, marginal costs of
abatement are expected to become more flat as both endogenous and
exogenous technological development drive down abatement costs. This
has led some to suggest that the ideal mechanism for greenhouse gas
abatement is one that acts like a price mechanism at the margin with
the flexibility to behave like a quantity-based mechanism in the long-
term by changing the price in response to changes in the slopes of the
marginal cost and benefit curves (Stern 2006).

Unfortunately, efficiency is not the only criterion that governs the
policy-making process. In reality, efficiency is but one of many
factors used in deciding which policies to adopt. Also important are
concerns about effectiveness, in terms of how much emissions are
actually reduced, concerns about equity, in terms of who has to bear
the burden of emissions reductions, and concerns about what is
political acceptable to the powerful actors. Quantity-based mechanisms
(tradable permits) and price-based mechanisms (taxes) perform
differently in their ability to satisfy these oft-competing criteria.

Tradable permits

Tradable permit systems have proven the most popular mechanism to date
in both international climate negotiations and domestic policy
proposals. They have the benefit of being more politically acceptable
to firms, as virtually all tradable permit systems for greenhouse gas
emissions implemented so far have grandfathered most permits to
existing firms based on emissions from a particular baseline year.
This reduces the compliance costs of firms vis-à-vis a tax and creates
a barrier to entry for new firms in GHG-intensive sectors, giving a
competitive advantage to those firms granted initial permit
allocations. Trading in permits helps minimize abatement costs by
allowing firms with high abatement costs to buy emission permits from
those with low abatement costs. This is particularly important on the
international level, where abatement costs differ widely between
countries.

Tradable permit systems allow the explicit separation of effectiveness
and equity. Effectiveness is solely governed by the level of the cap,
as climate change occurs based only on the total quantity of
emissions, irregardless of who actually emitted them. Equity, on the
other hand, is solely determined by the initial allocation of permits.
This separation of efficiency and equity can be a mixed blessing,
however, as equity issues tend to be highly controversial and
efficiency can suffer if no equitable distribution can be agreed upon
under a given cap. These issues are particularly important in the
context of developing an international tradable permit system.

Tradable permit systems also tend to lack a continuing incentive for
abatement. Under a permit system, firms will reduce overall emissions
to the point at which the total emissions of all firms is equal to the
cap, but there is little systemic incentive incentive to make further
reductions even if abatement costs prove lower than anticipated. The
only way to achieve additional reductions is to reduce the total
amount of permits in the system. This can be accomplished in two ways:
either the government can reduce the emission allowance of all permits
by a constant amount, or they can buy up permits from the market to
remove them from circulation. The prior option could potentially wreck
havoc on the market in the absence of a fixed schedule of reductions
decided at the time of policy formation. As the recent experience of
the European Trading System demonstrates, if people are uncertain what
the value of permits will be in the future, changes in permit
allocations can lead to dramatic spikes or drops in the market price
of permits (Sterner and Muller 2006). However, creating certainty in
the permit market limits the ability of the government to tighten
permit allocations in the future in response to new scientific
developments that clarify the social cost of carbon. The second
option, buying up permits, may result in an unacceptable transfer of
wealth from the government to firms, especially if initial permit
distributions were grandfathered rather than auctioned. Additionally,
the announcement of a large government buy up of permits could lead to
a spike in permit prices and potential windfall profits to firms and
traders.

Finally, international trade in permits poses potential compliance
issues. Countries initially allocated excess permits will have an
incentive to sell their permits at the onset and later withdraw from
the treaty when emission restrictions start to impose an economic
burden. In the absence of trade sanctions on countries that withdraw
from the treaty, which would prove problematic under international
trade law, non-compliance may pose a huge problem. One way around this
may be what David Victor calls &quot;buyer liability&quot; (2001: 69-74). In a
buyer liability system, a permit becomes void if the initial issuer
defaults on their treaty obligations. Thus all permits in the market
would be explicitly priced based on the perceived risk of default of
the issuing nation, and nations would have a strong incentive to take
steps to reassure potential buyers against the risk of default. A more
subtle but no less problematic form of non-compliance has been seen in
the empirical experience of the European Trading System (ETS).

A few other interesting considerations when designing an &quot;ideal&quot;
system:

Upstream vs. downstream regulation
Abatement policy mechanisms can regulate emissions at the point where
carbon enters the economy, the point where greenhouse gases are
actually released, or somewhere in between. Under an upstream program,
producers and importers of GHG-producing fuels would be required to
hold permits for any fuel they sold, based on the GHG-potential of
those fuels. The price effect of an upstream permit system would
peculate down throughout the economy, raising the price of energy
produced proportional to carbon releases and creating an incentive for
increased energy efficiency and greater use of alternative energy
generation technologies. Upstream solutions of the benefit of greater
coverage and simpler implementation than downstream solutions, as
there may be as few as 2000 entities that would be required to hold
allowances.  However, upstream solution may be less politically
palatable due to their wide coverage of sectors where price increases
may be less popular (e.g. transportation fuels in the United States).

Downstream solutions, on the other hand, will be quite expensive to
implement outside of the rather narrow power sector. Regulating
emissions at the tailpipe would be impractical for all 300 million
vehicles in the United States, as the transaction costs would prove
prohibitively high. If a downstream solution focused on a particular
sector, as the Kyoto Protocol focuses on the power sector, there would
likely be some leakage between regulated and non-regulated sectors.
For example, if only large power producers are regulated, it would
create an incentive for people to run smaller generator units that do
not meet the threshold for regulation. The cost imposed to meet a
particular overall emissions target would be higher for specific goods
in a limited downstream system, while an upstream system with broad
coverage would more effectively spread out costs.

One potential shortcoming of an upstream system is that it might
provide an inadequate incentive for carbon sequestration.
Internalizing the cost of emissions at the point of extraction or
import is only effective if the amount of carbon emitted per unit of
fuel combusted cannot be reduced. If carbon sequestration is a viable
option, however, there would be little incentive for downstream
electricity generators to capture carbon post-combustion, as it would
have no direct effect on the price they pay for fuel. There may be
some ways to get around this problem, perhaps by exempting fuel sold
to generators using carbon capture and storage from permit
requirements or creating markets for additional permits generated via
downstream abatement (similar, for example, to CDM permits in the EU
ETS). Regardless, this will still be a somewhat problematic issue for
upstream systems.

Another question, especially for upstream systems, is how to deal with
carbon feedstocks (e.g. fertilizers and plastics). An overly broad
system would raise the price of fossil-fuel derivatives, such as
plastics, that do not directly result in greenhouse gas emissions.
Fuel destined for these purposes could be exempted from permit or tax
requirements, but it would be difficult in practice to determine the
lifetime emissions of numerous products.

Finally, there is a question of how the price signal would differ if
permits or fees are disconnected from the point of emissions. For
downstream users in an upstream system, the incentive for emissions
abatement would be solely embodied in the GHG intensity-weighted price
of fuels. Price increases in fuel would create an incentive to
minimize fuel use, or minimize power purchased from generators using
expensive fuel. As long as greenhouse gas emissions from any given
fuel are independent of the method in which the fuel is used, as
discussed earlier, a price mechanism should theoretically have an
identical effect no matter where it is placed in the product &quot;stream&quot;.
However, shifting the price signal upstream of the point of emissions
could potentially dampen the abatement incentive in practice by
shifting the focus from reducing emissions to reducing costs. As there
are potential options for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of a
given fuel, especially for non-carbon fuels that can be converted to a
more benign form (e.g. methane incineration), pricing emissions
downstream could create a greater incentive for innovative emissions
reduction solutions rather than just energy efficiency.

Initial allocations of permits

Given the potential value of emission permits, the initial allocation
is extremely important. Permits can be allocated by grandfathering,
auctioning, or updating allocation systems. Grandfathering involves
giving firms permits based on a certain baseline year, preferably far
enough in the past so as not to influence recent investment decisions.
Grandfathered permits will often result in windfall profits for firms,
as the cost of permits can be passed through to the consumers while
the benefits of permit sales will not, at least in imperfect markets.

Permits can also be auctioned by the government at the beginning of
the system. These auctions would reduce potential barriers to entry of
new firms, as all firms would have to pay for their permits. However,
since permit price might have changed since the initial auction, the
relative burden on companies may vary by time of entry. Auctions would
also provide a revenue stream that could be used to offset the
distributional impacts and/or tax interaction effects of the system.
Auctions would prove unpopular politically, however, as they involve
fairly substantial transfers of wealth from firms to the government,
even if that revenue is subsequently recycled. Auctions also risk
inefficiently high initial permit prices, especially if the permits
involved are indefinite and firms are risk adverse and believe that
the system will become stricter over time. In theory, auctions could
be structured with a price cap, but the government would have to be
willing to provide unlimited indefinite permits at that price cap to
avoid creating scarcity conditions.

Finally, permits can be allocated based on emissions in the prior
year, with permit allocations updated regularly. This would impose the
least impact on firms, as permit allocations would best mirror their
current emissions and hence match their abatement costs better than
the other systems. However, an updating allocation would create
perverse incentives that would unduly reward investments in further
carbon-intensive generation, as those who build a new plant would be
rewarded with an increased pool of permits the following year. This
waters down the effectiveness of the tradable permit system, as the
benefit from additional permits would offset the cost of compliance.

Revenue recycling: efficiency and distribution concerns

Revenue raised via the auctioning of permits and/or the sale of annual
permits could be used to offset the effects of the system. As
increasing energy prices will tend go have a regressive effect on the
economy, given that poor people tend to spend a larger portion of
their income on energy, revenue could be used to progressively reduce
income or payroll taxes. A tradable permit or hybrid system would also
tend to create inefficiencies due to the interaction of new and
existing taxes. This &quot;tax interaction effect&quot; can be reduced by
recycling revenue as efficiently as possible, possibly by cutting
corporate capital gains taxes and other distorting taxes. Note that
there is, to some extent, a tradeoff between offsetting the equity and
efficiency effects of the system. A system that offsets purely
regressive tax effects might be less efficient than one focusing
purely on the most efficient revenue recycling.

Banking

Banking would allow firms to preserve unused permit with the option of
using that unit of emission in the future. Firms may choose to bank
excess permits rather than selling them as a hedge against future
permit market volatility. This might be less important, however, in a
system with a low escape valve price). As Pizer has shown, tradable
permit systems that allow banking tend to exhibit less volatility than
those without banking. If initial permit allocations proved too high,
however, banking could have the perverse effect of watering down
future compliance periods should a large number of permits be banked.

Carbon target certainty

The traditional economic analysis of climate change treats it as a
stock pollutant with the damages associated with a particular ton of
emissions rising convexly as a function of to current stock. The
relatively slow change in marginal damages, at least in the short
term, is used to argue for the superiority of fixing prices rather
than quantities in dealing with the problem. In the long term, as
Stern pointed out, marginal damages begin increasing much more
quickly, and a mechanism that fixes quantities would produce better
results. The important question, than, is where this crossover point
occurs. At what point is achieving a certain carbon target, say
atmospheric concentrations below 550 ppm, worth the risk of higher
than expected abatement costs?

The climate system is characterized by its non-linearities. The paleo-
climate record reveals a number of climate &quot;tipping points&quot; that have
occurred in geologic times, where the climate has shifted relatively
quickly from one stable state to another. These shifts are regulated
by positive and negative climate feedbacks, such as cloud formation,
albedo changes, methane releases, etc. If the potential for sudden
climate shifts past a certain point is high, than a tax based system
risks treading on the &quot;tail&quot; of probable future climate change
scenarios, where the low probability high cost impacts occur. The
merit of tradable permit systems in limiting potential damages, albeit
at the risk of incurring high costs, is rather ...

Something like:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They have built off the seminal work of
&gt; Roberts and Spence (1976), who first proposed a &quot;mixed system&quot; of
&gt; emission permits bounded by a penalty for excess emissions and a
&gt; subsidy should the permit price fall below a certain threshold.
">

However with a single price, ie the government would offer to buy and
sell unlimited amounts of permits at a fixed price. This would ensure
zero short term price volatility. To ensure revenue neutrality, taxes
and grandfathering would have to be adjusted each year.

I had a discussion with Geoffrey Styles on cap and trade. He basically
argues that the &quot;cost&quot; of a system is what industry collectively pays,
and that therefore cap and trade with grandfathering gives far greater
reductions for a given cost to industry than carbon taxes.

http://energyoutlook.blogspot.com/search/label/cap-and-trade

This is about political feasibility, because any change that really
hurts a small group of incumbents, while providing a new benefit to
many, will get massive opposition from the incumbents and lukewarm
support from those due to benefit.

But it's also about export competitiveness, because the right type of
grandfathering allows special treatment for export intensive business.

I understand these concerns, and wonder what mechanisms there are to
limit the damage from price volatility inherent in targeting quantity
rather than price. Is there any benefit in having any short term price
volatility?

It seems to me that yearly limited tinkering with a steadily rising
price is more than enough. For heating oil a price spike in a cold
winter is vital, it suppresses short term demand, increases short term
supply and encourages inventory holding, all of which ensures there
won't be a shortage. For carbon, what exactly is the benefit of prices
going up in a cold winter? What good does that do?

It just seems odd to see a hybrid system referred to as a
&quot;conventional&quot; cap and trade; perhaps the Bingaman bill is proving
more influential than I expected :op

Tradable permit systems do allow the seperation of efficiency and
equity, and thus permit the initial permit distribution to be chosen
based on political considerations without effecting the overall level
of abatement that occurs (though it certainly effects the equity; just
look at the windfall profits in the power sector due to grandfathering
in the first phase of the EU ETS!). Grandfathering allows the
government to soften the blow for businesses. Cap and trade systems
also make the price implicit, rather than an explicit tax, which may
be more politically palatable (after all, what we don't know can't
cost us...). Ironically, tradable permit systems involving any degree
of grandfathering will tend to be considerably more regressive than
tax systems, as there is no revenue to recycle to offset the rising
cost of energy for the poor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From an economic standpoint, the only real reason to prefer cap and
">

trade systems over emissions taxes is if the marginal damages of
climate change are so steep that it becomes essential to limit
emissions to a certain fixed target, lest we pass a threshold.
However, most modeling I have seen (see Pizer's 2002 paper, for
example) requires an unrealistically high convexity of the marginal
benefits of abatement function for permits to outperform taxes. Also,
climate change is probably not a threshold problem, tipping points of
no return notwithstanding.

As far as limiting price volatility goes, a hybrid system with an
escape valve would prevent too much volatility (especially if short-
term abatement costs prove higher than anticipated). Similarly,
allowing for the banking of permits would reduce cost volatility
between compliance periods (and thus avoid the problem currently
facing the EU ETS, where permits are effectively worthless at this
point). Banking could be problematic, however, should initial permit
allocations be higher than optimal, as it would limit the ability to
remove permits from the system. As far as I know, there are no real
benefits of short-term price volatility (other than the opportunity
for a few people to get rich arbitraging the market).

I've been doing some work recently on what I call a &quot;phased hybrid&quot;
system that transitions over time from a standard hybrid to a pure tax-
like system. In a phased hybrid, firms would receive an initial
portfolio of fixed-term tradable emission permits, either via
grandfathering or auctioning. As the number of permits in the system
decreases over time (as the initial allocation of permits expire), the
price of permits will converge with the price cap, which should
ideally increase over time proportional to the social cost of carbon.
After a certain period of time, none of the initial permits will
remain in the system, and all firms will have to pay for emissions at
the level of the price cap. At this point, the system will be
functionally identical to a pure price-fixing mechanism. The benefit
of this system over a traditional hybrid system is that it provides a
mechanism to eliminate initial allocations (and thus makes any
necessary grandfathering less onerous). It would over time remove the
barrier to entry posed by initial allocations, and also provide
continuing incentives for abatement due to the defacto price floor
that would develop as the number of permits in the system decreased
and the system started to resemble a pure tax.

It's conventional cap and trade + an extra feature. There's such a
momentum for cap and trade now, I think we need to think about ways to
modify the scheme to make it better, preferably without mentioning the
t word.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; From an economic standpoint, the only real reason to prefer cap and

I really have trouble following that argument. If we think we need to
reduce by 50% by 2050 we can make an estimate of the required tax
path, say $10 in 2010 and $150 in 2050, and as time passes we can
annually tweak that so that the actual path ends up with either $100
or $500 in 2050. What's different about that from choosing an
emissions reduction path with a cap and finding that the price of the
permits slowly rises towards $100 or $500 (except for the needless
shor term volatility)?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As far as limiting price volatility goes,
">

So what's wrong with government limiting volatility to zero?

I can think of two arguments that'll be made. One, if the government
sets the amount of free permits and the price wrong, it'll have to
transfer a lot of money to industry and it's a pretty obvious transfer
of money. On the other hand, the windfall profits in the EU-ETS were
obvious enough, and it really shouldn't be that hard to balance the
books by tweaking free permit issuance and permit price on an annual
basis.

Secondly, I guess people will cry communism, because the power of the
market is being subverted by government intervention. That's rubbish,
because we aren't talking heating oil or milk, and there won't be
butter mountains or gas line type shortages. But it might still be
brought up as a rhetorical stick.

&gt; marginal tax) is equal to the cost of abatement. In a world
&gt; characterized by uncertainties, however, taxes and tradable permits
&gt; can result in quite different outcomes.

&gt; In his classic 1974 article, Prices vs. Quantities, Martin Weitzman
&gt; pointed out that price-based and quantity-based approaches behave
&gt; quite differently when the costs of abatement are uncertain. The
&gt; relative effectiveness of each depends on the slope of the marginal
&gt; abatement cost and marginal benefits curve. If marginal abatement
&gt; costs are expected to be steep, e.g. each unit of emissions costs more
&gt; than the prior unit to abate, a price approach will tend to limit
&gt; potential deadweight loss that would occur under a quantity-based
&gt; mechanism by capping costs should marginal abatement costs prove
&gt; higher than expected, and allow for the optimal level of abatement
&gt; should abatement costs prove lower than expected. If the marginal
&gt; benefits curve is steep, however, a quantity-based mechanism can limit
&gt; the deadweight loss that would occur due to inefficiently high or low
&gt; abatement under a price-based mechanism. Thus steep marginal costs and
&gt; flat benefits of abatement would tend to favor a price-based
&gt; mechanisms, while flat marginal costs and steep benefits would favor a
&gt; quantity-based mechanism.

&gt; In the context of climate change issue, it is likely that price-based
&gt; mechanisms will outperform quantity-based mechanisms, at least in the
&gt; short term (Pizer 2002). Carbon dioxide is a classic example of a
&gt; stock pollutant, where the marginal damages of a unit of emissions is
&gt; solely a function of the existing concentration of CO2 in the
&gt; atmosphere and a single unit of emissions has a negligible effect on
&gt; the total stock. Hence the marginal benefits of abatement should be
&gt; relatively flat over the short term. Likewise, marginal abatement
&gt; costs are expected to be steep, as each additional unit of abatement
&gt; will be more expensive than the prior one, and there is little time
&gt; for innovation in abatement methods. If a pure quantity-based
&gt; mechanism is implemented and marginal abatement costs prove higher
&gt; than anticipated, firms could be forced to pay permit prices well in
&gt; excess of the social cost of carbon, leading to a loss of welfare. In
&gt; the long term, however, the situation changes considerably. Here,
&gt; marginal benefits of abatement are expected to be quite steep, as the
&gt; stock changes dramatically over time. Likewise, marginal costs of
&gt; abatement are expected to become more flat as both endogenous and
&gt; exogenous technological development drive down abatement costs. This
&gt; has led some to suggest that the ideal mechanism for greenhouse gas
&gt; abatement is one that acts like a price mechanism at the margin with
&gt; the flexibility to behave like a quantity-based mechanism in the long-
&gt; term by changing the price in response to changes in the slopes of the
&gt; marginal cost and benefit curves (Stern 2006).

&gt; Unfortunately, efficiency is not the only criterion that governs the
&gt; policy-making process. In reality, efficiency is but one of many
&gt; factors used in deciding which policies to adopt. Also important are
&gt; concerns about effectiveness, in terms of how much emissions are
&gt; actually reduced, concerns about equity, in terms of who has to bear
&gt; the burden of emissions reductions, and concerns about what is
&gt; political acceptable to the powerful actors. Quantity-based mechanisms
&gt; (tradable permits) and price-based mechanisms (taxes) perform
&gt; differently in their ability to satisfy these oft-competing criteria.

&gt; Tradable permits

&gt; Tradable permit systems have proven the most popular mechanism to date
&gt; in both international climate negotiations and domestic policy
&gt; proposals. They have the benefit of being more politically acceptable
&gt; to firms, as virtually all tradable permit systems for greenhouse gas
&gt; emissions implemented so far have grandfathered most permits to
&gt; existing firms based on emissions from a particular baseline year.
&gt; This reduces the compliance costs of firms vis-à-vis a tax and creates
&gt; a barrier to entry for new firms in GHG-intensive sectors, giving a
&gt; competitive advantage to those firms granted initial permit
&gt; allocations. Trading in permits helps minimize abatement costs by
&gt; allowing firms with high abatement costs to buy emission permits from
&gt; those with low abatement costs. This is particularly important on the
&gt; international level, where abatement costs differ widely between
&gt; countries.

&gt; Tradable permit systems allow the explicit separation of effectiveness
&gt; and equity. Effectiveness is solely governed by the level of the cap,
&gt; as climate change occurs based only on the total quantity of
&gt; emissions, irregardless of who actually emitted them. Equity, on the
&gt; other hand, is solely determined by the initial allocation of permits.
&gt; This separation of efficiency and equity can be a mixed blessing,
&gt; however, as equity issues tend to be highly controversial and
&gt; efficiency can suffer if no equitable distribution can be agreed upon
&gt; under a given cap. These issues are particularly important in the
&gt; context of developing an international tradable permit system.

&gt; Tradable permit systems also tend to lack a continuing incentive for
&gt; abatement. Under a permit system, firms will reduce overall emissions
&gt; to the point at which the total emissions of all firms is equal to the
&gt; cap, but there is little systemic incentive incentive to make further
&gt; reductions even if abatement costs prove lower than anticipated. The
&gt; only way to achieve additional reductions is to reduce the total
&gt; amount of permits in the system. This can be accomplished in two ways:
&gt; either the government can reduce the emission allowance of all permits
&gt; by a constant amount, or they can buy up permits from the market to
&gt; remove them from circulation. The prior option could potentially wreck
&gt; havoc on the market in the absence of a fixed schedule of reductions
&gt; decided at the time of policy formation. As the recent experience of
&gt; the European Trading System demonstrates, if people are uncertain what
&gt; the value of permits will be in the future, changes in permit
&gt; allocations can lead to dramatic spikes or drops in the market price
&gt; of permits (Sterner and Muller 2006). However, creating certainty in
&gt; the permit market limits the ability of the government to tighten
&gt; permit allocations in the future in response to new scientific
&gt; developments that clarify the social cost of carbon. The second
&gt; option, buying up permits, may result in an unacceptable transfer of
&gt; wealth from the government to firms, especially if initial permit
&gt; distributions were grandfathered rather than auctioned. Additionally,
&gt; the announcement of a large government buy up of permits could lead to
&gt; a spike in permit prices and potential windfall profits to firms and
&gt; traders.

&gt; Finally, international trade in permits poses potential compliance
&gt; issues. Countries initially allocated excess permits will have an
&gt; incentive to sell their permits at the onset and later withdraw from
&gt; the treaty when emission restrictions start to impose an economic
&gt; burden. In the absence of trade sanctions on countries that withdraw
&gt; from the treaty, which would prove problematic under international
&gt; trade law, non-compliance may pose a huge problem. One way around this
&gt; may be what David Victor calls &quot;buyer liability&quot; (2001: 69-74). In a
&gt; buyer liability system, a permit becomes void if the initial issuer
&gt; defaults on their treaty obligations. Thus all permits in the market
&gt; would be explicitly priced based on the
