Hey folks,

A friend sent this to me after I hadn't seen him in about 10 years, and he
was set back a bit by the troubles I was having. I don't know if it's to
show never give up hope or someone's always worse off. It's depressing, I'll
warn you of that, but just by passing it on, it shows the smallest, most
feeble of us, can make a difference with just words. I do try poetry on
occasion, but this is not one of mine. I'll try a Goat original out on you
someday.

Take care--og

CRABBY  OLD MAN

When  an old man died in the geriatric ward of a small hospital near
Tampa ,  Florida , it was believed that he had nothing  left of any value.

Later, when the nurses were going through his meager  possessions, They
found  this poem. Its quality and  content so impressed the staff that
copies were  made and distributed to every  nurse in the hospital.

One nurse took her copy to Missouri . The old man's sole bequest to
posterity  has since appeared in the Christmas edition of the News
Magazine of  the St.  Louis  Association for Mental Health.  A slide
presentation has also been made
based on his simple, but eloquent, poem.

And this little old man, with  nothing left to give to the world, is now
the  author of this &quot; anonymous&quot; poem  winging across the Internet.

Crabby Old Man

What do you see  nurses? ...What do you see?
What are you thinking.....when you're looking at  me?
A crabby old man, ...not very wise,
Uncertain of habit ........with faraway eyes?

Who  dribbles his food.......and makes no reply.
When you say in a loud  voice.....&quot;I do wish you'd try!&quot;
Who seems not to notice ...the things that  you do.
And forever is losing .......... A sock or shoe?

Who, resisting or not...........lets  you do as you will,
With bathing and feeding ....  The long day to fill?
Is that what you're  thinking?   Is that what you see?
Then open your eyes,  nurse......you're not looking at me.

I'll tell you who I am .......... As I sit here so still,
As I do at your  bidding, .....as I eat at your will.
I'm a small  child of Ten.......with a father and mother,
Brothers and sisters  .........who love one another

A young boy of Sixteen ..with wings on his  feet
Dreaming that soon now. .......a lover he'll  meet.
A groom soon at Twenty ......my heart gives a  leap.
Remembering, the vows......that I promised to keep.

At  Twenty-Five, now .......... I have young of my  own.
Who need me to guide .... And  a secure happy home.
A man of Thirty  ......... My young now grown fast,
Bound to each other ........ With ties that should last.

At Forty, my young sons ...have grown and are gone,
But my  woman's beside me.......to see I don't mourn.
At Fifty, once more, ......... Babies play 'round  my knee,
Again, we know children ....... My loved one and me.

Dark days are upon me ............... My wife is now dead.
I look at the  future ...............I shudder with dread.
For my young are all  rearing......young of their own.
And I think of the years....... And the love that I've known.

I'm now an old  man.........and nature is cruel.
Tis jest to make  old age ......look like a fool.
The body, it crumbles..........grace and  vigor, depart.
There is now a stone........where I once had a  heart.

But inside this old carcass ...... A  young guy still dwells,
And now and again .......my battered heart swells
I remember the joys........... I remember the pain.
And I'm loving and living.............life over again.

I think  of the years ..all too few......gone too fast.
And accept the stark  fact........that nothing can last.
So open your eyes, people ..........open  and see..
Not a crabby old man.  Look  closer....see........ME!!

Remember this poem when you next meet an older  person who you might brush
aside without looking at the young soul within.....we  will all, one day,
be  there, too!

hi og - this one comes up sooner or later in all the geri, palliative,
or home care trainings

whatever the provenance, it's a keeper

i first read it titled 'kate'

originally attributed to be about a scottish female patient, and poss.
written by nurse phyllis mccormack back in the 60's

there is a companion piece:

Mattie's Poem A Nurses reply  - - by Liz Hogben

What do we see, you ask, what do we see?
Yes, we are thinking when looking at thee
We may seem to be hard when we hurry and fuss
But there's many of you and too few of us.

We would like far more time to sit by you and talk
To bath you and feed you and help you to walk
To hear of your lives and the things you have done
Your childhood, your husband, your daughter, your son.

But time is against us, there's too much to do -
Patients too many and nurses too few
We grieve when we see you so sad and alone
With nobody near you, no friends of your own
We feel all your pain, and know of your fear
That nobody cares now your end is so near.

But nurses are people with feelings as well
And when we're together you'll often hear tell
Of the dearest old Gran in the very end bed
And the lovely old Dad and the things that he said
We speak with compassion and love, and feel sad
When we think of your lives and the joy that you've had.

When the time has arrived for you to depart
You leave us behind with an ache in our heart
When you sleep the long sleep, no more worry or care
There are other people, and we must be there
So please understand if we hurry and fuss
There are many of you and too few of us!!

Liz Hogben

Dear Paul,

Thanks for that reply poem, though poem or ode or any other word, falls far
short of the feelings that both evoke. I've tried a little writing of such
myself, but it all way short of either of these and even darker if you can
imagine such feelings (and I'm sure you can).
It's just disturbing, that while you can't control the number of full
hospital beds but if hospitals managed their funds better (you know what I
mean, around here, shutting down DC General and P.G.county hospitals is some
of the dumbest stuff I ever saw), and when they get down to the bottom line
it's all going to be revealed as golden parachutes and graft. It only leaves
like 1/4 of the city without hospital care. If they had only closed one they
could have relocated the staff to the other and fixed the shortcomings in
staffing problems at the one left open. Only in DC (the area, too) could
they show such a flair for incompetence.
What else can you expect when the bigwig law makers all go to Bethesda Naval
hospital by helicopter, even for a routine thing, like having a tube shoved
up your butt?
Bet you there's no shortage of nursing staff there.

Take care--og

&gt; Tis jest to make  old age ......look like a fool.
&gt; The body, it crumbles..........grace and  vigor, depart.
&gt; There is now a stone........where I once had a  heart.

&gt; But inside this old carcass ...... A  young guy still dwells,
&gt; And now and again .......my battered heart swells
&gt; I remember the joys........... I remember the pain.
&gt; And I'm loving and living.............life over again.

&gt; I think  of the years ..all too few......gone too fast.
&gt; And accept the stark  fact........that nothing can last.
&gt; So open your eyes, people ..........open  and see..
&gt; Not a crabby old man.  Look  closer....see........ME!!

&gt; Remember this poem when you next meet an older  person who you might
&gt; brush aside without looking at the young soul within.....we  will
&gt; all, one day, be  there, too!

&gt; Hey folks,

&gt; A friend sent this to me after I hadn't seen him in about 10 years, and he
&gt; was set back a bit by the troubles I was having. I don't know if it's to
&gt; show never give up hope or someone's always worse off. It's depressing, I'll
&gt; warn you of that, but just by passing it on, it shows the smallest, most
&gt; feeble of us, can make a difference with just words. I do try poetry on
&gt; occasion, but this is not one of mine. I'll try a Goat original out on you
&gt; someday.

&gt; Take care--og

&gt; CRABBY  OLD MAN

&gt; When  an old man died in the geriatric ward of a small hospital near
&gt; Tampa ,  Florida , it was believed that he had nothing  left of any value.

&gt; Later, when the nurses were going through his meager  possessions, They
&gt; found  this poem. Its quality and  content so impressed the staff that
&gt; copies were  made and distributed to every  nurse in the hospital.

&gt; One nurse took her copy to Missouri . The old man's sole bequest to
&gt; posterity  has since appeared in the Christmas edition of the News
&gt; Magazine of  the St.  Louis  Association for Mental Health.  A slide
&gt; presentation has also been made
&gt; based on his simple, but eloquent, poem.

&gt; And this little old man, with  nothing left to give to the world, is now
&gt; the  author of this &quot; anonymous&quot; poem  winging across the Internet.

&gt; Crabby Old Man

&gt; What do you see  nurses? ...What do you see?
&gt; What are you thinking.....when you're looking at  me?
&gt; A crabby old man, ...not very wise,
&gt; Uncertain of habit ........with faraway eyes?

&gt; Who  dribbles his food.......and makes no reply.
&gt; When you say in a loud  voice.....&quot;I do wish you'd try!&quot;
&gt; Who seems not to notice ...the things that  you do.
&gt; And forever is losing .......... A sock or shoe?

&gt; Who, resisting or not...........lets  you do as you will,
&gt; With bathing and feeding ....  The long day to fill?
&gt; Is that what you're  thinking?   Is that what you see?
&gt; Then open your eyes,  nurse......you're not looking at me.

&gt; I'll tell you who I am .......... As I sit here so still,
&gt; As I do at your  bidding, .....as I eat at your will.
&gt; I'm a small  child of Ten.......with a father and mother,
&gt; Brothers and sisters  .........who love one another

&gt; A young boy of Sixteen ..with wings on his  feet
&gt; Dreaming that soon now. .......a lover he'll  meet.
&gt; A groom soon at Twenty ......my heart gives a  leap.
&gt; Remembering, the vows......that I promised to keep.

&gt; At  Twenty-Five, now .......... I have young of my  own.
&gt; Who need me to guide .... And  a secure happy home.
&gt; A man of Thirty  ......... My young now grown fast,
&gt; Bound to each other ........ With ties that should last.

&gt; At Forty, my young sons ...have grown and are gone,
&gt; But my  woman's beside me.......to see I don't mourn.
&gt; At Fifty, once more, ......... Babies play 'round  my knee,
&gt; Again, we know children ....... My loved one and me.

&gt; Dark days are upon me ............... My wife is now dead.
&gt; I look at the  future ...............I shudder with dread.
&gt; For my young are all  rearing......young of their own.
&gt; And I think of the years....... And the love that I've known.

&gt; I'm now an old  man.........and nature is cruel.
&gt; Tis jest to make  old age ......look like a fool.
&gt; The body, it crumbles..........grace and  vigor, depart.
&gt; There is now a stone........where I once had a  heart.

&gt; But inside this old carcass ...... A  young guy still dwells,
&gt; And now and again .......my battered heart swells
&gt; I remember the joys........... I remember the pain.
&gt; And I'm loving and living.............life over again.

&gt; I think  of the years ..all too few......gone too fast.
&gt; And accept the stark  fact........that nothing can last.
&gt; So open your eyes, people ..........open  and see..
&gt; Not a crabby old man.  Look  closer....see........ME!!

&gt; Remember this poem when you next meet an older  person who you might brush
&gt; aside without looking at the young soul within.....we  will all, one day,
&gt; be  there, too!

I think
Hawaiian Wayne  said it right it also took my breath away and gave me
some new out looks on how I live my daily life I have wasted so much
time 55 now and at a crosswalk in my life but i think after reading
this poem the road i choose will be different than the one I had
planned.
god bless all

happy thoughts:):)
