The U.S. invaded Iraq to overthrow its government. It did so, and has now installed (appointed) its very own government in its place, which is now ostensibly the "sovereign" government of Iraq. So why hasn't the U.S. signed a peace treaty with the Iraqi government? I admit there is still a "war" of sorts going on, but the U.S. defines it as either terrorism (with no defined purpose), or as an insurgency against the appointed Iraqi government, since U.S. troops are no longer "occupying" the country (according to the U.S.) but merely there to "assist" the Iraqi government in "suppressing civil unrest." So how can they justify not signing a peace treaty? Perhaps they can't sign a peace treaty because they never declared war?

Just my thought for the day to keep you busy while I'm gone.

Because of the way the invasion was done, there was never a thought put to getting a surrender or a peace treaty. Invasion melded into occupation; it was hard to tell the difference, and no one would have known where one ended and the other began if Bush hadn't made his trip to the USS Abraham Lincoln.

Without a surrender, the occupation never had a patina of legitimacy--the coalition force very easily took the place of the old regime in the minds of the Iraqi people.

A surrender may not have been enough to save the effort, but overlooking the importance of that and/or a peace treaty is just another example of the extraordinary bungling of all this.

We should allow The World Criminal Court to determine if there was a valid declaration of war

and, if the declaration was valid, we should allow the world court to rule on the accuracy of the declared reasons for the war

By these two standards, George Bush will end up in a cage

If we can try Saddam for war crimes, then we have to try George too

OT, but go, Fidel! (via Reuters )

"Let's hope, in Cuba's case, God does not instruct Mr. Bush to attack our country," Castro said. "He had better check on any divine belligerent order by consulting the Pope." ...

Castro, who will be 78 on August 13, looked cheerful in his trademark olive-green military fatigues as he handed out awards for revolutionary excellence before his speech at a university theater in Santa Clara
