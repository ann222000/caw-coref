oh darn. i wish i coulda seen knocked up. i really liked the movies i
went to see with Paul. but i didn't love him, you know, that way,
because of Bob, and now that i have the computer, i think maybe i am
set for life...?

hey, maybe it'll come out on cable! :) (i'll have to be in the mood,
but...hopefully i will be...maybe i'll get stoned first. i'm gonna try
and get a legal prescription for pot. oh g-d, all the different kinds
of marijuana they sell are SOOOOOO different. i mean, sweet nightmare
really was a NIGHTMARE. the worst pot EVER. but &quot;GOD' was really fun.
Totally made me happy. Not STONED happy, just, happy happy. :)

thanks Babs. :)

I really enjoyed Black Book.  Although it's pretty cliched, it's very
watchable and quite touching.  Lots of wartime intrigue and sexy
bits.  Would make a good choice for you two to watch with a bottle of
Cabernet Sauvignon on your first night together after poisoned rose

Black Snake Moan
Talk about a flick with balls!!
It's rooted in the blues, too. A big plus for me.
By the same folks who did Hustle and Flow.

Paris Je Tiem (might've spelled that wrong)
20 individual love stories, all 5 minutes all taking place in various
neighborhoods in Paris. Sweet little movie.

Thompson again.&gt;

He was entertaining, but Billy Connolly stole the show. 'Shooter' was
good, though it strayed quite far from Hunter's novel. And yes, Levon
Helm's role, though small, was well done. 'Seraphim Falls' was a treat
in that it had Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan in a good old fashioned
revenge tale.

I can identify with your problem with Timberlake, but I thought he held
held his own as an actor--though I will say that I though he did the
weakest job in the cast.
I watched the
director's comments on the DVD and learned he cast Justin because
he's a small town Tennesee boy, and Justin wanted the part of the maligned
boyfriend/failed soldier boy. There's one scene in a bar, after the Justin
character is kicked out of the Army that's filmed in his hometown.
It's some funky place. I will continue to avoid the &quot;musician&quot; Timberlake
like the proverbial plague, but he didn't ruin the movie for me and I
doubt he will for you.

&gt; should have been a widescreen satire about the music biz's

&gt; Interspersed with nightclub performance scenes which just made my

&gt; down the actors with &quot;stage sweat&quot; before each take.

&gt; Also, the music was wrong. The film was supposed to take place in

Poisoned Rose,
Thanks for that PS, PR. I hate it when something that might have been
is infinitely better than what is. So many great plans are executed
poorly. I think I might see this anyway, though, given my penchant for
movies about twins  -- conjoined or otherwise. (I was captivated by
David Cronenberg's &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; starring Jeremy
Irons as identical twin gynecologists. Well, maybe captivated isn't
the right word, but the movie left a lasting impression.) But I won't
blame you if it smells of Limburger. You're off the proverbial hook.

&gt; Odd penchant...you're not a twin yourself, are you?

&gt; Have you seen &quot;The Other&quot; ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069050/)?

I'm not a twin myself, but I do seem to gravitate toward them.
Haven't seen &quot;The Other&quot;, but I enjoyed Tryon's novel. I grew up on
old movies, and two twin-themed films that stand out in my mind are
&quot;The Dark Mirror&quot; with Olivia De Havilland and &quot;Stolen Life&quot; with
Bette Davis. Twin stories are such good vehicles for exaggerating the
good vs. evil theme. Doppelgangers can be pretty cool too.

&gt; Two great old movies I saw on TCM this weekend: &quot;Curse of the Demon&quot;

&gt; a wider age gap between &quot;Mulder/skeptic&quot; and &quot;Scully/believer.&quot;
&gt; Great tale of Egyptian witchcraft and demons, with one of the most
&gt; memorable movie-monsters I've ever seen. Especially for a film which

That second name is what was given when I looked up the director,
Jacques Tourneur, who directed the original &quot;Cat People&quot; -- heads

Could you picture a younger Bob Dylan playing the protagonist? I think
he does well with this sort of humor. His little &quot;walk&quot; in &quot;Masked And
Anonymous&quot; had me on the floor.

&lt; Yet
the use of anthemic, proletariat-esque &quot;songs&quot; sung by masses of

All riiiight!

&lt; Seems years ahead of its time -- it made me think of

&gt; early Woody Allen stuff like &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; and &quot;Bananas&quot;

Two of my favorite scenes in a comedy are in &quot;Take The Money And Run&quot;
-- the scene in which the gun made of soap melts in the rain and the
chain gang scene.

Not yet. In my mind I'm picturing a younger  Dylan in the role though
-- from
your descriptions and my imagination. I don't have TMC, and of course
Blockbuster had neither film on their computer. I didn't really expect
they would, but I had hoped. I'll see it though. I'm certain of that
much. Guess I could have answered &quot;Reason enough for me to want to see
this soon.&quot;  ;-)

May I please ask...which walk are you referring to?

&gt; Well, it's more like a Buster Keaton role but, sure, I suppose the
&gt; young Dylan is a similar physical type.

This sounds so good to me. I bet Dylan could have done a  Buster
Keaton role at one time. Now, I see him as Charlie Chaplin. Someone
mentioned that to me once, and now I have that image ensconced in my
cranium. And I know I'm not the only one who thought his &quot;walk&quot; in
&quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; was Chaplin-
like.

&gt; I was really happy that I made a spontaneous choice to watch it the

Good. I'm a big fan of spontaneity! And it's such a good feeling when
the spontaneity pays off, as it so clearly did with this movie. Maybe
I can track it
down at Kim's video. I've been resisting Netflix, even though people
rave about it.

By any chance, do you have a cd called &quot;The X-Files: Songs in The Key
Of X&quot;? (Costello has one on there. &quot;My Dark Life&quot;) Interesting
concept. Bought it on a whim a while back.

&gt; Yeah, I have that. Though one day, I'll probably save a few isolated

LOL. Used copies are going for a penny at Amazon.

I'm trying to figure out what drew me to this -- other than the fact I
watched
The X- Files. Probably the Burroughs-R.E.M. track. Maybe if we hang on
to our copies for another 20 years, we'll do okay in a selling
situation. The cd was a bit of a disappointment, but selling for a
penny now seems a bit harsh.

&gt; Two great old movies I saw on TCM this weekend:

&quot;Night of the Demon&quot;
&quot;A Nous la Liberte&quot;

Ordered both from Amazon yesterday. With &quot;A Nous La Liberte&quot;, I had a
choice of the 1931 original on VHS or the 1950 reissue on DVD, with
several scenes deleted but with quite a few extras -- including the
two deleted scenes. There's also Clair's 1924 short film called
&quot;Entr'acte&quot;, as well as an interview and even an audio bit on the
plagarism lawsuit over Chaplin's &quot;Modern Times&quot;. I chose the DVD.
