My metal show went well. My rig was more then enough to handle the
requirements. The promoter paid everyone on the dot, the kids had fun, and
the bands were appreciative. My associate provided a loader who doubled as
security for us. There were no hassles from the venue management. I may even
be doing some polka sound for them. A friend wandered by and offered the use
of his massive power distro.
The show started on time and ended on time. I even located an active DI box
that had been eluding me for weeks.

Every single vocalist cupped the mic which made it all muffled. I theorize
that one benefit may be that they don't break their teeth as they thrash
around up there. I picked the OM-7 for this but I suspect any dynamic mic in
my kit would have worked as well.

My earplugs were in all night. The levels at the mixer were not louder then
a typical rock or country show that I do.

The bass players managed to achive a universally distorted sound, even with
a DI box. I tried a compressor on insert but it sounded the same if not
worse.

My associate brought a bag of oranges which he uses to get the attention of
anyone who is causing mischief. No orange projectiles were employed for this
show.

It's back to country music for me this weekend with great vocals, a steady
drummer, Â a happy crowd, friendly bartenders and the oranges go in mixed
drinks.
