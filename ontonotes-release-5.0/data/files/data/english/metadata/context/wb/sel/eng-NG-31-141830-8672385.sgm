Oh Ron, I'd like to think I have another two or three decades left in  me!  I
am sorry to be so long winded but I have to ask why you are happy  with the
philosophy or mentality of the Albany movement as opposed to the  Birmingham
movement?

Before Rosa Parks was another young black woman who got arrested  on a
Birmingham bus  However, her past had  a backlash.

&quot; By 1955, the Women's Political Council  had plans for just such a boycott.
Community leaders were just waiting for the  right person to be arrested, a
person who would anger the black community into  action, who would agree to test
the segregation laws in court, and who, most  importantly, was &quot;above
reproach.&quot; When fifteen year old Claudette Colvin was  arrested early in 1955 for
refusing to give up her seat, E.D. Nixon of the NAACP  thought he had found the
perfect person, but Colvin turned out to be pregnant.  Nixon later explained,
&quot;I had to be sure that I had somebody I could win  with.&quot;

You will remain in Albany mentality as long as all you want is  bodies.  It
is a known fact that some you consort with have been founded of  harming their
children.  You are asking us to look beyond that and just  join in.  I am only
suggesting that perhaps, with the correct people, you  could become
Birmingham. It may be a slower start but when you include  reputable people, and
disassociate those that can bring down your efforts, then  you will pass the public
scrutiny and ignite the court of public opinion.

Dear Ron,

Again, with the utmost regard, I don't think you are recapping how the  Civil
Rights Act came into existence.

It is well documented that in the state of Alabama, a bus boycott was  what
gripped the attention of the world.  One person, Rosa Parks (an  educated
seamstress who was involved with the NAACP) refused to give up her  seat and was
arrested is what spurred Jo Ann Robinson, idea of a bus  boycott.  That enticed
Ed Dixon, Ralph David Abernathy and Dr. Martin  Luther King to begin the bus
boycott protests.  So, a lone person in  one state is what put the spotlight
and began the momentum behind the final  pinnacle for the Civil Rights Movement.
Why? well, I think that the  bus boycott eventually had the economic effect
against the Montgomery Bus  Company (a state established business) and it
forced them to accept  unsegregated bus seating.

Now the importance of having different people doing their ideas on  different
levels is shown by the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court  ruling.
We need intelligent, dedicated attorneys working on the judicial branch  to
advance these cases.

The Federal Government is unable to regulate the state laws unless they  are
unconstitutional.  It is clear from this ruling Santosky v. Kramer  (No.
80-5889) that the due process rights of parents which are given to  parents via the
Fourteenth Amendment ensure that severing parental rights  requires a
standard of &quot;clear and convincing.&quot;  Do you know how many  parental termination
decisions that I read that quote this case?

In re Adoption of T.A.M., 2004 WL 1085228, at *3 (footnote  omitted).
In Dep't of Children's Servs. v. D.G.S.L., this Court discussed  the relevant
burden of proof in cases involving termination of parental  rights.
Specifically, we observed:

It is well established that “parents have a fundamental right to  the
care, custody, and control of their children.” In re Drinnon,  776
S.W.2d 96, 97 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988) (citing Stanley v. Illinois,  405
U.S. 645, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972)). &quot;However, this
right is not absolute and parental rights  may be terminated if there is
clear and convincing evidence justifying  such termination under the
applicable statute.&quot; Id. (citing Santosky v.  Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102
S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599  (1982)).

The involvement of Federal government to  intervene in  state matters is
prohibited by the Tenth Amendment of the Bill of  Rights unless it is shown that
actions are unconstitutional.

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,  nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved for the States  respectively, or to
the people.

What better place to show that than in the judiciary?  I think,  Ron, what
you are looking for is something akin to a Congressional  investigation.
However, how will you show the violations?  I've  spoken with many others before
that the problem of accountability is not on  the surface to expose.  While
parents are quietly raped of their  rights, on the surface, every i is dotted and t
is crossed by state process  to show how they follow Title XX to receive the
funds.  It is the  parent who must protect that right, individually in each
instance of  intervention by the government - much like the bus boycott because
each time  they withdraw, they won't get to use Title V funding streams for
that family  or their children.  A slow process but one that can be effective.
In order to do that, we have to TRAIN parents how to respond to these
interventions.

The other caveat is that if they don't follow the guidelines to receive  the
funds, they can just not take them.  In fact, I recall there are  one or two
states who do not take the CAPTA funding stream.  So, in  effect, the federal
legislation safety plug (or they will say it is) is that  it is
self-correcting.  In other words, if a state doesn't follow the  guideline, they don't get
the money.  The Federal government will say  that is enough of a safety valve.

Remember that even though the Jim Crow era were shattered, in 1954  with
school desegregation, the southern states who did not recognize it  still used the
black code and other state laws until the passage ten  years later of the
Civil Rights Act.  So, states do have the power to  handle their business as they
see fit until the unconstitutionality of the  provision can overstep the
state law.

So having a rally stating that parental rights a fundamental and cannot  be
pierced by the camel's nose in the tent would be rebutted by federal
legislators ah yes, indeed that is true, however, if the state has a  compelling
interest, they can intervene because the constitutional rights of  children to be
protected from harm is a countervailing right.

What are your plans to economically impinge state's child protection
business enough so that they are willing to flex in the way they handle  child abuse
and neglect issues?

Dear Ron,

I understand that you don't want to be in charge of anything.  I guess  my
point is not apparent.

I am questioning the past and present habit of conglomerating everyone in a
cake mix type of approach.  I think the cake will fall before you are  done.

Your &quot;all you need is love&quot; prescription or a cause has been tried again  and
again with the same results. I got on these boards in 1998 and have watched
this train wreck over and over again.  I am not saying there won't be
differences of opinion that are respected.  I am saying that the central  point,
focus, mission, ideology, philosophy that you build your movement upon  must be
very pure, very clear and the only glue that keeps the wandering people
connected.  With what you've proposed thus far, that isn't what is  happening.

I am beseeching you to go back to the drawing board and rethink your  plan.
If it is truly just for fathers, then be up front and go for  it.  This horrid
idea of trying to mix these two divergent units of  parental rings and
father's rights is just a very bad mix.  I've said in  the past, the use of PAS is
consecrated on the ideology that one of the parents  must be found unfit
turning all of your sovereign parental rights over to  a judge.  These are the types
of actions parental right movers and  shakers are trying to minimize.

The reason why child protection works in our country is because they have
the unity of their mission.  The blue wall of protection from the police to  the
case worker to the judge is all sealed in qualified or absolute  immunity.
What you are trying to construct will be easily dismantled, as  it has been in
the past attempts with cps divide and conquer actions.

My plea to you is to become more creative.  If you truly want to this
movement move forward, you need to come up with ways you can avoid the  process.
That, in and of itself would be a BIRMINGHAM BUS BOYCOTT  magnitude of financial
strain on the family courts.

If the Christian Community of Homeschooling felt their rights were violated
in the schools and they came up with a privatized version of school, then why
can't you come up with a model for privatized mediation that has nothing to
do  with the state agents or its parasitical feeders?  Why can't two divorcing
people go to a privately hired mediator (and if you're poor - a grant
supported  mediation corporation) and hammer out the agreements, sign the agreements
and  only have the judge in a court rubber stamp that final decree?  What if
the  persons who used that private mediation signed a contract with the
stipulation  that they could not use CPS agents, the courts, etc., to intervene in
what was  agreed upon in this mediation.  That custody disputes had to be worked
out  and tried for a trial period before the final dissolution agreement
could be  completed.  I see a lot of grant money for you in doing such a thing and
your corporation could be the paradigm that would begin nationwide to set
these  in place.  The caveat, no CPS type of tricks, no PAS, no he is a victim
or  she is a victim type of issues clouding the purpose which is to mediate an
agreement that is settled and final.  Of course, in the exigent situations
where someone's life is at stake, this type of paradigm couldn't and wouldn't
work.

Now, the largest proponent of the &quot;gospel of love&quot; besides Christ was St.
Paul who has it in Corinthians 1:13.  However, St. Paul was very clear that  you
include anyone that will live up to the ethical, moral and spiritual ideals
of the church because you represent Christ.  This is a very hard hurdle for
me to overcome.  Please show me one all inclusive social movement   that has
succeeded with your philosophy that there just be noise.  While  the squeaky
wheel gets the oil, it also must have credibility to stay alive in  the public
spotlight.  The world if full of critics and when you have  people who have
actually live large lives in the sea of immorality, you have a  big big problem
with credibility.  Here is some reading that may give you a  glimpse of what St.
Paul went through in trying to maintain his inclusion while  never
compromising his ideals.  Now, on a personal note, I apologize to all  of the
non-christian members for any offense you may feel with this post.   effie

Fr John Jillions: Love and Curses. Searching St. Paul  for a Vision of
Christian Unity - Russian Orthodox Church Representation To The  European
Institutions:

Unity and Division in Corinth
We see this twofold approach very clearly, for example, in St. Paul's
dealings with the Corinthians. In First Corinthians he begins with an appeal for
toleration (1:10ff); at the centre of his message is the hymn of love in chapter
13; and he ends the letter to the troubled community with yet another
reminder  to “let all that you do be done in love” (1 Cor 16: 14). As he signs off
we have  a picture of effusive affection : “The churches of Asia send
greetings. Aquilla  and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you
hearty greetings  in the Lord. All the brethren send greetings. Greet one another
with a holy  kiss. I Paul write this greeting with my own hand” (1 Cor
16:19-21). “Maranatha  , our Lord come. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My
love be with you  all in Christ Jesus. Amen” (1 Cor 16:22b-23).
Yet the same  final chapter includes a sober warning: “Be watchful, stand
firm in the faith,  be courageous (lit. be manly), be strong” (1 Cor 16:13). And
then, tucked into  the centre of the warm final greetings comes this lightning
bolt: “If anyone has  no love for the Lord, let him be accursed,” literally “
let him be  anathema” (1 Cor 16:22a). This was not some vague imprecation,
but a technical term (used in the Septuagint to translate the Hebrew herem, the
holy ban) for exclusion from the communion of the church. Nor was this mere
hyperbole: exclusion was precisely what St. Paul had prescribed to be carried
out by the assembly in 1 Cor 5:1-5 (Cf Ezra 10:8).
Love and  anathema are put together in one sentence, without any hint of
embarrassment or  apology. This is inconceivable in the contemporary ecumenical
environment , but  here it is in first century Corinth. “Love for the Lord” is
the double-edged  sword that unites and divides in St. Paul's view of the
church. This strips St. Paul's vision of Christian unity of all  sentimentality.
After this general introduction I would like to focus more specifically on
Corinth to see in greater detail how the issue of unity was handled in
practice.  The lessons of Corinth are remarkably apropos to current debate on the
nature of  unity and authority within the church. But Corinth also brings to the
fore the  positive witness of some Christian division, since the problem there
was not  just disunity, but too much unhealthy unity.
St. Paul in Corinth
St. Paul arrived in Corinth from Athens, probably in the spring of 51 AD
after starting churches--and stirring up beehives-- in Phillipi, Thessaloniki
and Veria (Beroea). We know that he was not averse to provoking division for the
sake of the Gospel, so he left in his wake not only a string of fledgling
Christian churches united in Christ, but also a string of divided, angry
synagogues and had to be spirited away by less provocative pastors like Silas  and
Timothy.
His stay in Corinth began and ended with such divisions (see Acts 18:1-18).
He began with three weeks of preaching in the synagogue, testifying “that the
Christ was Jesus”. Some responded well, but most rejected his message and
opposed him publicly. Paul was exasperated. He had been going first to the Jews
every place he went in Europe, but now he would focus his efforts elsewhere:

And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and  said to
them, 'Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent. From now on I will  go
to the Gentiles.' And he left there and we to the house of a man named Titius
Justus, a worshipper of God; his house was next door to the synagogue.
Crispus,  the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the lord, together with all his
household...(Acts 18: 6-8).
St. Paul did not quietly move to the other end of town: he moved right next
door, and took the synagogue ruler with him! While this is Luke's description,
it fits well with everything we know about St. Paul's willingness to be
divisive  when necessary. Paul himself readily admits, for example, that “when
Cephas came  to Antioch I opposed him to his face” because he and other Jews with
him “were  not straightforward about the truth of the Gospel” (Gal 2:11,
14). St. Peter had  been equivocating--demonstrated by his cowardly behaviour--
on a central aspect  of Christian life, the freedom given by Christ to Gentiles
and Jews, their  emancipation from bondage to the ritual requirements of the
law. St. Paul could  not allow this to go unchallenged (note that Peter's
actions mean as much to St.  Paul as his words: he does not limit his view of
Christian doctrine to words  alone, but draws conclusions about unhealthy belief
on the basis of the actions  he sees).
After 18 months, a group of Jews united to attack St. Paul (omothymadon, lit.
“with one mind,” another example of negative unity) and brought him to
Gallio,  the proconsul, for trial. They were probably charging him with advocating
a  religion that should no longer receive the benefit of Roman laws
protecting the  Jews, but Gallio impatiently dismissed their accusations as mere
internal  wrangling and refused to hear them any further. In the wake of the ensuing
beating of the synagogue ruler Sosthenes (another sympathizer of St. Paul?),
the  apostle left a few days later.
He travelled through Asia Minor for the better part of a year going “from
place to

I will second that. I think that a big part of the problem is that we would accept anyone claiming they could/would help. We were grateful for anyone offering to help because we were so tired of carrying such big loads. I had a huge caseload back in 2003. Then we started finding out some of the people we had been working with were not what they claimed to be and were harming others. Then began damage control and in some instances, escalation and retaliation. We began moving towards only people with verifiable credentials and references. I now won't certify anyone who isn't degreed. I feel I had no choice but to do this in order to protect others. When someone claims to have this certificate or degree, I now ask for the proof. I've found that those who really do have the credentials have no problem providing it immediately. Those who don't have never supplied it, usually with one lame excuse or another.
