Deep-Fried Cheesecake

Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
1                     prepared cheesecake (homemade or bought)
30                    Oriental spring roll wrappers
Egg wash (whisk 1 egg with 1 cup of milk)
Vegetable oil (as needed)
Cinnamon Sugar (as needed, see below)

Cut already-baked cheesecake into uniform pieces approximately 3 x 1-inches
in size. One large cheesecake will produce about 30 slices for deep frying.
Lightly moisten each spring roll wrapper with the egg wash. Blot off excess
egg wash with paper towel.
Place each piece of cheesecake in the middle of a wrapper. Fold top of wrapper
down over the cheesecake, and both sides toward the middle. Roll each piece of
cheesecake toward you until it is completely rolled up. Give this "egg roll"
a gentle squeeze to make sure the dough is sealed completely. Using a deep
frying pan, heat at least 3 inches of oil to 365 F. Dip the corner of one
"egg roll" in the heated oil. If the oil sizzles, it is ready. If not, heat
the oil a little longer. When the oil is ready, gently release "egg rolls" into
the oil and allow to brown lightly, approximately 10 seconds. Using tongs,
remove the golden-brown "egg rolls" from the oil. Place each "egg roll" in a
bowl of cinnamon sugar and coat well. Place deep-fried slices of cheesecake on
paper towels to cool slightly before serving.
CAUTION: These will be very hot. Allow to cool at least 5 minutes before serving.
They can be enjoyed warm or cold.

Cinnamon sugar
2 cups granulated sugar
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
Mix well.
