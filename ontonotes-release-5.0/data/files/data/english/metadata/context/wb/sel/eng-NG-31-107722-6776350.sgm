Please forgive my requests for lovemaking on unorthodox terms.
For I now do realize that my requests have always superceded my
expectations.
Throughout my quest for sexual contentment, at times I have battled
complacency.
Yet, I long for innate intimacy unparallel to prior experiences and
future fantasies.
During which times, I escape reality, inhibit vulnerability, and
ultimately surrender to..the inevitable.
In my daydreams, I am a lotus mixed with the attributes of a
chameleon, dragon, and butterfly.
But to the naked eye, I'm rows of impatiens, climate controlled,
stagnating to unfold, amidst the publics demand to hold, or better
yet, be held onto.
So then, I ask you..
Are you a gardener?
Do you know how to cultivate?
Are you trained to skillfully penetrate delicate cores of fragmented
Ferns,
Sniff/stir/and fascinate,
On the pollen and nectar that resonates,
Within the buds of Zinnias and Marigolds,
Pansies and Lilacs,
Carnations, Petunias, and Morning Glory Vines?,
For the petals of this Daffodil are not as moist as those of the
roses..
So please, keep me watered..
I'm tired of being dry.
And am not too proud to beg,
For succulent sips of your nourishing lips and rays.
Orchids and Opiums are known, after all, for their intoxicating
whiffs...
So get high on my supply.
I beg of you...
For as you will soon see,
Within my outer thorns,
Lies a fragile hidden treasure,
Awaiting to ripen and blossom widely only to and for you.
My petals open so wide,
that often at times,
I shed on mistake.
So I implore you to make an effort,
To germinate me with your love.
Terminate me with your touch.
Fertilize me with your seed/foundation,
Captivate me with your presence.
And celebrate me with your essence.
You are my sunshine.
You are my rain.
You are my air.
Thus, the pathways and sole sources of my existence.
After all,
Its a proven fact, that,
There is no sustitute for mother nature...
And/Or,
Dare I say,
A lover's nurture.
