Just brought myself up to date on news... Warm Vibes to all with bad
weather problems... we are pretty lucky back here in the Old Dominion
[as we are sometimes known since we were the first permanent English
colony of the original 13]... Coco: you are doing great with
photography and I agree with Sue -- you could be teaching and likely
will be with your ability to explain composition, etc.

Deborah: I think the stock market climbed form your group's shopping
extravaganza! Our economy certainly needs some kind of boost!

Med tests are done -- will not have all the results until late Tuesday
afternoon -- I see one Doc on Monday and one on Tuesday... I seem to
be doing better but when you are as tuned to your body as all of us
here are -- you know when  something is not quite 100%...

My car was diagnosed as only a bad battery after extensive electrical
checks... but why was the battery not shown to be bad on the &quot;free
warranty checks&quot; that were shown on the bill to have been done since I
am close to the end of the warranty? Oh well... that is a rhetorical
question so forget about any answers!

Christine: I feel your pain... I have some burdens too as many
retirements deplete our ranks and we try to cope and adjust in the
workplace...

I am back to the mats tonight and then on the road for 2 days... I
will check in sometime over the weekend... Fellow teacher Sandy and I
are doing one of our 90 minute classes co-teaching Yoga on Saturday AM
-- these have been popular -- I call us the &quot;Father/Daughter Could Be
Team&quot; since she is close to the age of my youngest daughter...
Blessings -- and Special Prayers for the People of Tibet if you have
room on your List... received disturbing news today from Richard G&lt;re
and the D@lai L@ma about conditions in Tibet... an ancient and revered
culture and faith tradition is endangered...

I'm happy to report that I didn't break the bank shopping.  Got a few
stocking stuffers, a pair of pants and a top and Wh*te House/Bl*ck
Market (good sale there), and some Satsuma Body Polish at B*dy W*rks.
Need a pick-me-up on a  dreary winter day?  That scent in the shower
does wonders.

I bailed on the shopping about noon and walked the few blocks to see
my daughter; she and I and her best friend/roomie from college ate a
tasty lunch at a local noodle house where the noodles are fresh-made.
That made the entire day for me.

Back to business here; glad the week is half-over.  So much to do in
so little time!

Good morning MT pals.

Coco, I do not have the same weather as BEJ and Janet, I am on the
other side of the mountains and we only get 10 inches of rain a year.
I am in the desert area of the state.  But I feel for them, I lived
over there on that side for quite a while.

Jimmy I am praying for you.  ME I hate cars when it happens that way.
Maybe this is your giving of yourself so when you get the new car you
really will like it. NOt that you wouldn't anyway, like it I mean.  Oh
I think I am lost.  I just hope the car problems are fixed.

I guess I am off. Good thoughts and vibes to all of you dear people.

Swooshing for now. Catch you later. Someone needs to tell ME that it's
Wednesday and not Thursday today. Maybe, she's out shoveling snow. I
hope they didn't lose power.

Ola, girlfriends (including JIMMY!  OK, I'm not too PC).

Well, we found out that we're living with Taz in the morning!  My
gosh, I'm so afraid Scootie is going to hurt herself with her running
and jumping and annoying the bejesus out of the older cats.  At the
same time, she's so funny, we can't help but laugh at her antics!

TD:  I admire your restraint., though I'm not one for shopping.  My
ideal women's department would have a sweater.  If I liked it, I'd buy
it.  As it is, I walk in a store and when I see all the merchandise,
my eyes glaze over and I go catatonic!   Which means that I'm a
terrible gift giver!  So, you guys don't expect anything from me!
LOL.

On a deeper plane:  whatever happened to Peace on Earth?

Taking a class at work today.  I could have tested out but &quot;failed&quot;.
Actually the folks I know who tested out took hours looking up the
answers in books.  I vowed to take the test without the open book.  I
figured if I didn't really know the material I could benefit from the
1 1/2 day class.  So far my instincts were right.  I know most of the
material but am picking up a few tidbits.  I'm also learning from the
class discussions.  I don't understand why some folks are so against
taking a class now and then.  And the sad part, those I know that
tested out could really benefit from the class!  We are all engineers
of sorts and the class has to do with schedules and budget (blech).
So believe me we need the help.

MD - I don't get the same weather as Janet either.  Since we're in the
rainshadow we only get 18 inches of rain.  Drive an hour west and it's
rainforest.  There's no way I could ever live any more west than I
do.  I absolutely love our weather and get a kick out of the storms.

Hi all.  No extreme weather here, unless you consider fog to be
extreme.  Emma is home with a fever today. I had to make scalloped
potatoes for the teacher appreciation luncheon today, so I got up at 5
to do that.  It was very time consuming, so now I know why no one else
signed up for that.  Next time, I'll buy the box of scalloped potatoes
and add hot water!

My husband received orders to go to Korea for a year. It's an
unaccompanied trip, so the kids and I can't go.  We won't be attached
to this base anymore, so I can go anywhere I want.  I have no clue
where to go.  MIL called this morning telling me it's in the kid's
best interest to go to South Carolina because of all of their family.
I hated living there before, so I don't think that'll happen. I was
thinking San Diego, but my husband knocked that down.

BEJ - so happy you get a kick out of the storms!  I could have guessed
that about you.

Jaznmom-they will love the homemade scallops. My aunt used to make
them quicker using a cookie sheets, sliced potatoes (of course) sliced
onions, a little salt and pepper and then spread a medium white sauce
over them and bake them in the oven. It was much quicker to cook them
as a thin layer rather than in a casserole dish as a thick layer. But,
I am sure yours are better.

Hey, I gave in a bought 2 pairs of pants. Getting tired of just
wearing jeans and my one pair of brown velvet pants all the time. So,
I need to hem a couple pairs of pants.

I am babysitting tonight. Hoping to take grandson to toy store as a
neighbor brought over a $10.00 gift card for him for his birthday. I
taped a Shr*k Christm@s show on TV and I think we need to make some
cookies if he feels like baking tonight.

Found out at 6:30 that my Italian sausage dish (my mom's unwritten
recipe) is required for the cycling club's Christmas party this Sat.
The next two days and nights are already booked, so I made a (what
felt like) late run to Nugget and got my ingredients.  The house
smells great but it's too late to sample any of it. It's no good until
about 2 days from now anyway.  Served over fresh Italian rolls with a
tossed green salad and mmm, soooo good.  My mother would make a big
pot of it the week before Christmas, then serve it on Christmas Eve,
when we had a cavalcade of friends, family, neighbors and carolers
come by.  I miss that kind of connection...no family nearby and our
friends are not within walking distance.  Still, having a pot of it
around makes me feel like it's really Christmas.

Which means that a smaller batch lurks in my future.  And a vegan
batch, as well.  How times have changed!

Poo:  On a deeper level, yeah, WTH happened to peace on Earth?

&gt; &gt; Jaznmom-they will love the homemade scallops. My aunt used to make
&gt; &gt; them quicker using a cookie sheets, sliced potatoes (of course) sliced
&gt; &gt; onions, a little salt and pepper and then spread a medium white sauce
&gt; &gt; over them and bake them in the oven. It was much quicker to cook them
&gt; &gt; as a thin layer rather than in a casserole dish as a thick layer. But,
&gt; &gt; I am sure yours are better.

&gt; &gt; Hey, I gave in a bought 2 pairs of pants. Getting tired of just
&gt; &gt; wearing jeans and my one pair of brown velvet pants all the time. So,
&gt; &gt; I need to hem a couple pairs of pants.

&gt; &gt; I am babysitting tonight. Hoping to take grandson to toy store as a
&gt; &gt; neighbor brought over a $10.00 gift card for him for his birthday. I
&gt; &gt; taped a Shr*k Christm@s show on TV and I think we need to make some
&gt; &gt; cookies if he feels like baking tonight.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all.  No extreme weather here, unless you consider fog to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; extreme.  Emma is home with a fever today. I had to make scalloped
&gt; &gt; &gt; potatoes for the teacher appreciation luncheon today, so I got up at 5
&gt; &gt; &gt; to do that.  It was very time consuming, so now I know why no one else
&gt; &gt; &gt; signed up for that.  Next time, I'll buy the box of scalloped potatoes
&gt; &gt; &gt; and add hot water!

&gt; &gt; &gt; My husband received orders to go to Korea for a year. It's an
&gt; &gt; &gt; unaccompanied trip, so the kids and I can't go.  We won't be attached
&gt; &gt; &gt; to this base anymore, so I can go anywhere I want.  I have no clue
&gt; &gt; &gt; where to go.  MIL called this morning telling me it's in the kid's
&gt; &gt; &gt; best interest to go to South Carolina because of all of their family.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hated living there before, so I don't think that'll happen. I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking San Diego, but my husband knocked that down.

&gt; &gt; &gt; BEJ - so happy you get a kick out of the storms!  I could have guessed
&gt; &gt; &gt; that about you.
