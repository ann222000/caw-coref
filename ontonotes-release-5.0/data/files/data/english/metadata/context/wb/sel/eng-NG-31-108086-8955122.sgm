I have had the 1/48 scale Kit for a some time now but have not built it
yet.  I'm wanting to build the ''Gun-Ship'' version that they talked
about using at one time.
It looks like it's really a pretty good Kit.

It also seems that there are a  LOT  of
people on Both Sides that just seem to HATE ths thing.  It's  NOT  a
PLane and it's  NOT  a Helicopter.  Soooo they just HATE it for being
and doing Both tasks.

And I think that it  WTLL  one day I hope Prove that it really Belongs
in the Sky.

All Hail the  ''Shy-Pig''  Long and Far may it Fly.  I think that  it's
really kinda KewL

I think most of the negative press is political.

Admittedly it is unusual for a transport to have the cutting edge
technology that the Osprey has, but it IS new technology.

It certainly has teething problems, but that is inherent in new tech.
Look at how long the F-22 has been in development.  I think when early
teething problems caused a drop in funding, this was detrimental to
getting the bugs out quickly.

The Harrier went through very similar teething problems and IT was
almost cancelled also.

The CH-46 that the opponents want to just keep using is not the most
reliable thing around anymore either.

Another nifty fact about it; although it can't glide land if the engines
quit, like a aircraft...it also can't autorotate land like a helicopter
if the engines quit...so if the engines shut down, you are SOL:

The V-22 has been in development since 1982, and is now actually going
to get operationally deployed, 25 years later.
To give some meaning to that, the B-29 was also a state of the art
pushing program technologically, that was first promulgated in January
of 1940. This program pace means that it would have been ready to bomb
Japan in 1965.
The V-22's development phase was longer than than many of the aircraft
that have served in the U.S. inventory's entire development period and
operational service life.

You want a airplane that could/did NOT glide - the F-104. No way
no how could you consider the &quot;glide slope&quot; of the Starfighter a
&quot;glide&quot;. Still, it was considered fairly successful, and widely
adopted.

Besides - helos don't autorotate below a certain altitude/
airspeed either. I do not see the V-22 being any worse that a
helo in that respect when in hover mode.

The more interesting question is how long are you in that
transition/hover mode, and is the cross shafting of the engines
such that it is more damage resistant that helos are, where the
engines are, by necessity, very close together?

I also expect the V-22 has much better ditching manners than
a helo ever hoped to have.

Has Mitsu given up on their V-22 design, where the entire
wing rotated, unlike the nacells on the V-22?

No, it can't glide in a true sense - it has to &quot;auto-rotate
forward&quot;...what I don't know is how/if the ability to tilt the rotors is
affected if there is a dual engine flameout or a problem with the cross
coupling.

A helo has to maintain forward speed to auto-rotate.  The pilot has to
build enough rotational inertia in the mains to be able to flare into a
somewhat vertical landing before that rotational inertia dissipates as
forward speed bleeds during the flare.

The problem is that you can't land the thing with the rotors tilted, and

No; thirty.  And at least half of those were infantry they stuck in the back

&gt;&gt;       I am sure the V-22 can glide if it is in flight configuration.
&gt;&gt;     You want a airplane that could/did NOT glide - the F-104. No way
&gt;&gt;     no how could you consider the &quot;glide slope&quot; of the Starfighter a
&gt;&gt;     &quot;glide&quot;. Still, it was considered fairly successful, and widely
&gt;&gt;     adopted.

&gt;No, it can't glide in a true sense - it has to &quot;auto-rotate
&gt;forward&quot;...what I don't know is how/if the ability to tilt the rotors is
&gt;affected if there is a dual engine flameout or a problem with the cross
&gt;coupling.

&gt;&gt;       Besides - helos don't autorotate below a certain altitude/
&gt;&gt;     airspeed either. I do not see the V-22 being any worse that a
&gt;&gt;     helo in that respect when in hover mode.

&gt;A helo has to maintain forward speed to auto-rotate.  The pilot has to
&gt;build enough rotational inertia in the mains to be able to flare into a
&gt;somewhat vertical landing before that rotational inertia dissipates as
&gt;forward speed bleeds during the flare.

&gt;&gt;       The more interesting question is how long are you in that
&gt;&gt;     transition/hover mode, and is the cross shafting of the engines
&gt;&gt;     such that it is more damage resistant that helos are, where the
&gt;&gt;     engines are, by necessity, very close together?

&gt;The problem is that you can't land the thing with the rotors tilted, and
&gt;if the cross-shafting is damaged it's all over anyway...engines running
&gt;or not.

&gt;&gt;       I also expect the V-22 has much better ditching manners than
&gt;&gt;     a helo ever hoped to have.

&gt;I seriously doubt that...

&gt;&gt;       Has Mitsu given up on their V-22 design, where the entire
&gt;&gt;     wing rotated, unlike the nacells on the V-22?

Tilt rotor work can be said to have begun in 1953 (or even earlier) with the
XV-3 built by Bell. In the 70s, the Army and NASA sponsored the development
of the XV-15 which can really be thought of as the prototype for the V-22.
So the development period for this aircraft can be 35-55 years, depending
upon what &quot;start date&quot; one chooses.

&gt; The V-22 has been in development since 1982, and is now actually going to

&gt; To give some meaning to that, the B-29 was also a state of the art pushing

&gt; This program pace means that it would have been ready to bomb Japan in

Nobody should die in plane crashes but the fact is they do, especially in
aircraft with new technology.  The only way to prevent deaths is to stop
flying.

An old H-53 pilot/college professor told us he felt that the Marines were
simply not trained or equipped to develop and flight test something like the
Osprey.  IMHO, that is the reason for it's safety record.  As he pointed
out, all those Marines who died in the cabin should have been sandbags.

We had a couple of those also way, way, back:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiller_X-18
http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/c-142.htm
I once talked to a pilot in the Navy aircraft test section (he went way
back to the Tripartite Evaluation Squadron that flew the Kestrels in
competition with the VAK-191)
His story of what happened to the Osprey was this;  the tilting wing
design was much superior to the swiveling engine idea, in that it
increased lifting power by not having the downwash of the prop/rotors
fall on top of the wing, pushing it downward, allowed easy cross
shafting of the engines, and allowed the wing control surfaces be used
in vertical flight for easy control of the vehicle.
But after LTV-Hiller-Ryan couldn't get a production contact for the
XC-142, they sold the swiveling-wing patent to Canadair, as they were
working on a VTOL cargo plane idea also:
http://www.exn.ca/FlightDeck/Aircraft/Milestones/cl84.cfm
When it came time to compete for the V-22 contract, an attempt was made
to buy back the patent from Canadair, but they realized  how important
it was, and quoted a sky-high figure for it.
Since the Bell XV-15 had proven successful during tests:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_XV-15
The  V-22 had its design based on it.
Unfortunately, the XV-15 didn't need to have a wing that would rotate 90
degrees to lay on top of the fuselage, a folding tail, or blades on its
rotors that could be folded for storage; all of which were needed for
compact storage on a helicopter carrier, and the ability to fit on its
elevators.
So something simple turned into something very complex, and we've been
paying the price for it ever since.
What the test pilot was really torqued off about was the cancellation of
the A-12 Avenger II; he had done a lot of work on that program, and said
that it would have been a great aircraft...but with the end of the Cold
War the Navy wanted to put funds elsewhere and screwed over
McDonnell-Douglas and General Dynamics to free up funds for other
projects by claiming the plane was no good.
He was getting very close to retirement, so felt he could get away with
saying stuff like that.
The reason he was at the airshow was to see one of the first appearances
of the MiG-29 in America and see what he thought of it from a trained
test pilot's perspective, so as to figure out what its potential was in
air-to-air combat.
He flew in in a TA-4J with a new Navy pilot; the kid was so awed by this
guy that he was almost strewing rose petals in front of him when he
walked. I think his having served three combat tours in Vietnam as a
Skyhawk pilot and returning to the carrier on more than one occasion
with his aircraft so shot up it had to be scrapped probably helped. :-)

The only guarantee you can be sure of in an aerocraft is
that it WILL return to earth at some point in the future.

At other times, there just does not exist a market for the
aerocraft after all - re Beechcraft Starship. Leading edge design,
but too expensive and perhaps too ahead of its time.

Yes - but when you figure the ability to tilt the rotors I'm not really
certain what &quot;auto-rotate&quot; actually means for V-22.  Any component of
tilt robs from the lift vector, and so the optimum auto-rotation tilt
should be 0 or 90 degrees...however they measure it wrt vertical.

The possibilities for failure modes are far more numerous compared to a
standard helo...have no idea how they drive the tilt - hyd, electric,
pneumatic...or what systems there are to fail, or cascade failures.
Only know I've seen film of what happens when the thing gets squirrelly
in ground effect - it ain't pretty.

Mostly it's a matter of forward speed, and maintaining blade rotational
energy.  Altitude has little to do with it other than determining how
fast you need to get the thing down - gross weight at time of failure is
a bigger concern.  The trick it to save enough rotational energy to
convert forward speed to vertical lift somewhere near impact...er,
touchdown.

Thats pretty obvious, if you've ever seen one in operation...as I have.
The rotor radius simply grossly exceeds the height of the rotors from
the ground.  Given that the aircraft will need to pitch down to maintain
forward speed, I'd say the rotors couldn't be tilted much more than
about 5 degrees without running the risk of a blade strike during a
flared landing.  And again, the specific mode of failure is a critical
factor.

Harriers, OTOH, are something I know a great deal about.  They don't

catastrophic...you either elect to eject, or to do a conventional

to VL, you don't have an engine emergency...and even then, you will be
limited by temperature, gross weight, or a combination of the two
determining if you have the margin to VL - just like a helo's ability to
hover is limited.  Source of info: NATOPS.

than any other twin-rotored helo, and that helos have far more severe
ditching characteristics than any fixed wing aircraft - BECAUSE of that
high CG you cite...they impact, and then turn upside down in the water.
That's a fact, and what aviators train to expect.  I stand by my
statement.

The Starship was discontinued because the structural aging of composites
was/is not fully understood, and Beech wasn't inclined to assume the
financial risk of being liable if one came apart in the air.

All Starships were leased, not sold - and so Beech simply took them all
back and destroyed them.  All but one - which belongs to Burt Rutan, who
had a hand in the design.  His is the only one left flying - I'll ask
him about it if I run into him again...I get to about once every few

The V-22 might have its problems, but a Time magazine article should
have no influence whatsoever on one's opinions of the merits of a new
weapons system.

Mainstream media bias against any and all new weapons systems goes
back more than 50 years and is remarkably consistent.  The list of
weapons systems once criticized as too expensive, too dangerous, too
heavy, too big, too fast, too slow, or that allegedly just wouldn't
work includes (but is not limited to) the B-52, B-1, B-2, F-14, F-15,
F/A-18, F-22, F-111, C-17, AH-64, M-1, and the Nimitz class aircraft
carrier.  If the mainstream media had made weapons acquisition
decisions over the past 50 years, B-29s, F-86s, and Shermans would now
be fighting in Iraq.

On the other hand, the media (and the Democrats) once loved Rumsfeld's
&quot;light, lean, and lethal&quot; theory of warfare... you know, Humvees with
TOW missiles instead of heavy armor.  That worked real well.

Yes - the APU on a Harrier supplies high pressure air only, and not
electrics like a true APU.

There is still an airstart button on the throttle in a Harrier - the fan
is big enough to keep the engine rotating during engine out forward
flight if you watch your airspeed.  Like with all turbines, you have to
be in a specific speed/altitude box to maximize chances of a successful
relight.

Rufus, if you have been on the 'net for any length of time, you
should understand why it is bad for to argue from authority. If you
are an aeronautical engineer, finding a source that states the V-22
can't glide should be trivial.

The problem we seem to have is that you fundimental view of
the V-22 is that it is a helo, my view is that it is a v/stol
airplane.

A reference I found on the web indicates that the V-22 can
auto-rotate, when in vertical flight configuration, much like a
helo. Sorta. Maybe. When configured with the engines horizontal,
the V-22 can glide. What I have not found is whether the &quot;normal&quot;
aircraft flight controls work when the engines are rotated vertical,
or more than around 45 degrees above the horizontal. That cound
affect the ability of the V-22 to glide to a landing in an engine
failure event.

Since you are a degreed aeronautical engineer, and closely
interested in the V-22, finding references should be trivial.
:

I am well aware that the more complex the system, the more that
can and will go wrong. I am also well aware that duplicating systems
serves to increase the number of things that can go wrong. The real
question is - what is the likelyhood of such an occurance. I deal
with chaos theory (specifically, not knowing your precise entry/start
conditions) every day.

Bunk. The rotars are designed to shear at the hubs. This is as
silly as arguing that prop driver aircraft can't belly land because
the props will hit the ground.

The overriding concern is to get the machine on the ground. Whether
it flies again is not important at the moment.

&gt;&gt; composite fatigue...particularly for a pressure cycled airframe.

&gt;&gt; I used to see one coming into the airport at Vegas from time to time.  I
&gt;&gt; have to assume it's probably Rutan's bird.  They land flat and hot, like
&gt;&gt; most canard configured aircraft.  But they sure are/were neat.

&gt; he the one with his own graveyard?

...interesting.  Our family had it's own graveyard sometime ago.  It was
the subject of a legal dispute with shopping mall expansion some years
back.  Turned out after some extensive research that we'd quit-claim to it.

The aircraft is a real beauty from the aesthetic point of view; but one
wonders if the extrapolation of Rutan's concept of canards/swept rear
wings doesn't really work in high speed aircraft as well as it did in
the VariEze.
With the VariEze, he'd come up with everybody's 1950's dream... a low
priced, very fuel efficient, stall proof private aircraft with a
reasonable turn of speed.
Almost a flying motorcycle or Volkswagen.

He came and gave a lecture for us once, and as I recall that is still
his vision of the future - the ability to commute by air...air-taxi, of
sorts; using small light aircraft as a mode of public transportation
between short distanced hubs or rooftops.

He's a really interesting guy to listen to, and you can just feel that
he's a conceptual thinker far beyond most folks in the room.  But if you
listen to the guy he starts making sense.

I asked him if he employed many model builders at Scaled Composites -
his reply was that if you came to him with an idea, you better be able
to build it yourself...so yes - everyone at SC is a model builder.

Aviation Week had him write a article about what aircraft would be like
100 years back in 2000.
He designed a tail-sitting VTOL fighter, but said that's not what
military aircraft would be like at all in the future.
In the future a soldier shows up with something around the size of a
shoebox opens it, and around 100 things around the size dragonflies come
out of it driven by nanotech jet engines. These ignore friendly forces
who are carrying IFF gear, but they fly straight into the foreheads of
anyone who isn't carrying IFF gear and fire a small shaped charged
straight into their brain.
That should scare the hell out of anyone who thinks they may be in the area.
His timescale may have been off though:

The Ercoupe was designed to be operated more like a car than a aircraft:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCO_Ercoupe .
Aerobatic it wasn't, but it was supposed to be very easy to learn to fly.
I'm trying to remember if anyone made a model kit of it, as I think I
saw one advertised once.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his vision of the future - the ability to commute by air...air-taxi, of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sorts; using small light aircraft as a mode of public transportation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between short distanced hubs or rooftops.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He's a really interesting guy to listen to, and you can just feel that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he's a conceptual thinker far beyond most folks in the room.  But if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; listen to the guy he starts making sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I asked him if he employed many model builders at Scaled Composites -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his reply was that if you came to him with an idea, you better be able
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to build it yourself...so yes - everyone at SC is a model builder.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something tells me that getting your license had better be tougher than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it currently is.  Many folks can't handle two-dimensional maneuvring.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't think adding another dimension will help them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No - not that everyone should be flying, but that flying should be
&gt;&gt;&gt; accessible to everyone as a form of public transportation.

&gt;&gt; yeah, i wanna take the 8:15 helibus to the office.

&gt; Can I buy your helibus?  Too much! The Helibus!

I'd catch that bus three times a day...

&gt; The Ercoupe was designed to be operated more like a car than a aircraft:
&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCO_Ercoupe .
&gt; Aerobatic it wasn't, but it was supposed to be very easy to learn to fly.
&gt; I'm trying to remember if anyone made a model kit of it, as I think I
&gt; saw one advertised once.

Yes I have one. Don't rememeber the maker, it's packed away. Rough and basic,
canopy is part of fuselage and therefore not clear. It looks like the
pictures I suppose. Even has decals.

Like the military version at Wiki, didn't know that. Gives me an idea...
