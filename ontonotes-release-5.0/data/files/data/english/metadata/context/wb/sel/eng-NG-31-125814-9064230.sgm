Hi Everyone,

This is a cross post because I wasn't sure which one to put it in and some
people may not use all the NewsGroups that I have posted it to, so beg your
forgiveness.

The main BT socket is in the bedroom and from this I have daisy chained all
the rest of the sockets in the house using the faceplate connection on the
front of the BT socket.

From some of the sockets I have filters plugged in for the phones, 4 in
total. I also have a filter plugged in for the PC to use the Broadband.

I noticed that the connection speed was getting slower and slower so I used
the Voyager 105 modem given to me by my ISP in order to findout the exact
speed. It was 320 kbps.

I disconnected all the phones in the house, tried the speed again and it was
the same. Plugged modem into main socket and speed increased to something
like 580 kbps. I thern took faceplate off and plugged modem directly into
socket, now 1.8Mbps. I plugged extensions into filter and all phones work ok
without individual filters.

Now my question is this. Do I have a fault on my original installation of
the sockets in the house, or, should I have just used 1 filter in the main
box as I have at present ?

Your comments are most welcome.

Are all the extension sockets correctly wired with twisted pair telephone
cable? I've seen slow speeds caused by extensions wired with alarm cable.
Some people may suggest that you disconnect the ring wire - although I have
not found that a problem.

It is possible that you havea fault on the extension sockets installed
throughout the house.  It may simply be that these sockets have been wired
without the benefit of the correct twisted pair cable.  It is also possible
that the &quot;ring&quot; wire is connected, but its partner in the twisted pair is
not, thereby unbalancing the pair and introducing noise.

What you should do is formalise the test arrangement by installing a
faceplate filter. An example is the &quot;NTE5 compatible ADSL filtered
faceplate&quot; see: http://www.solwise.co.uk/adsl_splitters.htm
All the extension cables should then be wired to the filtered output of the
faceplate.

If it isn't possible to install your router or modem adjacent to the
filtered faceplate in the bedroom, then use Cat5 cable to run the unfiltered
signal to a RJ45 socket at a more convenient location.

If you go to http://www.clarity.it/telecoms/adsl_bits.htm and buy the
'Genuine BT Master NTE5 Linebox ADSL Adaptor' (don't forget to get some
screws) you can plug it into your main BT socket, connect your
extensions to the appropriate socket on the front, your broadband cable
to the other and then throw all your other filters away.

No connection other than that of a (very) satisfied customer. They're a

BT when running cables along the street etc take care to avoid sources of
interference like mains wiring. So it seems strange that miles of cable to
the exchange can have less effect than a few yards in the home - but it
can be. The best way is to install a single filtered unit where the line
comes into the house, and site a router there. Then either use CAT5
cabling to your computer(s) or a wireless link.

You're correct in your assumption Adrian. I removed the faceplate, plugged
in the filter then plugged the extensions and modem into the filter.
It may look a little more ugly than the NTE5 ADSL Linebox, but it certainly
is cheaper. It'll do for the time being. The bedroom where main BT socket is
located is my Office/junk room so ugliness isn't any problem.

Good solution (if visually ugly!).  Add the proper faceplate to your tuit
list.

Back at your original problem, it may have been bad wiring, or it may have
been a bad filter. Some filters seem to be much better than others, and some
appear to go faulty.

&gt; &gt; socket, now 1.8Mbps. I plugged extensions into filter and all phones work ok
&gt; &gt; without individual filters.

&gt; &gt; Now my question is this. Do I have a fault on my original installation of
&gt; &gt; the sockets in the house, or, should I have just used 1 filter in the main
&gt; &gt; box as I have at present ?

&gt; &gt; Your comments are most welcome.

&gt; Only the phones need to have filters.  The

More correctly it WILL cause problems if you attempt to run an ADSL modem from a
filtered connection.

I'm not to bother swapping post with you just because you believe that
the DSL port is completely unaffected by the filtering for the
analogue port.

If you had been here long enough you would have read that on occasions
there have been reports of people having to use a filter (using the
correct port of course) to enable their DSL to work &amp; anybody who
argues round in circles to prove his supposed superior knowledge just
isn't worth the efort. I've got more important things to worry about
other than giving you another chance to prove yourself (to whom one
can but wonder).

Not quite true (as kraftee says later)
The 'modem' side of a filter should (on decent units)have additional
components in it to isolate/protect the modem from the DC on the line,
the 25c/s ringing voltage and the dc changes caused by lifting/replacing
the handset on other phones.

No. Any components there may adversely affect the line balance and impedance.
All the required 'protection' is in the modem itself. It would be nuts if it

Not necessarily.

However I suspect the cost of the odd blown modem is a lot less than
trying to distinguish between a 1Mhz signal and a lightning transient,
without making the modem cost £1000 and therefore not be saleable.

I had  USR 9600 modem that DID get literally struck by lightning: they
replaced it FOC. I queried this and they said 'its built into the price.
Its easier to simply replace blown units with no paperwork and
invoicing, than to fiddle about trying to determine if the customer is
lying, and its a heck of a lot cheaper than trying to proof them against
it. We strip out the guts and scrap any parts that don't work: In your
case sir, probably the whole thing&quot;

But as far as the typical ADSL unit goes, part of what it does is to
have a high pass filter of probably at least second order set at about
20Khz: That's more than enough to get rid of any DC, speech and ring
tone on the line. All you ant is to reduce it so it doesn't overload the
digital filters that come later.

So you just plug em straight into BT and Robert is a relative.

If the modem has a phone port, that will have its own low pass filter in
it. Another reason why you wouldn't want to do that sort of filtering
higher up the food chain: phones plugged into a phone socket on the
modem would NOT then work.

The other reason for using a filtered Master Socket is that then the
ADSL signal gets taken off the line as soon as possible and doesn't get
fed on to all the sockets around the house with possible mis-termination

Fit a filtered faceplate at the master socket, and run cat5 cable from its
RJ45 socket to another RJ45 socket at a convenient location.  Plug your
router into the second RJ45 socket.  The Cat 5 cable will ensure that the
ADSL signal arrives at the second socket substantially uncontaminated.

Or, put your router beside the master socket and work out a networking
solution to your computer (upper room).  Network could be ethernet (same as
Graham J's method for cabling); wireless (depending on wall count), ethernet
over mains (pretty effective every time I've seen it used, Solwise.co.uk for
reasonably priced components).

It is worth finding out how much you loose through your house wiring on your
BB speed. Some people loose immeasurably little, others find half their
speed is lost in the poor wiring around their house.

Evidently you think you are loosing so little that doing nothing is
sensible.  Others will find a certain amount of loss, and have to decide if
its worth networking to the master socket to remove that loss.  In extremes
its the difference between a stable broadband service and no connection.

The ADSL connectors on the master socket/modem are actually RJ11 with
the line on the centre pins.
One can now buy long cables terminated in RJ11 both ends for this very

I guess PC world will charge about £100 whereas Maplin will be much
cheaper at £10 for a 10m cable (A93CG) or less for shorter.
Or an 'ultra high speed version for £20 (A97CG)
CPC even cheaper.

Yes, I got a 15m one MUCH cheaper at CPC (I don't use it any more;
router and rack are 1 metre from the master socket!)

Having said that, a twisted pair cable will be better in many cases, as
a house is inherently a 'noisy' place.

Yeh but it still requires RJ11s unless one wants to wire from the back
with CAT5 and that is probably only better than standard (modern) BT
twisted pair cable cos it is thicker and hence less lossy.

I doubt it is possible to get RJ11 terminated CAT5 unless one makes it
oneself and manages to get the thicker cable into RJ11s

Standard BT twisted pair was really all I meant. Most extension leads
seem to be flat twin.

ADSL Nation used to do a range of what they called ADSL2 extension
leads, RJ11 plugs on the end &amp; (lovely) twisted pair inbetween &amp; if my
memory serves me well the longest was 20mtrs, which should fill
anybodies needs..

We got a filtering master socket and all is well.

It was convenient that the master socket was in my study - it is, as someone has

My modem feeds 4 RJ45 sockets around the house. Wireless was a bit
expensive when I installed it. And I'd rather not have to look at all that
wiring so I fitted it in the cellar - which is where I re-routed the phone
line to enter the house, rather than the original through a window
frame. ;-)

If I suspect a problem with the router I can interrogate it from any
computer on the LAN, and re-boot if necessary.

Oh, I rarely (never?) have problems with the router itself, but being able to
see the Carrier Detect and activity lights is useful.

When Telewest fitted cable to this place they turned up expecting to
nail it to the skirtingboards in that obscene way they have. They looked
a bit surprised when I showed them a draw-wire leading through a conduit
to the back of the house where I wanted the terminal.
Definitely worth doing - you can't see any wires anywhere except behind
the telly.

When NTL supplied service at a relations, they just cut off all the BT
wiring (including the NTE) and connected their wires to it using the old
internal cabling.
I had to re-do it when they went back to BT/Sky as the old internal
stuff (orange/blue/brown/green untwisted) completely f***s up ADSL

Why..? Put all computers on the LAN, it's a lot easier. If your router
only has one Ethernet port, get a switch, they're cheap enough.
