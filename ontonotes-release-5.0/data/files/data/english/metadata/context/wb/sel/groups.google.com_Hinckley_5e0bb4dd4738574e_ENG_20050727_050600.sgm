This is what they are promising!!
Thoughts?
My comments in brackets

What Action Will We Take?

We will complete a new Masterplan for Hinckley town centre and set up a
Town Centre Partnership - to guide future improvements.

We will facilitate redevelopment of the Hinckley Bus Station site, with
the aim of maximising its benefits for town centre vitality.
(yawn)

We will complete a Car Parking Strategy, based on research we've
already undertaken, setting out future parking improvements for
Hinckley.
(Increase the charge you mean)

We will produce a new 'Local Development Framework' to guide physical
developments and land use changes in the Borough.

We will discuss with local businesses the potential for setting up
Business Improvement Districts in the Borough.

We will create attractive 'gateways' into Hinckley and improve floral
displays to give a positive impression for people coming into the town.
(yep its worked on the A5, Onyx etc are full of nice flora and rubbish,
gateways to include 'chuck wagons)

On a pilot basis, we will launch a 'Hit Squad' service to respond
quickly to problems such as graffiti, vandalism, litter and fly
tipping.

We will carry out a study into the options for the future replacement
of the facilities at Hinckley Leisure Centre.
(Yep. New building on the way)

We will develop a pilot project with a local Community College and the
County Council to develop the college facilities for wider community
use

We will continue our Community Parks development programme, working
with local residents to plan and implement improvements to parks.

We will continue to run our Parish and Community Initiatives Fund to
support improvements to leisure and community facilities in Parishes.

We will continue to support the new Tourism Promotions Board to develop
and implement a Tourism Strategy.
(come and see our empty shops)

We will bid to the West Leicestershire Rural Transport Partnership for
funding to set up a pilot transport project to give young people and
others in rural areas better access to facilities.

We will develop a skateboarding and/or 'extreme sports' facility in the
Hinckley area.
(WOW, money well spent)

We will take part in a pilot 'Service Shop' project to deal with
selected County Council service enquiries for callers to our main
Helpdesk at our Hinckley offices. If the project works, and there is a
public demand for it, we may be able to extend it in the future.

We will install technology to enable 'remote working' by our staff
providing the ability to access
information held within the Council's systems from any location -
improving efficiency and access to our services.
(Stevie, that means you can work from home, Mr Hall, from N Wales, Mr
Andrews from France)

We will set up systems for the public to make any payments, account
enquiries or applications to us (eg Council Tax, Planning Applications)
on line if they choose.

We will set up a Citizens' Panel of local residents willing to help us
with regular consultation about our services.
(Oh yes, here we go......)

We will implement an Empty Homes Strategy to encourage and help owners
of empty houses to bring them onto the market for rent.

We have commissioned an update of our Housing Needs Survey to confirm
the level of need for new housing of different types.

We will continue to use our planning powers to ensure that developers
provide the types of new housing that are needed.

We will set up a programme of training for all our staff about how they
can help the Council and Police prevent and respond to crime and
anti-social behaviour.
(????????????)

We will set up a second 'Community House' on the Wykin estate in
Hinckley to support local people in reducing crime, anti-social
behaviour and other problems.
(Second house, did the 1st not work?)

We have supported the creation of a refuge for victims of domestic
violence by providing a property, and we will work with the managers of
the refuge in the future to ensure it can operate effectively.

We will carry out our new Licensing responsibilities with community
safety firmly in mind.

We will introduce an alternate weekly refuse and recycling 'kerbside'
collection service, providing wheeled bins for refuse and plastic boxes
for recyclable materials.

We will also expand the optional wheeled bin collection service for
garden waste.

We will work with Leicestershire County Council to support the newly
established Young People's Council.

Thoughts guys

Before I pass a comment I want to see:-

1) A business plan.
1) A time table break down
2) How much it will all cost
3) Where all the money is coming from
4) How much the rates will go up to pay for it

My guess is that the council tax wont go up substantially this side of
the election.
That way they can hoodwink the electorate on the excellent job they are
doing.
Using section 106 monies to finance things that they should do anyway
being but one example.
I imagine we'll get two more years of promises yet.

And I dont think, no accuse, that apart from lining the pockets of
friends and themselves that this lot don't have a plan for anything.
