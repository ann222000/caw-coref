Why the GOP Must Nominate Ron Paul,

Ron Paul Odds Have Been Slashed to 6 to 1: Now Favored Over Romney

Public pushes Ron Paul odds down even further this week

http://www.gambling911.com/Ron-Paul-100107.html

Forget those political polls.  Throughout time (at least the last decade), oddsmakers have had an uncanny knack for predicting political races.  It's not so much that they have a crystal ball, rather the lines adjust based on public action.  When it comes to political betting, the public action is presumed to represent votes.  The theory being that someone who is likely to vote on Mitt Romney probably won't bet on Ron Paul winning.

The gambling public seems to believe that 2008 Presidential candidate Ron Paul stands a very good chance of winning, so much so that this past week odds on Dr. Paul have been slashed further from 8 to 1 down to 6 to 1, with the potential payout of $600 for every $100 bet.  (see betting odds at Sportsbook.com).

This gives Ron Paul shorter odds than Mitt Romney.  He's only slightly trailing behind John McCain (5 to 1 odds) and Rudy Giuliani (5 to 1 odds).

Fred Thompson is the favorite among Republicans with odds of 4 to 1.

We'll put an asterisk on this one since so much of the betting action on Ron Paul has been prompted by Gambling911.com readers.  Still, it is a reflection of ardent support for their favorite candidate.

&quot;These short odds represent the folks at Sportsbook.com reacting to all the betting action generated as a result of articles that have appeared on the Gambling911.com website over the past few months,&quot; points out Carrie Stroup, Gambling911.com reporter and this month's FHM Magazine featured babe.

The Gambling911 site was one of the first to break the news about Ron Paul drafting legislation to make tips exempt, thus prompting an effort by his massive legion of supporters to target the service industry with Ron Paul sermons.

&quot;If I were a bartender, I would vote for Ron Paul,&quot; admits Payton O'Brien, Senior Editor of Gambling911.com, who in recent months has been following the Paul campaign with interest.  She is a Democrat.

Gambling911.com reporter, Jenny Woo, who has stripped once or twice in her past life, believes that strippers, bartenders, wait staff, casino dealers and those who depend heavily on tips will lean towards a Ron Paul vote.

&quot;We work hard for the money and it's that drive that is a characteristic also found in the voter mentality,&quot; Woo says.

The Ron Paul supporters are yet to hit competing online gambling websites whose Presidential betting odds have not been promoted by Gambling911.com.

&quot;Now is the time for Ron Paul supporters to start banging sites like World Sports Exchange, which still have Paul with +2400 odds for a payout potential of $2400 on every $100 bet when he wins,&quot; O'Brien recommends.  World Sports Exchange betting odds on Dr. Paul can be found here.   &quot;They (WSEX) even have Huckabee ahead of Paul.  If I were a Ron Paul supporter, I would be outraged and let them have it, even with a $5 bet!&quot;

World Sports Exchange actually lets you see how many bets are being placed on each candidate.

&quot;Your money is safe with World Sports Exchange even though they do not advertise here,&quot; reassured O'Brien.  &quot;So let's hammer them!&quot;

The media, neoconservatives and some Democrats just don't understand why Ron Paul's supporters are so excited, dedicated and diverse. At the most recent PBS debate in Baltimore, the camera panned to catch the first African-American female fighter pilot in U.S. history applauding enthusiastically when Dr. Paul suggested we should bring the troops home from Iraq and every other country they currently occupy. Neoconservative bloggers are aghast at Ron Paul's increasing success as are the neoconservative gatekeepers. This is a truly satisfying result since it was the neoconservative hijacking of the Republican Party which has helped to further decimate our once-great Republic.
In one comment, written as a response to a post at the quintessential neoconservative and freedom-hating blog, Red State, a reader unsupportive of Paul points out the obvious for most neoconservatives, that Ron Paul's ability to raise a million dollars in seven days is &quot;[expletive deleted] scary.&quot;

The neoconservative movement is now officially in its dying throes and yet neoconservatives do not take notice. A good example of this can be witnessed in Newt Gingrich's threat to join the crowded field of GOP Presidential candidates. (Eye of) Newt has been touting his ability to bring together a goodly number of intellectuals who will help solve America's problems. What is at the forefront of those problems? Why, it is the threat of Islamic law being instituted in the United States if we were to pull out of Iraq. Seriously, that is what he's saying.

The neoconservatives are banking on a strategy that has worked for them since 1994 (and all governments since the dawn of civilization). If they just pull the kids 'round the campfire and tell them a scary enough story, the kids will flock to their skirts and demand protection. If the story isn't scary enough, then it has to be modified until it becomes sufficiently scary. But at some point, the story becomes so far-fetched that even the true believers have to scratch their heads.

With Ron Paul's entry into the field of Presidential contenders, that tactic is no longer going to work. Ron Paul's early support was made up of those who were either never fooled by this claptrap or have come to understand that they were being manipulated. It only becomes more apparent to them with every utterance by neoconservatives that the scare stories have no basis in reality. Rather than offer something truly different, the neoconservatives are simply upping the ante and labeling it &quot;different.&quot; They have discounted Ron Paul's support by claiming that it is much smaller than it appears. This is just another side of the same reality-denying tactic that is killing their movement. Because they cannot acknowledge reality, their influence will completely wither away, sooner rather than later.

Ron Paul's grass roots support is growing daily. Each time he is given a national forum in which to speak, a new flood of supporters joins the cause and his coffers grow (as opposed to Mitt Romney who's coiffeur's coffers grow). In the spaces between these national appearances, the growing body of supporters reaches out to their neighbors and spreads the word.

The neoconservatives on the other hand, believe that they are the keepers of all intellectual truth and that they have enemies both domestic and foreign. The domestic enemies are &quot;liberals&quot; or those whom they label so. The list of &quot;liberals&quot; keeps growing however and their blindness to reality prevents them from realizing that a list of enemies, increased by spite and action and drawn from a static pool of voters, is causing the number of &quot;allies&quot; to dwindle.

If you are thinking that I'm giving away some secret that will tip off neoconservatives and cause them to mend their ways long enough to torpedo Ron Paul's candidacy, don't worry. As Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton (ret.) told the San Diego Tribune recently, &quot;this administration is immune to good advice.&quot;

The neoconservatives are immune to good advice. Their arrogance and hubris knows no bounds. Even if they were to read this, they would discount it as irrelevant nonsense from a wacko Paul supporter. Since it is only they who have the answers to America's problems, there are no qualified observers who can offer worthwhile advice. Their inability to give criticism any serious consideration is the source of their failures in every policy. Iraq is a great example of this but there are others that can be pointed out such as FEMA's reaction to hurricane Katrina.

We are at the &quot;fight&quot; stage in Gandhi's oft-quoted statement. The neocons are beginning to fight, but they are using the very tactics that do nothing to diminish support for Ron Paul and everything to decrease their own ranks. They think that non-neoconservative voices emanate from brainless liberals, but this isn't why their ranks dwindle. They are incapable of honest self-assessment – the very thing of which they accuse their enemies –

thus, neoconservative influence continues to wane. Their knack for projecting their own problems onto others is similar to their knack for projecting U.S. military power all over the globe. It is not &quot;terrorists&quot; who would convert the U.S. to a nation ruled by draconian dictates but the neoconservatives themselves.

Ron Paul's support grows because he is the anti-neoconservative candidate. Where neoconservatives deride those who don't buy their solutions, Ron Paul always assumes the best of both detractors and the merely ignorant. When Bill Maher asked him &quot;Why are Americans so stupid?&quot; he responded, &quot;We're Americans,&quot; to point out that all Americans aren't stupid and his task is to inform and enlighten rather than make enemies. What a concept. The most obvious truism for a politician is that he should be expanding his influence rather than alienating voters. This is lost on neoconservatives.

Ron Paul refuses to convert disagreements into personal arguments which create animosity. His tactic is to merely present his side of the argument while acknowledging that this is part of his core belief system and not an indication that those who disagree are stupid or evil. This has trickled down to his supporters who, for the most part, avoid political arguments and instead implore the uninitiated to simply discover for themselves what Ron Paul is saying. This tactic has worked brilliantly. Ron Paul's message is genuinely compelling and his defense of these views has been consistent and dogged over the past 30 years; no matter what obstacles are thrown before him. That is the basis for his supporter's enthusiasm. He truly means what he is saying. Unlike his counterparts, he does not have to waste any words explaining why his votes do not match his rhetoric. His supporters do not have to suffer the nagging feeling that something different would occur if they were to
elect him. He has always voted in a manner that matches his speech.

The neocons have no candidate in the race remotely showing the same level of integrity though they appear to be certain that nobody will notice this. They prove by their actions that any talk of truth, honesty or values is just empty, pandering, rhetoric. The number of Paul supporters is increasing because, contrary to neoconservative belief, Americans are not stupid. They just haven't had a decent alternative in 30 years. Well....now they do.

Why the GOP Must Nominate Ron Paul - And Response

posted October 2, 2007

Why must the Republican Party nominate a 72-year-old grandfather from the Gulf Coast of Texas, until the past few months little known outside his district, as its 2008 standard-bearer? Very simple: the alternative is eight years of President Hillary Clinton. That ought to be enough to get the attention of every conservative who happens upon these words, so let me explain.

It should come as no big revelation to anyone inside or outside of the Republican Party that the GOP has lost touch with its conservative roots. Massive deficit spending that would make Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter blush; foreign adventurism beyond the wildest dreams of Woodrow Wilson or Teddy Roosevelt; more big government programs than FDR or LBJ

(Google &quot;Medicare expansion&quot; for a massive example) ... the Republican Party of the early 21st century is clearly not your father's or grandfather's GOP.

There are no more Robert Tafts, no more Barry Goldwaters, not even any more Ronald Reagans (as imperfect as he turned out to be after reaching the White House) ...

except one: Ron Paul. Dr. Paul (an OB/GYN who has delivered more than 4,000 babies) is the last, best hope for the GOP to reclaim its once-upon-a-time status as the party of limited government.

It isn't his status as the leading advocate of limited, constitutional government that makes Ron Paul a must-nominate for the GOP, though. It is true that in the long run, the Republican Party needs him to help it reclaim its spirit, and this indeed will be his lasting legacy. But, in the short run, the party needs him to win the 2008 election and save the country from another Clinton presidency that would be far worse than the first.

(Unlike Bill, who was apparently mainly involved in politics to get the attention of the ladies, Hillary is a true believer in socialism; and, with a Democratic majority in Congress, she will have an excellent opportunity to expedite its widespread implementation in America.)

Fact one: Hillary Clinton will win the 2008 Democratic nomination. She is an experienced, cut-throat politician with deep ties in the party, and can take Barack Obama down pretty much any time she wants to. And John Edwards is not serious about pursuing the nomination. He is just positioning himself to be the VP nominee again, because in the wake of the 2006 Congressional elections he believes that Hillary will win the Presidency by taking a few key states where John Kerry fell short. Long story short: forget the others - Hillary is the woman to beat in 2008.

Fact two: The 2008 election will be won by the candidate who most credibly addresses the growing anti-war sentiment that has been embraced by the majority of the country's voters. (Google &quot;2006 mid-term elections.)

70% or more of Americans want out of Iraq, and for many of them, it is the defining issue of the campaign. You may agree or disagree, but it's a fact and it's going to decide the 2008 Presidential election.

If it comes down to Hillary Clinton vs. any of the &quot;establishment&quot; Republican candidates, she wins by default. She may have voted for the war originally, but she will continue to claim that she was misled by the Republican administration, and that we should trust her to make things right.

(Of course she won't really get us out of the Middle East mess, but Joe Six-Pack won't figure that out until after she wins the election.)

If any of the supposed &quot;front runner&quot; Republican candidates (Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, John McCain, or Fred Thompson) wins the GOP nomination, Hillary Clinton is essentially a lock. Not only will she win over a sizable portion of the independent vote with her (perceived) status as &quot;the anti-war candidate,&quot; but - simply put - the GOP will not turn out its base in sufficient numbers to win.

Nominate Rudy Giuliani? Conservative, red-state voters are not going to turn out to support a gun-grabbing Northern liberal faux Republican who dresses in drag and is a charter member of the Wife-Of-The-Month Club. The social conservatives, along with the fiscal conservatives and the key swing voters (libertarians and constitutionalists)

will either stay home on Election Day or vote third party. Rudy won't even carry his home state, and ask Al Gore how that usually works out. Slam dunk, Hillary wins.

Nominate Mitt Romney? You get basically the same result as Giuliani without the (bogus) &quot;America's Mayor&quot; 9/11 cachet. Conservatives in the South and West won't turn out for the former governor of &quot;Taxachusetts&quot; who has flip-flopped on virtually every issue they hold dear. The fact that Romney is a Mormon won't help him with the mainstream Christian base, either. He probably can't win the GOP nomination, but even if he does, Romney is toast in the general election.

Nominate John McCain? Not gonna happen. His campaign has taken a nose dive from which it will be virtually impossible to recover. As of the end of the second quarter, even (supposed) long-shot Ron Paul had more cash on hand - and, when the third quarter numbers come in, McCain will be even further behind in the money game. He probably won't even be in the top five on the GOP side. Stick a fork in him, he's done. And even if he could pull off the apparently impossible and come back to win the Republican nomination, he loses to Hillary on the war and many domestic issues as well.

Fred Thompson? He's the last hope of those Republicans who are looking for a &quot;mainstream&quot; candidate to save them from looming, seemingly inevitable defeat in 2008. On the surface, he appears to have more of a chance than the previously mentioned &quot;big three.&quot; After all, he has the &quot;actor factor.&quot; It worked for Reagan and, more recently, Arnold Schwarzenegger in California - couldn't it work for Fred, too? Well, no, not this time around.

Like Ronald Reagan, Fred Thompson is reasonably good at reading a script. Unlike the Gipper, though, Fred is just awful at speaking extemporaneously. In case anyone was wondering why Thompson waited so long to declare his candidacy, it's obvious to those who know anything about his abilities and liabilities: he wanted to avoid as many debates as possible.

Like Obama on the Democratic side, Thompson is an empty suit. He looks reasonably presentable, but sooner or later he has to open his mouth, and when he does he doesn't say anything of substance. The less he speaks in public (especially with other candidates around to rebut him),

the better for Fred. Unfortunately for Thompson, while he has so far been able to duck any direct confrontation with his GOP rivals, he won't be able to avoid debating Hillary if he wins the Republican nomination. And about five minutes into the first debate, with no &quot;Law and Order&quot; writers to put words in his mouth, it will be over. Game, set, match, Hillary.

When you look at it objectively, there isn't a single one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; GOP candidates who can beat Hillary Clinton head-to-head. And none of the &quot;second tier&quot; candidates (Huckabee, Brownback, Hunter,
Tancredo, et al)

have stepped up to the challenge. Really, there is only one remaining viable Republican candidate: You guessed it, Ron Paul.

Only Ron Paul can take advantage of the Internet the way Howard Dean did before he imploded four years ago. Indeed, he has already captured the Internet ...

the Ron Paul Revolution is already in full swing online. It sure was nice of Al Gore to invent the Net for Ron Paul supporters to take over, wasn't it?

Only Ron Paul can outflank Hillary Clinton both to the left on the war, and to the right on everything else ... which is the only winning strategy the Republicans can plausibly employ in 2008.

Only Ron Paul, who is truly pro-family (married to the same woman for over 50 years, with five children and 18 grandchildren - no &quot;trophy wives&quot; here) can motivate the socially conservative base to actually turn out and vote.

Only Ron Paul, who wants to eliminate the IRS (and a host of other federal agencies) and stop the Federal Reserve from devaluing our money through runaway, printing-press inflation, can motivate the fiscally conservative base to cast a GOP ballot in 2008.

Only Ron Paul can keep the Libertarians and Constitution Party members from splintering off to support their own third-party nominees rather than another neo-con, Bush clone Republican. (In fact, the 2004 nominees of the Constitution Party and the Libertarian Party, Michael Peroutka and Michael Badnarik, have both already endorsed Ron Paul's candidacy.)

While the LP and CP may command only a small fraction of the overall vote, that may well be enough to turn the tide in a crucial state or two. Ask Al Gore if he could have used a few thousand of Ralph Nader's votes in 2000....

Yes, when you look at things objectively, there are only two candidates who can win the White House in 2008: Hillary Clinton and Ron Paul. The contrast could not be more stark, nor the results for the future of America more divergent. If you are a social or fiscal conservative, a libertarian, a constitutionalist, or just a concerned independent ...

now is the time to consider your options and act accordingly while there is still time to affect the outcome.

The Ron Paul Revolution has begun.

While I don't look at this issue as a 'Republican vs. Democrat' issue, I do agree with your premise that the GOP must nominate Ron Paul.

I am a registered Democrat in California who will re-register as a Republican merely to ensure that Ron Paul is nominated. I consider myself a 'Constitutionalist Liberal' and the breadth of Dr. Paul's platform most closely represents my political bent.

I encourage others to find out more about Ron Paul and his patriotic vision for the future of our great nation.

I agree with Mr. Dumas that Ron Paul should be the Republican candidate. I lean toward the liberal and would vote for Hillary but I want to see the Republican Party rejuvenated and see it get back to its roots.

I read all about what Ron Paul stands for and he's definitely what the Republican side needs. His ideas are not all bad and would stir the kind of controversy I like. I like the way he would indict certain systems like the IRS, the Federal Reserve, and others.

The Republican leaders of late have led the Republican Party into the sewer. Today's Republican Party would be an embarrassment to Ike Eisenhower and Abe Lincoln.

I'm against ideology in politics and I'll forever be for a woman's right to choose. Ron Paul is against that, but he's not for a federal law banning abortion, he's for letting the states decide. I'm for letting the women decide, so I won't vote for Ron Paul.

Still, I'm for a strong creditable Republican Party vying against the Democrats on issues. It's looking to me like Hillary is very likely going to be the next President, and, unlike Mr. Dumas, I think that would be good for America.

However, if she loses to Ron Paul, I think he would represent the Republican Party very well, and bring it back to its roots. I hope he wins the Republican nomination.

I also hope that this election people will begin putting their political bitterness aside and respect, and look for merit in, the political viewpoints of others.
