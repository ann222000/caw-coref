Right.  Apith would rarely have had a good reason to venture far from the
forested patches that comprise the earliest hominid communities.  Unlike
present-day hominids they may have often had little or no knowledge of other
communities in their vicinity.  From their perspective their whole world was
their treed, community site.  And the biggest obstacle they faced to their
survival was the dry season and its implications: influx of scarcity
producing food competitor species and influx large predators that would prey
on them when they were weak and vulnerable during the depths of the dry
season.  Given these situational factors it's hardly surprising that they
evolved behaviors along the lines of preventing inmigration of food
competitor species: collective rock throwing, stick wielding, mob-oriented
aggression directed against any inmigrating food-competitor species and
predators.  The communities comprised of individuals that were more
intelligent, more proficient at cooperating and communicating with one
another toward long-term collective goal of preserving the wealth (food
producing fruit trees and other vegetation) of the garden-like community
site are the ancestors of present-day hominids.  The communities comprised
of individuals that lacked these abilities were the victims of predatory
massacres during the depths of the dry season.

These situational factors provided a gradual upramp for the development of
hominid intelligence, communicative abilities, and tool/weapons usage.

I think it can be shown that early hominids evolved thicker dentine so
as to cope with eating tubers during the dry season, and that they
therefore learned to carry sharp sticks or bone shards to dig the
tubers. Which also proved to be useful defensive tools.

The Kalihari pygmy still carried such sticks in recent times for just
this purpose.

Demonic Males by Wrangham and Peterson reports on the field studies of
Orangutan, Gorilla, Chimp, and Bonobo. It is the Bonobo that have been
filmed carrying herbivore bone shards to dig tubers. This not only
provides a convenient drink, but a dose of complex carbs. They report
that whereas the other apes and monkeys eat fruit and meat, they also
have very thin dentine, but that the Bonobo have the thickest dentine
of all primates but one: hominids. Which is necessary to deal with the
grit that comes with the tubers.

Tubers also proved to be essential to the survival of European yeoman
farmers. When armies came thru, they would seize the grain and burn
the fields. But when the yeomen figure out how to grow tubers, and
heard that an army was coming, they simply took what they could carry
into the forest after buring the tubers in the fields.

You dont read about it in history, but of course you would not, since
it was all written by the scribes in the pay of the kings and
generals. But whole armies were starved out in this way. Its basically
what happened to Napoleon, and why the Poles and Russians still love
borscht.

Sure meat is nice, but tubers will get a group thru when there aint no
meat around.

Well this is all fine and dandy, Day.  But what's it got to do with human
evolution?  How is it, supposedly, not obvious that tuber eating fails to
explain the selective emergence of human cultural, social, communicative,
and intellectual adaptations?  Obviously it does not.  There is no
group/communal selection in your scenario.  Without it you can't explain the
selective origins of any of these uniquely human attributes.  Equally
obvious is the fact that my hypothesis does explain the selective origins of
these attributes.

Oh, come come now, Lee.  Like it's not obvious that these anthro-retards are
evolutionary illiterates, like yourself, who couldn't even begin to offer
any scientifically relevant feedback on my hypothesis or any hypothesis.
Like yourself, they are hardly even qualified to dispute AAT.

Science is a process, not a conclusion.

It dont explain the thick dentine, which is not found on the other
major meat eaters. Meat needs shearing, not grinding. The other thing
about the hominids was their rapid advance into novel ecosystems, and
to do that, they needed to exploit every resource that was there. We
are, after all, omnivores. This is still seen in the contents of bog
body stomachs which had a little meat, but 90% of the actual diet was
wild seeds, tubers, grains, legumes, &amp; greens. this is seen in the
bone middens along the Danube as well going back 7000 years.

Most of the meat they ate was rabbit. Ox, deer, &amp; goat were for
special occasions. Sass, &quot;The Substance of Civilization&quot; calculated
that when the agrarian revolution began (with grains) 10,000 years
ago, the amount of land needed to support a community shrank by a
factor of 5000. just an acre of wheat will easily produce 30 bushels,
or over a ton of grain. That nobody has to risk his life to get,
either in hunting accidents, or being killed by other hunters
defending territory.

Someone noticed the the Chalcolithic village tels along the Danube
basin rivers were regularly spaced 3km apart. This works out to 2000
acres per village. Soil cores show they used crop rotation, so even if
they only used a field once every 5 years, that's still 400 acres in
grain. A village maxed out, according to our DNA, at 300.

Remember too, that in this era, Europe still had lotsa wolves and
lions, and in the bush, lotsa men got ambushed. Lion claws would not
have been seen as tokens of bravery if so many men had not died trying
to get them. It was gonzo safer to stay home on the farm and run the
trap line every day for the rabbits, or go fishing in the river. Going
out for all the meat you think was in the diet was just too much
fucking dangerous work. These guys did not have 30-30's.

Lotsa places that hominids lived were on migration routes that had
huge herds passing thru, but then months would go by when they had to
get by on whatever else was around, and tubers always were.   If you
look at the fossilized teeth of the carnivores, you may see a few
broken. If you look at hominid teeth, quite often you see some
missing, or some holes in the jaw where an abscess had burst thru, and
some cases where the infection killed. which happened to a kid in the
news recently. Why are there so many cavities? It aint from eating
meat.

Not that there are not some, like the Inuit who eat a lot of it; I
dont recall ever seeing a snaggle tooth Inuit grin, but in many other
cultures you are hard to find a single skull with all the
teeth.

&gt;&gt; &gt; the fields. But when the yeomen figure out how to grow tubers, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; heard that an army was coming, they simply took what they could carry
&gt;&gt; &gt; into the forest after buring the tubers in the fields.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You dont read about it in history, but of course you would not, since
&gt;&gt; &gt; it was all written by the scribes in the pay of the kings and
&gt;&gt; &gt; generals. But whole armies were starved out in this way. Its basically
&gt;&gt; &gt; what happened to Napoleon, and why the Poles and Russians still love
&gt;&gt; &gt; borscht.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sure meat is nice, but tubers will get a group thru when there aint no
&gt;&gt; &gt; meat around.

&gt;&gt; Well this is all fine and dandy, Day.  But what's it got to do with human
&gt;&gt; evolution?  How is it, supposedly, not obvious that tuber eating fails to
&gt;&gt; explain the selective emergence of human cultural, social, communicative,
&gt;&gt; and intellectual adaptations?  Obviously it does not.  There is no
&gt;&gt; group/communal selection in your scenario.  Without it you can't explain
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; selective origins of any of these uniquely human attributes.  Equally
&gt;&gt; obvious is the fact that my hypothesis does explain the selective origins
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; these attributes.

Just because a lot of fools agree with you dont mean you are right. I
have not argued that they did not eat meat. There's plenty of evidence
for hominids eating bugs, crustaceans, &amp; worms that have the same kind
of high quality protein as large herbivores. I am certain as well that
they ate carrion, using flung stones and sharp digging sticks to drive
off other predators.

Being able to run for several kilometers after spotting a vulture
circle in the sky would have been an enormous advantage if they could
arrive before the hyenas crushed all the bones for the marrow. But
also, being able to eat the tubers scattered around the bush to have
the carbs to make that run would have been important. And to do that,
they needed thicker dentine than carnivores or the other fruit eating

Lots of herbivores will eat tubers, but the tubers evolved so that the
top shears off. The hominids carrying sharp sticks solved that
problem. The search for tubers dispersed groups across a wider area,
which tended to create a more egalitarian community because the alpha
males could not see, nor control what everyone was doing.

The dispersal for the sake of tubers revealed bird eggs, nuts,
berries, lizards, snakes, and other such small game that added the
meat needed for mental development at the same time it increased the
attention span looking for such a wide variety of resources. But none
of that works without the regular discovery of tubers, which can be
carried with for a dose of high energy carbs later on. And that wont
do much good unless the hominid has the teeth that can stand up to the
abrasion. Which is why hominids have thicker dentine than all other
primates, and AFAIK, carnivores.

It'd be interesting to know if domestic dogs, which were often fed
tubers, developed thicker dentine than wild canines. To eliminate the
consumption of tubers by hominids does not make any sense, altho I can
see where the idea fails to feed the alpha male warrior mentality. If
the challenges to the tuber diet were carried on in a more polite
manner, that  mentality would not be so obvious.

You are setting up a circular argument. Your thinking is so vague you
are only going to confuse yourself between the group selected groups
associated with apes (as well as those of other large herbivorous prey
species) and the group selected groups that originally underly human/
hominid evolution.  These are very different entities.

Firstly, they are not mutually exclusive--the existence of form of
group selection does not preclude the existence of the other.

But they are not interchangeable and you seem to not be capable of

Try to avoid jumping to conclusions.  You need to avoid these kind of
absolutist assumptions and start dealing with the mechanistic aspects
of a selective scenario.  You always do this.  You make sweeping
generalizations and then ignore the details necessary to a selective
scenario.  Most notable is the fact that you have groups of Apiths
going to war with other groups for no reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That would have been the situation right

My scenario does not depend upon sweeping generalizations.  It just
works.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; If
&gt; &gt; tubers don't indicate situational factors that underlie communal/group

&gt; Their use -- allied to the ability of hominids
&gt; to largely exclude other species which
&gt; consumed tubers (e.g. baboons and pigs) --
&gt; would enable high densities of hominid
&gt; populations.  That factor was essential.
">

This is a silly assumption.  A'piths were primarily frugivorous.  It
makes no sense for them to focus upon tubers and let other species
deplete the fruit trees in their vicinity.

Another thing, unless you have some element in your scenario that will
result in the extinction (massacre) of groups/communities that lack
human adaptation you don't have a viable group/communal selective
scenario.

Paul, you need to work out the details of your selective scenario and
get out of the habit of making sweeping generalization.

Wake up to reality. Humans are social, communal.  Digging up tubers

Egalitarian community?  You haven't described the emergence of
communalism yet you are already idealizing it already.  This is
obvious nonsense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The dispersal for the sake of tubers revealed bird eggs, nuts,

Its ludicrous to suggest that harvesting and eating tuber would lead
to the amazingly expensive and complex adaptations that are apparent

If they carry sharp sticks to dig tubers, they can then use the same
sticks to drive away either lions or hyenas. Major carnivores are
acutely aware of their physical condition, and very risk averse to any
small injury. Even a small hole in a hide from a sharp stick in those
conditions can easily get infected. Nobody was calling the vet or
providing antibiotics. Septicemia can result in death in 5 days.

Moreover, many of the carrion that they had access to were only killed
because they themselves had an infection and were not in top
condition. Which meant that simply poking at the meat with the sticks
innoculates with staph and other bacteria.

In &quot;The Forest People&quot;, an Mbuti pygmy went into the forest with his
little meter long spear. Finding the trail of an elephant, he caught
up to it, and stabbed it in the rump, then climbed a tree while the
beast beat the bush and ranted. But then, it went on its way with him

You have an unrealistic understanding of the natural world. Only in large
groups wielding weapons could hominids possibly have survived hyena and
lions in treeless habitat.  Sharp sticks are useless unless there are many
individual wielding them and working in concert.  And the ability to work in
concert is not something that would have evolved in a happenstance manner,
it would have had to have been (group) selected.

You don't get it. Only group/communal selection can possibly explain the
social adaptation that distinguish humans from all other species.  If you

That is a very good question.  It would be

That's a strawman Lee. I never implied that the hominids drove away
all the big cats.
The most telling evidence I know of are the holes in the back of early
Apith skulls that match leopard teeth. Given the placement of the
holes, the attack came from the rear. In India, to this day, the last
man walking in line in a jungle trail wears a mask over the back of
his head to deter tigers from attacking- because the cats can see the
eyes of the mask. The cats are so risk averse they wont attack unless
they think they can do so unseen from the rear.

And this dude, is the deterance of a cat even bigger than African
lions, and it works in dense bush, whereas the tuber digging I refer
to that needed sharp sticks was on relatively open savannah.

You fail to appreciate the fear of infection because you grew up in an
era of commonly available antibiotics. I was born on a farm in 1939,
and still remember how the women freaked if any of us kids got a cut
that bled. I did not think of it at the time, but they all remembered
other children, in the era before antibiotics, who died of septicemia.
Go look in an old graveyard some time. They are full of kids.

The primitive hominid habitat was no different. Read &quot;The Forest
People&quot;, and you see a hunter rely on infection to kill an elephant.

Nor am I saying that sharp sticks worked in dense brush where the
visibility was too short to permit hominids to group together for
their mutual defense. Posted here a while back was an analysis on the
hominid shoulder joint to facilitate throwing stones and rocks. Read
the studies in psychology using animals to show how a minor injury was
sufficient to deter a test animal from trying to feed if the food was
not already immediately present. Animals are not, in fact brave,
unless they are defending the young.

I was referring to this statement, which seems to imply that the Mbuti
are
not mighty hunters.

Day: &quot;In &quot;The Forest People&quot;, an Mbuti pygmy went into the forest with
his
little meter long spear. Finding the trail of an elephant, he caught
up to it, and stabbed it in the rump, then climbed a tree while the
beast beat the bush and ranted. But then, it went on its way with him
following. Every day for 4 more days. On the 5th, the elephant fell
over dead from the infection. He then went to the village, and they
all moved to where the carcass was to eat it.

A sharp stick (one of the methods) is not much help if you can't run
away as fast as a lion

That's my point, calling the guy with an AK-47 or hand-grenades is
hardly an example
of  mighty hunting.

Check out the film 'In The Blood' from  interlibrary loan. In this
documentary, the hunter shot
a cape buffalo with Teddy Roosevelt's Holland &amp; Holland (pretty big
rifle for its time).
The bull just ran off like it wasn't even hit. A few shots later and
they finally get it down.

Now, think about this. One of the first examples of  smoking-gun
evidence for hafting
during the Middle Stone Age is a Mousterian point stuck in the skull
of a buffalo. How in
the world did the thrower think he could get away with something, that
seems to us, as
suicidal as that?

Back to mighty cats. A friend of mine shot a cape buffalo late in the
afternoon.
Same as in the documentary above, it ran off like it wasn't even hit.
They lost the tracks
because of failing light. Next day they pick up the trail again. This
time there are pieces of flesh
and guts on the ground along the trail.  When they finally find the
creature a pride of lions were
chewing away at the carcass. Since they didn't have a permit to kill
any of the lions, one would
think taking the buffalo back without firing a shot, at least in the
air, would be hard to do. Nope,
the three of them just walked up and the lions scattered into the bush
and didn't come back.

That's wrong. I can't imagine a pygmy climbing high enough, fast
enough, to get away
from an elephant, not to mention thorns in some of those trees that
would impede climbing.
We are not talking about escaping from a hyena here.
Elephants can reach how high with their trunks, 20+ feet maybe? Or
maybe they would just knock
the tree down?

The typical argument for the above example of the lions scattering is:
Well, the lions have just
been conditioned recently by the noise of modern guns  and so now run
from humans.

Evidence against this argument is with cougars, who are even more
chicken than lions.
They are actually attacted by gunfire, because some of them have
figured out that the sound of rifle
shots = dead deer and will investigate rather than run (until they
spot the hunter). That is probably
how the lions got to the buffalo  after it was shot the night before
by my friend.  Shots = meat.

IMO, cats fear of Homo started in the MSA or earlier. Cats can't stand
to be faced down
by groups of Homo (or even hyenas for that matter). It doesn't mater
if it is spears, rocks,
or guns, they run. As you said, they go after individuals from behind,
from hidding in the bush,
they never attack across open ground, they are simply not programmed
to do so.

No, the point in the buffalo skull is hard evidence Homo the mighty
hunter has been trouble for
big game animals for a good long time.

People&quot; ( Colin ...
An account of this field work was published in 1961 as The forest

Cached - Similar pages - Note this

The book is an Anthropology classic. The dude lived with the Mbuti
pygmi for years, altho not all at once; IIRC, starting back in 1948
before cultural contamination. This is what he said about a time he
followed the hunter into the jungle. Argue with him. Given the
academic standing he seems to have a lotta credibility.

Get your own sources. All I can report on is what I've come across. I
dont claim to know when hominids started carrying sharp sticks. But
given the way tubers are distributed in sandy ground, in clumps or
scattered bunches a few meters apart, a group could go thru harvesting
them and still be close enuf- if the brush is not too high, and they
are tall enuf to see over the grass- to help defend each other while
foraging. And not only for tubers.

The Chad skull from 6mya was in a seasonal river delta, and here too,
the sharp sticks would've been useful to dig clams as well as deter
crocks while doing it. Since the Bonobo have been filmed carrying
sharp bone shards to dig tubers with, I'd expect hominids to be doing
something similar way back.

I think there are records of Amerinds choosing some high spot from
which to throw spears down on Buffalo; Seems like that wouldda worked
in Europe, and certainly, spears would sometimes stick in skulls. Thje
really productive method, recorded by the Greeks, was to choose a
valley, and along the ridgelines on both sides, tie feathers to the
bushes. While one crew does that, another strings a net across a
narrow point in the valley below, then they begin driving whatever is
in the valley twards the net. Game thinks the feathers fluttering are
hunters, so they stay in the valley bottom, then as the beaters get
going, they panic and run.... into the nets where even the women and
kids join in a melee, clubbing everything.

The Scythians did the same sort of thing on horseback, forming a
circle on the steppe 25km across, and driving everything to the
center. In like manner, I remember 'rat killings' on the farm, where
kin and neighbors would show up shortly before the grain harvest.
Farmers left old tin or lumber out in the yard which the rodents would
naturally burrow under and nest in. Then, while we kids stood around
with sticks, the men would lift away the tin or lumber exposing the
rats. The melee was great fun.

its instinctive with us still. Soon as a kid is up and walking in
diapers, if given a stick, he will go around and whack shit with it.
The early agrarian tels along the Danube left us bone middens. And
while there is some deer, bear, bison, elk, or whatever, pound for
pound, the thing they ate the most of was rabbit. Setting rabbit
snares was just so simple; so while the men worked in the fields with
scythes, maddocks, hoes, or whatever, the kids went to get the meat
for the stew pots. But most of what they ate was grain and legumes.

Same deal with the bog body stomachs from the iron age. Some meat was
in the diet, in soup or stews, but most of the carbs came from tubers,
grain, wild seeds, nuts, and other vegetable sources. Yeah, guys love
to go hunting, but it dont really pay that well. I see them all the
time in my neck of Ozark woods... driving by. They only shoot what
they can see from the pickup truck. To much work to actually hike, too
boring to stand around in a deer stand.

You can define the terms any way you like. The 'mighty hunter
mythology' seen in innumerable movies dont look like a pygmy stabbing
an elephant in the ass. The dude knew what he was doing, and bravery
had nothing to do with it. He's not playing toradore. The iconography
we are all familiar with, of killing large animals at close range with
spears, and trying to stay out of the way of the prey animal's
attempts to defend itself has nothing to do with what the pygmy did.

Given the fractures seen on Neanderthal bones, that seem to be what
they were doing. In every culture that I know of, hunter and warrior
are nearly synonymous. And indeed, in primitive hunter graveyards,
there is a remarkably high ratio of parry fractures of the upper arms.
Their constant warfare certainly did demand bravery. The depiction of
bravery had a lot to do with the images of the kings killing lions.
Usually with several arrows already in it, and several slaves around
to help out if need be. If you loose a slave now and then, that's no
biggie, there's plenty of more to be won in battle.

We likewise have lotsa images of aristocrats mounted on horses in
Europe killing bears, deer, wild boar, elk or lion. They'd only  make
those images to pander to the power elite. The digs are revealing a
rather different image. Feel free not to like it.
