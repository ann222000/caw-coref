Tell Your Member of Congress: Don't Eviscerate ENDA

There is a crucial vote on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act
(ENDA) scheduled for tomorrow morning in the House Committee on
Education and Labor. There's a strong possibility that the bill the
committee will vote to mark up will NOT be the same bill we've
supported this year.

If your representative is on the Education and Labor Committee, we
need you to call her or him with the message: do not mark-up ENDA
unless it includes the original language protecting victims of
discrimination based on gender identity.

Capitol Switchboard: 202-224-3121

People For, along with activists and organizations representing both
the civil rights and the LGBT communities, strongly opposes a move
to strip gender identity from the bill's language. Here's why:

*       It violates the spirit and intent of this legislation to
single out one group of people as somehow not worthy of protection
from job discrimination.

*       The years-long battle to pass this historic
nondiscrimination legislation would be undermined by leaving out any
part of the LGBT community.

*       Transgender Americans are perhaps the most vulnerable group
within the LGBT community to various forms of discrimination, so
they arguably need these protections the most.

*       Allowing employers to discriminate based on real or
perceived &quot;gender identity&quot; could also affect people who are not
technically transgender, just based on certain behavioral traits
they may or may not exhibit.

We're committed to passing federal employment nondiscrimination
legislation, but not at any cost. Moving this bill forward without
gender identity will leave an often discriminated-against group of
Americans without protections for the foreseeable future; this is
unacceptable.

Please tell your representative to move the ENDA bill forward ONLY
IF it includes gender identity.

&quot;[T]he job of the gay community is not to deal with extremists who
would castigate us or put us on an island and drop an H-bomb on us.
The fact of the matter is that there is a small percentage of people
in America who understand the true nature of the homosexual
community. There is another small percentage who will never
understand us. Our job is not to get those people who dislike us to
love us. Nor was our aim in the civil rights movement to get
prejudiced white people to love us. Our aim was to try to create the
kind of America, legislatively, morally, and psychologically, such
that even though some whites continued to hate us, they could not
openly manifest that hate. That's our job today: to control the
extent to which people can publicly manifest antigay sentiment.&quot;
