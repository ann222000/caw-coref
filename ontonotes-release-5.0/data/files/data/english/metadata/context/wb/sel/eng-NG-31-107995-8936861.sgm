We just redid our driveway, patio etc with new concrete. It is 6&quot;
gravel, 6&quot; concrete with wire mesh on the driveway and 5+5, no wire
mesh, elsewhere.

Unfortunately, a kid stepped on one place on the driveway and there is
a imprint of his step about 5mm deep or so. My wife is livid about
this, as she is wont to be in general.

So, I am thinking if I can fill the hole.

My idea was to take a solid epoxy 100% solids from raka.com, which I
have, mix with portland cement for color, and apply to the imprint. It
is very clean right now and is not contaminated with oil etc.

Would this work or not? It is in the worst part of the driveway (next
to the road). We have snow, ice, salt, etc.

Go buy a $5 bag of concrete patch mix at Depot. It's a driveway, not a
space shuttle and the patch mix made for the purpose will work just
fine.

why not use a carbon fiber based composite, or fill the thing in with a
titanium casting?

1.) I think there is a latex coating which helps concrete stick to concrete.
B.)  New concrete bonds to itself pretty well.

You will have a hard time getting a perfect color match with any material
other than the same stuff the driveway is made of.  If your wife gets livid
easily, the outline of a footprint in a slightly different color will
probably bother her.

Here's an idea:  Chop out a rectangular recess and inlay a tile with your
house number on it.  Maybe your wife would like a second tile inlaid with
her first name on it.

Or just fill the footprint with a concrete slurry and hope for the best.

There are some high strength, high adhesion cement based products
specifically for the situation. The greener the concrete base, the
better the products will stick. Roughing it out with an air hammer is
even better. You can get the right products at a concrete products
supplier (this is different than the ready mixed delivery services) or a
smaller selection at places like Lowes, Home Despot, or Menards.

Get a new wife and forget about the driveway. Probably not the cheapest
solution though.

Your patch idea will probably NOT work.  Go ahead, you're no
farther behind.  The color will not blend, I suspect.  Make sure
to mask around what you do - see below.

One idea that might work:
Call the concrete man.  Ask if he has a core drill with a large
enough bit to encircle the kid's foot print.  If the print is not
centered, could you drill several holes to create a pattern or
enough to do the address?  Drill and Chip out the circles about
1/2-3/4 deep.  Fill with epoxy or high strength pavement patch,
embed a design or number if desired.  Trying to make square or
diamond, straight line cuts will be quite problematic, that is why
I am suggesting round.  Mask or cover quite an area around the
area, any slop will not clean off and will stain and discolor what
you have.  You will probably be in the next size dog house if you
stain or discolor it.  My dog house has lights and AC!

No matter what kind of patch you do, it will not match the original.
Personally I don't think it is much of a problem.  I have seen concrete jobs
where they deliberately put the kids hand prints in the cement.  So you
could adopt the kid or get a new wife.

Another course of action would be to have that section cut out and then have
an identical section at the other side cut out so they look symmetrical.
Refill with tile,or a paver, or a different color concrete.  As someone else
suggested, cut out the foot print and put new concrete in with your house
numbers etched into the concrete or use some bronze numbers.

I'd go for that. I've patched the old concrete on my walks numerous times,
trying to find something that will last and match. Getting it to last is not
hard. Getting it to match is almost impossible, in my experience.

As for getting it to last, I haven't had much luck with the cheap patching
concrete from Home Depot. The best luck I've had is in using a polymer
bonding &quot;paint&quot; followed by a high-quality, polymer-modified patching
concrete that I got from a professional mason. It's still there after eight
or nine years.

I etch my old concrete with muriatic acid but that isn't necessary with
fresh concrete. That does seem to make a difference when you have to feather
the edges of the patch. But I prefer to undercut the old concrete rather
than feather. In fact, I have a job like that facing me right now, before it
gets cold.

Sinking a bronze or tile marker of some kind into the concrete sounds good
to me. Then I *would* use epoxy, to bond it in place. But I'd make sure it
was a close fit to begin with.

No, no, clearly the only wife acceptable solution will require applying
an additional 1&quot; of concrete to the entire driveway so there are no
areas that don't match. While he's at it he needs to have it colored and
stamped to look like stone.

I'm thinking of using bricks for my front sidewalk, set in sand. It's short,

My brother's a civil engineer and he was telling me about a bridge job

I grew up in a little town in the midwest, and our sidewalks were as
broken and uneven as hell from all the tree roots. I think that gives a
sidewalk character. Where I am now, in Plasticville, they cut down trees
that interfere with a sidewalk, partly out of fear that someone will sue
if he trips. Makes me sick to see a sidewalk given priority over a tree.

Used bricks work well and can easily be repaired if necessary.  For
driveways the 'paver' blocks work out very well and will withstand the
heavier load of the vehicles.  Glen Gerry is one brand of pavers. They
have a big factory on RT 61 in PA near Shoemakersville. A friend of mine
just did his driveway and he located on a main road and has had a number
of inquiries on them.  He is thinking about going into the business of
installing them.  :)

Years ago when my sons and I poured the apron for the rear door of my shop
we all put our hand prints in the wet concrete. Now, 17 years later I get
teary eyed when I look at the size of their handprints and think of the good
times I had with my kids doing projects like that together. My three boys
are 25, 200 and 1700 miles from home with their own families and don't have

Hmm. Diamond-filled?

That kind of upends the idea of concrete as a cheap material.

Better yet, give it to the kid for his birthday present.

&gt; Used bricks work well and can easily be repaired if necessary.  For
&gt; driveways the 'paver' blocks work out very well and will withstand the
&gt; heavier load of the vehicles.  Glen Gerry is one brand of pavers. They
&gt; have a big factory on RT 61 in PA near Shoemakersville. A friend of mine
&gt; just did his driveway and he located on a main road and has had a number
&gt; of inquiries on them.  He is thinking about going into the business of
&gt; installing them.  :)

Oh, yeah. I drive out I-78 regularly. If I had a pickup I probably could
save some money by getting them there.

I've installed pavers in sand around a swimming pool (my parents', not
mine), and it was a pretty good solution to ground that kept settling and to
roots that kept heaving. Every year I'd adjust a few bricks.

Maybe next spring.

&gt;So, I am thinking if I can fill the hole.

&gt;My idea was to take a solid epoxy 100% solids from raka.com, which I
&gt;have, mix with portland cement for color, and apply to the imprint. It
&gt;is very clean right now and is not contaminated with oil etc.

&gt;Would this work or not? It is in the worst part of the driveway (next
&gt;to the road). We have snow, ice, salt, etc.

The kid may be famous someday, making  the piece of driveway with his
footprint worth big bux on EBay.  Ask your livid wife to  sign an
agreement  that you'll own the footprint should she get so livid as to
bail and seek  a more perfect driveway.

Nothing gives sterile concrete more character than the footprint of a
child.

Geez, I encouraged my wee children to make footprints in concrete I'd
poured, floated and trowelled back in the mid-'70's.

Wife-at-the-time later kinda trashed the place later,  but that slab
and the yardbarn that sits upon it are still there.

You have my sympathies.  Ather the divorce, make sure you get a new place
with more space for all your accumulations.

In that case, drill a couple holes with a masonry bit and fill the
hole with cement patch. The kid can have his footprint and your wife
might settle down. By drilling holes, it ensures that it will be less
likely to come out during freeze/thaws.

My brother had his wife and son along along with himself, put their prints
in the driveway.
