I recently bought a 50# box of tubes at auction. Most are pulls that
test good. Many are NOS. Most of the NOS are "Best Test" brand. In looking
at these tubes, I find quite a bit of variety in the way the tube is
numbered, even within the same number tube. Were best test tubes relabeled
from other brands extra stock?  A Google search doesn't reveal anything.
I did find 4 NOS 1L6's in the bottom of the box, and a dozen new 6BZ6
tubes. Not bad for a $10 bid.

No , not bad...
but maybe you did not know that tubes are obsolete...
I think they have transistors now.

Hey...I was just joking you know...the $10 was definately a great deal !

All these "house brand" , "rebranded" or "no-name" tubes came from one of
the main suppliers... Ken Rad, GE/RCA,  Tung Sol,  Sylvania, whoever.  No
small company could afford to make their own.
There have been many stories about them...  that they were the "off spec"
rejects of the major makers,  that they were military surplus,  or, even
stolen from the major makers somehow.

Any, all or none of these stories could be true... I dont know...  our pal
Alan Douglas might have more insight into that...  Alan???

Note that Sylvania crushed and pelletized all their reject tubes

other makers and branders for re-branding, but they never sold second-

By 1950, I believe only Ken-Rad, Tung-Sol, GE/RCA, Sylvania, WE and
Philco survived in any meaningful way as tube-makers in the US. RCA re-

Euro and British tubes (I have a Mullard-made, GE-branded 5AR4 and a

Hygrade Out from Under
Monday, May. 13, 1940
Article Tools

Email

For most of its 40 years in the lighting business, Hygrade Sylvania
Corp. has lived off scraps from other people's patent tables. It has
not been a bad living. Hygrade has missed no dividend since 1921,
earned $856,807 on an $11,022,424 gross last year. But last week
Hygrade directors began to move out from under the table. Gathered in
their Salem, Mass, office, they voted $250,000 (or more if needed) for
a new factory. Its product-to-be: fluorescent lighting, in which
Hygrade owns basic patents of its own.

Hygrade was started by husky, sporting Yankee Frank Poor, later joined
by his brothers Ed and Walter. Once high in the field of 10-watt bulbs
for electric displays, they found after World War I that General
Electric's patents were law-proof, settled down to make bulbs under G.
E. license, on a production quota of 2% of G. E.'s own. Pushing like a
radish sprout under a rock, the Poor Brothers merged with other small
licensees, ran their quota up to 10%, became No. 3 lamp maker (after
G. E. &amp; Westinghouse).

Still pushing, the Poors went into radio tubes, on license from R. C.
A. A merger with Sylvania Products Co. in 1931 got them 100% more tube
capacity, also Hygrade Sylvania's present president, bespectacled
Benjamin Erskine (who owned Sylvania). Now Hygrade is the No. 2 tube
maker, but pays 5% royalties to the No. 1 maker, R. C.'A.

When fluorescent lighting showed commercial possibilities several
years ago, Hygrade researchers went quickly to work. Mercury vapor
inside fluorescent lamps is ionized by an electric discharge between
electrodes at each end, produces short ultraviolet rays which must
then be converted by a fluorescent powder to visible light. In
February Hygrade's chief research engineer, James L. Cox, got an award
from N. A. M. for a new method of coating the lamps with a porous
powder so that longer rays of the visible range are efficiently
radiated. Costly to install, fluorescents waste only 75% of their
energy in heat (incandescents waste 90%), are therefore more
economical than incandescents in many uses. Millions who saw their
cool, ghostly rays at the World's Fairs last summer are already
spending $1,000,000 a week to install fluorescents in factories,
stores, some homes.

=====================================================

SYLVANIA traces its roots back to 1901, when young entrepreneur Frank
Poor became a partner in a small company in Middleton, Massachusetts,
that renewed burned-out light bulbs. The company would buy an old bulb
for a few cents, cut off the glass tip, replace the filament, and
reseal the bulb.

Poor soon moved the business to Danvers, bought out his partner, and
called his new company Bay State Lamp Company. His brothers soon
joined him in the enterprise.

The Poor brothers started the Hygrade Incandescent Lamp Company in
1909 to sell new carbon-filament light bulbs and, by 1911, tungsten
filament light bulbs. The Bay State refilling operation was soon
discontinued. In 1916, Hygrade opened a new plant and headquarters in
Salem, Massachusetts, which could turn out 16,000 lamps a day.

Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, the Novelty Incandescent Lamp Company had
been formed in 1906 to make novelty lights and refill old light bulbs.
After several transitions, the company was finally purchased in 1922
by entrepreneur Bernard Erskine and two associates, who founded the
Nilco Lamp Works. In 1924, Nilco formed the Sylvania Products Company
to make receiving tubes for another new invention that would change
the world: the radio.

In 1931, Hygrade, Nilco and Sylvania representing the company's roots
in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania merged to form the Hygrade Sylvania
Corporation. The company sold lamps under the Hygrade name, and radio
tubes under the Sylvania name. Hygrade Sylvania marketed its first
fluorescent lamp in 1938, developing a complete line of fixtures
called "Miralume." The Sylvan Street plant was opened in Danvers in
1941 to manufacture fluorescent lamps.

In 1942, the company changed its name to Sylvania Electric Products,
Inc., and debuted the "flashing S" logo. The 1940s and 1950s witnessed
enormous growth, as new plants were opened. The company increased its
production of materials and components, phosphors and metals, for
example, used in lighting and other products. Sylvania also expanded
into consumer electronics, television tubes and radios.

How did I get involved with this?

No idea who/what Best Test was. Could be anything from rewashed
pulls to factory seconds to radio mfrs overstock to gov't surplus.

Other active makers would be Amperex, Chatham, Bendix, Eimac and
many smaller ones though admittedly not all made consumer products,
only military tubes.  I'm not aware of any Du Mont - CBS Hytron
connection.

I don't recall the details now - and I may in fact be totally wrong...
but IIRC - when Du Mont disintegrated in the mid 50's - several
divisions were sold off in various directions. *Seems* like the consumer
electronics division went to Emerson (1958?); part went to Paramount
(actually - I think Paramount was already a part owner - as an early
investor - and - Paramount has played "footsie" with CBS over the years
esp. since the "DesiLu" days); part went to Fairchild (which is when,
IIRC they got deeper into test equipment - i.e. o'scopes, etc.).  Maybe
it was Fairchild who in fact wound up with what was left of Du mont's
tube production (along with the CRT facility)... I'm sure someone will
straighten me out..!

Best Test may not be a brand of tubes.  Standard Brand wasn't.  They were
just empty boxes that any tube could be put into.  The brand of the tube is
what is marked on the tube, not necessarily what the box says.

There were off brand tubes like Zaylatron (spelling probably wrong) and
Rad-Tel.  These were used or reject tubes and sold for low prices (33c for
any tube!).  Some of these odd brands clearly marked their tubes as used or
seconds; I have some like that.

These tubes have a Best Test stamp on the tube itself, that is consistent
from tube to tube, but the actual tube numbering changes by font and
placement. For example, and these are all miniatures, some have the tuber
number circling the nipple, while others have a tall-font number on the side
of the tube, and others have a regular font in a box stamped on the side of
the tube.

Hi,
The "how did I get involved?" wasn't aimed at you, just to whoever
originally titled the thread.

Fairchild bought the Du Mont scope business, and made some very
nice ones too (I have one) but I honestly don't know who wound up with
the CRT production facility, if indeed anyone did.  I suspect Du Mont
never made receiving tubes, but had other makers put its brand on
theirs.  However I don't know.

Fairchild bought the CRT / O'scope business in 1960... the write-up here
confirms the "oscillograph and CRT manufacturing":

&lt; http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/D/htmlD/DuMont/DuMont.htm &gt;

Fairchild made scopes with the DuMont name on them as a division of
Fairchild - they made two of the "famous" USM-281 series: the USM-281D/E
(281 &amp; 281A were HP 180/HP182; 281C was a Tek 7603). I remember them as
they used 2N3055 for regulators in the 100V supplies - and if not well
coated with heatsink compound - they would fail. Properly installed -
they'd do fine.  I guess it's also possible Fairchild might have gotten
a so-so batch of 3055's...

Is your DuMont a 281D/E (or it's civilian version DuMont 150)? They were
nice scopes - I liked them better than the HPs - and they were easier to
service than the Teks (those tiny push-button switches on the Teks were
too easy to shear off in the hands of the military apes that used them.
Oooo-- I'm gonna catch it for that - the 281C was spec'd by &amp; primarily
used by the Air Force).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I suspect Du Mont
&gt; never made receiving tubes, but had other makers put its brand on
&gt; theirs.  However I don't know.
">

Now I'm questioning my memory as well - I can't find the article I was
thinking about; and I'm thinking I've confused DuMont with another
company. Right now I haven't time to research it - and it's just not
that important a tid-bit.

Hi Alan, it was me that mentioned you... I thought you could chime in on
tube makers and how the off brands got their tubes.   I know your expertise
is 1920's but thought you might shine some light further.

Hi,
I have the USM-281E, bought non-working at a local hamfest. I've
forgotten what it took to make it run, not much, but I was impressed
with the functional control layout. It's rather different from the Tek
arrangement but I thought was easier to use, once I got familiar with
it.  It wasn't just a "me too" copy of another scope.

Unfortunately Fairchild was too far down the slope to ever come
back. Even HP had trouble competing with Tektronix.  Allen Du Mont had
a huge lead over his competition in the 1940s and blew it.

Yes, I agree completely.  I replaced as many HP 281/As with Dumont 281Es
on as many submarines operating out of Guam as I could. They seemed
tougher (better at absorbing handling bumps, etc. - try "handing up" a
35-40 lb. scope through a 27" hatch without bouncing it off the ladder,
etc.), held calibration better - and (as I noted before) once the series
pass transistors were replaced (been 30 years and I still remember they
were 2N3055s) - the were VERY reliable.

The trouble with HP scopes at that time (mid 60's through mid 70's) was
that HP just couldn't seem to build a scope with easy to set/reliable
triggering to save them. Seems like you'd spend more time fidgeting with
the trigger level knob than looking at the waveform. Real frustrating;
and considering HPs expertise - really bewildering.

Good reason, same width, 88 "holes", some of the early test units used a
modified player mechanism to "read" the "frequency command".  They never
got a practical system working during WWII - in fact it wasn't until the
Cuban missile crisis that the US navy finally had a working system. Of
course by that time the patent had run out - no royalties paid.

Actually - I have no clue what they are - got them so Sherry isn't "out
there" without any way to get help in case of car trouble, etc.

Frankly I'm not sure what GSM / CDMA / XYZ is - never paid any

I doubt anyone could have seriously competed with Tektronix in the scope
business. Seldom have I seen such amazing engineering and build quality
come so consistently over such a lengthy period of time from one high
tech company. All through the 60s and 70s and at least some part of the
80s, Tektronix was making Mercedes while others were making Chevys.
