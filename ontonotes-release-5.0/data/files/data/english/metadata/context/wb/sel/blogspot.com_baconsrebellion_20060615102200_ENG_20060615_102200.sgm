The impact of high gasoline prices on Virginia transportation policy
is prompting more than blog posts at Bacon's Rebellion -- see " Energy
Independence and Sustainability ," " Straight Talk about Gasoline Prices
and Transportation Policy ," " A World with One Billion Cars " and "
Virginia's Vulnerability to Oil Shocks ." There is evidence that
legislators are reappraising their thinking about transportation policy.

Exhibit A: Sen. Martin E. Williams, R-Newport News, chairman of the
state Senate’s Transportation Committee.

As reported by Peter Galuszka in the latest Road to Ruin article, "
Gas Shock ," Williams is a self-described conservative Republican who
for years supported free enterprise, property rights and the extension
of development and roads into the countryside. As gasoline prices have
risen, however, he has come to realize that Virginia's transportation
policy cannot continue as it has. Consequently, he has been willing to
support measures linking land use and transportation that he never would
have before.

“I never thought I would agree with a growth management strategy that
hurts property rights but I am already there,” he says. “We just can’t
accommodate growth in outer areas like we used to.” I'm delighted to see
that Williams is open to change, and I probably shouldn't quibble. But I
just have to set the record straight on one issue. I, too, support free
markets and property rights, but I never equated those with the policies
responsible for the pattern of scattered, disconnected, low-density
development commonly referred to as "sprawl," much less our
sprawl-inducing transportation policy. To the contrary, few sectors of
the U.S. economy are as heavily regulated (zoning codes, subdivision
ordinances, comprehensive plans) and subsidized (road construction, the
pricing of utilities and public services, mortgage financing) as real
estate.

For me, "property rights" means that government should not have the
right to take someone's property, or diminish the value of someone's
property, without compensation. "However, property rights" does not
entitle land speculators to make a profit, nor does it require local
government to extend roads, utilities and public services to any old
place that a developer decides to build a subdivision.

As Sen. Williams thinks through the implications of higher gasoline
prices for transportation policy, I hope he also reconsiders what the
terms "free markets" and "property rights" mean in the context of the
heavily regulated, heavily subsidized real estate sector.

We were going to post a seperate note but this is as good a place as
any the ask the question:

Did anyone else notice that last Saturday's WaPo Real Estate front
page story on gasoline prices ("By the Tank") included a RADIUS MAP!!!

Eat your heart our Business-As-Usual, WaPo has discovered the impact
of Radius Analysis.

Twenty years too Late? At least 10.

Also "we" all do not call it "sprawl," some of us call it what it is
dysfunctional human settlement patterns.

Huh?

Density limitations and large lot restrictions have exactly the
effect of diminishing the value of peoples property without
compensation. At the same time, flood plain restricitons and drainage
requirements actually support the public safetY and health.

How do you distinguish between a land speculator and an owner that
simply can't stand the pain of increased property taxes due to higher
assessments caused by outside demand?

If the county refuses to extend utilities and also refuses the right
to use alternative and privately funded septic systems, for example,
then is that a legitimate safety, health, and financial matter or is
that a charade for NIMBY?

If the county supports services in one place and not another, how is
that any different from the transfer of wealth you note in your comment
on Rail to Dulles?

Given that practically any decision the county makes has some impact
on owners: positive in some cases and negative in others, what kind of
compensation scheme do you think will level the playing field and
encourage those who might be forced to try to develop in unfavored
locations not to?

It seems to me that the desired activites are BOTH encouraging
development in areas the county elects to provide roads and services to
and encouraging those in other places to forestall development and
continue conservation practices.

At present there is far more money devoted to the former than the
latter, and that is a primary cause of disbalance in our communities.
Incentivizing both of those activities will amount to subsidies of one
kind or another, so where does the money come from, who decides how it
will be distributed, and what kind of free market is that?

If you take away what you call the subsidies for far flung roads and
services, what do you replace it with unless you are willing to diminish
the value of someone's property without compensation?

Finally, if you encourge development in some locations above others,
what do you say to people like TMT who say, enough already?

You have a property right to buy a place in the country. You don't
have a property right to demand that the county provide a road, water,
sewer, electricity, cable, trash services to your property. Or, the
county could help provide some of those support services and demand fees
for them.

Loyal lawyers, do the Virginia and local codes place a legal
requirement for those infrastructure services on government?

Glad I saw Ray Hyde's post before I put up mine. I'm not disagreeing
with Ray, just asking questions.

The classical poli sci definition of 'politics' from the 1950s
(Lasswell) is "who gets what". Every decision on land use and taxes
creates winners and losers. Every single one.

I've proposed that we be guided by priniciples. Maybe I'll do another
Rebellion piece on those principles.

Ray, you said: "Density limitations and large lot restrictions have
exactly the effect of diminishing the value of peoples property without
compensation."

I agree totally. That's why I oppose most density limitations and
large-lot restrictions.

You ask: "If the county supports services in one place and not
another, how is that any different from the transfer of wealth you note
in your comment on Rail to Dulles?"

I'd be open to the idea that counties should be required to extend
services to anyone who wants them, with one caveat : that the developer
(and/or landowners) be willing to pay the locational-variable costs.

No one should plop down a subdivision in the middle of nowhere and
demand as a right for government to extend water, sewer, roads, etc.,
and provide for police, fire, rescue, schools, at the same price as
citizens living in more efficient locations.

The difference with the Rail-to-Dulles situation is that the property
owners don't want to pay for the cost of extending Metro to Dulles. They
want to reap the benefits with none of the cost. The schema that I laid
out is fully consistent with the philosophical principles I've
consistently stated.

The radius map is only important if you think the central area is the
only destination of importance.

It seems to me that the impending redevelopment of Tyson's and other
locations shows that such a centralized way of thinking is outmoded and
unuseful. To the extent that it is still useful, the radius map is no
surprise. It has long been understood that people mae rational decisions
that combine the costs of travel and the costs of housing: it should be
no surprise that those who are considering changes (those that read the
real estate section) would continue to take such costs into account.

What would be more useful is a map that shows the combined cost
contours for housing and travel, and that map should show the contours
of equivalent costs not just for the the center but for the major
employment centers.

Such a map would likely show broad areas of equivalent costs away
from the centers and smaller areas of equivalent but higher costs
elsewhere. To a buyers those factors equate to risk and reward, which is
the primary motivator for speculators of all types.

Ray, You seem to be under the misapprehension that "the central area"
of the Washington metropolitan statistical area (or New Urban Region)
includes only Washington and, perhaps, Arlington/Alexandria. Tysons
Corner may not stand at the geographic "center" point of the region, but
as it re-develops into an urban area, is is becoming part of the
region's urban core. It's right off the Beltway and it has access to the
Metro. By comparison to Leesburg or Quantico, Tysons is centrally
located.

"No one should plop down a subdivision in the middle of nowhere and
demand as a right for government to extend water, sewer, roads, etc.,
and provide for police, fire, rescue, schools, at the same price as
citizens living in more efficient locations."

I sort of agree, but the fact is that you don't get the same police
fire and rescue services, let alone the others, at least not for many
years. By itself that amounts to diminishing your property value, which
of course is how you are able to sell. By the time you get those
services, it is because the demand is high enough to make their
provision "efficient".

How often do you re-assess the location variable costs? The first row
of townhomes in Centreville took an enormous risk. Suppose they paid for
the new infrastructure they required, and later other people came along
to take advantage of it. Should they get some of their money back?

What if the cost of providing that infrastructure was so high that
the risk was no longer justified? Everybody in Centreville would have
wound up in TMT's back yard.

Wouldn't that result in a tremendous transfer of wealth to those that
live in areas where infrastructure exists?

Let's face it. If Metro had to pay its own full locational costs, it
would shut down tomorrow, and yet Metro is still an undeniable benefit
to the region as a whole. No one knows where the benefits accrue or how
to pay for them, but surely taking money from people who choose a
different mode is unnacceptable.

Right now you claim that scattered development is subsidized. Just
because centralized development is claimed to be more efficient (and the
evidence from taxes and housing costs does not support this), does that
mean that development there is not also subsidized?

What we are quibbling about is the efficiency of the subsidy, not the
fact of it. But any measuremnt of efficiency has to consider time and
that is what is lacking in cost of services studies that are frequently
used to support your position. They are a snapshot of current conditions
and not an average over time. The situation in Centreville now is a lot
different than it was 20 years ago, but if it had to meet your criteria,
it would never have been built.

Even if a new area provided all its own infrastructure through
develper and owner contributions, eventually the time comes when the
area is sufficiently developed that it is efficient for the government
to take over the roads, etc. Otherwise you have a hodgepodge of tolls
and fees and banruptcies like we had in the 1800's. No one seriously
wants to go bac to that, so how do we work it in such a way that it is
fair to all, suppports conservation where we need it, supports
development where we need it, and halfway makes sense?

As it stands now we ARE imposing large lot restrictions mostly as a
means of directing development to other areas. The large lots mean that
you will pay more for living in such areas, which in some way supports
your idea of paying more to live in remote areas. Where the problem is
again falls to a matter of time. Time is cheap to the government, but
dear to mortals. An area may be designated for large lots, and that is
fine for a time. But eventually conditions will change and the
ordinances not, or not so fast. If new demand develops, it pushes up
prices and assessments, making the large homes and lots unsustainable,
yet there is no effective way out, and no way to agree on when the
appropriate time is to change the rules.

Even where infrastructure exists, new development means that you
still need more of it: a refrain we frequently hear from TMT. If we
consider time as an element, how do we know whether a Centerville
solution is a better solution than say, redeveloping all Bailey's
Crossroads?

Exactly my point. Where was the center on the map in the Post, and
what was the diameter of the "Bull's eye"? It now appears that the
"center" of the region is becoming an elongated L shape, one leg of
which is the entire corridor from Dulles to downtown.

If you make that the bull's eye, then the radius map looks a lot
different, and so does the transportation plan needed to support it.

But my real point is that distance is unimportant by itself. What
matters is the combination of distance and housing costs.

JAB:

You have a right to buy a property in the country. Presumably it will
be served by some kind of county road. (That road might be a dirt road
that any developer would be fined for leaving unprotected.)

Suppose you are willing to share the (small use) of that road and
share your property with another buyer. Your neighbor on the other side
of the road is unwilling to share, so he opposes your sale. How does the
county pick and choose over whose rights prevail?

Your neighbor across the road drives all the way to U of MD. to
teach, and in doing so he traverses and causes additional congestion in
TMT's piece of the planet. Your prospective new buyer is a local
teacher. How do you decide what principle prevails, and how are TMT's
right protected?

All the while you own the property, the county retains the right to
take some or all of it for a new road or school to support other new
residents. Under Kelo, the county also retains the right to manage your
property for greater tax production. Presumably, that could also be
interpreted to mean that the county has the right to manage your
property for minimum tax expense impact.

If the county has all those rights, then where exactly are the owners
rights? What is left to him is only the right to stagnate.

Even if the government builds a new road across your property, they
could still prohibit you from developing part of the remaining property
on the basis that you might use the road!

If you have a place in the country, you are not going to get water,
sewer, cable, or trash service unless you pay for it yourself. You might
get some police and fire service, but you will have to wait a long time
for it to arrive, and it may be a volunteer, not a professional.

If you plan to put up a thousand homes, that is obviously different
than if you put up one, but the rules are largely applied the same for
all, with the result that the rules actually favor the large scale
development we wish to prevent, or at least direct to the correct
locations.

Jim: "No one should plop down a subdivision in the middle of nowhere
and demand as a right for government to extend water, sewer, roads,
etc., and provide for police, fire, rescue, schools, at the same price
as citizens living in more efficient locations."

I'd modify that to say: "No one should plop down a high-rise condo or
a whatever in the middle of somewhere and demand as a right for
government to extend water, sewer, roads, etc., and provide for police,
fire, rescue, schools, where existing capacity to serve is inadequate
without providing sufficient contributions to the cost of extending such
infrastructure."

Clearly, there must be a balance between the rights and obligations
of both existing residents and newcomers. It would be unfair, for
example, for a county to impose impact fees for schools on an
age-restricted community (i.e., 55+). It is not unfair, however, for
that same county to impose impact fees for roads, parks, libraries,
police, fire, etc. on the age-restricted community.

I don't see a difference in principle as to whether the new
development occurs in the middle of nowhere or in the middle of
somewhere. Development requires infrastructure regardless of where it's
located. A fair share of the the costs for that infrastructure should be
recovered from the new development.

I would readily agree that the infrastructure costs would vary
depending on where the new development is located. There may be
instances where an established community has spare capacity in a
category of public facilities. For example, the District of Columbia has
an excess of public school classrooms. Assuming for the moment that
those facilities are adequate for their purpose, adding new homes -- SF
or condos -- in an area with surplus classroom space has adds no
incremental cost to the existing commuity. On the other hand, adding the
same number of homes to a small community in western Loudoun County, for
example, would likely create a substantial incremental cost for schools
because there is (presumably) no excess classroom capacity on our
western Loudoun County town.

But move our new development from Washington, D.C. to Tysons Corner
and we might not have excess classroom capacity at Marshall High School
or the various schools feeding Marshall (Marshall serves the Tysons
Corner area.) If no such excess capacity exits, there is a brand new
incremental cost for constructing new classroom capacity in Fairfax
County to serve the new development. Those costs are just as real as the
ones incurred by my small town in western Loudoun County. Moreover, I
submit that the basic cost structure in Fairfax County per unit
constructed or remodeled is likely to be much higher than the costs per
unit in rural Loudoun.

In theory, this should all be addressable. The appropriate county
boards should be able to insist on proffers sufficient to cover a fair
share of the necessary classroom space in either Loudoun or Fairfax
Counties. The data suggest that Loudoun County officials would negotiate
fair cash proffers. But then there's the current Fairfax County gang
that will not negotitate fair proffers. Even the new higher (but
well-below what's obtained nearby) target proffer for Fairfax Schools
still contains a discount for the use of trailers. Maybe that's why we
have so many trailer posing as classrooms in Fairfax County. Until
voters can clean house in Fairfax, especially at the Chairman level,
there's going to be more opposition to development in Fairfax County.
Many of us would rather see the sprawl continue given the policies of
our supervisors.

Comrades:

Am I reading PRAVDA? The government does not, necessarily, extend
water, sewer, cable, etc. It only does this if it WANTS to. The private
sector does all of this - but only if the government doesn't buy the
space.

I am really perturbed that a blog published by intelligent folks is
espousing that government infrastructure (other than roads) is to blame
for this.

Please, (insert Deity here), grant some wisdom!

9:14 - At the risk of being too flip, I must ask: Whether you
understand what level of public investment is necessary to support
development? No one's talking about extending wires and cables. Verizon,
Cox, Comcast, Dominion Power all do a good job of that.

But, at least in Fairfax County, the government is involved in the
extension of roads, sewer, water, schools, libraries, parks, police,
fire, and Metrorail. Have you ever read a government's capital
improvement plan? Where, pray tell, do the funds for this infrastructure
come except for taxpayers and, in some instances, ratepayers? The
commenters in this discussion do understand reality.

WOW - I think we've hit the mother lode in terms of THE issue.

My view:

On one side we have folks who think it is the responsibility of
government through taxes on property and gasoline to provide roads,
water and sewer to whoever wants it wherever they wants it whenever they
want it no matter the scope and scale required.

On the other side, we have folks who think that each person should
pay their pro-rata share according to their wants and useage.

Notice I've carefully not used the term "need" because that implies
that a "want" is legitimate because it is expressed as a "need".

I'll admit from the get-go that local governments DO make winners and
losers when they designate where growth is intended to occur and
appropriate infrastructure provided to support it.

I'd point out also that governments are NOT required to provide one
with water/sewer merely because their drainfield is failing. There are
provisos that include the cost of extending water/sewer AND
geography/gravity.

Further - where I live - if one wants water/sewer - one pays a
substantial availability fee that goes into the captial facilities fund
- to upgrade/replace the water/sewer infrastructure that was allocated
to your use.

Further, you pay monthly for your use and if your use is high you'll
pay much more than those that use less.

Ditto with electricty, phone, cable... you name it - EXCEPT roads
which most people view as "free" and we all are getting a reality check
with the Virginia GA budget process and transportation "needs".

The truth of the matter is that roads cost BIG money - not only
interstates, but primaries and secondary roads that primarily serve
subdivisions and homes - which are also known as settlement patterns.

The "theory" is that the gasoline tax collected from each user will
recover that users "fair share" via gasoline tax according to how much
gasoline they use.

In my opinion - this is like charging someone 1/10th of the true cost
of water/sewer and then attempting to recover the actual costs from all
taxpayers.

One penny increase in the gasoline tax in Va will generate about 80
million dollars I believe. Lemme see, aren't we talking about a billion
dollar shortfall? Hmm... so.. we'd need to raise the gasoline tax by 15
cents or so to generate the billion. But wait.. there's MORE. Even if
our elected were brave enough to commit Hari Kari.. the economic folks
tell us that increasing gasoline cost results in less gasoline use....

So.. choose your poison - higher gasoline taxes and/or toll roads/et
al pick em...

BUT the bottom line IS.. as this BLOG and countless news
organizations are reporting that folks who Choose to commute longer
distances to work... ARE going to pay a LOT more than they used to - AND
it will affect their decisions about WHERE to live in terms of How Far
and/or what mode of mobility they will use.

So.. will higher fuel prices result in changes in settlement
patterns? Will the growth rates currently being experienced by counties
like Loudoun, Stafford, etc... start dropping as the price of commuting
goes up?

Lots of food for thought. :-)

I think Larry has pretty well covered the territory and I also think
the final answer will be some of all of the above.

His comment about charging 1/10th the cost of sewer and then
spreading the difference among all taxpayers is exactly on target: this
is exactly what we do with real estate tax. The rates are set such that
the argument is made that residential housing does not pay its own way.
This is true whether it is new development or not.

We are doing the same with the gas tax. We have refused to set the
tax where it needs to be for political reasons.

In both cases we now have a cash shortfall that cries out for tax
adjustments that match the changes in the rest of the economy, but we
are ideologically opposed to "new taxes".

With respect to gas taxes, the current plan is to avoid that form of
hari kiri by diverting the blame for the inevitable cost increases to
some faceless foreign owned company. And notice that their contracts
WILL allow for toll increases to match inflation and traffic carried.
Those are the same increases we have refused to apply to the gas taxes.

Surely there are locational costs that need to be addressed, and just
as surely there is a general benefit of increased infrastructure to
everybody. For example, I live on the fringe. If I have to call a fire
truck, there is one station available. If the fringe later builds out
beyond me, eventually those people will have to pay for a new fire
station to serve them, but now there are two stations available to me if
there is a multi-alarm fire. The down side is that all those people who
built farther out will now be using "my" roads to travel past me to get
to work.

But, If I happen to be a fireman, I now have th opportunity to
commute the other direction.......

So this all comes doen to a matter of balance. No one answer is going
to be sufficient and focusing on any one solution is counterproductive.
Furthermore, balance is a dynamic condition: it is one that is always
changing and so claiming that only one kind of settlement pattern
"works" is nonsense.

What we really need to consider is what kind of settlement pattern
adapts to changes most easily over the long term. That settlement
pattern will adjust to changes with the least pain and angst and
expense.

Any attempt to prevent change can only create more unstable
conditions in the long run. Those attempts currently take many forms
such as flood plain restrictions, historical districts, agricultural
districts, conservation easements etc. etc.

That is not to say that we don't have important resources that
deserve protection.

So, if we agree that some benefit of infrastructure accrues to all;
if we agree that there are local costs in addition to general costs; if
we agree that we need to plan ahead for flexibility; if we agree that
the urban footprint is much larger than the urban area; if we agree that
urban and rural areas are mutually dependent, then we have to come to
the conclusion that some level of investment in prospective development
is important in both places.

That investment is going to be over and above our apparent current
needs, but it is the investment that prevents nonsense like Faifax
administrators working in the Taj Mahal of administrative building while
Fairfax children attend overcrowded schools supplemented with trailers.

We can sit around and point fingers at everybody else as the ones
that are causing "the problem", but we have met the enemy and it is us.
Or as Larry says, pick your poison.

I am not convinced that there is such a thing as "more efficient
locations". If that was true taxes in arlington would be the lowest
around. I'm also not convinced that the proposed location variable costs
are anywhere near as high as some people claim, and furthermore to the
extent that they are, it really represents an investment in future
flexibility: our cost accounting is not taing into account the
governments long view of things.

I don't see any way around it. We need more conservation and we need
more development. Both of them are expensive, and taken together they
are more expensive than either one singly.

It is going to cost more money than we are now spending, and now we
face the political reality of whose pockets it is coming out of. No
single answer will work, and ideology is the enemy. We will need to
exploit every good idea from traffic management, to better sewage
treatment, and we will all have to pay more to implement the ideas. At
the same time, every good idea that works will become a valuable
business for someone.

While we are going forward we need to examine what looks like good
ideas, such as Metro West and Albemarle place. If they turn out to be
not what we think then (proponents or opponents) should be prepared to
admit we were wrong, and learn from our mistakes.

One thing that I am sure will fail is the idea of a strategic
stalemate.

I have promoted the idea that some of our transportationproblems can
be eased by creating new jobs in places other than the central areas.
The following was taken wholesale from the Virginia Centrist blog and it
is entirely out of it's intended context. But I was particularly
attracted to the notion of relocating certain functions from high cost
urban locations.

What was that about efficient locations again?

a non-blogging state employee said...

Understandably this whole debate in the primary was missing some
important nuance.

An idea termed rural outsourcing or farmsourcing looks at the
significant technology infrastructure investments in Rural America since
the 1990s (broadband, wireless, etc) and considers how some industries
might utilize that technology to locate in the American back country
just as easily as in Bangalore.

There are a few recent examples in Virginia you could identify with
this. Here are two:

1) The location of high end IT jobs from Northrop Grumman and CGI-AMS
in Russell County

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/01/AR2006010101034.html

http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0223/p02s01-usec.html

2) VEDP's new distributed services initiative encouraging in-state
relocation of certain functions from high cost urban locations to rural
ones

More Jobs in More Places - a factoid and a bit of speculation. Nissan
is moving its North American headquarters from California to near
Nashville, TN because of California's high taxes and high cost of
living. Not exactly Russell County, but the principle is the same.

Virginia's year-to-year state spending increases are out-of-control
and our Governor and state Senate seem to think that the biennial
solution is higher taxes. But then, California is much different from
Virginia, isn't it?

Second item. At the present time, a very high concentration of
defense and homeland security contractors are located in NoVA. Do we
have the equivalent of a single point of failure? Obviously, these
contractors are not all located in one complex, but do the Departments
of Defense and Homeland Security become concerned that a serious
disruption in NoVA effectively creates a serious disruption in the
government's contractor base? If so, do they begin to put pressure on
contractors to have a base of operations that is not in NoVA? Do some
contractors with operations outside NoVA (in much less expensive areas)

Some years ago the Vint Hill Base near Warrenton was closed down. the
county has (ineffectively) tried to redevelop it ever since. The sole
successful part of the operations were the capture of a big FAA facility
and the development of a number of large single family homes.

The county government has recently turned down the redevelopment
authority's request for another thousand homes.

Maybe instead, they should put the fences back up with some new
office buildings and create a private version of Fort Belvoir for
homeland security and other government contractors.

Hear is a link to a story about aging planned subdivisions. It seems
that as existing infrastructure ages, it costs more to replace than
planned. Accordingly the homeowners associations are assessing new and
additional fees, but only on the new buyers in the development.

According to the article....

"Lake Ridge recently began charging new homeowners a one-time $500
fee, and Reston residents recently approved a $250 fee for people who
buy new homes there."

"The older the communities get, the more cash they need," said John
Rhodes, executive vice president of Legum and Norman, a residential
management company.

and

"Many older communities are low on funds to keep up and replace their
pools, centers and trails. That's because previous boards of directors
tried to keep homeowner fees low or were prevented from increasing fees
by the group's bylaws".... "It was well-intentioned but misguided,"
.....

Sound familiar? Isn't that the same thing that is happening to the
community at large?

"Local real estate agents say they are not enthused about the
fees...... "There are some significant questions about its
enforceability and fairness....."This is an existing community imposing
this fee on new purchasers."

Does this sound familiar, too?

"At the time Lake Ridge was developed, there were no proffers, the
voluntary fees developers pay to support such county services as fire
stations, libraries and schools. But Ken Thompson, an original developer
of Lake Ridge, said the developers tried to be responsible, donating
open space and land for schools and a library.

Though the donations were generous, the open space -- trees and
trails and the picturesque Occoquan Reservoir -- that still makes Lake
Ridge desirable was more upkeep than people thought, resident Linda
McCabe said."

And there you have it in a nutshell: conservation is expensive,
existing development is expensive, taxing newcomers additional fees
because existing residents have not paid enough is unfair, and part of
the problem was caused by limiting increases in homeowner fees to 5% a
year, which, over time, was not enough as it turns out.

If you ever wanted an exact proxy, analogy, or a sample experiment to
show you exactly what is happening in the larger society, this is it.

re: more jobs in more places

okay - you won't find a person more concerned about growth and
transportation and quality of life and ways to come up with a better
way.. more efficient.. more equitable and less damaging to the
environment.. but basic economic realities have to be reconciled..
accepted.. and acknowledged as .. well as realities.

Companies locate where it is in their best interests. That's where
their enterprise can find adequate qualified labor at a competitive
wage... and where they can operate successfully.. i.e. selling goods
and/or services for a profit.

There are literally thousands of places in the USA that do not have
population pressures, growth, overloaded transportation systems, loss of
habitat.. etc... just wander though places like Iowa, Kansas, Missouri,
Arkansas, or even Southwest Va .. Kentucky, WVA, etc. They would just
LOVE the kinds of "problems" that NoVA has.

But we cannot and should not force companies to NOT locate in the DC
area and instead suggest they go to these other places.. can you?

Would you do that to a company any more than you would tell people
that they cannot come here to take a job and find a place to live?

( as an aside.. you COULD tell the Feds to move to other places.. and
the private contractors would follow).

But.. in general, the phrase - "more jobs in more places" ... is this
really a practical thought for most companies and most urban areas that
attract companies? I know I'm ignorant.. so if I'm not seeing this..
please feel free to further my education.

re: publically funded infrastructure - is also NOT economic reality
if there is not a close relationship between USE and COST. If we provide
ANY service at the same equivalent low cost to everyone no matter what
their useage then we WILL create a situation that is not sustainable.
Sooner or later.. people will use more than is available.

Try the publically-funded road solution with water/sewer or
electricity.. and see what happens.

The same thing that has happened with roads will happen with
water/sewer/electric... we'll bankrupt those services.

People will wash their cars every day and leave the hoses running...
or everyone will get a swimming pool and fill it up every time it gets a
little dirty... folks will turn on every light and device that consumes
electricity and leave them on all day long.. etc. Heck..people will buy
plug-in electric cars and fuel them for peanuts...

This is what has happened with roads... (in my view). People drive as
often and as far as they want because there is virtually no disincentive
to doing so.

The actual costs of their driving are not allocated to them when they
purchase fuel. We all basically pay a token amount of tax for roads and
have no incentives to "save" like we must with other services that DO
charge according to how much we use.

I do think.. that once folks each have to pay a realistic cost for
driving - defined as what it takes to provide enough/adequate funding
for roads - then the issue about settlement patterns, growth, affordable
housing, proffers, etc .. will begin to change because, in essence,
these issues are dysfunctional responses to the fact that we do not
charge what we should for transportation in the first place.

$5 a gallon gasoline ... or 25 cents a mile toll... I predict.. will
have a profound impact on many of these issues.

I agree that people should pay a realistic price for driving, and I
fault the government for not stepping up to the plate and incrementally
raising the gas tax every year since 1987. Had they done they we would
not have to take the sudden jolt of pain that is coming. Over the years
many people might have made other living choices as a result, and *some*
of our sprawl and transportation problems might be different.

I'd prefer fuel tax over tolls because we have the method already in
place, it charges for weight and distance, and we could apply it to home
heating as well as travel. It would not require expensive toll stations
and equipment or cause the inevitable delays and it is universal as
opposed to locational. If the tax was set at a realistic level, then it
would not be a token payment.

Companies locate where it is in there best interests. In DC the Fed
provides a powerful self interest, and in HR it is the Navy, shipyards,
etc. But when the central areas become to expensive or too vulnerable,
then it is in companies interest to find other areas. Yet what we see
here is a cry to keep them in confined spaces, which not only increases
their costs, but creates enormous traffic problems.

Businesses are moving out of the central area, and some of them even
to other states, like the heating and cooling company owner I quoted. We
are still constructing arterail travel systems that no longer meet our
needs.

Maybe we can't force companies NOT to locate in an area. Yet we do
exactly that to homeowners through large lot restrictions. Those
restrictions penalize some owners and please others, but the net result
is to forcibly create a denser labor market than might otherwise occur.
This creates a windfall for land owners in the denser areas and a denser
labor market for businesses: it is a subsidy for business.

I view Metro as a huge subsidy for business. It has done nothing to
alleviate congestion but it does allow a larger labor market to reach
the central areas.

While Jim Bacon and others view sprawl as being massively subsidised,
I think the evidence shows just the opposite. We know the central areas
are higher taxed and more expensive overall. It is difficult and
expensive to attract and retain people who are willing to subject
themselves to either the expense or the commute. So why does the
situation persist?

In part it doesn't and we see businesses moving out. In part it is a
matter of time. In part it is because we massively subsidize the ability
of business to stay there via Metro and our continued emphasis on
arterial roads.

When DC and other cities ask for commuter taxes the reason is that
they want to be able to subsidize the services that they provide to
business, and at the workers expense. Charging locational costs that are
higher than justified in outlying areas has the same effect.

And you are right about the Feds. FBI is in West Virginia. Why is the
Agriculture department downtown? And a lot of what contractors do can be
done elsewhere as well.

We can not and should not force companies to locate in other places,
but we don't have to subidise them to locate where they will cause
problems either. I'd say allowing a company to locate where it will
cause environmental and safey and economic problems through increased
traffic congestion is at least as undesirable as allowing residential
development in a flood plain. We don't seem to have any problem in
prohibiting the latter, why not the former?

As for suggestions, I don't see why not. We suggest that people live
in TOD, what's the difference? If we can define a *legitimate* safety
and health issue then government has a responsibility to act.

I come at it 180 degrees away from Jim Bacon, but I come to the same
conclusion: we need to back off the building restrictions and let things
happen. Here is where we differ. Having done that (relieving building
restrictions), we need to do two things: charge fair and realistic
locational costs and step up to whatever transportation needs result.
Those transportatin needs will also have to be paid for by fair and
realistic locational costs.

My observation and prediction is that if that actually happens, then
the costs associated with cities will limit their density. That is why
we have air rights limitations in New York, for one extreme example.

If I'm wrong and the kind of density develops that needs and can
support subways etc. then fine. If I'm right, then we should stop
whining and build a road network that works. Either way, the users
should pay something near the full costs, but not all.

I don't think that is going to happen. What I think will happen is
that a powerful few will continue to suck the life out of the
countryside to benefit a few landowners as Jim Bacon has observed. They
will preserve their water at our expense and after they foul the water
they will ship the sludge and garbage back to the country.

I think we need to think more carefully about who is incentivised for
what, and what the results are.

GAS SHOCK WRAP UP

Peter’s story upon which Jim builds in this post does a fine job of
laying out the basis for “Gas Shock” applying MainStream Media reporting
and protocols. Jim’s responses to comments in this string are right on
target.

This string has covered some good ground but has gone about as far as
it can go without a transformed perspective of some participants.

Over the course of this and related strings at Bacons Rebellion Blog
spanning the last few years those who started out just wanting to
justify subdividing their land outside the Clear Edge for urban uses are
still searching for ways to avoid reality – all be it in a less
confrontational manor. They have not yet come to recognize many of the
complexities and forces causing settlement pattern dysfunction.

The same is true for some inside the Clear Edge who just wanted
housing, jobs and traffic to go somewhere else.

Larry Gross capped off the Gas Shock discussion with an observation
that may be paraphrased / expanded as follows:

In a large nation-state with a robust economy and far more land
devoted to (and speculatively held for) urban land uses than there is
any foreseeable need, enterprises, talented (Creative Class) citizens
who have a choice and those seeking to better themselves (legally and
illegally in the US of A) will all choose to move to large, fast growing
New Urban Regions.

This reality is based on the fact that these places are where there
is opportunity to prosper and succeed. They move to the places where,
under the current rules of the game, they believe their goals are most
likely to be achieved.

Forcing these enterprises and citizens to go to other places where
those new jobs or that talent is “needed” smacks of a “planned economy”
with a Five Year Plan and will fail as have all such plans.

Most commentors at Bacons Rebellion seem close to admitting that
within large, prosperous New Urban Regions the governance agencies have
set up the wrong processes and incentives to guide location decisions
and that citizens and organizations have made location decisions that
are not in their own best interest.

So what of Gas Shock? Gas price increases, added gas taxes and tolls
and other user fees will cause changes but not Fundamental Changes.

In a democracy with a market economy a Fundamental Change in
settlement patters and a Fundamental Change in governance structure
requires better informed citizens to make more intelligent decisions in
the voting booth and in the market place. Thus the importance of
PROPERTY DYNAMICS.

An important first step is to get past a few simplistic bromides that
float around dressed up as “solutions.”

It is very clear that it is not enough to change the location of new
economic activity by spreading jobs around. New job and other economic
activity has to be focused in Balanced, Alpha Communities both inside
the Clear Edge and in Balanced But Disaggregated Communities Outside the
Clear Edge.

In both cases the key is to fairly allocate all the location variable
costs. This is not the five or six directly related to the conversion of
nonurban (open) land to urban uses. Roadways, water, sever, schools,
fire and safety are important but they are only 5 to 8 (depending on how
they are classified and grouped) of the 40 +/- location dependent goods
and services upon which the Cost Of Services Curve is based.

It is also clear that setting lot size minimums does not “lower” the
value of land. These controls raise the value of more land because it
forces developers to convert more land to urban uses than they would
otherwise do. Land that is poorly located for urban land uses is
devalued by compact development because there is more land now held for
(dreamed of selling for) urban uses than can possibly be used. The fear
of lost value is the root cause of the whining about “crowding” by those
who have “escaped” to large lots and want to be sure their value does
not go down when reality sinks in and those who what to subdivide their
land.

The prior paragraph is prove by the market for quality urban space.
Units in places with density at and above 10 persons per acre at the
Community scale sell for more than those in lower density places and
have for the past 50 years. In Village-scale station areas served by
shared-vehicle systems, the value per square foot of residential and
nonresidential uses far exceeds even the most lavish McMansion on a
large lot or the most up scale “town center.”

Any rational observer can come to understand exactly what will happen
when the traditional municipal location and density requirements are
removed. It is called the Greater Houston New Urban Region.

For non-residential land uses (15 to 20 percent of the total) there
are pods of employment / enterprise uses

A high-rise core that is now acquiring a shared-vehicle system

Refineries, docks, warehouses and low-value fabrication along the
ship canal,

Warehouses and high-value fabrication near the airports

Agglomerations of service and office uses at “Freeway” interchanges.

The remaining 80 to 85 percent of the urban land uses – residential
and residential service uses are scattered across millions of acres.

The residential uses are agglomerated at the dooryard, cluster and
neighborhood scales (with a few villages-scale and community-scale
agglomerations) in widely dispersed areas. True to the market reality
noted above, those residential uses located in Community scale
agglomeration above 10 persons per acre have far high values. But at the
dooryard and cluster scale almost all live in components of settlement
patterns that would fit in Alpha Communities except that they are
scattered across the landscape.

Oh yes, the traffic congestion and immobility are among the worst in
the US of A.

This is what happens if you remove the “traditional” settlement
pattern “controls” but do not allocate all the location variable costs
fairly.

After getting past the non-solutions citizens must come to understand
the “Five Critical Realities that Shape the Future” at
www.baconsrebellion.com and understand how to start the process of
implementing the Six Overarching Strategies in PART FOUR of The Shape of
the Future.

The first of the Six Overarching Strategies is to fairly allocate
cost of location variable costs. There is no need for new controls or
incentives, the market will take care of the evolution of functional
human settlement patterns.

Ed, What I'd like to see -- perhaps in a future full-length column --
is a discussion of the 40 location-variable costs. What are they? And
how might they be altered to be "fairly" allocated? I totally agree with
you in the abstract. But the devil is the details. How is a concept like
the "fair allocation of of location-variable costs" applied in real
life?

Jim:

Interesting you should raise these questions.

We have just completed a cycle of intense discussion on that very
topic with a person well trained in the natural sciences.

A scientist who held senior positions in government and the
Smithsonian recently undertook to critically read every page of “The
Shape of the Future.” He stumbled over the Cost of Service Curve when
first encounter in Chapter 2 Box 3. He called it “Humbug.”

After a series of exchanges he has now come to the conclusion that
the Cost of Services Curve is a valid representation of the summation of
location-variable costs.

As suggested above, that conclusion is very important to the fair
allocation of location-variable costs.

I have just gone back over Chapter 24 which is devoted to the
strategy of the rational allocation of location-variable costs. I think
the answers you seek are there. After reading the chapter, if you have
specific questions, I might recast some of the recent exchange into a
column on the topic.

You will also need to look at Chapter 2 Box 3 and Chapter 4 Box 5 and
Box 6.

Two threshold observations:

If citizens understood that the location-variable services were not
being fairly charged they would demand immediate change because the
majority are subsidizing a minority. That is not a popular condition in
a democracy.

None of the “Cost of Services” studies carried out by governance
agencies we have reviewed are worth the paper they are written on
because they focus on just the services provided by municipal agencies
(5 or 6 out of 40 +/-) and the costs are not allocated by organic
component of settlement pattern.

Finally, a Note on the quantity “40 +/-” : The work of graduate
students upon which the Cost of Service Curve is based first started by
listing the goods and services that contemporary citizens demand /
expect. We came up with between 39 and 42 depending on how several (e.g.
micro wave transmissions) were classified and combined. In Chapter 24
Box 3 we used “30 to 40” as the number of services. With the writing of
Handbook we shifted to use of “40 +/- ” because the number changes and
morphs as new technology comes on line.

It is clear that every good and service has some location-variable
cost component. We eliminated those where the costs of transport from
source to user were generally factored into the cost. For instance food
at the super market or at the farmers market includes, or should
include, transport cost.

So the Cost of Services is based on the goods and services that
involve or result in specific expenditures that vary based on the
location.

Let me know if you have questions after reading Chapter 24.

I'll agree that every service has some location variable cost
component.

However, we have been over this before, and most of the services you
describe are commercial services. The forty plus services actually boil
down to a handful, of which five account for almost all the cost.
Schools, roads, fire, and police, garbage disposal. Everything else is
minor, commercial or exists only in some locations, where it is charged
as an extra, as in sewer and water service.

I'm glad you brought up the subject of transport cost for food.
Doesn't that imply that every neighborhood should have it's own food
supply? Doesn't that imply that we need more places surrounded by open
spaces? Doesn't that imply that everything else we move would have to be
moved farther? Isn't the cost of transport already included in food? And
isn't the cost of transport already so cheap that you can truck
watermelons from Mississippi cheaper than you can grow them in Northern
Virginia?

Give me a break. You are a very convincin, if confused, fellow: you
had me going for a while. But I'm afraid your scientists first thought
was correct: Humbug.

TO READERS OF THIS THREAD:

As Jim Bacon has noted one needs to take everything the prior
commentor says as his own opinion.

The following is a good example:

"However, we have been over this before, and most of the services you
describe are commercial services. The forty plus services actually boil
down to a handful, of which five account for almost all the cost.
Schools, roads, fire, and police, garbage disposal. Everything else is
minor, commercial or exists only in some locations, where it is charged
as an extra, as in sewer and water service."

"We" have not been over this before unless the commentor has a mouse
in his pocket.

The prior paragraph is a gross misstatement of the content of the
Cost of Service Curve and the only intent of this post is to avoid
reality and support the subdivision of land in the Countryside for
scattered urban land uses.
