Good source for &quot;new&quot; 5.25 and 3.5 inch floppy disks?

All,

Well, I made up some disks for someone recently, and I was forced to
open my last box of blank 5.25 inch floppies. Uh Oh.

It then occurred to me that my supply of Double Density 3.5 inch disks
is all down to old PC disks, about half of which test bad when I
format them.

Ditto for the High Density 3.5 inch disks for my SuperDrives, which
also test bad about half the time.

So really, what it seems I need is fresh supply of floppy disks, but
are there such things any more? I see folks selling them on ebay, and
Google turned up a few places (such as http://www.oldsoftware.com/disks.html )
that seem to have some supply, but perhaps my fellow CSA2-ers can
recommend a place that has sold them consistently good media at a good
price.

And are truly new, quality, double-density 5.25 and 3.5 inch disks
even sold anymore?

Thanks,
Warr

I've seen 3.5&quot; disks at Wal-Mart and Big Lots, new in the box.
I wouldn't bet on the quality though. Reports have been that quality of
floppies have dropped since they are no longer the media of choice.

WalMart and other office supply stores sell *high density* disks.
Though you can use such disks in a pinch (I'm told), what I'm looking
for is 800k double-density disks.

Well, we Tiers use them all the time in our 720k drives, just tape over the
density hole.

There are more than enough threads arguing about media differences, but IMHO
those only applied to the 5.25&quot; HD media (and I keep finding a pack or two
of those after all these years unopened to throw out).

As for quality, I would suggest reading the disk tests of Paul Panks over on
comp.sys.cbm. Especially if you need a laugh... ;)

You must enjoy data loss, then.  The heads on low density drives cannot
generate a field sufficient to fully saturate domains on the media.  Don't bet
the farm on being able to read those disks back after a few years.

I'm starting to find that most &quot;low&quot; (DD) density 3.5&quot; diskettes are bad out
of the box.  Whenever I need to use them with either my Apples or Amigas, I
end up throwing out 3 of 5 for format/verify errors.  I'd like to think that
it's bad drives, but I have a pile of them and the bad disks are well and
truly... bad.

I believe that HD 3.5&quot; drives switch write current based on the
opening indicating an HD disk.  I think that will let you write non-HD
data on them.  I don't know that it would be readable on an LD drive.

For 5.25&quot; drives, the write current is selected by pin 2, set by the
controller based on what it thinks it is writing.  You would have
to change the signal into pin 2 to write LD data on HD disks.

With Apple II 3.5&quot; drives, it depends on the drive whether you can
successfully use HD 3.5&quot; disks or not.

I personally have had a drive that could write to HD 3.5&quot; disks and was
able to read them back for a while but I copied all that data over to DD
disks as soon as I got more so I don't think I ever had data on a HD
disk for more than six months or so.  I also had an Apple 3.5 Drive that
simply refuses to format or write to an HD disk.

I have read here on comp.sys.apple2 about at least one person who was
able to write to an HD disk and was able to read from it for some time
but after a while he could no longer read the disk.

I've had this happen with HD 3.5&quot; on a PC as well. Too many times. I get
more mileage on my TI on HD disks.

OTOH, I once had a 3.5&quot; HD in my car I'd forgotten about in the console for
about 3 years that was in perfect condition when I found it. Didn't lose
anything... And being in the southeast U.S., where it reaches the upper
90's, that is pretty good!

My comment would only apply to writing DD format in HD drives that
allow that operation.  It takes more write current to write to an HD
disk, which is why it won't work in older (pre-HD) drives.

Yes, 3.5in drives are different.  For 5.25in the controller tells the
drive which density it is using, and the drive adjust the write current
appropriately.

For 3.5in the drive uses the hole (that isn't for write protect) and
adjust the write current.  If you put in a 3.5HD disk and convince
the controller to write in DD (non-HD) mode it will write DD data
using HD write current.  It should be readable on DD drives, though
I wouldn't guarantee it.

No, coercivity was a 5.25&quot; HD thing.

But there is the different write current to consider.

From Wikipedia on Floppy Disk:

The holes on the right side of a 31Ž2-inch disk can be altered as to 'fool'
some disk drives or operating systems (others such as the Acorn Archimedes
simply do not care about the holes) into treating the disk as a higher or
lower density one, for backward compatibility or economical reasons. Popular
modifications include:
Drilling or cutting an extra hole into the right-lower side of a 31Ž2-inch DD
disk (symmetrical to the write-protect hole) in order to format the DD disk
into a HD one. This was a popular practice during the early 1990s, as most
people switched to HD from DD during those days and some of them &quot;converted&quot;
some or all of their DD disks into HD ones, for gaining an extra &quot;free&quot; 720
kiB of disk space. The success ratio was very high, especially as late DD
disks used the same materials as HD ones, so they had no problem supporting
the higher density. In general, only very old (made before 1989) DD disks
were likely to exhibit faults and read/write errors. There even was a
special hole punch that was made to easily make this extra (square) hole in
a floppy.
Vice versa, taping the right hole on a HD 31Ž2-inch disk enables it to be
'downgraded' to DD format. This may sound counterproductive at first, but
there are practical scenarios, e.g. compatibility issues with older
computers, drives or devices that use DD floppies, like some electronic
keyboard instruments and samplers[53] where a 'downgraded' disk can be
useful, as factory-made DD disks have become hard to find after the
mid-1990s. See the section &quot;Compatibility&quot; above. It is important to note
that due to read/write voltage differences in the heads of DD vs. HD disks,
writing to an HD floppy with a DD drive (or an HD drive in DD mode) is
widely considered to be a highly unreliable method of storing data.

And then this:

Within the world of IBM-compatible computers, the three densities of 31Ž2-inch
floppy disks are partially compatible. Higher density drives are built to
read, write and even format lower density media without problems, provided
the correct media is used for the density selected. However, if by whatever
means a diskette is formatted at the wrong density, the result is a
substantial risk of data loss due to magnetic mismatch between oxide and the
drive head's writing attempts. Still, a fresh diskette that has been
manufactured for high density use can theoretically be formatted as double
density, but only if no information has ever been written on the disk using
high density mode (for example, HD diskettes that are pre-formatted at the
factory are out of the question). The magnetic strength of a high density
record is stronger and will &quot;overrule&quot; the weaker lower density, remaining
on the diskette and causing problems. However, in practice there are people
who use downformatted (ED to HD, HD to DD) or even overformatted (DD to HD)
without apparent problems; see the Floppy trivia section. Doing so always
constitutes a data risk, so one should weigh out the benefits (e.g.
increased space and/or interoperability) versus the risks (data loss,
permanent disk damage).

So, it appears there is no clear answer on the subject, at least from
Wikipedia.

I'd sure like to find a website from, say, Teac, on this subject...

Actually, coercivity is a physics thing.  It's a measurable property of
magnetic materials.  Now, whether the various types of 3.5&quot; media differ to
any extent and whether those differences are significant, that's another issue.

Write current is precisely the characteristic that one would adjust to best
utilize media of a specific coercivity, since the magnetic field at the head
is proportional to the current.

I'll have to go off and digest this stuff some more.

Found some info:
http://books.google.com/books?id=E1p2FDL7P5QC&amp;pg;=RA1-PA660&amp;lpg;=RA1-PA...
coercivity+on+floppy+disks&amp;source=web&amp;ots=M0tgBda_cz&amp;sig=ZI_6EB1BzRzC-H85gv a
9-6t5ic0#PRA1-PA660,M1

Gee, what a link - don't know what is trimmable. Here is a tinyurl:
http://tinyurl.com/yqwm85

This is a book preview that just happens to have what we want.
Go to pages 659-660...

To sum it up, you are right - there are differences (I'm tired of typing
that &quot;C&quot; word).

There is a table on p 659.
5.25&quot;                         3.5&quot;
DD          HD        DD         HD
Coercivity (oersteds)              300        600       600        720
Thickness of media (microns)       100         50        70         40

Just guessing, but see that the coercivity difference between the 3.5&quot; DD
and HD is 120, vs. 5.25&quot;'s 300 difference. And the thickness difference is
less too...

Considering the differences are less, it seems plausible to assume that
there is a better chance of data loss in the situation of 5.25&quot; HD disks
written in an LD drive (which has been definitely what I've seen) than 3.5&quot;
HD disks written in either an LD drive or an HD drive with the HD hole
covered on the disk (which is again what I've seen).

I guess &quot;whatever works for you&quot; or &quot;play it safe and don't do it&quot;.

The book referenced is &quot;Upgrading and Repairing PCs by Scott Mueller&quot;...

Anybody want to update the Wiki entry on this, who has experience?

The wikipedia site I posted has it, though I didn't verify the numbers.

That site says 300 Oe and 600 Oe for 5.25in (DD and HD),
600 Oe and 750 Oe for 3.5in (DD and HD).

For 5.25in the difference is large enough that it doesn't
seem to write at all.  For 3.5in, it might write, but not
so reliably.

Or, put another way, if your 3.5&quot; DD drive is in any way marginal, then
it will have difficulty writing an HD disk with any permanence.

If you're not sure, and you care about the permanence of your data,
HD media in DD 3.5&quot; drives should be avoided.

As noted before, a DD 5.25&quot; drive will *not* reliably write HD media.

not in a regular drive.

The coercivity specifies the field strength necessary to switch the
media from one saturated state to another.

If the media was previously recorded, then you are correct--the media,
or at least substantial parts of it, are already saturated in one or
the other direction, and write current will either be sufficient to
change it or not.

However, if the media is not recorded, or has been degaussed, then
smaller write currents will be sufficient to cause a partial response
and leave the media in a lower state of magnetization.  In this case,
the disk could read correctly for a while, but would have a lower
read signal and a lower threshold for data disturbance.

&gt;&gt;zero chance.  Note that core memory depends on half the current not
&gt;&gt;writing a bit for every write or read cycle.

&gt; And what really stinks is that 5.25in are hard to determine.
&gt; Just look at a 3.5&quot;, if it has a hole across from the write protect, it is
&gt; HD.

&gt; 5.25in? Well, unless it is in the box, it is hard to determine (even if it
&gt; is in the box, see below). I got a shipment of new disks, no sleeves, in
&gt; plastic wrap, plus some other make that were labeled DSDD. I've found that
&gt; MANY HD 5.25&quot; do not have hub rings. Some of these DSDD didn't have the hub
&gt; rings, and were in fact, DSHD. They would format fine in an HD drive, but
&gt; not in a regular drive.

&gt; However, I've had supposed HD disks (no hub rings from an HD box new) that
&gt; formatted great in a regular drive, but not to HD. So apparently even the
&gt; manufacturers get them mixed up.
">

A very good indicator (though not perfect) is that almost all 5.25&quot; DD
coatings were brown or dark gray, while almost all HD coatings are
nearly black.

I believe over the years the manufacturers, in order to boost profits,
have made the disks thinner and thinner thus lowering the
reliability.  Of course with the advent of new technologies, first the
zip disks and then flash media, there is no use for the floppy except
for us.

I just bought a copy of &quot;The Manager&quot; from ramito on eBay and just as
all the original disks I have from those days, they all are good.

I found a big bunch of LD 3 1/2 disks on eBay a couple of years ago.
I have just about used them all up by backing up all the software that
I have acquired.  I have found these to format fully and have not had
to throw any away.

I wouldn't use any new floppies for any thing.  I would only use HD
floppies from the late 80s if you could verify the manufacture date.

The media thickness is part of the spec, and is what keeps data
written on one side from changing data written on the other side.

One could always sacrifice an old and new disk and use a micrometer...

Maybe the problem is that there are no new floppy manufacturing
machines being made, and the old ones are getting crufty, leading
to marginal disks...

Just to throw my 2-cents in, My personal experience was the the
following. Note that I never owned a 5.25&quot; HD drive.

HD 5.25&quot; disk in an AppleDisk 5.25&quot; drive:
Would NOT format without errors, would not read or write data.

HD 3.5&quot; disk in an AE 3.5&quot; 800K drive (Replaced my AppleDisk 3.5 over a
year before I tried a HD disk)
Formatted, but kept giving errors when I tried to use it. The disk
formatted just fine in the computers at school, and I also tested it on
a friend's PC.

After I finally got my hands on a SuperDrive, I tried drilling holes in
a DD disk and formatting it as HD. It seemed to work fine, but as time
went on I noticed that these disks seemed to have a much much higher
rate of failure. It has been over 8 years since I've done this, and I
don't think any of the drilled disks are still working. Of course, I've
got a bunch I haven't tested in a while either, but none of the ones
I've tried have worked perfectly. It seems to somehow damage the disk
and reformatting doesn't help.

That's my non-technical, personal experience as best as I can remember
it. It's what most people care about, what works and what doesn't. I
should note that it took sevearl months for a DD disk formatted as HD to
develope problems. Months of regular use, such as the data disk I used
for my classes at school.

I just looked at the site, and I find it interesting, and ironic, that
the DD disks cost more than the HD disks. For the entire time they were
BOTH available in stores, the opposite was true.

I'm not sure if I want to order from them, I just wanted a 10-pack. Then
again, I could probably split it with the person who prompted me to need
a 10-pack. Somebody I know was just given an old Apple IIe system with 2
5.25&quot; drives and a monitor, but no software.

He's asked me if I can give him some software to get it going. That's
not a problem, except that I've only got 3 blank 5.25&quot; disks left in the
box.

But of course they are ***RARE***  ***CLASSIC*** !!!!  ;-)

And there are probably not too many being made any more...

A PC (or other HD) drive would saturate the media, but it sounds like
your AE drive was not saturating it, leaving it partially magnetized.

Degaussing and reformatting would probably put you back where you
started.

That's consistent with the behavior of a lower coercivity medium used
at a high density.

As the oppositely magnetized regions get closer together, they have
more tendency to &quot;flip&quot; adjacent regions.  Higher coercivity prevents
this (at the cost of being harder to write).

Bottom line: there's a reason for most specifications.  ;-)
(But not all--for example, after the early 1980s, virtually all
&quot;single-sided&quot; media were actually suitable as &quot;double-sided&quot;.)
