clamshell charger

For a while I have had a clamshell iBook which I thought had a bad DC in
board. I replaced that and the problem was the same but I've had the
presence of mind to check the charger. I checked the voltmeter against
the charger from my other computer (a Dell) and it read 19.71V which is
acceptable as it is supposed to give 19.5V. Just now I checked it
against the charger for my clamshell and it gave some fluctuation
between 0V and 0.05V so I now assume the charger is at fault. Can anyone
tell me the likelihood of the charger developing a fault? I had bought
the charger a couple of months beforehand and I am fairly certain it was
brand new (it is just a standard, black brick type)

thanks and best regards

Pretty high, actually; much of the time it's not the charger dying,
but the cable breaking inside. They're pretty fragile.

Aha that would make sense now that you mention it. My foot did catch the
cable at the moment it stopped working

Stupid me!
thanks very much, Bruce

This may be fixable, depending on where it broke.

This is also why I think the magnetic power connection on the new
macbooks is the Greatest Invention Evah!! Especially as I damaged
myself once quite painfully diving onto a concrete floor to save my PB
being dragged off the table by my right foot.

If this is an Apple AC charger, there's a possibility it's defective.
There was an Exchange Program for these &quot;brick&quot; chargers, but it's
over now:

I'll second this. My first laptop I tripped on the cable within the
1st 5 minutes I owned it and yanked it off a table and shattered the
case.

Too bad we can't retrofit the G3/G4 'books to use this--it's really
the only thing I envy with the new intel books.  :)

Like any piece of electronics it does not last forever and certainly
can become victim of wear and tear, you can be pretty sure it is the
device in question when a voltmeter reports that the device is
returning incorrect voltages

That looks like standard message header info.  See if somehow the
'show headers' info setting in Eudora got clicked on for some reason.

I can't find any setting dealing with &quot;show headers&quot; in any of the
panels. Looks like I'll have to put up with it.
Thanks anyway

I haven't used Eudora in years.  There used to be a way to toggle the
headers on and off.  Is there a &quot;help&quot; section you can put in &quot;toggle
headers&quot; or something close to see where that might be?

Terry,

Under settings look for boring  (or goner) headers.

(You have to have installed &quot;SuperSleek  Plugin 1.0&quot; or &quot;Extra Settings&quot;)

I am constantly having to upgrade mine, but I can send you the list to
copy-and-paste into the list.
