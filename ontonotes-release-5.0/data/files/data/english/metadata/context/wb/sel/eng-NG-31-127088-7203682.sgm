Defending men who go through change of wife
By Denise Noe

I remember hearing talk show host Virginia Graham say, "Women go
through change of life. Men go through change of wife." I read an
actor quoted as saying that when a wife is forty, "she should be
changed for two twenties."

Of course, women are statistically more likely to initiate divorce
actions than men. However, the middle-aged man who divorces his middle-
aged wife for a younger, prettier woman is neither a myth nor a
rarity. A comment on a previous post challenged me to defend such men.

I believe they need defending as the "change of wife" is often derided
as the depth of male swinishness.  It can also BE defended.

In long-term relationships, both legally wed and cohabiting, partners
often grow apart. They frequently develop separate interests and lack
enthusiasm for each other's interests. Years together may deepen
intimacy but they may also lead to a sense that one has learned
everyone can about and from one's spouse. There is also a possibility
of familiarity leading to sexual boredom and resulting in a celibate
marriage. All of these things are true for both women and men.

However, men have a special problem in that they must be sexually
aroused in order to engage in sexual intercourse.  Thus, a bored wife
may still be able to fulfill her husband's sexual desires while a
bored husband fulfills neither hers nor his own.

On many levels, not just the sexual, a younger person brings a fresh
perspective to an older person.  On the specifically sexual level,
natural selection has led to a tendency among men to be attracted to
women who are of what has been childbearing age throughout the
existence of our species.

Middle-aged wives who are divorced for younger women often feel left
in the lurch.  Phyllis Schlafly has said, "It's a fact of life. A man
fat and fifty may think he's attractive to women. A woman fat and
fifty is not attractive to men." The phrasing of this statement is
interesting and reflects basic differences in human sexuality.  The
older man may THINK he's attractive to women.  Women can have sex
regardless of whether they are genuinely aroused or not.  The ability
to fake a sexual response means females can form relationships with
men who offer financial security or social benefits to the women (and
possibly their children) even if the men are not attractive to them.
However, an older woman is stuck with the truth.

Many women, and some men, do not engage in paid work during periods of
marriage.  Being a fulltime homemaker has many pluses but its biggest
negative is that a former homemaker is at a disadvantage in the labor
market compared with those who have been in the market without
interruption.  Thus, financial provisions should be made for them in
divorce settlements - and are.

However, men who go through change of wife should not be reviled.
Often they have left a marriage that has become empty and routine for
a relationship that is alive.
