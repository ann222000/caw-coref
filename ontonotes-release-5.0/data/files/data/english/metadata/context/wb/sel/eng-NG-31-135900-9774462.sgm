Hi,

As some of you know the guys from Battlefront have been absent from
their CM:SF forum for over 2 months.

Well, until today, they're back !

Man, I sure missed the comedy they bring to the forum, here's 2 quotes
from the same post made today

http://www.battlefront.com/discuss/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=52;...

&quot;This is a Forum to exchange ideas and opinions about Combat Mission
in a constructive manner. Therefore, the rules basically boil down to
two basic concepts:

1. If it isn't about Combat Mission (even if indirectly), it is off
topic and not to be posted here.

2. If a post has nothing constructive to add to the discussion, it is
unproductive and not to be posted here.&quot;

and a bit further in the same post :

&quot;This Forum has been around for 10 years now. We have never, ever,
even ONCE banned someone for expressing an opinion that is critical of
our work. &quot;

Pure comedy genius I tell you :)

All kidding aside I fully expect a new 1.05 demo shortly which should
be a better representation of the game as it should have gone out the
door.

Greetz,

Eddy Sterckx

I liked the earlier part better:

&quot;I'd be lying if I said that my vacation from the Forum wasn't
enjoyable. The level of bitching, complaining, rudeness, intolerance,
disrespect, and outright abuse that a handful of people have felt they
are entitled to has become intolerable. Before the hiatus I put up with
a lot of this behavior simply because there was, unfortunately, quite a
bit to bitch about rightly and wrongly. But the time for that has
passed. We need to move on from the squabbling and get back to the
productive way this Forum used to be. And that's why I'm going to remind
you all of how things are supposed to work around here so there is no
excuse for continued rule breaking.&quot;

TRANSLATION:  &quot;How dare you assholes expect a *working game* for a
piffling $50 and have temerity to demand it in a public forum!!  And now
is the time to put aside petty grievances like being taken for a sucker
with an unworking product and get back to all being sweet li'l fanboys.&quot;

And:

&quot;We hit a technical hitch when Charles tried to switch the code over to
a new compiler. Unfortunately, this was Microsoft product. As one can
imagine, the transition should have been easy but wasn't. We lost almost
2 weeks of time trying to work through oddities and outright bugs in the
compiler which produced extremely unstable and/or wacky stuff for us to
test.&quot;

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

Now Microsoft's fucking *compiler* is the problem?  Yeeeeeaaaaah, lots
of bugs in that puppy.  Unstable as all get out.  C and C++ being such
new and unknown quantities.

Suddenly I feel this irrational need to defend a code brother :)

I'll have to check at home but was under the impression that the
previous incarnations of the game were not compiled by a M$ compiler,
but on a compiler which was also available for the Mac and/or Unix.
Their choice of OpenGL over DirectX was also probably in anticipation
of a future port of the game to the Mac or Linux

If that is the case and they indeed switched from - let's say the
Borland C++ compiler to the M$ one - there may indeed have been some
problems which a non-geek as Steve Grammont translates as &quot;bugs in the
compiler&quot;, but which in fact are a bit more technical.

Given that a simple compiler version upgrade can cause serious
problems too, never mind this (possible) brand change, this is about
the only thing in his post which I actually believe is straight
talk :)

Yup, but they could have said so, just said so, and in a different manner

decided to switch to MS (S)Compiler, and we discovered that it was a long

Again, which is a good reason why you  aim your development efforts at

The problem is that there's a track record here, that of blaming anyone
and everyone and everything *except* the guys typing the bugs into the
CM:SF code.  First it was ATI and nVidia, then Windows Vista, then
mysterious drivers ... now it's the compiler?

Yah.  And the dog presumably ate their homework, too.

Talk about biting the hand that used to feed you.

A simple status report on 1.05 would have been good......leave out
the pissing and moaning about people who spent money on this piece
of junk complaining about it.

Better get your CMBO, CMBB and CMAK now.....these clowns aren't
gonna be around long.  Those items are about to become collectors items.

I didn't see them bitching about compiler issues (well, just a little
bit :-) ).

It looks like a MacOS X version is on the way.  It surprises me that
they're going to support multiple platforms with multiple compilers.
Problems will increase exponentially.

Yeah, but who - *exactly* - held a pistol to their heads and said,
&quot;Change compilers or die?&quot;

Nobody.

*They* decided to change compilers, presumably because they imagined
that there would be some benefit to the change that would overcome the
inevitable problems with changing a codebase.  My point is simply that
they can't blame the new compiler[1] or the guys who built it - and that
their customers don't give a rat-fuck what compiler they're using ...
just that the product they paid good money for is not a buggy shitware
disaster.

Again, if this complaint occurred all by its lonesome in an otherwise
brilliant product, then maybe I could excuse it.  But it's *never*
Battlefront's fault; it's buggy ol' XP and Vista, or buggy ol' ATI
drivers, or buggy ol' nVidia software, or the new compiler, or &lt;insert
other bullshit excuse here&gt;.

Doesn't this start to assume a weary sort of sameness after a bit?

[1]  And my ancient compiler course in CS tended to paraphrase the old
Hebrew proverb about the jug and the stone:  &quot;If your code won't compile
on our compiler, that's bad luck for your code.  If our compiler won't
compile your code, that's bad luck for your code.&quot;

I hear you.  We are on the same line.  Just expressed differently.

&gt; &quot;We hit a technical hitch when Charles tried to switch the code over to
&gt; a new compiler. Unfortunately, this was Microsoft product. As one can
&gt; imagine, the transition should have been easy but wasn't. We lost almost
&gt; 2 weeks of time trying to work through oddities and outright bugs in the
&gt; compiler which produced extremely unstable and/or wacky stuff for us to
&gt; test.&quot;

&gt; Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

&gt; Now Microsoft's fucking *compiler* is the problem?  Yeeeeeaaaaah, lots
&gt; of bugs in that puppy.  Unstable as all get out.  C and C++ being such
&gt; new and unknown quantities.

For me the path finding is everything, especially as it gets your own units
killed more often than not. I think the problem that Battlefront had was
that their previous three titles were so good. If you are having fun with
CM:FS you will have a lot more fun with the previous three titles if you
like WW2.

The game when it came out looked worse than the previous titles, performed
very poorly (or on some hardware not at all) and was full of so many bugs as
to render it unplayable.

I know how much effort goes into these games as I'm a software developer and
can appreciate how long it takes to design and code a decent game,
especially in 3d. However, publishing deals aside I don't think there is any
excuse for releasing a game like this in such a poor state.

Even without the path-finding issues (which kill the game for me anyways),
there are a number of flaws in the system that the WWII versions don't
suffer from. One of these is the omission of infantry based smoke grenades.
These are such a fundamental feature of urban warfare that I was very
surprised that they were excluded, especially given the game's focus on
urban warfare.

I tried to get back into the game recently and decided to go through the
tutorials again. I had a simple mission. Advance on enemy trench and take
the enemy out. All was going well until I decided to dismount my mmg team
from a Stryker.

The smoke got deployed and the team dismounted and deployed properly - so
far so good. Then the tacai decides to swing the Stryker around 180 degrees
so that its ass is pointing toward the trenches and then start backing away
toward those same trenches. I was stunned. It's not like I even gave the
Stryker any orders other than drop smoke.

To me if the AI acts like this on a flat map with just one enemy trench, it
will have no chance in urban situations.

I'd like this game to be fixed, but I'm beginning to suspect that it is
fundamentally broken. Battlefront will need to fix it if they want any hope
of selling their next add-on for it.

Merry Christmas to all!

I also don't understand the engineering it takes to build a car or an
airplane.  But I sure as hell can tell whether or not they work and/or
are crap.  Imagine Toyota telling us that we can't possibly judge
their cars because we, the consumers, are not technically qualified to
do so!

Imagine the outrage of gamers telling a gaming house that the game
they released has technical problems, weaknesses and maybe even not
the type of game that the gamer wants to play!  How dare they raise
any such points even when the gaming house admits that a game was
released in late alpha or beta and in addition was missing features
that were supposed to be the game.  Things by such consuming bastards
certainly cannot be tolerated!

From Roger Ebert review of Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo (0 stars): &quot;The
movie created a spot of controversy in February 2005. According to a story
by Larry Carroll of MTV News, Rob Schneider took offense when Patrick
Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times listed this year's Best Picture nominees
and wrote that they were 'ignored, unloved, and turned down flat by most of
the same studios that . . . bankroll hundreds of sequels, including a
follow-up to Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, a film that was sadly overlooked at
Oscar time because apparently nobody had the foresight to invent a category
for Best Running Penis Joke Delivered by a Third-Rate Comic.'

&quot;Schneider retaliated by attacking Goldstein in full-page ads in Daily
Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. In an open letter to Goldstein,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Schneider wrote: 'Well, Mr. Goldstein, I decided to do some research to find

out what awards you have won. I went online and found that you have won
nothing. Absolutely nothing. No journalistic awards of any kind. . . . Maybe
you didn't win a Pulitzer Prize because they haven't invented a category for
Best Third-Rate, Unfunny Pompous Reporter Who's Never Been Acknowledged by
His Peers. . . .'

&quot;Schneider was nominated for a 2000 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor,
but lost to Jar-Jar Binks. But Schneider is correct, and Patrick Goldstein
has not yet won a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, Goldstein is not qualified to
complain that Columbia financed Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo while passing
on the opportunity to participate in Million Dollar Baby, Ray, The Aviator,
Sideways, and Finding Neverland. As chance would have it, I have won the
Pulitzer Prize, and so I am qualified. Speaking in my official capacity as a
Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks.&quot;

The part that simply astounds me about the &quot;you're not qualified to pass
judgement on the programming of a wargame because you haven't built any
prize-winning wargames&quot; is that people in this group - and similar
groups - routinely criticize *MacArthur*.  And Halsey.  And Napoleon.
And Nelson.  And Scipio Africanus.  And Alexander.  And Clauswitz.  And
Nimitz.  And Yamamoto.  And Sun Tzu.  And Grant.  And Lee.  And
Tecumseh.

So it's kinda amazing to dismiss a guy who's just finished a rolling,
200-line post claiming that Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery of Alamein
was actually a poor strategist ... because he thinks the dummies who
programmed the laughable COMBAT MISSION: SHOCK FORCE are lousy
programmers.

Oh please, we're talking about some pretty basic shit here. If you're
in the middle of 'crisis mode', dealing with upset customers and
trying to get things working the way they're supposed to, the LAST
thing you do is complicate matters further by switching compilers.

You switch compilers when your code is stable and things are working
correctly otherwise you just added one more 'what if' for every bug
that you start tracking down.

Switching compilers/ide is a project and it *never* goes smooth.

It was a major pita back in the BASM versus MASM days, and it's still
a problem in Struts vs. JSF today.

The only reason you'd take such a drastic step is when you're stuck.
Really stuck. Which I think is the case here. Certain features they
want in the game are either impossible or very hard to do in what they
use right now so the only long-term option is to switch. The mistake
they made was thinking they could do that mid-project.

LOL!  Your validity is the last thing I need, and I'm far from
&quot;pontificating&quot;. Amazing how, when someone disagrees with what you
feel, it's okay to attack that person, but the brazen and infantile
attacks I read here seem to be just okey-dokey. Again, I'm lead to
warn others of people like you and that inbred who called me a pansy!
Too funny!

First, I never claimed to have made anything &quot;bug free&quot;, I was merely
pointing-out that NOBODY has EVER created something that is without
its warts. I WILL say, however, that the games I've designed were
about as bug free as a program can get. Eddie knows who I am, as well
as Eric Rutins. I've designed two games, Raging Tiger and The Star and
the Crescent, both with ProSIM company's Pat Proctor. I was also
deeply involved in the design and production of Air Assault Task
Force, and have been involved in the creation and testing of a few HPS
titles and even more alpha and beta-testing of games from FPS's to
RTS's.

In addition, I work with simulations for the US Army. So, I'm not a
complete idiot when comes to making games, as well as the PR aspect of
it. While not entirely bug free, these games have actually required
little to no patching at all to fix basic issues with the programming,
only data updates to either correct an issue with a vehicle or weapon
system, or to make some changes to AI scripting to increase customer
experience or realism in a scenario.

No, I'm not a programmer, but I do extensive research into pathfinding
in my real job, because it is a nut that even the most experienced
simulation designers have yet to crack. This applies to AI as well. I
am currently working with another small contractor to create entities
and units that perform the full gamut of movement and missions to a
set standard, and it is something that, if we do it right, could be
revolutionary in military AND civilian simulations.

I am not defending BF's decisions as they pertain to customer
relations, or their problems with a publishing deal that may or may
not have lead to an early release of their product. I am, however,
defending the efforts they have made to respond to the problems and
the subsequent harrassment they have received from people who don't
have the first inkling of what it takes to create something like
CM:SF. It's likely those same people have hundresd, if not THOUSANDS
of dollars of crappy software in their pasts that never elicited such
hatred. It's kind of sad, actually, to watch people get so worked-up
over something like this. It leads one to believe that their lives are
seriously lacking in other areas...kind of like the &quot;compensation&quot;
thing with the big cars...

You might THINK that dealing with the problems inherent in a game like
SF is easy, but if it were so easy, then there'd be a hundred games
just like it on the market. I'm not trying to discount ANYONE'S
comments here, I only wish to remind people of two things: 1 - the
type of game and the infinite combinations of hardware and software
makes releasing ANYTHING like this terribly difficult, and 2 - While
consumer comments are fine and have been taken to heart by the BF
crew, when people start talking nasty and acting like children, a
developer is less likely to take their comments seriously and is
counter-productive.

I've seen the way people act on their forums, and it really gives me
little hope for the future of serious and intelligent wargames. I see
the way people act here, and I KNOW that there is a problem with basic
civility and humanity. I'm not talking about everyone here, just a
select few, and they know who they are. If you have to ask yourself
&quot;Is he talking about me?!&quot;, then I probably am.

Again, these are just my opinions, and I have no illusions that it
means diddly-squat to anyone BUT me...but that seems to be a rarity
around here...

No one is saying this sort of endeavor isn't *difficult*, just that the

those viewpoints aren't exactly incompatible, are they?

And what people are mostly reacting to is your lame theory that

able to produce a similar thing which is beyond criticism.&quot;  This is
simply too stupid for words, as *nobody* in this day and age is enough
of a renaissance man to have professional expertise in every aspect of
technology he needs or wants to use every day.

No, I'm not a professional automobile designer - but I'm qualified to

It's more complicated than that.

When CM:SF first came out the guys at BFC where adamant the game was
pretty near perfect, better than sliced bread, a thing you'd sell your
grandmother for and responded haughtily to even the mere suggestion
there were bugs in it. Given that it contained more bugs than your
average African ant hill and that everywhere you looked there was a
feature inexplicably missing this was waaaay over the line most people
draw when it comes to accepting pr talk. It was pure bs, bordering on
conning people. And this pissed people off - big time. That's why some
took it personal and some even made it their mission in life to
provide payback. Pettiful behaviour ? Maybe, but who am I to judge
that ? There's a small grocery store here nereby which once
(knowingly) sold me some rotten tomatoes and I never, ever went back
there - I even drive a couple of miles further if I need something
they have.

Really ? Maybe I'm kinda immune to it but I don't see this ng as a

Please...where did I say you couldn't criticisize anything at all? I
just said that people should lend the proper amount of weight to the
opinions expressed. I will listen to another developer or programmer
who has particular experience in the field in question rather than
someone who just hates what he hates and has problems eloquently
expressing himself.

As much as you'd like to think it, you are definitely not God's gift
to wargaming, and your bullying tactics are more than laughable. It is
often the tactic of the bully to resort to hostility because of a lack
of experience in a given situation...and I notice you like to

Right here:

&quot;And where are all of YOUR polished releases?  Where are all of YOUR
wargames, produced by YOU, and sold to the public?  In addition, there
better not be any bugs in them!

People in glass houses...&quot;

Disavow your plainly expressed purpose as you like, but the only
&quot;argument&quot; (if we can even call it that...) you're bothering to make
here is the obvious one; the *only* person who may validly criticize a
software developer is someone with their own &quot;polished releases&quot; and
&quot;produced wargames&quot; and &quot;no-bug products&quot;.

By implication, this extends to anything.  How *dare* someone criticize
a Toyota Corolla unless he's &quot;released polished car designs&quot; of his own
and created &quot;no bug&quot; automobiles?

I say this whole argument - both your specific point and your
implication - is ridiculous.  Being able to produce something isn't
required to *use* something, so why should it be required to criticize
something?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
