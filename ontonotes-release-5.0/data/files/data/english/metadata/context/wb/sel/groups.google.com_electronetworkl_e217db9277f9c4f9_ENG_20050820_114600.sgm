there was a one hour interview last night on
the Charlie Rose show (PBS) in the .US, which
was interesting for several reasons, some of
which relate rhetoric about the war situation
with the facts of electrical infrastructure:
facts are facts, as Mr. Donald Rumsfeld, .US
Secretary of Defense, said to Charlie Rose.

apparently in some 14 out of 17/18 provinces
things are going fairly well in Iraq, said he.
and that in so many words, it is just simply a
matter of perspective: the glass is either half
empty or half full, depending on what you know.
the question is polarized by Mr. Rumsfeld into
those who are against the war, and those who
believe the sacrifice is worth it, in helping
Iraqis and 'freedom' by waging a war for it.
even though the initial failed strategy still
is being used to guide actions, decision-making.

democracy is said to be being built, there are
now stock exchanges in 14 of the provinces, and
there are textbooks in school, etc. all of the
good news is not being distributed to everyone,
Mr. Rumsfeld said, and it is distorting what is
going on that is good. possibly this has some-
thing to do with the unsafe environment of a
combat zone in these remaining provinces, also,
else wouldn't reporters freely be going out to
visit these schools and stock exchanges if they
were largely pacified areas? or would they be
murdered like the reporter who filed a story on
this other-side of the war, another perspective,
the Iraqi civilian one, which exists without a
reliable power system, cooling, and clean water?

which reality is it, it is curious. because if
one factors in 'electricity' into these facts,
this 'informed' choice of a glass half-empty or
half-full approach to judging such a situation
leads to a very different assessment of gains
made, and losses compounding these situation.
that is, the approach which is said to justify
these gains may itself be a distortion based on
a traditional assessment from a non-electrical
point of view, which would defy common sense.
and to use such distortion as a justification
and validation of an existing failed strategy
would be to assume such an approach will lead
to paradigmatic changes in the way things work,
in relation to the issues claiming improvements.

that is, what good is a stock market without any
electricity? stock markets do not work without
any electricity. therefore, can you actually
have a working stock market with no electricity?

or for that matter, democracy. can one have a
functioning government without electricity? is
it possible to have governance without reliable
power generation, delivery, use? highly doubtful.
and if governance were to emerge, it would more
likely emerge on the other end of the spectrum,
as anarchy, than as highly rule-based democracy.
as a natural evolution out of chaos, into order.

thus, the critical ambiguity being used as a
justification of current approaches to issues
complex and contradictory, can be clarified if
including an electrical dimension into analyses:

q: is the glass half empty or is the glass half full?

a: is there reliable electricity?

if there is no reliable electricity, the glass would
not have potable water, thus the glass would be empty
as whatever is in it, is not going to be used to drink.
and if one is dealing with food, water, shelter, and
water is missing from that equation, how can optimism
be the choice in such a situation, said to be stable?

q: how many provinces in Iraq have electrical problems?

a: the press avoids these types of basic questions.

is it the 3 provinces that do not have reliable electrical
power, or all provinces where there is no air conditioning
in desert heat, no water in parched conditions, and no
energy conservation when the grid is placed online, counter
to any control of such 'critical infrastructure', which is
necessary to stabilize before anything else can function?

most schools do not function without stable electricity.
most hospitals do not function without stable electricity.
most governments do not function without stable electricity.
most stock exchanges do not function without electricity...

q: why is there not reliable electricity in Iraq?

a: who knows? one reporter died to report that power plants
were being taken over by religious forces who do not sound
to be in sympathy with the goals of the Iraqi government.

now, imagine if all the other developments depends on
being able to stabilize daily living so more complex
developments can happen, by Iraqis and for Iraqis. and
the electrical infrastructure is sitting there, turning
off and turning on, keeping an stable environment from
developing, while more traditional structures try to be
built up upon -- what? the electrical infrastructure,
which for all intents and purposes is not under control
in such as a way as to allow for a stable development.
for a stabilization of other, dependent, infrastructures
of the Iraqi society, economics, politics, and culture.

it is so basic, if dealing with facts, that you're not
going to be able to function at a certain level if this
foundational and fundamental electrical stability is not
secured, by Iraqis and for Iraqi cultural developments,
not influenced by parties outside of their constitution.

yet it is also ironic that the rules of culture that
apply to the 'developed' world are not applied to those
in transition, redeveloping along the same set of rules
about how states function, and what is required to do so.
i.e., the .US would cease functioning without electricity.
people would find it odd to try to maintain NASDAQ without
an electrical grid, or any major hospital without power.

and to judge a strategy's success while there are power
outages throughout the day and night would be omitting
a critical dimension, critical for the success or failure
of the approach to dealing with more emergent phenomena,
such as government by rule of law, and self-governance.
its a lot to expect of others to do this without reliable
power, if that is the case, and who would know if there
are no reporters giving facts about such basic issues?

if there is no reliable power throughout Iraq, that
would be a major omission. if there is no reliable power
in 3 or 4 provinces, including Baghdad, that may be yet
another situation. and, no wonder the populace would be
enraged to not have reliable power, as nothing else is
'reasonable' until there is reliable power, clean water
does not even exist without stable power, so how can it
be that democracy can exist without reliable electricity?

it simply cannot. it defies logic, reason, common sense.

there is a dynamic about the electrical infrastructure
that is so basic it should not need mentioning, yet in
the context of the ongoing 'police operation' in Iraq,
it runs counter to the existing strategy that says that
if only things keep going as planned (by failed strategy)
that sooner or later things will turn around: they will
not. i.e. until the electrical infrastructure is secured.

basically, the powerplant functions as a king which, if
it can be check-mated keeps the rest of the infrastructure
from being able to function. it is effectively game-over.
it determines what can and will happen with electricity.
(for instance, the queen, symbolized as a skyscraper, is
not able to function without the king.) nor if the power
pylons which transmit power are taken down (knights).

Chess Set prototype (story of electrical power)

besides having a 'management issue' by who is running the
grid, which was reported to be taken over by people said
to be hostile to current Iraqi self-determination, or so
it seemed to be reported that it was religious authorities
who have no technical background about the electrical grid,
there is also another dimension of system, order, control
of electrical infrastructure which check-mates itself by
way of the pawns of civilian consumption of such power.

if people, Iraqi citizens, cannot be required, even forced
to limit electrical consumption for their own long-term
benefit, it exacerbates the inability to stabilize the flow
of electricity, the purification of water, the workings of
hospitals and schools and stock exchanges, because of those
who sit around with multiple air conditioners, big screen
televisions, and other amenities for a few hours a day, a
mirage of a future electrical culture of a stabilized Iraq
yet which is an anomaly given the violent anarchy outside.
without sacrificing, regulating, such power consumption,
there is no way to build up other cultural infrastructures.
they cannot self-sustain, a government or a people, without
a reliable electrical grid governed in their self-interest.

what would happen if the Iraq electrical infrastructure is
being governed by forces hostile to an Iraqi constitution?
could a democratic Iraq ever emerge from such a situation?
highly unlikely -- only if the problem is never addressed.

so too, if one is fighting street battles and bombings by
'eliminating' the effects which are caused by such grief,
by such agony, as originates from such fundamental needs
not being met, and to think that anything of this dynamic
is going to change, by 'staying the course' or not losing
one's nerve: that's not the question, that's an answer,
and it requires one to lose their mind and replace reason
with a blind-faith in what amounts to a failed strategy:
to keep doing the same thing is like a fission reaction,
and it just keeps going and going, and yet it cannot be
kept to go on indefinitely, components wear down, need to
be replaced, and may not be able to be: such as civilian
lives who have survived a dictator only to die in freedom,
or soldiers who died and were wounded for what amounts to
good intentioned ideologies yet which holds a core truth,
or idea, about helping to establish new liberty of people,
yet without an effective strategy for actually doing so.

instead, the .US is said to have faith and be assure dof
ideological distortions about what is going on in Iraq,
in relation to goals stated and accomplishments being met.

if the .US is pursuing democracy, constitution government,
schools, hospitals, and stock exchanges, in addition to
cooling, shelter, and clean water: electricity is required.
and it is the first requirement for other things to develop.
without electricity there can be no 'modern' governance, it
seems likely, given the givens about today's way of living.
and maybe this is a difference between visions for Iraq, if
those who fight against Iraqi citizens do not want Iraqis
to have these things either: it is a place of polarization.
sooner or later, Iraqis are going to have to fight for their
self-determination and self-definition and self-government.
before that, though, they may have to fight for their grid.

and this is where the .US policy could be transformed from
the initial agenda for invading Iraq to the present ordeal
and how the .US can support development of Iraq by Iraqis.
if the .US would address issues of long-term basing, which
is to say it does not have long-term designs on the country
and also clarifies its relationship to the oil wealth of
the country, in formally announcing public relationships
to such issues, outside the private realms of Halliburton
and other companies operating alongside the .US military,
including their bases, it may be possible that the .US may
be able to provide infrastructural support and protection
of such critical facilities, to stabilize the daily lives
by getting out of the way, and helping design such a new
infrastructure that can support Iraq's robust development.
i.e., the power grid is under control of Iraqi civilians
who share a vision for Iraq as its constitution drafters.
and that this infrastructure, as a foundation, is needed
to develop other institutions also guided by Iraqi ideas.

the .US role would change from a war-fighting and police
operation to securing the daily needs (reliable electrical
power) to everyday Iraqis, while the Iraqis would take on
those who which seek to devolve the society into anarchy.

given the history of urban planning, ideas of 'occupation'
could go back a long way in that this is often a way to
conquer a place, by taking it over, and redesigning a
place according to different rules. the best of such an
approach were the Romans, the military were the engineers
which would start a grid and a new city plan which would
allow control over a place otherwise organized. it may
have been from scratch or from redevelopment, and yet it
was about extending 'empire' and it may be built-into
the age-old dynamics between different civilizations,
that such planning could destroy the core logic of a
place, by instituting another way of doing things. if
one were to take the .US military planning and basing
in this context, it could be argued similar that such
an 'occupation' would result in a cultural redesign:
yet this would not seem to be the case, excepting that
the .US soldiers live in air conditioned cities with
satellite dishes, teleconferencing, televisions, video
games, telephones, refrigerated foods, clean water, etc.
while the Iraqis live without these same things, daily.

instead of redefining the grid, the urban grid already
exists from prior centuries, what has changed is the
electrical infrastructure which stands between these
two views of reality; and the source of conflicts and
'rhetoric versus reality' of what daily live is like,
in Iraq, for those whose only choice is to live there.
the .US can attempt to evolve institutions such as a
stock exchange, or even better television programming,
and yet without a stable electrical grid these changes
mean nothing, as they cannot be made to self-sustain.
the weakness is the electrical infrastructure, and if
there is one thing the .US forces could do better than
any others on the planet, it would to be to secure and
support the redesign an electrical infrastructure which
would sustain the rapidly development of Iraqi culture.

'the occupation' in the daily lives of Iraqi's would
end, the .US military forces would be better able to
leave on a schedule, with full Iraqi autonomy for its
self-governance and self-determination, while it would
also be secured from the basic failures occurring today
that are limiting the advances by undercutting them by
way of how power is managed, distributed and consumed.
a new arrangement, a new strategy, and reprioritization
of the role of the .US military, as military engineers,
could help facilitate building a foundation for peace,
and a defined role which limits original .US agendas,
while serving the Iraqis, ... always part of the plan.

this would require .US leadership, outside the 'box'
or paradigm of the traditional interpretations, to go
to the core issues and address them to transform the
situation from a saga to a shared, regional success.
who knows, with better defined dynamics, and goals, a
role of diplomacy in the neighborhood could become a
way to co-develop the region, and give everyone the
chance they deserve to choose the life they will live.

personal responsibility, to ask something of the self,
would apply for those who consume beyond their needs,
at home or abroad, by placing a new critical value on
the conservation of resources, while also refocussing
the cultural escapism, 'over there, not here', with bad
choices adding up to an ever-worsening world complex.
leaders would do something about these basic facts,
they would not omit them or hide from them, nor would
they choose to disregard them based on their belief:
they would face them, acknowledge the truth of ideas,
and change their plans according to the new reality.
they would not stick to old plans and failed strategy
and justify present decision-making based on these.
they would transform the situation, and minds along
with it, and real gains would become readily visible.
that's a leap of faith: democracy in word, and action.
if talking the talk, it's now time to walk the walk...

and to do so requires addressing issues of electrical
infrastructure and the forces which are directing it,
and to what end: for Iraq's future, or towards its past?

can there be democracy without democratic Iraqi power?
with stable, secure, reliable electrical power, the
glass may indeed be half-full, if not soon overflowing.

&quot;Victory captures the king, the electrical powerplant, and determines
the future of the cultural kingdom, and its economic, social,
and political order in electrical civilization... &quot;
