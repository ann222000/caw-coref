So what do the Rams need to do in Oakland during their third preseason game?

What the Saints did to the Chiefs on Thursday night in Kansas City. New
Orleans handled the Chiefs 30-7 and got its high-powered offense in sync.

Saints quarterback Drew Brees didn’t even play a full half, yet he
completed 17 of 19 passes for 182 yards and one touchdown. The New
Orleans defense attacked young Chiefs quarterback Brodie Croyle, forcing
him to suffer a nightmarish 5-for-17 performance.

The Saints are NFC title contenders. They have high expectations for
this season. The rebuilding Chiefs face a tough road back into AFC
contention.

So during Week 3 of the preseason -– the last time most stars see any
meaningful action before the regular season -– this was an appropriate
outcome for teams in contrasting circumstances.

The Rams must view the Raiders game the same way. Oakland has a new
coach, Lane Kiffin, and a new quarterback, Dolphins washout Daunte
Culpepper.

The Raiders are trying to undo the damage of their chaotic 2006 season,
when they finished 2-14. They are doing so without the No. 1 overall
pick in the ’07 NFL Draft, unsigned quarterback JaMarcus Russell.

Kiffin has an enormous task at hand. The Raiders have been a
laughingstock in recent seasons. The AFC is a far more powerful
conference, top to bottom, than the NFC.

By contrast, Rams coach Scott Linehan has his program rolling smoothly
in Year Two. His team’s injury troubles are relatively minor at this
point and he appears to have almost all of his pieces in place.

Now it is time to play a crisp preseason game. Now it is time to prepare
for the season opener, since the Governor’s Cup game against Kansas City
will primarily be an exercise for the back-ups and those young players
trying to claim the last few roster spots.

Week 4 of the preseason will bring us the Gus Frerotte Game as Linehan
puts his best players in bubble wrap.

During Week 2 of the preseason, the Rams first-team offense (minus
Steven Jackson) moved the ball against San Diego but failed to score
touchdowns. Fullback Madison Hedgecock killed one potential scoring
drive with a fumble and quarterback Marc Bulger killed another with his
end zone interception.

“You don’t want any turnovers, but if you throw the football you’re
going to have a few,” Linehan said. “You just want to have a lot more
positive things in the passing game than negative. You just practice it
and stress it.”

Defensively, the Rams missed some open-field tackles and became
vulnerable to San Diego’s established ground game, even with LaDainian
Tomlinson wearing street clothes. They also failed to force a turnover,
which is a point of emphasis with the Jim Haslett-coached defense.

“Defensively, you work at getting the ball out,” Linehan said. “We
haven’t seen that yet here in preseason, but it was very effective for
us last year.”

On special teams, Linehan’s gave up a punt return touchdown. That can’t
happen in real games, ever. New special teams coach Al Roberts has to
get the coverage teams ready.

Every problem the team suffered last season cropped up again in the
Chargers game. Hence the focus on this game, the Rams’ last preseason
chance to work all their front-line players in game conditions.

“Almost all (first-teamers) will play the entire first half,” Linehan
said. “Possibly the opening drive of the second half. Have the
(second-teamers) finish the second half. Most everybody that has a great
shot at being on the final 53 will play at least a half.”

We’re not asking Linehan to give Jackson 20 carries in this game or
expose Bulger to needless danger. But it IS fair to expect the
first-team offense to score a couple of touchdowns, since running back
Brian Leonard, receiver Drew Bennett and tight end Randy McMichael have
joined an already formidable attack.

The Rams need to start quickly this season. Their early schedule is
favorable. They need to bank some victories, since their schedule turns
ugly midway through the campaign.

Linehan’s team needs to generate some momentum -– and that has to start
tonight in Oakland.
