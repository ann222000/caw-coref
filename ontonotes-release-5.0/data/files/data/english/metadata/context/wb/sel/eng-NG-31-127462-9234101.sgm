This AP report was posted a short while ago on MSN.com:

LONDON - Police have arrested two men over an attempt to blackmail a member
of the British royal family with an alleged sex tape, a newspaper reported.

The Sunday Times said the pair had approached the unnamed family member and
demanded 50,000 pounds (US$100,000) not to publicize a video allegedly
showing the royal engaged in a sex act. The blackmailers also claimed to
have evidence suggesting the royal had supplied an aide with an envelope
containing cocaine, the newspaper said.  The newspaper said it could not
identify the royal family member for legal reasons.

It said the blackmailers' target contacted police and two suspects were
arrested at a London hotel on Sept. 11 after an undercover police operation.

Buckingham Palace could not immediately be reached for comment.

In response to queries about the report, London police said only that two
men, aged 30 and 40, had appeared at a London court on Sept. 13 charged with
blackmail. They were ordered detained until a hearing at London's Central
Criminal Court on Dec. 20. The force would give no details of the case or
identify the suspects.

Old flash Prince Harry at it again is my guess. Wonder if the odds
makers have been taking bets?

If it is PH, one would think HRH would have learned  his lesson by now,
and keep the royal tackle and himself out of such situations. In this
era of digital/cell phone cameras, nothing is private anymore, and it
all can be captured quite easily.

Still, would love to see just what is what, but have a  hunch this is
going to be played out very quietly. Even if the pair to go trial,it is
highly unlikely the photographs will be given in public evidence. There
is also probably a furious hunt going on to see if anyone else has or
received the same pictures.

Persons taken into custody really are amateurs. If it was money they
wanted, they could have sold the photographs to any number of American
or European tabloids for far more than what they tried to extort out of
the RF.

If it were the person you hope it is, they'd have asked for a lot more
money.

As I'm sure you already know, the BBC is now saying that the person
who was being blackmailed is a minor royal, one with a low public
profile. -- Q

Well, it was only $100,000 US - Charles is definitely worth more than that -
Harry should be, too.  Unless, of course, one is dealing with really stupid
blackmailers who do not know the street value of what they have.

Remember that people, by in large, do not understand what royalty is.  I am
reminded of a Larry King interview with India Hicks, he kept saying that she
was royal - and she kept correcting him.  So we could be talking about Lord
Frederick or someone as minor as that.

The reports are that it's someone who isn't in the papers very often.  And
on top of that, you have to wonder what they mean by 'royal'.  Do they mean
an HRH or a member of the Queen's family?
I'm afraid that nobody with any knowledge of Prince Charles took those
rumours seriously.  Even our papers were openly scoffing at them.

One clue is the fact that the cocaine had been placed in an envelope
which was 'embossed with the royal's personal insignia'. Which royal
except the Prince of Wales would have personalised envelopes, and what
sort of 'insignia' are they referring to? My guess is the Duke of
York..

You can guess all you like, but &quot;very quietly&quot; is an understatement.
SOP for blackmail cases is that nothing which might reveal the
identity of the victim will be disclosed - if necessary the identities
of the accused will remain secret and the entire trial will be held in
camera. This would be true irrespective of who the victim was. There
will be no question of the photographs being published in the UK,
before, during or after the trial. Doubtless, numerous blurred images
which are alleged to be these photographs will appear in the foreign
press and on the internet, and people will believe what they want to
believe.

Quite true. Harry has not been linked to cocaine at any time whilst
both Freddie Windsor and Tom Parker Bowles have. Though the latter is
not a member of the RF, some see him as one by extension, on the PoW's
Christmas card et al . Yet the report says it was the aide who used
the cocaine.

Now by process of elimination, you are correct.  Nevermind the
obigatory red-herring supplied by the BBC in regards to seniority of
the royal.

This case involves First one or more civilians gaining employment on
this particular royal's staff, therefore he must have an extensive
staff to slip in one or two new members.( These men filmed the
video. ) Not to mention that Scotland Yard slipped in yet another faux
employee to set up the trap for the alleged blackmailers.

&quot;By this time a detective had been attached to the royal's staff. He
contacted the gang posing as a member of staff and the meeting was
arranged at the Hilton. Parts of the video were shown and the meeting
was secretly videoed by Scotland Yard detectives in an adjacent room.
The two suspects were then arrested.&quot;

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2753447.ece

There is only one royal male with such an extensive staff.

Of course the 50 thousand was just the first payment of many they had
dreamed of collecting.

Nice sleuthing, Lori.

ANY royal would have stationery with personal insignia on it, including
royal ladies.  Many peers do and so do some commoners.  There is nothing in

extremely lazy in differentiating between actual royals and relatives
by marriage, which takes us back to Tom Parker-Bowles, or someone of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There's little doubt of the 'royal and his aide.'

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Old flash Prince Harry at it again is my guess. Wonder if the
odds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; makers have been taking bets?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If it is PH, one would think HRH would have learned  his lesson
by
&gt; &gt; now,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and keep the royal tackle and himself out of such situations.
In
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; era of digital/cell phone cameras, nothing is private anymore,
and
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all can be captured quite easily.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Still, would love to see just what is what, but have a  hunch
this
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; going to be played out very quietly. Even if the pair to go
&gt; &gt; trial,it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; highly unlikely the photographs will be given in public
evidence.
&gt; &gt; There
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is also probably a furious hunt going on to see if anyone else
has
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; received the same pictures.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Persons taken into custody really are amateurs. If it was money
&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wanted, they could have sold the photographs to any number of
&gt; &gt; American
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; or European tabloids for far more than what they tried to
extort
&gt; &gt; out of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the RF.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Candide

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why would you think PH?  My first thought was Prince Charles as
&gt; &gt; there were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rumours a few years ago about his dealings with male members of
his
&gt; &gt; staff/

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it was only $100,000 US - Charles is definitely worth more
than
&gt; &gt; that -
&gt; &gt; &gt; Harry should be, too.  Unless, of course, one is dealing with
really
&gt; &gt; stupid
&gt; &gt; &gt; blackmailers who do not know the street value of what they have.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember that people, by in large, do not understand what royalty
is.
&gt; &gt; I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; reminded of a Larry King interview with India Hicks, he kept
saying
&gt; &gt; that she
&gt; &gt; &gt; was royal - and she kept correcting him.  So we could be talking
about
&gt; &gt; Lord
&gt; &gt; &gt; Frederick or someone as minor as that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; -- Stephen J Stillwell jr

&gt; &gt; Well that is true, even the BBC insists still on calling the late
Diana,
&gt; &gt; &quot;The Princess of Wales&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Others besides those taken into custody must know about the matter
or a
&gt; &gt; least the circumstances surrounding, so it probably will all come
out
&gt; &gt; someday.

&gt; &gt; Candide- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Well it looks as though the Ginger Bullet Magnet has dodged one this
&gt; time. Actually though, he seems to be taking his military
&gt; responsibilities seriously and both he and Wills did seem intelligent
&gt; and conscientious during their NBC TV interview in June so maybe
&gt; there's hope for him after all.

Wasn't that bit with the tart in Canada involving PH after the NBC

I don't think he's a likely candidate because even our worst tabloids regard
him as 'royal by association only' and this story emerged in the Sunday
Times.  According to all reports, TPB hasn't done drugs for many years - he
went through a bad phase and came out of it.  So, I doubt it's him.
I think it more likely it's someone related to the Queen by blood but in a
not-well-known- to the public fashion.  One thing that makes me (and not
just me) think this is that these men could have made a lot of money selling
these photos to foreign press if they were of some really high-profile
royals AND there is the suggestion that they demanded only as much money as
they thought that 'royal' could obtain.  It could, after all, be a now
happily married junior, junior, junior royal couple! We don't even know if
the 'royal' was male or female.

Does the article state that this is illicit, extra-marital or homosexual
sex? No, it does not.

All that seems to have come out so far is a bit of a nothing if you boil it
down.  Assuming this video isn't a fabrication, it appears that a royal aide
took cocaine from a royal envelope, obtainable from a desk drawer.  And
remember an 'aide' can be anything from a Private Secretary to a vegetable
peeler in newspaper speak - and a royal was filmed 'committing' a sex act.
If this sex act was so outrageous or the royal so important why not go to
the foreign press and name your price?  £50k is pretty paltry if this is so
'explosive'.

was taken on a mobile phone.

The film was claimed yesterday to show a close aide &quot;boasting&quot; of
engaging in a gay sex act with the royal individual.

The aide is also apparently seen taking cocaine from an envelope
bearing the royal person's name, chopping up the drug with a Harrods
credit card and snorting

The two suspected blackmailers are both well off and move on the
fringe of royal circles.

One of them is the 30-year-old son of a businessman who is said to
know the royal aide.

A tawdry picture was emerging last night of how the pair came to be

The Mail understands that the suspects contacted at least three
national newspapers with a view to selling the tapes earlier this
year.

They were arrested as they played the &quot;sex&quot; tape.

It is understood they had material from mobile phone camera footage as

The video is said to show cocaine being cut up on a coffee table with
a Harrods charge card before being snorted by the royal aide. &quot;

&gt; &gt; One clue is the fact that the cocaine had been placed in an envelope
&gt; &gt; which was 'embossed with the royal's personal insignia'. Which royal
&gt; &gt; except the Prince of Wales would have personalised envelopes, and what

&gt; &gt; York..

&gt; &gt; Richard Lichten

&gt; I would doubt that people know what a &quot;royal personal insignia&quot; is or is
&gt; not.  The Viscount Linley and many others may use emblems or monograms on
&gt; their stationery which could easily be confused by a reporter for an
&gt; insignia.

That's possible and now we are told who the blackmailers are ( we've
already been told in other articles that they are affluent )...sounds
like they wanted to cause unrest more than gain money:

Royal sources moved swiftly to rule out the Queen's immediate family,
including Princes William and Harry and their cousins Zara and Peter
Phillips.

But thousands of internet users began speculating about the victim's
identity and fears rose that they might be named by foreign
newspapers.

Last night, the two alleged blackmailers were named as Ian Strachan
and Sean McGuigan.

Strachan has told his lawyers he has met Prince Harry and William
twice and has rubbed shoulders with Princess Anne's daughter Zara and
Lord Frederick Windsor, son of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent.

It could be a Coat of Arms. And anyone even vaguely associated with

Apparently the whole point of mentioning the &quot;insignia&quot; was to
demonstrate that it identified the royal or is connected to him. No
word of him saying it wasn't his envelope, in fact he contacted law
enforcement because he realized he was in a very bad position.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Authorities have named the two men accused
of trying to blackmail a member of the British royal family.
art.buckingham.gi.jpg

Buckingham Palace said the case is a police matter and made no further
comment.

Ian Strachan, aged 30, and Sean McGuigan, aged 40, are both due to
appear at the Central Criminal Court, London, in December.

Scotland Yard confirmed to CNN Sunday that two men had been charged
with trying to blackmail an unnamed member of the royal family. The
men appeared behind closed doors at the City of Westminster
magistrates' court, London, last month, each charged with one count of
blackmail.

It has been reported in the British press that the men approached the
royal household and suggested that they had video tape of a royal
taking part in a sex act.

British newspapers have also said that the alleged blackmailers
claimed to have tape of a royal aide snorting cocaine supplied by a
member of the royal family.

It is reported that the police were then brought in and that a
detective posed as a royal official during a meeting with the alleged
blackmailers at a London hotel. Two suspects were then arrested.

British newspapers report that the men were demanding approximately
$100,000 or £50,000 in exchange for not making the video public.

Buckingham Palace said this is a police matter and they cannot comment
further.

The judge in this case has banned the media from publishing or
broadcasting any information that would lead to the identification of
the accused or the alleged victim.

http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/29/royal.blackmail/index....

The judge's hope of protecting the accused has failed miserably amd
most people believe they know the identity of the royal who has a
staff so large that an extra addition or two from Scotland Yard sent
is as a mole is inconspicuous.

There has been no reporting on the size of the staff of the royal involved.
Nor is the royal involved a member of the senior royal family.  It is
someone who does not carry out royal duties, so very probably not someone
who is an HRH and therefore not strictly 'royal', but a member of the
Queen's family.  The lawyer of one of the blackmailers has said that there
is no video of any sex scenes but that there are video and audio tapes of an
*aide* (not a royal) claiming to have performed a sex act with a royal.
There is no proof of the fact which is probably why a paltry £50k is all
that was asked.

It has only been GUESSED that it is a minor royal....not
substantiated. It is surmised only because of the small amount of
money involved. Yet two points to remember is that blackmail is not a
one time operation but intended to be drawn out indefinitely and
neither of the two charged are said to need money and in fact said to
be relatively wealthy.

PLUS, Blackmail rumours about THE QUEEN are mentioned:

&quot;The video is said to contain other unsubstantiated allegations
concerning other members of the Royal Family, including the Queen.&quot;

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/ne...icle2759799.ece

SOOOO WHO do we know who was SACKED by the Queen and yet was soon
after engaged to organize HER Jubilee party !?!?!?!? Why would she
allow THAT unless..........

Link given to establish age of aide.

Keep in mind...it wasn't said that the royal used cocaine, only that
the aide did and the oldest blackmailer, aged 40 years old, is near
the age of a certain aide who was at the centre of a huge royal
scandal in the not too distant past. The two blackmailers are said to
be friends of the aide.

It was said that the blackmailers rang the royal's business office
rather than the Palace. One royal business office is in Buckingham
Gate.

Well after several days of this we can be sure of at least two things;
the matter does not involve a senior member of the RF, nor is the
&quot;evidence&quot; worth much in of itself. Perhaps it may be embarrassing to
whomever is involved, but that seems to be pretty much all.  We know
this because the stuff was shopped around and not one London tabloid
could be bothered, and they hardly are a bunch known for loyalty to the
RF, especially when there is a chance of making money.

If what was on offer contained anything clearly damning to even the
ranks of Freddie Windsor, it is almost certain the RF would have
probably tried to paid off the bastards. Scotland Yard or no, material
taken in as evidence is going to be and can be seen by any number of
persons, authorised or not. While they could loose their positions for
sneaking a peep and or tattling, it has been known to happen.

Clear photos or video of either Prince William, Prince Harry, Prince
Andrew, Prince Charles, Prince Edward,  or any male British  RH being
&quot;serviced&quot; by another man would be worth thousands if not millions of
pounds, and hardly something the Palace would allow to fall into outside
hands.

Think about it, if one had really juicy and damning material to use
against the RF, would you only ask for a mere £50k? Do you think that
the small amount demanded would leave the intended target of blackmail
to pay up and not call the police?

&gt; &gt; &gt; One clue is the fact that the cocaine had been placed in an envelope
&gt; &gt; &gt; which was 'embossed with theroyal'spersonal insignia'. Whichroyal

&gt; &gt; I would doubt that people know what a &quot;royalpersonal insignia&quot; is or is
&gt; &gt; not.  The Viscount Linley and many others may use emblems or monograms on
&gt; &gt; their stationery which could easily be confused by a reporter for an

I wonder who it could be. Lets review the evidence

1) this royal has a big staff, as has been noted
2) a royal who would engage in sexual activity with the help (and male
members at that)
3) I distinctly heard that the video in question &quot;featured someone
doing Charlie&quot; :)

Lets face it, they are royal, so they have a right to have it all
hushed up. The accused has no right to a fair trial. Try, convict and
hang him in secret.

Despite the fairly frantic attempts by a couple of people here to put senior
royals in the frame for this the facts are that the newspapers know who it
is.  They have said so.  But they are forbidden by law from disclosing the
name of the royal. (This is not too unusual in blackmail cases and is not a
prerogative of the royals)
The newspapers have said that it is not a senior royal and not a royal who
does any duties.  Therefore it is not the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the
Prince of Wales, Princes William or Harry, The Earl &amp; Countess of Wessex,
Princess Alexandra, the Dukes of Gloucester or Kent or anyone else we can
think of who sometimes represents Her Majesty on an official basis.  And,
according to the lawyer of one of the blackmailers, there is no video of
anyone having sex with anyone.  The entire thing is based on some
cocaine-fuelled boast by a royal aide and *that* was taped and video'd.
No doubt, in time, it will be publicly declared in papers in Eire or Europe
and UK papers will then feel free to take it up and sanctimoniously justify
themselves in doing so because they'll be 'setting the record straight and
protecting the names of all others who came under suspicion'.  Blech.

There have been several less than subtle 'hints' so my post was addressed to
all of those.  All we can be sure of is that the victim of the blackmailers
isn't a senior royal and doesn't do royal duties.

Not really, as there is an ongoing criminal investigation, and the judge
as issued a gag order. Besides it has already been established that the
blackmailers tried to shop their wares to various tabloids around
London, and found no takers. It stands to reason whatever newspapers
were contacted, and informed of what was on offer, was told if not
actually saw the content.

The fact it isn't all over the Internet by now reinforces whatever
scandal is going on, it does not involve anyone even remotely senior in
the RF. Rest assured those who &quot;know&quot; about the matter, either think the
thing is such small beer not worth bothering about, or aren't interested
in participating in tittle-tattle.

&gt; &gt; This AP report was posted a short while ago on MSN.com:

&gt; &gt; LONDON - Police have arrested two men over an attempt to blackmail a member
&gt; &gt; of the British royal family with an alleged sex tape, a newspaper reported.

&gt; &gt; The Sunday Times said the pair had approached the unnamed family member and
&gt; &gt; demanded 50,000 pounds (US$100,000) not to publicize a video allegedly
&gt; &gt; showing the royal engaged in a sex act. The blackmailers also claimed to
&gt; &gt; have evidence suggesting the royal had supplied an aide with an envelope
&gt; &gt; containing cocaine, the newspaper said.  The newspaper said it could not
&gt; &gt; identify the royal family member for legal reasons.

&gt; &gt; It said the blackmailers' target contacted police and two suspects were
&gt; &gt; arrested at a London hotel on Sept. 11 after an undercover police operation.

&gt; &gt; Buckingham Palace could not immediately be reached for comment.

&gt; &gt; In response to queries about the report, London police said only that two
&gt; &gt; men, aged 30 and 40, had appeared at a London court on Sept. 13 charged with
&gt; &gt; blackmail. They were ordered detained until a hearing at London's Central
&gt; &gt; Criminal Court on Dec. 20. The force would give no details of the case or
&gt; &gt; identify the suspects.

&gt; The Times gives a more detailed report, revealing that there is such a
&gt; tape:

&gt; &gt; Why would you think PH?  My first thought was Prince Charles as there

&gt; Quite true. Harry has not been linked to cocaine at any time whilst
&gt; both Freddie Windsor and Tom Parker Bowles have. Though the latter is
&gt; not a member of the RF, some see him as one by extension, on the PoW's
&gt; Christmas card et al . Yet the report says it was the aide who used
&gt; the cocaine.

&gt; Now by process of elimination, you are correct.  Nevermind the
&gt; obigatory red-herring supplied by the BBC in regards to seniority of
&gt; the royal.

&gt; This case involves First one or more civilians gaining employment on
&gt; this particular royal's staff, therefore he must have an extensive
&gt; staff to slip in one or two new members.( These men filmed the
&gt; video. ) Not to mention that Scotland Yard slipped in yet another faux
&gt; employee to set up the trap for the alleged blackmailers.

&gt; &quot;By this time a detective had been attached to the royal's staff. He
&gt; contacted the gang posing as a member of staff and the meeting was
&gt; arranged at the Hilton. Parts of the video were shown and the meeting
&gt; was secretly videoed by Scotland Yard detectives in an adjacent room.
&gt; The two suspects were then arrested.&quot;

&gt; There is only one royal male with such an extensive staff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the RF.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why would you think PH?  My first thought was Prince Charles as there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were rumours a few years ago about his dealings with male members of his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; staff/

&gt; &gt; &gt; Quite true. Harry has not been linked to cocaine at any time whilst
&gt; &gt; &gt; both Freddie Windsor and Tom Parker Bowles have. Though the latter is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not a member of the RF, some see him as one by extension, on the PoW's
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christmas card et al . Yet the report says it was the aide who used
&gt; &gt; &gt; the cocaine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now by process of elimination, you are correct.  Nevermind the
&gt; &gt; &gt; obigatory red-herring supplied by the BBC in regards to seniority of
&gt; &gt; &gt; theroyal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This case involves First one or more civilians gaining employment on
&gt; &gt; &gt; this particularroyal'sstaff, therefore he must have an extensive
&gt; &gt; &gt; staff to slip in one or two new members.( These men filmed the
&gt; &gt; &gt; video. ) Not to mention that Scotland Yard slipped in yet another faux
&gt; &gt; &gt; employee to set up the trap for the alleged blackmailers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;By this time a detective had been attached to theroyal'sstaff. He
&gt; &gt; &gt; contacted the gang posing as a member of staff and the meeting was
&gt; &gt; &gt; arranged at the Hilton. Parts of the video were shown and the meeting
&gt; &gt; &gt; was secretly videoed by Scotland Yard detectives in an adjacent room.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The two suspects were then arrested.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2753447.ece

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is only oneroyalmale with such an extensive staff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course the 50 thousand was just the first payment of many they had
&gt; &gt; &gt; dreamed of collecting.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice sleuthing, Lori.

&gt; &gt; Still living on your own planet, I see, PK?

&gt; &gt; Can't you read? The media (that you worship as being so accurate) is
&gt; &gt; saying this is NOT a prominentRoyal, so it is likely NOT PC.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One clue is the fact that the cocaine had been placed in an envelope
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which was 'embossed with theroyal'spersonal insignia'. Whichroyal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except the Prince of Wales would have personalised envelopes, and what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sort of 'insignia' are they referring to? My guess is the Duke of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; York..

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Richard Lichten

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would doubt that people know what a &quot;royalpersonal insignia&quot; is or is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not.  The Viscount Linley and many others may use emblems or monograms on
&gt; &gt; &gt; their stationery which could easily be confused by a reporter for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; insignia.

&gt; I wonder who it could be. Lets review the evidence

&gt; 1) this royal has a big staff, as has been noted
&gt; 2) a royal who would engage in sexual activity with the help (and male
&gt; members at that)
&gt; 3) I distinctly heard that the video in question &quot;featured someone
&gt; doing Charlie&quot; :)

&gt; Lets face it, they are royal, so they have a right to have it all
&gt; hushed up. The accused has no right to a fair trial. Try, convict and
&gt; hang him in secret.

Agree on 1 &amp; 2 but doubt the video tape is that explicit but all this
blather that it isn't a senior royal is only guess work and the papers
have admitted it by saying they were judging by the amount of money
asked for the evidence. The Palace hasn't said a word, not minor
royalty, not low-profile, none of that.

Charles is always highly protected from criminal charges, so much so
that two trials were halted for his benefit; that of Paul Burrell and
George Brown. He is protected from testifying at the inquest into the
death of his late wife. He was not prosecuted for flogging royal gifts
and failure to report the income from them.

He was shielded from the British press the last time he and this same
'aide' were in hot water. It's happened again. The ranks are closed.

The two who tried to sell this story and the tapes weren't really
after money. That's already been established. They were out to expose
the prince yet again and have succeeded. They could pay a high price
for it , up to 14 years in prison.
