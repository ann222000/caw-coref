3-D Medical Imaging Reaches the Stars

Cambridge, MA -- A unique collaboration created by Harvard's Initiative for
Innovative Computing (IIC) has brought together astronomers, medical imaging
specialists, and software engineers to adapt medical imaging software to
create 3-D views of astronomical bodies.

"Once this technology is fully developed, we will be able to explore and
visualize space in entirely new ways," said Alyssa Goodman, Director of the
IIC and a Professor of Astronomy in Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Goodman discussed results from the IIC's Astronomical Medicine Project, or
AstroMed, last week at the IIC's Inaugural Symposium in Cambridge, Mass.

AstroMed typifies the work of the IIC, bringing together computer scientists
and their colleagues in other disciplines to develop new approaches to
scientific problem-solving -- in this case, solving problems common to both
astronomy and medicine, particularly the visualization and analysis of
large, complex data sets.

In pursuit of that goal, AstroMed researchers are working to modify existing
medical imaging programs for use in astronomical research. The revised
programs can generate 3-D views of cosmic structures, just as physicians
generate 3-D views of anatomical structures.

Astronomical and medical research are more alike than they might seem.
Astronomers and medical researchers often rely on quantitative analysis of
imaging data for insight. Astronomers may be looking for nuggets of
star-forming material buried in interstellar matter while doctors are
looking for tumors hidden inside a brain, but the steps in their
investigations are extraordinarily similar.

Until recently, researchers would have needed a powerful supercomputer to
create 3-D visualizations like those of AstroMed. Now, such visualizations
can be done on a laptop with Open Source programs such as "3D Slicer" and
"OsiriX."

3D Slicer allows users to interact with data. Not only can a 3-D object be
created -- it can be rotated, zoomed and cropped using a set of intuitive
tools. In astronomy, "3-D" doesn't always mean three spatial dimensions. By
combining the 2-D position of gas emission mapped out on the sky with 1-D
measurements of the gas's velocity along the line of sight, astronomers
generate 3-D data sets with dimensions that can serve as proxies for three
spatial dimensions. Using programs like 3D Slicer and OsiriX on these
virtual 3-D constructions, astronomers can become virtual spacefarers,
easily selecting "distances" and viewing angles in order to navigate around
a gas cloud and study it from "all sides."

"Right now, this software is a tool for scientists. We are blazing a trail
in the field of 3-D astronomical computer graphics," explained Michael
Halle, AstroMed Project Manager. "As we refine our capabilities, we hope to
develop a tool that researchers in a variety of fields reliant on 3-D data
will use on everyday computers."

Initially, the AstroMed team has focused on studying dusty gas clouds in the
Milky Way that are forming new stars. The team is working to analyze data
from the COMPLETE survey of star-forming regions, which has collected
extensive infrared and radio measurements of several star-forming complexes.
Already, their work on the Perseus region has identified several previously
unknown large bubbles and shells of gas, as well as more than a dozen new
jets of material shooting from newborn stars.

Goodman added that while medical advances currently are helping the
astronomical community, in the future, astronomers' innovations in extending
and improving this software will help the medical community. "The algorithms
that we develop to identify star-forming clumps in a dusty gas cloud might
be used to identify possible tumors in a person's body," she explained.

The revised software also may prove useful to other data-intensive branches
of science like weather modeling and geophysics.

The software and techniques developed by the IIC will contribute to the
revolutionary astronomy project known as the Virtual Observatory. The
Virtual Observatory will link all the world's astronomy data together,
giving people around the world easy access to data from many different
telescopes and observatories, at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic
spectrum.

The team at Harvard includes: astronomer Goodman, Dr. Michael Halle, a
principal at the Surgical Planning Laboratory of Brigham and Women's
Hospital and the AstroMed Project Manager at IIC; Dr. Jens Kauffman, a
postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and
IIC; Michelle Borkin, Harvard College '06, now an IIC Research Associate;
and Douglas Alan, an IIC Senior Software Engineer. In addition, the team is
working with Dr. Nick Holliman of the University of Durham's Visualization
Laboratory in the U.K. on enhancing AstroMed images using stereoscopic (3-D)
displays.

The Initiative in Innovative Computing (IIC) accelerates the pace of science
by fostering collaborations that span traditional academic boundaries,
bringing together computer scientist and scientists in other disciplines to
develop solutions to problems and develop ideas and inventions along the
continuum from basic science to scientific computation to computational
science to computer science.
