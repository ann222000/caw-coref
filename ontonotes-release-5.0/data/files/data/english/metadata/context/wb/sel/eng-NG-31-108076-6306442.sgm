What has brought you the biggest gain in your sparring/rolling
performance?

1) Improved physical conditioning
2) Better technique
3) Just having more experience in rolling/sparring

All 3.  But probably most of all number 3.

For fisticuffs, 3 edges it for me.  You can out box someone with just the
jab when years of experience has made certain subtleties of timing and
distance second nature.

Still consider myself new to (and crap at) rolling, but I reckon 2 will edge
it there (Assuming I ever do improve), as *I* feel it did in the standing
clinch.

Not to mention, #3 tends to lead to #2 and #1.

I've found that you improve at a slow and steady rate with just number
3! When I learn new techniques (ones that others in class don't know)
I tend to dominate for a while.
I think in rolling that it's more important to work out the particular
techniques that work best for you as an individual.
Fitness comes into it I'd say when your skill level is close to that
of your opponents.

Scary.

For both striking and grappling, 3 is a big factor in the beginning,
just getting used to being in that situation. After the initial (big)
boost from that, 2.

Although I can't clearly separate 2 and 3 in any practical sense.

Well in practice 3 will also include some 1 and some 2, but in the
above split I kind of wanted to see 3 as just increased experience.

For me I'd say that 1 is the biggest contributor to improving if you
start. By increasing the specific conditioning for a particular sport
you'll be able to roll longer, and to focus more on technique than on
preservation of energy while rolling.

And while strenght cannot replace technique it can compensate up to a
certain degree.

Well, since I've recently convinced myself you are all actually me ala
Fight Club (although in a much more boring kinda way - jeez can't at
least one of me blow something up or something...) I'm not quite sure
how I'd be able to do that?
