THE POISON FLAG

By Ron Rizzo

Small black flies were dancing around the American flag.   It
hung by a short oblique pole
mounted in an aluminum cup screwed to the front door frame.
&quot;Disgraceful,&quot; Mr. Walter Nebble muttered. He scrutinized the
tiny bobbing swarm thrilled
by a remote inhuman excitement.    The center of his face gathered up
in a crumple of disgust.
&quot;You  could  smear some citronella on the flag,&quot; I  helpfully
suggested, from the chain-link
pen of my tiny front lawn.
Mr.  Nebble's mouth deformed in an inverted rictus of horror.
I  had  impugned  both the
physical integrity  of  his quilt-sized banner,  and  his fastidious
slaughter of vermin.  His  small
back yard,  half  the size of his driveway, triumphantly sported  on a
rusty  iron pole the largest
citronella candle  we had ever seen,  a monumental waxen phallus  of
faintly lemon scent.  We
speculated  he had ordered  it  from the mosquito coasts  of Central
America.    But  no dozing
hammock, indolently slung between the elderly elms, complemented it.
Without a word,   Mr. Nebble  disappeared  into his front
porch, from which  there  issued
metallic clanks and dull thuds.
Meanwhile, the mites alighted on stars and white stripes, like
winking specks of dirt on legs,
promenading  up and down the chaste files,  and simulating  pinprick
holes  in the five-points of
unnamed states.
Mr. Nebble emerged,  armed with pliers,  a staple gun,  a
plastic tub of water,  latex gloves,
and a large jug of wide-spectrum insecticide.
Without  acknowledging  our presence --- my better half  had
joined me  during the interval,
Walter pulled on  the squeaking gloves with some  irritation,  poured
ounces of the milky poison
into the water, pried loose the large staples from the flagpole, and
plunged the flag into the toxic
solution, which sloshed over his two front steps.
We gasped.
Like a sarong-bound washerwoman  squatting on a sloping rock  by
a tropical river,  Nebble
repeatedly dunked, hauled up,  and rung out the national standard as
if it were a soiled garment,
completely infusing its fibers with toxin.
But the tiny flies  had moved on  to another  object of
interest,  our faces.  Batting  at the air
like twins throwing fits, we ducked into the house.

********

For the next two weeks  we didn't use our front door.  We  got
to the car  from the kitchen.
When we drove home, we parked the car in  the mossy cinderblock relic
of a garage at the yard
end of the driveway, which flanked the Nebble's double-decker.   Or,
if the errand was on foot,
we slipped out the back porch into the alleyway that ran along the
other side of our house.
Our surreptitious comings-and-goings were suffused with the
faint perfume of the citronella
spike, the  Nebbles'  monstrous,  imperishable  bloom.    The aroma
lent to  night trips  an air of
mystery,  of buggy romance.   In the pitch black  into which the  tall
frame  houses,  and ancient
maples, chestnuts,  and  the  odd  blue spruce,  plunged our back
yard,  the waft of phony  citrus
was all  that moored us,  between  extinguishing  the car lights  and
fumbling for the  porch light
switch.

*************************************************************************** *****

Finally,  the 4th of July arrived.  Mr. Nebble lit  sparklers
and  Roman candles  on his brick
stoop in the evening, to amuse the little kids on our block. Mrs.
Nebble watched from behind the
screen door.  Hating explosions, which unnerved me,  I fled to the
refuge of a back room with a
book and  the five-inch  portable TV,  unsure  whether the  now-
unreliable  Walter  stocked  his
cellar with fire-crackers, rockets and other terrors.
But David watched  from our second-floor  front  room  that
served as a  library-cum-music
studio.  Namely,  it  housed  an  enormous battered globe  mounted  in
a thick  oaken  armature,
plus  an  unstringed  mandolin  and  David's  flute.  The globe,
rescued  from  a  rummage sale,
showed a bloated Germany,  its two fiery pieces squeezing Poland,  as
a rasher of Czechoslova-
kia  lay  vulnerably beneath them.
I thought,  David's probably leaning against  a wooden
meridian,  absently turning the wreck-
ing-ball earth, as he gazes out  the corner window, his pale moonlit
face glazed with the sly half-
smile that crept under his moustache when his attention retreated and
his thoughts silently flared
on his lenses, like the mute display on the sidewalk below.
I slipped  my arms  around  his waist  and kissed  the back  of
his neck.   He tittered  as my
moustache brushed his ear.
&quot;Has Miss Frightful abandoned her boudoir and bodice-ripper?&quot;
David's   baritone  skewed
camp into a surreal twang or an epistemological drawl.
&quot;The lack of percussion gives me hope,&quot; I puffed. &quot;However, the
merest whiff of nitre shall
send me flying.&quot;
&quot;Or produce a tremendous release of MEEthane.   Between cherry
bombs and saltpeter, or
a devil waving  a big lemon stick,  you  make the most demure
debutante  look positively rapaci-
ous.&quot;  He raised my hand and thoughtfully kissed it, still watching
the sparklers stutter in light.
&quot;He's  luring those kids to their death,&quot; I complained.   The
poison-soaked  flag  hung limply
just above Nebble's bald crown.   &quot;Filling their lungs with toxic
vapors.&quot;
&quot;I  haven't  seen any gnats buzzing his front  door  lately,&quot;
David observed.
&quot;He's pushed  the insects  into  extinction.   Can you  imagine
him as  caretaker  of our bio-
sphere?  And all three of its species?&quot;
&quot;I wonder if he's told his tenant about the Stars and Stripes.&quot;
&quot;I wonder if he's told his wife.&quot;
&quot;Perimeter defense.  It's all the rage.&quot;
&quot;You can't exactly call it a Green Zone.&quot;
&quot;The insecticide should've faded by now.&quot;
&quot;It hasn't rained once since he dunked Old Glory.&quot;
David turned around and clasped my shoulder blades.   &quot;How about
retiring to your steamy
boudoir?  We can enact your favoritepurple prose.&quot;

********

The next morning, as  I crunched  through  my  Amygdalen
Clusters  soaked in  kefir  and
blackstrap molasses, and compulsively read an article on Labrador in
an old issue of Macleans,
David waltzed into the sunlit kitchen nook, fully dressed.
&quot;You'll never guess what Herr Walter is doing,&quot; David teased.
I shifted uneasily in my BVDs, unsticking my bare thighs from
the  white  bench  that  was
plastered  with  monstrous  Marimekko daisies.
&quot;No, I never will,&quot; I echoed, intrigued.
&quot;He's laundering the Stars n' Stripes again, in bug's bane.&quot;
This  news,  of the same senseless act repeated,  like a second
crime,  and a glimpse of an
insane habit in the making, baffled me.

&quot;Has he lost it?&quot; I wondered, disdainfully.
&quot;Well, he's wearing surgical gloves again, but I think he'll
need to buy more insecticide, if a
third baptism is in the offing.&quot;
I opened  the kitchen window and sniffed  the moist  morning
air.  Only  the smell of grass,
asphalt, sunflowers, and a few rotting pink roses greeted my
nostrils.  But I could hear a distinct
sloshing sound echoing dimly along the driveway from the street.
I slammed the window shut.  David's look was a question.
&quot;Are we living next to a maniac?&quot; I irritably asked.
To  dispel my disquiet, David walked over, pressed his thumbs
against my nipples as he grasped me under the arms, and kissed me.
&quot;I'm  off to work, love.  Let's meet for lunch at the Stunted
Gingko,&quot;  David beamed down
at me without smiling.
&quot;OK.&quot;
&quot;Don't obsess.  You have to finish coding that  test suite
today, don't you?&quot;
&quot;YES,  MR.  DAVID,&quot; I chimed in my most mindless  third-grade
voice.
He went out to the hall,   retrieved  his sports jacket,   then
came  into the kitchen  again  to
leave by the back door.
&quot;Toodles,&quot; I fluttered my fingers at him.

********

Friday  was my turn to cook.  After work I picked up supplies
at Supermercado Singapore.
I toted them  home  down our alley.   In the sunlit  evening  I could
hear  the dissonant  clank of
metal.  As I rounded the corner into our back yard, I saw Nebble drop
a monkey wrench on his
lawn.
I ventured  a &quot;Hello&quot; and a half-smile. Nebble looked up,
unsmiling, said nothing, and turned
away,  descending  into  his cellar like a troll.  Same shit-head, I
thought.
I crossed our driveway and peered at his lawn.  A circle of
heavy  metal  hand  tools lay on
the grass around  the  citronella,  radiating away from the lofty
candle.   What on earth  is  that,
I wondered.  As far as I knew, Nebble was devoid of any sense of art
or design.
Faced with the inexplicable and unfriendly,  I headed  into the
house,  issues of  chicken jal-
frezi crowding out bewilderment.
After supper David offered to wash the dishes.
&quot;Go  out  and  play,&quot; I commanded.  &quot;It's a beautiful  summer
evening.  I just have to stow
the basmati.&quot;
David skipped out the back door.  He's off to George Wedmore's
garden  down  the alley,
I guessed.  Uncle George,  as we called  him,  was a retired  linen
goods salesman,  a fanatical
horticulturalist, and a mad opera queen.  He grew  obscenely  large
peonies, lilacs that towered
like Douglas firs, and sunflowers  the size of bird baths:   they
groaned  over his high brick wall,
threatening to brain passers-by.  The centerpiece of his inner garden
was  a  pentagon  of mini-
ature cypresses, ruthlessly pruned to  form  leafy corkscrews.   No
one dared ask George as to
their

Grrrr!  The Google Groups editor munged the lines.  I'd manually
reformatted
the entire story as a text file; it was composed as an MS Word
document.

Does anyone know how to get around the editor's short lines?

BTW, the long lines of asterisks are page breaks.

Cheers,

Darling, with prose of such superb quality, why worry about the format?

I didn't even get past  a glance at the tinyness of the scrollbar.
