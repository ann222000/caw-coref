Not to mention his theory that Intercontinental *Ballistic* Missiles

&gt;insubordination above and beyond the usual for a net-kook.  In particular,

I've been wondering about that.  Neither Sean nor I crowned anyone with a
Tinfoil Sombrero since Poseur von Zwei Scheisse got one a year ago, then
five people (Porchie, nightbat, Colonel Jake, Mop Jockey, and now
Nukleus/Bloxy) got crowned in the space of a very short month.  Other than
Porchie, who had a running start on kookdom, all these kooks had been
working on their shiny headwear for months.  Mop Jockey started on his last
October or November, when he started making noises about running his own
awards.  Nightbat has been defying AUK for a long time; he just finally
crossed the threshold with his attepted nullification of nominations.
Colonel Jake has had a mirror of the netcabal site on his kooksite for
months and then made the mistake of claiming it as an official AUK site.
Bloxy has been insubordinant to the Big-8 Board since its founding and had
been kooking out over the old system before that, so he had lots of
practice by the time he turned his attention to AUK.  I'd say it was a
bunch of kooks who finally reached critical mass, combined with a pair of
FNVWs who finally lost patience with them.  Invocation of the sunspot cycle
isn't necessary and isn't even testable, as the last sunspot minimum was
about 11 years ago and there just isn't enough data.  However, I will
entertain the possibility of cabin fever as winter wears on.

"Pot...kettle...so black it picks cotton." -- But Alex "Dink" Cain isn't
racist at all, oh no. Not him. Why, some of his best friends are porch
monkeys. I'll bet. Message-ID: &lt;397FCBBB.1 ... @hotmail.com&gt;

"You think I don't know this? What gives you the right to speak as if
you have authority over me? You have none. I like his use of the words
'wanton woman'. They are biblical. Maybe there is some hope for k man
after all. You? There is no hope for you at all you freak of nature. Go
back to the hole you came out of." -- Atlanta Olympiada Kane "knows"
Kadaitcha Man was referring to me, but addressed him as though he was

"What are marijuana tablets?"

"When logic and proportion

"The nonsense screeds you compose and post to usenet lack any kind of
coherent and rational meaning whatsoever, and are composed of random
bits and pieces stolen from mythology, science fiction, religion, comic
books, etc., placed into a blender, and the switch turned to the highest
setting.
About every other screed has droppings of death threats, racial
bigotry, laughably false prophesies of gloom and doom, and inane
attempts to extort money. These bland, meaningless, pulpy messes are
then trowled into usenet; identical or nearly identical screeds are
repeated ad nauseum." -- Art Deco had to clean up bits of Warhol for
days after using the Hammer on him

"Q: How many Bush administration officials does it take to change a
light bulb?
A: None. There is no need to change anything. We made the right decision
to stick with that light bulb. People who say that it is burned out are
giving aid and encouragement to the Forces of Darkness." -- Anon.

"Outlaw amateur assassins!" -- Chiun

"Property is theft."

"Property is liberty."

"Property is impossible."

"Etymology:
Argumentum ad Septicus : argument to putrefaction. Derived from Septicum
Argumentum : putrefaction of argument.

"Septic \Sep"tic\, Septical \Sep"tic*al\
a. [L. septicus to make putrid: cf. F. septique.]
Having power to promote putrefaction. Of or relating to or
caused by putrefaction." -- Kadaitcha Man, indirectly to
Donald "Skeptic"/"Septic" Alford, in MID: &lt;a3svh.djj.1 ... @news.alt.net&gt;

"I never fail to be amazing" -- Looney Maroon for September 2006 nominee
William Barwell's ego knows no bounds. MID:

"Red meat won't hurt you. Fuzzy, blue-green meat will."

as needed)

"may you live to whatever age you'd like to." -- Dave Hillstrom,
in alt.discordia

"We are most nearly ourselves when we achieve the seriousness of the
child at play." -- Heraclitus

"And thats another mistake on your part. Your 'playing' games on usenet,
and I'm not playing...It has nothing to do with impressing you, it has
more to do with making sure you have the education you'll need to debate.
The debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it. I'm
giving you an opportunity to educate yourself. That's all." -- A trashy
former virus-writer turned Outer Filth doesn't know if he's playing or
working, in MID: &lt;1159389579.179851.33 ... @e3g2000cwe.googlegroups.com&gt;

"I am incapable of original thoughts" -- Ctrl¤/Alt¤/Del¤ has an honest
moment, in MID: &lt;0h59i25ejlthqeeitdp0hlk4kvo1ejp ... @4ax.com&gt;

"But now the end is near. Now Mark Foley comes along and is making
almost all liberal dreams come true and seriously, I'm sorry for it.
See, I believe in karma. I believe what comes around goes around and I
know full well that it's just bad juju to wish such a level of turmoil
and ill upon other humans, warmongering gay-hating maladroits or no, and
that the real path of enlightenment is paved with forgiveness and
progress and white-hot love and turning the other cheek and scotch.

"In fact, Jesus said something about that, I do believe. He said, "Knock
it off already with the warmongering and the hating of each other and
let's all get some wine and party like it's 2012." Then again, he never
saw Karl Rove stab the nation with the dull ice pick of bogus fear. He
never heard George W. Bush describe brutal war and the death of tens of
thousands as "just a comma" in world history.

"Check that. Maybe I'm not so sorry after all." -- Mark Morford,
