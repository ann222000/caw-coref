OK, that should be enough.

Rowling was doing so *well* until the very ending.  I was really
engaged, had to force myself to put the book down so I could get a
couple hourse of sleep before going to work.  Then came the ending, and
it just didn't make any sense.

The deathly hallows themselves seem to be nothing but misdirection.
Harry was carrying one of them on his way to meet Voldemort--the
invisibility cloak--but wasn't wearing it.  He acquired another on the
way, then dropped it before the meeting.  The whole bit with the Elder
Wand (see below) was confused and bogus.  Apparently the hallows had
nothing to do with him surviving Voldemort's Avada Kedavra.

The bit in &quot;King's Cross&quot; seemed a deus ex machina, unworthy of the
series as it has been written so far.  But I guess that's just my
opinion.

Harry had put his mother's type of protection on *everybody*?  Lame.

But worst of all was the business of the wands.  Harry says that Draco
was the true master of the Elder wand--huh?  Why?  But then he says that
because he took Draco's wand--that would be Draco's original wand, the
one he used throughout Hogwarts, right?--that makes him the true master
of the Elder Wand?  Whaa?  An Avada Kedavra bounces off of a
Expelliarmus?  Since when?  This is the spell that cannot be blocked,
right?

THEN, when V is dead, we hear *nothing* more about the many Death Eaters
scattered about who will be fighting for their lives.  And consider
this:  The ministry was run by pureblood biggots.  Only some of them
were Death Eaters; the ministry had been able to implement sweeping
anti-mudblood measures only because there were so many like-thinking
wizards either already in the bureaucracy (like Umbridge) or who could
be easily recruited.  That machinery was running quite well without
Voldemort, as Voldemort ran around hunting wands.  The biggoted
Ministry, with its considerable resources and mantle of legitimacy,
still remains after the battle.  Those who collaborated have a vested
interest in at least pretending that they still believe in those
principals.

Draco was the true master of the Elder Wand because he was the one who took

Elder Wand works correctly for its true master, which is whoever defeats the

So Harry puts the Elder wand back into Dumbledores grave.  Yet Harry IS
the master, because even if it's in Dumbledores possession, it still
belongs to Harry. So all someone needs to do is defeat Harry, and then go
get the wand and the Deathly Hallows continue?
They get the cloak. They start a woods search for the stone, and it all
starts all over again. I would not consider lost in the woods permanently
lost. Looks how indian artifacts turn up constantly. If someone KNEW the
stone was out there, it's worth making a lifelong quest of a lot of
people sifting the woods to find it.

It served several purposes.  The most important is that it gave
Harry Potter a choice.  Wouldn't the book have been boring if
it merely chronicled his robotic obedience to Dumbledore's
orders to track down the Horcruxes?  This gave Harry meaningful
decisions to make.

In addition, the Horcruxes gave Voldemort something to
obsess over while Harry was on his quest.  Otherwise, it
would have just been Voldemort and his forces chasing
down Harry for the whole book--again, not so interesting.

Third, it gave Dumbledore a fatal flaw.  It was Dumbledore's
obsession with the Hallows that caused his downfall.

All in all, I'd say it was a pretty neat job of Rowling to get
so much mileage out of the Deathly Hallows.

You're forgetting the final twist, which was that it was all
in Harry's head.  That wasn't actually Dumbledore, it was
Harry's subconscious figuring out what he could based
on what he knew at the time (and getting some of it
wrong).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Since always, when the two wizards involved are
Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.  There were actually
a number of things which would cause Voldemort's
killing spell to fail.  It was like Voldemort was caught
in a triple-checkmate.  Voldemort by this point was
well and thoroughly beaten--and he knew it, even
if he didn't know exactly all the reasons why.

IIRC, people have said that of every Harry Potter book so far, except HBP.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Indeed.  So when Harry made his decision to chase down the horcruxes rather
than pursuing the hallows, he was correct.  Whoever it was who said they
were &quot;just powerful artifacts that a myth had been written around&quot; was also
correct.

Hmm, did seem a bit tacked on with the whole &quot;gleam of triumph&quot; thing
introduced in book 4 when the books were suddenly much more popular.

I disagree.  It is not used as a major plot point (Harry defeats V
nonetheless), but if she hadn't included it, logic-choppers on these boards
would be wondering why his sacrifice didn't create such a protection.

It makes enough sense to be going along with.  If you really wanted to

On the contrary.  Often, when an unpleasant regime falls, everyone falls

Not quite.  Dumbledore says &quot;Of course it's going on in your head, but that

WRONG.  We find out in the first book that it CAN be blocked under
certain extraordinary circumstances.  The ministry just doesn't know
what they are.  And it looks like you can't AK a person very
effectively when the wand you are using has given it's allegience to
your intended victim (think how rare that would be - it's certainly
possible to use a person's own wand on them - just defeat them first.

???  The last legitmate Minister of Magic was assassinated.  The
current one was under the imperius curse during the entirety of his
leadership.  A huge number of high-ranking members were on the side of
the DEs, and now that Voldmort's fallen from power, they'll be on the
run.  Kingsley, as the temporary Minister is unlikely to let the
status quo remain -he had been on the run, just as many others were.
Remember his statements on Potterwatch?  He thought muggles were human
beings just like wizards.

And we know that there were half-bloods in the ministry, and AT LEAST
muggle-borns that were married to ministry workers (even if they were
lower down).

I disagree. I think the pendulum will have swung WAY in the opposite

supporters of V - he cost them too much.

&gt; &gt; You're forgetting the final twist, which was that it was all
&gt; &gt; in Harry's head.  That wasn't actually Dumbledore, it was
&gt; &gt; Harry's subconscious figuring out what he could based
&gt; &gt; on what he knew at the time (and getting some of it
&gt; &gt; wrong).
&gt; Not quite.  Dumbledore says &quot;Of course it's going on in your head, but that
&gt; doesn't mean it's not real&quot;.  Which connects with some interesting bits of
&gt; philosophy...  but for a simplistic view, think of it as a vision.
">

That's Rowling providing just enough of a caveat to give the
reader fair warning that MAYBE that wasn't really Dumbledore.
She has to walk a fine line--if she doesn't include a caveat,
then the readers will feel cheated and lied to when Harry reveals
Dumbledore's true plan (that the Elder Wand have no master).
But if she makes the caveat too obvious, then readers may
guess the final reveal too soon.

Basically, it's a setup to make Harry's final reveal more dramatic.

Keep in mind that according to Ollivander, the wand &quot;chooses&quot; its master.
Granted, disarming or killing the previous owner seems to be a manner in
which to become the master of a wand, but ultimately, that decision is up
to the wand.

Why?  Everything was in chaos. He was a respected Auror.  There were
certainly plenty in the ministry who did NOT like the leadership under
Voldemort, but kept their head down to stay alive (Percy as an
example).  And we know that many, many people hated Umbridge.

Look at the restoration of France after WWII - how anyone who had
&quot;collaborated&quot; was universally hated, and removed from power.

After the first Voldemort war, there was a huge push to weed out dark
wizards - remember the Crouch situation.   I think it's likely there
would something similar.

I do.  And I suspect most of the folks in positions of power like that
were Death Eaters, not merely bandwagoneers.  And all those who kept
their mouths shut to stay alive, probably didn't have to worry about
that anymore and could feel free to speak out.

Yes, you are right that bigotry existed before V, but I'm not sure
that matters.  Open bigotry was the norm against Jews before WWII, and
that includes in the US, and pretty much all of Europe.  Hitler
capitalized on that, used it skillfully, etc.  Once he was defeated,
most of the folks who were so bigoted DID leave power, or at least
quit mentioning it.

And, is the ministry ready to withstand a civil war, once Voldy's
gone? Fear of him was a big part of his power.

Hitler died after Nazi Germany was thoroughly beaten, wheras the Ministry

No, and I apologize if you thought that's what I thought you meant.  I was
just pointing out that we need a better parallel.  The key differences
are:

1) The wizard-in-the-street had no actual loyalty to Voldemort, and even
many of the wizards in the ministry working for pureblood supremacy
weren't all that crazy about him.  He was not an important rallying
point for the current regime, though others have pointed out that
*fear* of him might have been important for keeping people in line.
This is a far cry from &quot;The Fuhrer is my ideology!&quot;

2) The machinery of bureaucracy, law enforcement, domestic surveilance,
control over transportation, etc. was quite intact and still firmly
in the hands of those who hated the muggle-born at the time Voldemort
died.

No...the Imperius Curses cast by the DEs dissolved when Voldemort died.
Recall for example that Yaxley said it was quite hard to Imperius
Thicknesse...I expect that even those distrustful of muggle-borns would
have a new reason to hold grudges against DE sympathizers once they had
regained control of their minds.

Just about any cause identified with the DEs suffered a major blow.

(Look at what has happened to eugenics in the wake of the Nazis...
its knee-jerk opponents denounce even genetic counseling of those
who might pass on birth defects to offspring as part of a slippery
slope leading to extermination camps).

The World Trade Center towers MUST rise again,
at least as tall as before...or terror has triumphed.

It saddens me to have to report that the Germans have learned their
lesson well.

Our top stem cell researchers are forced to leave the country due to
riddikulus legal restrictions.

Many woman carrying obviously defective fetuses still choose to go to
the Netherlands to terminate their pregnancies rather than subject
themselves to the demeaning process of obtaining ~legal~ permission for
the procedure.
