120 Aphorisms for Astrologers

By

Abraham ibn Ezra
(12th century)

1  Because the Moon is near the Earth and accelerated in its course,
it increases the conjunction of planets by communicating its force to
them without ever receiving any force from them; it transfers
brilliancy from one to the other; it corresponds to the new-born in
that its beams develop gradually until they are full, and afterwards
it declines gradually until it is no longer visible and disappears
from the world. That is why the ancients said that it influences every
deliberation and the beginning of any task. If it is in its ascendancy
and its circumstances are favourable, anything which one may start at
that moment will meet with success, and contrariwise if it is in the
unfavourable circumstances. They added that, for the asker, you should
observe the ascending sign with its rulers, and for the request, the
7th sign with its rulers, and always put the Moon in contact with it.

2  If the Moon is moving by itself, [void of course] that indicates
any futile thing, and it signifies that any thing which the asker
requests cannot possibly occur.

3  The planet which enters into conjunction or into aspect with the
Moon prognosticates every future thing and anything which the asker
will expect; if the planet is favourable, it will be a boon; if the
planet is unfavourable, it will bring harm.

4  The separation from the Moon denotes things which have passed; if
it separated in conjunction or in aspect with a helpful planet, it was
beneficial, and with a harmful planet, it was sinister [harmful].

5  If the asterism which receives its force from the Moon is in its
ascendancy, then the thing will be done properly; just the opposite if
it should be weak.

6  Likewise, in the case of any constellation which communicates force
to another one, the event will take place according to the power of
the recipient.

7  On the day when the Moon is with the baleful planets, nothing which
one may ask will be completed properly if there is a planet in the
ascending sign; if the Moon should be in one of the poles of the
meridian, then it is worse, because it forecasts fear in mind and
sickness in body; if it should be in the falling [cadent] houses, it
indicates fear but not sickness.

8  The planets move in two faces, one helpful, the other harmful;
wherever you find the planet to be favourable, predict good; for the
opposite position, predict the opposite.

9  The favourable direct planets are useful whether they receive or
not. If they receive, so much the better. The unfavourable planets are
destructive by their very nature, but if a planet should be received
by it, its malignant influence will be attenuated. The same holds true
whether the visual angle formed with it is a sextile or a trine aspect

10  A planet should not be considered harmful until the rays of the
harmful planet dominate it in proportion to the force of its body; if
it is less than that, then it will forecast only slight harm; after it
departs in aspect one degree from the new-born, and relatively more if
it goes further away, it will provoke fear which will not have any
practical consequence. That is [also] the procedure of the favourable
planet. If the planet, which prognosticates all that which is to
happen, does not form a visual angle with the ascending sign, the hope
of the petitioner will not materialize.

11  If the beneficial planets are in aspect with the baleful planets,
the influence of the latter will be less harmful.

12  The favourable always prognosticate a boon, and the unfavourable
prognosticate harm. Nevertheless if the unfavourable one should be in
its exaltation, the effect will be good, although it will involve pain
and sorrow.

13  If the helpful planets should be in a position opposite to their
character, in the house of their dishonour [detriment], in the house
of their hatred [fall], or in the falling [cadent] houses, and if no
aspect lies between them and the ascending sign, then it will exert
absolutely no influence.

14  Likewise if the unfavourable are in that position, their harm will
be slight.

15  If the favourable asterism is in its ascendancy and if it alone
exerts an influence over the new-born, then its good influence will
increase.

16  If Jupiter is in aspect with the favourable planet, it will make
its nature favourable. Venus cannot modify the nature of Saturn except
with the aid of Jupiter. Jupiter nullifies the harm of Saturn, but
Venus nullifies the harm of Mars even more than does Jupiter.

17  If both the favourable and unfavourable planets are in a bad
position, or if they scintillate, they prognosticate something vile;
yet they cannot cause good or harm because of their weakness.

18  If a baleful planet should be east of the Sun, in a sign wherein
it exerts an influence, and if no other unfavourable planet is in
aspect with it, then it is better than the favourable one which
scintillates or is retrograde.

19  If the baleful are in control of the thing requested, and if the
ruler of the ascending sign joins in conjunction with them, and if the
Moon is in square aspect or in opposition, then, should the request be
granted, its end will be detrimental.

20  If the baleful is in an ascending sign and has within it any
power, its influence will be less harmful; if it is retrograde, it
will heap evil on evil.

21  If the baleful is in square aspect or in opposition, it will lose
its favourable influence.

22  If the baleful should be in the position of its power and in one
of the poles or one of the supports, its force is to be considered
equivalent to the force of the favourable planets.

23  If the baleful is estranged in its position, then its influence
will become more harmful.

24  If the baleful is in one of the poles, or if it harms the star of
the square aspect or opposition then its evil influence will be
complete; all the more so of it is more powerful than the star. If,
however, it is in a trine or sextile aspect, the evil influence will
be attenuated.

25  If the baleful should be in control of the thing requested, it
indicates delay in the matter, and it means that it will not
materialize but by grief and worry.

26  If the baleful should communicate its force to another ominous
one, then it will heap evil upon evil; if a favourable one gives its
force to another favourable one, then it will result in more luck: if
a baleful gives its force to a favourable, then the fate will change
from evil to good; the opposite will have an opposite effect.

27  If any beneficial or injurious constellation is in its house or in
the house of its honour, it will always result in a boon.

28  Any planet at the beginning of a sign is considered weak until it
is 5° away. Likewise, if the planet should be less than 5° away from
one of the houses, it will be considered to be in the force of the
house; if it is further away, then it falls beyond the force of the
house.

29  Any asterism between the beginning of the house and 15° possesses
great power.

30  If the planet is with one of the poles of the baleful and it
departs from its aspect by 1°, it will cause fear but it will not have
any practical result.

31  If the constellation is in the house of its dishonour, it
prognosticates grief, anguish, and distress.

32  The planet which retrogrades denotes rebellion and the destruction
of any project.

33  The planet, which is in its first station, is like a man who does
not know what he will do, and its result is bad: if it is in its
second station, it is like a man who expects something and whose hope
will not be in vain.

34  If a star should be delayed in its course, it will delay the thing
either fortunately or unfortunately; if Jupiter or Saturn should be in
the variable [cardinal] signs, they will hasten the thing.

35  If the planet is at the end of the sign, its force will be lost
for the first sign, and all its force will pass to the sign into which
it is to enter. If the planet is in the 29th degree of the sign, its
force stays in the sign where it is, because the planet exerts force
in 3 degrees: in the degree in which it is, in the preceding degree,
and in the subsequent degree.

36  If a star is about to enter into conjunction with a second star
but, before the conjunction is consummated, the second star leaves for
a different sign, and the first star pursues it and overtakes it, and
if, before overtaking it, no other star unites with it, then the thing
requested will be accomplished after the despair.

37  If a star is in aspect with another star, which then moves from
its position before the lighter star reaches it, no harm will result,
because the aspect does not interfere with the conjunction of
celestial bodies.

38  If an asterism is in a sign which corresponds to its nature, its
power will increase; if it is in a sign contrary to its nature, its
power will weaken as, for example, Saturn in a house that is cold and
dry.

39  If the planet, which is received, is favourable, then its force
increases: if it is detrimental, then its harm is lessened.

40  If the planet is not in one of the places of its influence but is
in the 6th or 12th house, it will not result in a boon.

41  If a planet is beneath the brilliancy and is one of the superior,
it will exert no influence: the same is true of the inferior. If they
retrograde, their influence is worse than any.

42  If the star, which serves for the prognostic, is retrograde, but
later its motion follows the order of the signs, that indicates that
the thing will be fulfilled partly. Likewise if it is beneath the rays
of the Sun and then departs from there.

43  If a constellation, assuming that it is favourable, is in one of
the censers, it will lose its good influence; if it is unfavourable,
its influence will become worse.

44  If the favourable planet is in the 8th house, it indicates neither
good nor bad; if one of the unfavourable is there, that prognosticates
complete harm.

45  If the planet is about to reverse its motion, it forecasts
unsuccessful consultation, difficulty, and destruction: if its motion
becomes direct, it will better the luck in the matter, its strength,
and its uprightness.

46  If the power of the planet should be 12 ° in an auspicious
position, that will exert a better influence.

47  If the planet is in a fixed sign, it forecasts anything which will
be constant and firm; if it is in a variable sign, the thing will
vary; if it is in a sign with a double body, it augurs that one part
of the thing will remain constant or that the thing will be modified
twice.

48  If the receiving star is in an unfavourable position, it portends
evil.

49  If the ruler of the ascending sign is in the house of its hatred,
it cannot control completely the thing requested.

50  If the planet enters into conjunction with the favourable or
unfavourable, the nature of the stronger of them is to be considered.

51  If the ruler of the ascending sign communicates force to the ruler
of the consulted house, the thing will be desired very strongly; but
if the ruler of the thing sought communicates force to the ruler of
the ascending sign, then the thing will materialize without any
difficulty.

52  If there is an obstructing planet between them, it prognosticates
an individual who will put an obstacle between it and the thing
sought.

53  If the master of the ascending sign separates from the master of
the thing sought, his desire will disappear.

54  If no planet is in aspect with the Moon, that indicates indolence.

55  If many stars are in aspect with the Moon,, those which assist in
fulfilling the object will be numerous.

56  If an asterism transfers from the ruler of the ascending sign to
the ruler of the thing requested, then the thing will be accomplished
through an intermediary.

57  If the ruler of the ascendant is in the house of its triplicity,
and if the rulers of the signs of the triplicity are in aspect with
it, those near to it will help it.

58  If the planet moves in the path, to which we referred for the
return of brilliancy, the thing will take place after despair.

59  If the prognosticator is in a position to communicate force, that
means that the thing will be accomplished exactly as he wishes.

60  If the prognosticator is about to communicate influence, that
augurs that the thing will reveal another.

61  If the testimony of the prognosticator is in the act of
communicating the nature, that denotes great joy in the affair.

62  If the testimony of the prognostication is in the act of
communicating two natures, that points to the joy of the petitioner
and of the one consulted.

63  If the testimony of the prognosticator is in a direct manner, that
indicates a good outcome in anything desired.

64  If the testimony of the prognosticator is in an oblique manner, it
means that he will abandon the project.

65  If the testimony of the prognosticator is in the position of
prohibition, it augurs that the affair will be destroyed after having
been expected.

66  If the testimony of the prognosticator is in the manner of the
return of light to evil, it shows that the asker will repent his
request.

67  If the testimony of the prognosticator corresponds to
interference, it portends that events will arise which will destroy
the thing.

68  If the testimony of the prognosticator is in the phenomenon of the
accident, something will happen to it which will put an end to the
consultation.

69  If the testimony of the prognosticator coincides with ruin, the
petitioner will seek other counsel.

70  If the testimony of the prognosticator is analogous to the
culmination of brilliancy, it points to an individual who will destroy
his own consultation.

71  If the testimony of the prognosticator refers to pleasantness, it
marks a man to whom it has done some good.

72  If the testimony of the prognosticator falls in the phenomenon of
recompense, it forecasts that it will do good to others also.

73  The testimony of the mutual reception of the prognosticators
predicts things which are preparing something that has not yet come to
mind.

74  If the testimony of the prognosticator corresponds to liberality,
it augurs that the solicitor and the adviser will love one another.

75  If the testimony of the prognosticator is taken at the time of
similarity, it marks every good which is in the process of formation.

76  If the testimony of the prognosticator occurs in the evil
mediation, it refers to the prisoners and the unfortunate, but if it
occurs in a good one, it refers to the maximum benefit.

77  If the testimony of the prognosticator coincides with the dignity,
it is an omen of every high rank.

78  The seven planets in their respective positions in the ecliptic
offer prognostics. If a star is in its house, it is an example of a
man in his home.

79  The star in the house of its honour is like a man in the pinnacle
of his rank.

80  The star at its limit [terms] is like a man in his seat.

81  The star in the house of its triplicity is like a man with his
relatives.

82  The star in its face corresponds to a man with his ornaments and
clothing.

83  The star in its aphelion is similar to a man astride his horse.

84  The star in its form is like a man in a situation suitable to
himself.

85  The star, which is in the reverse of its form, is like a man in a
situation unsuitable to himself.

with himself.

87  The star in a position over which it does not predominate
corresponds to a man who is not in his country.

88  The star in the house of its perihelion is similar to a man who
falls from his greatness.

89  The Star which moves beneath the rays of the Sun is like a man in
prison.

90  The star which scintillates is analogous to a man who is on the
verge of death.

91  The star, which is about to assume a retrograde motion, is like a
man bewildered and trembling at the misfortunes which will befall him.

92  The star which retrogrades is like a twitching and rebellious
person.

93  The star in its second station is like a man who expects good
luck.

94  The star, which is delayed in its course, corresponds to a man
exhausted and lacking strength to go on.

95  The star accelerated in its course is like a young man running.

96  The eastern star is kindred to a person happy to fulfill his
desire.

97  The western star is like an indolent man.

98  The star in conjunction with the Sun is like a person who sits
with the king on his throne.

99  The star in aspect is similar to an individual who seeks what he
desires.

100  The departing star is like a man who is repentant about the
thing.

101  The star at a pole of the meridian resembles a man who stays at
his post.

102  The star at a support is like a man who is hopeful.

103  The star in a falling house is like a man who changes his
position.

104  The stars in conjunction correspond to two companions.

105  The stars in a sextile aspect are like two individuals who seek
each other's love.

106  The stars in a trine aspect resemble two persons of similar
temperament.

107  The stars in a square aspect are similar to two people each one
of whom seeks control for himself.

108  The stars in opposition are kindred to two men fighting each
other fiercely.

109  The star in the ascending sign is like the new-born child that
comes out of the womb of its mother or like a thing which occurs at
the right time.

110  The star in the 2nd house is the same as the person who is in the
house of his assistants.

111  The star in the 3rd house harmonizes with the man who visits his
brothers.

112  The star in the 4th house corresponds to a man in the house of
his forbears or in his land.

113  The star in the 5th house is in affinity with a person in his
business and in his pleasure.

114  The star in the 6th house is equivalent to a weak man running
away.

115  The star in the 7th house is the same as a man prepared for
battle.

116  The star in the 8th house is related to a person beset with fear
and terror.
