I'm so sorry.  I didn't mean to offend anyone living in the UK.  Stormee
just happened to hit one of my &quot;hot buttons&quot; and I tend to have a knee-jerk
reaction to that (I really hate it when someone implies that the US is a
bunch of ignorant savages - I guess my age is telling, I still have a lot of
old-time patriotism and that's gone out of style now).

If you live in the UK, I hope you'll accept my abject apologies for any
aspersions I made to your country.  The odd thing is that I *am* an
anglophile!  I love everything about the UK (*especially* the &quot;pretty
accent&quot; ;&gt;).

You are all dear friends to me and I would be devastated to know that I've
hurt your feelings in my lashing out blindly.  I do hope you'll forgive me
my temper tantrum.

I missed what you said, Lori, but we all have days when our buttons are more
easily pushed.  I'm having to really try to hold back some knee-jerk
reactions lately (not so much on rpca).  I went off on a friend last night
because she pushed the wrong button at the wrong time.  I have to call to
apologize but right now I'm just embarrassed.  She didn't deserve it and I'm
sure she has no idea what set me off. (sigh)

You're under a lot of stress, worrying about Archer and who knows what else
in your life.  I'm under a lot of stress worrying about my brother (who
seems to be doing just fine, but still) and other things.  I'm sure everyone
here will understand, whatever it was.  Keep your chin up!

Thanks, Jill.  Isn't it sad how we always lash out at the people closest to
us just *because* they're close and &quot;handy&quot;?  I am always embarrassed and
ashamed when I do so, but often that's after the harm is already done.  I
can only hope that those I hurt are better people than me and can find it in
their hearts to forgive.

discussion with blind patriotism, that for someone who seems to be as
intelligent as you up to this point seemed to be to me is just plain sad, we
cannot maintain a country and improve it if we do not critically and

It's sad but yes, they are close and handy.  Who else are you going to lash
out at (or reach out to) some stranger on the street?  Someone at the
grocery store?  Someone at the bank?  Your boss?

Shit happens.  We have moods, stresses, buttons that can be pushed.

I would be sorry to see that you weren't able to accept an apology,
especially from someone as warm hearted and well meaning as Lori.  It really
isn't the place here to discuss those things you mentioned, although they do
come up from time to time, inevitably.  It's just really not the place to
judge people in that way, especially since here we know a lot about the
troubles and pressures that many of us have to live with day-to-day.

Yep, and pretty much all you can do is apologize and offer to fogive in
return when needed.  My best friend and I have a &quot;safe code&quot; for when we're
fighting - if either of us just really needs the other we'll call and say
&quot;peace at any price&quot;.  At that time we both immediately put aside whatever
it is we're arguing about and just &quot;be there&quot; for the other.

Lee, I don't want to see you leave the group - that was not my aim in
&quot;defending&quot; my country.  I'm sorry if things got heated and you felt
insulted, but you should realize that I also felt insulted by several of the
comments you made about/to me.

For the sake of peace in this group, I am willing to put aside hard feelings
and just ignore all previous posts.  I hope you feel the same.

she never apologized to me just the UK posters, and animal cruelty is a
pretty part of cats to me, thanks for your concern for Lori, it is
heartwarming to see that you care for people on this group.  life stresses
and the support is why I started reading and posting to this group... life
stress... this is way off topic but just so you understand that I get life
stress:

1. last august both of my father's sister's died exactly one week apart.
2. two weeks after that a cousins six year old granddaughter died of a brain
tumor.
3. my brother's cancer has returned.
4. my mom's sister is currently undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic
cancer and its not working.
5. my sister's school financing has gotten screwed up so she can't continue
college,
-6. my nephew is currently expecting his first child and something seems
just not right.
7.  and most recently this morning DH informed me that the furnace quit last
night and if its not the $20.00 part that he thinks it is we have to buy a
whole new furnace...

I am not wining here but the truth is I loved this group for its concern and
support, and I also loved it because it dealt honestly and thoroughly with
issues like animal cruelty, it breaks my heart that I seem to be mistaken,
or that I have gotten sensitive enough that I can no longer enjoy that,

Again, I never saw whatever post you replied to in which she got upset and
you were subsequently offended.  But it certainly wasn't Lori's fault that
you had all those incidents occur in your life one right after another.
That's more than enough stress for one person.  But we all have stress
triggers.

I don't know if you went off about Americans.  I didn't see the post.  I do
know I'd be upset, too, if you had.

Your leaving rpca isn't the answer.  Taking a break, maybe; whatever works
for you.  We all have problems.  We're all members of this thing called the
human race.  We also all love cats.  Do whatever you need to do.  But don't
(and again I didn't see the post) come down on a nation for one thing or
another.  On his ng are all doing the best we can.

&gt;&gt; &gt; factual

&gt;&gt; Lee, I don't want to see you leave the group - that was not my aim in
&gt;&gt; &quot;defending&quot; my country.  I'm sorry if things got heated and you felt
&gt;&gt; insulted, but you should realize that I also felt insulted by several of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; comments you made about/to me.

&gt;&gt; For the sake of peace in this group, I am willing to put aside hard

&gt;&gt; and just ignore all previous posts.  I hope you feel the same.

&gt; I would be sorry to see that you weren't able to accept an apology,
&gt; especially from someone as warm hearted and well meaning as Lori.  It really
&gt; isn't the place here to discuss those things you mentioned, although they do
&gt; come up from time to time, inevitably.  It's just really not the place to
&gt; judge people in that way, especially since here we know a lot about the
&gt; troubles and pressures that many of us have to live with day-to-day.

And in any case, there's no reason for *you* (Lee) to leave just because
someone else's views seem narrow or not very well thought out. Just block
them. And if a thread that you don't like goes on and on, you can block
that, too.

I'd hate to see you go just because of someone else's ignorance - or
perceived ignorance. (I haven't read the thread in question, so I can't
comment on the specifics. But I certainly agree with your idea that as
a country, we should always be willing to view ourselves with honest
criticism as well as with pride.)

I apologize for having made you &quot;narked&quot;(?)

It means annoyed here, colloquially (is that a word?)  I know what I mean.

We should never bring up historical issues that we are all ashamed about to
make a point here, Lori.

When I first got to know my German friend Nuele we decided to get the war
out of the way fairly quickly so we discussed it ad infin.  She felt ashamed
of it although she was not born then.

Just think before you post.  Occasionally I put a post  in my drafts folder
to prevent me from firing off.
Mostly I just do :-)

Obviously, it's not anyone's fault what their ancestors did before they
were born. But we can still take responsbility for it if we are direct
decendents, or if we have benefitted from past atrocities. I don't think
that taking responsibility means saying you are at fault, or that you should
be punished, shunned, blamed, etc. But you can still work to make amends
and to correct ongoing problems that exist because of past actions.

Often brutality can cause damage down the generations, and people whose
ancestors were brutalized, enslaved, conquered and repressed, etc, may
still be suffering aftereffects. So I feel it's possible to recognize
that they might still be at some disadvantage because of the inherited
damage. Those who inherited *benefits* are in a position to make some
reparations, or at the very least, to give recognition to the people who
are still struggling with the legacy.

I'm sure the decendants of WWII victims will be dealing with aftereffects
for generations to come. Nuele doesn't need to feel personally ashamed,
but that doesn't mean she's helpless to have a positive effect, either.

Lori, I hope that my occasional posts regarding US policy don't come
across as nothing but US bashing. I do love my country, and I take a great
deal of pride in some of the things we've accomplished. On the other hand,
I'm also deeply ashamed of some of the things we've done and I'm not shy
about expressing that.

Overall I think the US is a great place to live. It would be much better
if we could get our current crop of government officials out of office and
into jobs they're better qualified to do (like maybe digging ditches). And
I do believe that some day soon we'll actually develop a foreign policy
that's something more than a &quot;let's give the whole world something to hate
us for&quot; plan.

I too hope that some day we can fix the problems facing us. All of us,
worldwide. It's because of that hope that I support zero population
growth, energy conservation, ecologically sound food production, and other
issues. I am deathly afraid that it's too late to do any good, but I sure
keep my fingers crossed that we can keep the world inhabitable for a few
more generations.

Hmmm... let's see, half of my ancestors came from Europe and enslaved
and killed the other half of my ancestors. That means I'm both the
victim and the perpetrator, in a way. Do I apologize to myself? ;-)

I get the same knee-jerk reaction, too, Lori. I love my country; warts
and all;
and I do get offended sometimes. Especially by armchair animal
activists.
. Fine, if you don't like something -- but what are you DOING about
it? Are you
at least writing your congressman for stricter abuse laws? Do you jump
in when there *is* animal abuse in your town, do you speak with the
DA,
lobby for stricter sentencing? If there's a dogfighting ring,
cockfighting,
whatever -- are you at the sheriff's department *asking* why it's not
busted?
At the end of the day, opinions aren't worth squat. Everybody's got
one.

This post basically came outta nowhere, it's just a weird mood that
I'm
in ATM. Not pointing fingers at anyone. I just get tired of (IRL
too)...
all the doom &amp; gloom, whining, bitching about the poor animals, our
abuse laws aren't strict enough, yada yada. Then nobody even has
the guts to write a letter to the editor and sign their own name.
Bleh.
I get at least one phone call a week because I'm on the board of
directors,
and somebody's got some kind of issue they want to drone on and
on about. But just ask them to *get involved* and they have a
million excuses. They just want to bitch.

Thanks, Dan - my sentiments exactly. I don't think the US is the devil
and every other country is pure goodness. (Anyone who's heard me rant
about China knows that.) But because I am an American citizen, it's my
obligation to recognize and point out the things that are being done in
my name, if I disagree with them. Otherwise, I'm just being complicit.
Unfortunately, there happen to be a lot of things happening in the current
administration that I can't condone, so I'm critical a lot these days.

I don't completely agree with this. I guess it depends on the bitching
and how someone is communicating, but I think that talking about issues
to people can help to bring about change, too. An intelligent argument
about an issue, that gets people thinking about it and maybe rethinking
their position, can be pretty valuable. Especially if you're using a
wide-distribution method such as publishing, radio or the internet, and
lots of people are reading what you have to say. Don't underestimate the
power of the written/spoken word to change people's minds. It's not all
mindless bitching and whining.

No, Dan, I don't see your posts as US bashing.  I think there's a big, *BIG*
difference between disagreeing with US policies / laws / politicians - even
expressing disdain for the current administration (I do so myself) - and, on
the other hand, saying things like this or that country is more civilized
than the US.  The &quot;US&quot; as a whole includes me and my entire family, and I
don't feel that I or my family are any more uncivilized than any other

because of (insert your reason here)&quot; thus painting the entire country and
everyone in it with the same broad brush, that's doing a huge diservice to
those of us here who are caring, responsible &quot;global&quot; citizens.

Again, I really didn't mean to cause a big to-do or to insult anybody else,
but I just get tired of people here saying disparaging things about a
country and a people I think of as one of the greatest and grandest on earth
*despite* our current leadership!  The US has contributed a lot of things to
the rest of the world since its inception, decency and compassion included.
Our generosity as a people is unsurpassed, and much underappreciated.

Just as other people have justifiably been insulted by my remarks about

fashionable to bash the US and why it's unreasonable for US citizens to

mea culpa?!  I'm as proud of my country as the Brits are of theirs, why is
they are justified in being insulted but I'm not by the same types of

I don't agree. Bitching is just bitching, unless you're discussing

I think you might be confusing &quot;take responsibility&quot; for saying that you
had something to do with it. I'm not saying that. I'm saying, shoulder
some of the responsibility for *fixing* the problems that have come about
as a result of things that happened in the past, even things that you had
no control over or weren't even born. If we're not going to fix problems -
yes, even the problems we didn't create - then who will?

I think anyone who works in feral cat rescue is doing that. Most of them
are not at fault for cat overpopulation, since most of the rescue folks
I know or know about are very responsible. But someone has to do something
about cat overpopulation, and the rescuers, bless them, are the ones who
are taking responsibility.

&gt;&gt; I'm sure the decendants of WWII victims will be dealing with aftereffects
&gt;&gt; for generations to come. Nuele doesn't need to feel personally ashamed,
&gt;&gt; but that doesn't mean she's helpless to have a positive effect, either.

&gt; So what do you think she should do, then?

Well, keeping in mind that it's not for me to say what Nuele should
do, one possibility might be to donate money or volunteer time with
an organization that helps the decendants of Holocaust survivors, or
the families of victims who didn't survive.

She could vote for or campaign for politicians who support those efforts.

She could say to a decendant of a Jew, Rom, gay person, or anyone else
who was affected by the Holocaust that she recognizes that they are still
carrying the pain from what happened to their parent or grandparent.
Often just an acknowledgement of this kind can be very healing. Many
people have a hard time giving that kind of acknowledgement because they
feel so ashamed, they can hardly bear to talk about it. I think that just
makes it worse.

If she doesn't feel the need to do any of these things, that is certainly
her business, and I'm not trying to sound righteous about it, as though
she is *supposed* to do something. But since you mentioned that she feels
ashamed, I was suggesting that she doesn't have to feel powerless about
that.

I'm personally in favor of the Kyoto treaty, so should I be held personally

&gt;&gt; I totally disagree. WW2 was nothing to do with Nuele nor myself as

&gt;&gt; for WW2!

&gt; I think you might be confusing &quot;take responsibility&quot; for saying that
&gt; you had something to do with it. I'm not saying that. I'm saying,
&gt; shoulder some of the responsibility for *fixing* the problems that
&gt; have come about as a result of things that happened in the past, even
&gt; things that you had no control over or weren't even born. If we're
&gt; not going to fix problems - yes, even the problems we didn't create -
&gt; then who will?

&gt; I think anyone who works in feral cat rescue is doing that. Most of
&gt; them are not at fault for cat overpopulation, since most of the
&gt; rescue folks
&gt; I know or know about are very responsible. But someone has to do
&gt; something about cat overpopulation, and the rescuers, bless them, are
&gt; the ones who are taking responsibility.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure the decendants of WWII victims will be dealing with
&gt;&gt;&gt; aftereffects for generations to come. Nuele doesn't need to feel
&gt;&gt;&gt; personally ashamed, but that doesn't mean she's helpless to have a
&gt;&gt;&gt; positive effect, either.

&gt;&gt; So what do you think she should do, then?

&gt; Well, keeping in mind that it's not for me to say what Nuele should
&gt; do, one possibility might be to donate money or volunteer time with
&gt; an organization that helps the decendants of Holocaust survivors, or
&gt; the families of victims who didn't survive.

&gt; She could vote for or campaign for politicians who support those
&gt; efforts.

&gt; She could say to a decendant of a Jew, Rom, gay person, or anyone else
&gt; who was affected by the Holocaust that she recognizes that they are
&gt; still carrying the pain from what happened to their parent or
&gt; grandparent. Often just an acknowledgement of this kind can be very
&gt; healing. Many people have a hard time giving that kind of
&gt; acknowledgement because they feel so ashamed, they can hardly bear to
&gt; talk about it. I think that just makes it worse.

&gt; If she doesn't feel the need to do any of these things, that is
&gt; certainly her business, and I'm not trying to sound righteous about
&gt; it, as though she is *supposed* to do something. But since you
&gt; mentioned that she feels ashamed, I was suggesting that she doesn't
&gt; have to feel powerless about that.

&gt; I don't agree. Bitching is just bitching, unless you're discussing
&gt; ways to bring about change also.

Well, pretty much every time I've made a contribution toward a positive
effort to change something I don't like, it's because I've heard, read,
or seen (as in a film) about a situation that I find unacceptable. I
can't experience everything first-hand - many things go on in places far
away from me. So I have to rely on the people who inform the public about
those problems, and I very much appreciate the work they do.

I really believe that we must make contributions in the best way we can
as individuals. We all have different talents, as well as different
limitations. An extremely shy person isn't going to go talk to the DA,
but maybe they'll give money. A deeply depressed person might not be able
to get out and go to a protest march, but maybe they'll put a sign in their
window, thus inspiring someone else to go to the march. An extremely poor
person might not be able to donate money to a cause, but maybe they'll be
the one who talks to the DA. An illiterate person will not be able to
write persuasively about a situation or issue, but maybe they'll sit in
an office and answer phones. Everyone has their particular niche and
calling.

I don't think it's for anyone to judge exactly *how* a person fits into
the overall work that gets done to change something. But I do know, from
personal experience, that the people who talk, write, make films, and
even sing songs about issues have inspired almost every activist thing
I've ever done.

Before unsubscribing to this group I have a couple of things to say. I am
sorry there is a, hopefully temporary, rift in this community.

Having said that I want to say anyone that knows Lee knows that she puts her
money and her actions where her mouth is. She has rehomed three cats in the
past few months. This after spending money that she doesn't always have at
the vets to insure they are in good health or &quot;fixed&quot;.

People have died in this country to insure that we have the right to
question our laws.

Where animal rights is concerned is a &quot;button&quot; for many of us. We do our
part to make sure authorities are aware of problems when we know.

It isn't bashing to say a thing is wrong and that another country does it
better. Hopefully some politician will hear and try and change the rules.

To bring up all this about WW this and WW that is more than I want to deal
with.

I hope all your four footed friends get better and those humans that are
sick do the same.

May Bast and God bless you all

Gramby

I already answered this in another post, Tweed. Besides which, I don't
think you *should* do anything. I also have plenty to deal with in my

Thankyou *both* for behaving in a mature manner.

Sad fact of life is that our Real Life stresses can spill over into here,
our 'safe haven'. But if we can recognise and then apologise for the hurt we
have inadvertently caused (I can't imagine any regular here causing hurt
intentionally) and also accept an apology with good grace, then we're doing
something really special, really good, and can help each other have this
'safe haven' away from Real Life stresses.

So thankyou both for not carrying out a perpetual flame war and acting like
grown ups. Good to see (although sadly rather unusual here in Usenet) and a
*great* example to others.

You figure it out, let me know.  I figure most of us have ancestors who got
the short end of things at some point, as well as ancestors who may have got
unfair advantage.  Life isn't always fair, and it never was.  I kind of
figure the most you can really ask of anyone is that they live the best way
they know how in this lifetime.
