Obama steps into White House race

Mr Obama is considered to be a serious rival to Hillary Clinton
Senator Barack Obama is taking the first step towards a White House
run, raising the possibility the US will get its first black president.

Mr Obama, a Democrat, said on his website he had formed an exploratory
committee, which would allow him to raise money and hire staff for the
run.

He is one of his party's rising stars, having electrified the 2004
Democratic convention with a powerful speech.

He opposed the war in Iraq and has a solidly liberal Senate voting
record.

In a video announcement posted on his website, he said Americans wanted
to move beyond partisan politics to find common-sense solutions to
problems.

"Politics has become so bitter and partisan, so gummed up by money and
influence, that we can't tackle the big problems that demand
solutions," he said.

"We have to change our politics, and come together around our common
interests and concerns as Americans."

Personal history

Mr Obama, 45, has generated unusual excitement in Washington since he
was elected in 2004, even being described as a "beach babe" after he
was photographed visiting family in Hawaii.

BARACK OBAMA
Born 4 Aug 1961 in Hawaii
Studied law at Harvard
Worked as a civil rights lawyer in Chicago
Elected to the US Senate in 2004

Profile: Barack Obama

His 2004 convention speech touched on his personal history as the son
of a Kenyan man and a white woman from Kansas, hailing America as a
land of opportunity for giving his father a chance to study there.

He said he would make a formal announcement on 10 February as to
whether or not he would run for president.

Mr Obama is considered one of few Democrats who could snatch the
party's 2008 nomination from fellow Senator Hillary Clinton.

She has not yet declared her candidacy.

Former vice-presidential candidate John Edwards is thought to be the
strongest Democratic contender to have declared he is running for
president. "

Washington diary: The next president?
By Matt Frei
BBC News, Washington

One could be excused for thinking that a 45-year-old African-American
with barely two years' experience in the US Senate and a name that
evokes America's two most hated enemies wouldn't have an ice cream's
chance in hell of winning the presidency.

Mr Obama's trip to New Hampshire has put the spotlight on him
But Barack Hussein Obama has proven once again that in American
politics, truth is a lot stranger than fiction.

I went to the see the senator's maiden voyage to New Hampshire over the
weekend, my overnight bag packed with caveats and my pen dipped in
Beltway cynicism.

I came away thinking that Hillary Clinton has a huge problem on her
hands.

Since New Hampshire is one of the first high-profile pit stops on the
rocky road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the voters of the Granite State
regard politics with the same degree of zeal, snobbery and discernment
as wine buffs at a Pinot Noir tasting or poodle owners at the Crufts
dog show.

They are quick to rumple their nose and curl their lip when dished up
something that doesn't meet their expectations.

Money well spent

So it was nothing short of astonishing that 1,600 of them had paid $25
each on a beautiful Sunday morning to see Barack Obama at the Radisson
Hotel in Manchester.

Isn't $25 how much you normally pay people to listen to a senator speak
in public?

As far as I could gather from the rapturous applause and the
post-mortem interviews, the harsh cognoscenti of the Granite State left
the event feeling it was money well spent.

Send us your comments
As John Distaso, the political editor of the New Hampshire Union Leader
and the druid of primary politics, told me: "I have never seen anything
like this... at such an early stage in the campaign."

Early is an understatement. It's more than a year before the primaries
and almost two years until the presidential election.

As the governor of the state put it in his opening address: "We had
booked the Rolling Stones until we realised that Barack Obama would
sell more tickets!"

The junior senator from Illinois, as the cable news networks like to
refer to him, lopes on stage with an elasticity that almost verges on a
dance.

He deals with the hype graciously. "I am genuinely baffled," he told
the adoring crowd, sounding genuine, "and so is my wife!"

There are lots of deferential references to his wife Michelle, whom he
met at Harvard Law School. It reminds me of the endearing way in which
George used to talk about Laura.

Barack Obama also has a good line to fend off any questions about his
weird name.

"When I first started to work in public life... people would ask: 'Hey
brother, what's with your name? You called Alabama or Yo' Mama?'"

As for the unfortunate middle name, Hussein means "little beautiful
one" in Arabic and as the senator puts it: "The American people don't
care about middle names."

Appealing picture

Assuming that the senator will become a candidate and stick around for
a year or more, I am sure that his name will become campaign ad fodder.

But as we discovered in the mid-term elections, too much mud-slinging
backfires and America is not cruising for a bruising but yearning for a
healer.

Democrats - and others - went wild for Mr Obama in 2004
And this is where the meat and potatoes of Senator Obama's speech comes
in.

Ever since he wowed the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston, he has
been speaking about the need to overcome the bickering between Blue and
Red, Democrat and Republican.

He paints a picture of America that is more complex, nuanced and
appealing than the caricature that most partisan politicians and
journalists like to present.

He knows all about complex. He is after all the son of a Kenyan
economist who was "as black as pitch" and a woman from Kansas who is as
"white as snow".

He was brought up in Hawaii and Indonesia and he became the editor of
the prestigious Harvard Law Review.

He is religious without being born again. As he likes to point out the
title of his best-selling book The Audacity of Hope - number two on
Amazon - is plagiarised from a sermon given by his favourite Chicago
preacher.

He looks slim and healthy and yet he enjoys the occasional cigarette.

Beyond race?

In short he defies the pigeonhole.

It also struck me that on Sunday his was virtually the only black face.

The fact that someone like me can attract a crowd like this shows
that this country yearns for something new and different

Barack Obama
I know that New Hampshire is a predominantly white state, but Mr
Obama's campaign has moved on from the raw passion of the civil rights
movement.

He mentions Martin Luther King without reminding you of Jesse Jackson
or Al Sharpton.

Like Colin Powell, the senator from Illinois makes you forget he is any
colour.

He is also clever enough not to sound condescending or to tie himself
into the kind of mental pretzels that strangled John Kerry.

His inexperience in the Senate may turn out to be an asset and he has
the same talent that JFK apparently had of appearing glamorous and
humble at the same time.

As for the hype: "It flatters me," he told the crowd, "but it also
alarms me... because it says more about America than it does about me.

"The fact that someone like me can attract a crowd like this shows that
this country yearns for something new and different!"

His voice is neither shrill nor pompous.

Problem for Hillary

Yes, Hillary has the machine, the money, the pollsters and the brand
recognition - but she also has the baggage.

Being front-runner is not always good news for a candidate
She is the undeclared front-runner and according to history that is a
dangerous position in the Democratic Party.

After all, her own husband finished third in the New Hampshire
primaries before going all the way to the Oval Office.

The Senate has turned Hillary into a skilful deal-maker who rarely
slips up.

But is that enough to fire up the imagination of an electorate yearning
for a compelling story?

When pressed about an apparent admission in print that he had smoked
marijuana, Barack Obama replied: "Yes, and I inhaled. That was the
point."

Watch out, Hillary! And, I might add, watch out John McCain, Mitt
Romney, Rudy Giuliani!

Hillary's supporters are constantly coming up with reasons she can
overcome her limitations. Barack's supporters wonder whether he has
any.

Key questions

So, can he win? Can he raise the cash?

Can he survive the rough and tumble of the campaign and the tough
questions?

Will the colour of his skin not count against him? Can he be convincing
about security in the middle of an ongoing war?

Can he survive the fickle adulation of the media?

If the answer to all the above is yes, Barack Hussein Obama will be the
44th president of the United States... as strange as that may sound."

BARACK OBAMA  4hours and 20 minutes after the first post?

If Barack Obama's charisma is going to overcome all the obstacles in
front of him, Hillary Clinton's hope are put in the shade? So will
Obama .......

Obama is going through the motions, maneuvering, that's about all there
is to it. I suspect he's angling for VP, which means Hillary will have
to step lightly - since Obama may hold her ticket to the White House.

Do you mean to say that if Barack Obama can capture the majority of the
African-American votes in America, that Hillary Clinton would consider
him as her Vice president partner at the next elections? Is the
Democrat Party that desperate?

He's a nice looking nobody here, elle.
I didn't even know he was a Muslim -
Think about it, though. A liberal Muslim whose name sounds like Osama.
He hasn't a prayer of winning in my view.

It's media hype, that's for sure. Probably designed to promote Hillary.
I'd bet she's already made him a VP offer.  It's publicity stunts right
now - that's all.

What baffles me is how the Democrats can select their candidates for
President or Vice Presidents without thoroughly examinining their
credentials? Is the Democratic election machinery so inept or stupid as
to not realize that they could be putting up a loser for the whole
party?

There is no doubt that Barack Obama is a very intelligent cookie, but
he has so many drawbacks that he should be dropped bike a hot brick. A
person like Obama who can get a Harvard Law degree Cum Laude, and be
president of the Harvard law society, coming from obscurity is quite an
achievement. But on the other side of the scale, he is an obvious
opportunist (all politicians are), and a fake, and a dishonest fake at
that. When this comes out, the Democrat party will be discredited. He
has to declare and or denounce, officially, his faith before he would
stand a chance. He cannot straddle the fence and hope to get away with
it. This does not speak well of the leadership, decisiveness,
integration, and discipline of the Demoracts.

He isn't actually a Muslim; he's an active member of Trinity
United Church of Christ (UCC) in Chicago.

I have not heard any reports that he has denounced his Birth/original
religion, nor that he has become a confirmed Christian. Anyone can be
active in the Trinity Unted Church of Christ and yet still not be a
Christian. He has not adopted a Christian name instead of his Kenyan
Muslim name? He has not officially denounced his Muslim faith. There
are procedures for that, has he done it? His father and step father are
Muslims. In fact Obama Sr was an extremist Muslim!

Here is an American link with a few more details Ted, to enlarge your
data base about Obama. They are biographical facts of Obama. Most
Muslims first get absolved being a Muslim by a Sharia court, and they
usually then adopt a Christian name after that to distance themselves.
Obama has done none of these things. (You cannot have your cake and eat
it too.)

Obama is such a apparent opportunist. He accepts the description of
"African American" without a murmur. He will try to win their votes. He
will try to win the Muslim vote, and he will try to win the Christian
vote because he helps out in the Trinity Church. He is a Harvard Law
graduate, so he will get the vote of lawyers, and The Ivy League boys.
He will get the vote of all the minoritiy fringe groups. He is a member
of all these groups. What more do you expect with such an opportunist?
A Winner? or will it Boomerang? Politics is a dirty game.

Maybe. If I were managing the opposition, I'd do everything I could to
insure Obama's nomination - because he wouldn't stand a chance in the
general election. Thus, I suspect it's the Dems themselves who are
working to undermine his chances - and if the truth doesn't work,
they'll cook up enough rumors to kill a horse.

On the other hand, who've they got? No one, except a bet we'll lose the
war.

You might want to remember the slim hopes of John Kennedy, a Roman
Catholic with little real experience. The American voter is a fickle
one. Thumbs up. Thumbs down. BTW- JFK's "Ask not..." was stolen from
Kahlil Gibran, born in Lebanon.

Rig - But those were "JFK Democrats" - come to think of it, "I" was a
JFK Democrat. (John Kennedy was no panty-waist).

Otherwise, you're right regarding voters. Yet, things have changed
since the days of Gibran, and is why the modern-day Dems are so
unlikely to come up with a viable candidate.

Besides, after 40+ years of humoring, it's obvious there's no room in
the DNC for a substantial black candidate. They'll figure out a way to
torpedo Obama - and blame Pubs for their dirty tricks.
