Hi,

I would be gratefull for your suggestions for the cheapest
postscript laser printers that are known to work with linux.
Unfortunately the suggested printers page at linuxprinting.org
is hopelessly out of date. If there are any cheap color printers
in this category (I doubt) that would be great too.

Why do you insist they be Postscript printers? Linux systems
typically use ghostscript to interpret Postscript and generate native
printer-control code. This works quite well for printers supported by
ghostscript.

Any printer that accepts postscript should work fine with linux. Shop

Is there any particular reason they be native postscript printers?
The normal approach is to use postscript as an intermediate language,
and convert to the language spoken by the printer at print-time.  It's
now pretty much transparent if you use CUPS.

If you open a browser, and type in the search bar, 'man cups' you will
see a website for cups, and click on the entry 'Documentation' the site
opens and you can read all about it.  Tab 'Printer Drivers' lists 377 of
them.  Realize that some work on large groups of certain brand printers.

I am running a Brother MFC - 8500 5-in-one FAX, Printer, Scanner,
Copier, Phone, but the driver is for the MFC - 8300 and it prints great.

The Apple Select Writer 360 driver works on the 300 and 310.

Notice I like monochrome Laser printers, that I get for free.

Yes. This is good advice. I use Laserjet 4 and Laserjet 5 here. I was forever
throwing out inkjet printers, so I jumped on Ebay and bought some Laserjets,
and they just run without hassle.

(HP Laserjets use PCL rather than postscript, but PCL is well documented and is
supported on GNU/Linux without any issues.)

All of the LaserJets we have (and have had), including my private
LaserJet 1200, understand Postscript (and are exclusively used as
Postscript printers).  AFAIK There are some LaserJets that don't
support Postscript, though, so look at the description when shopping
around.

Many HP Laserjet 4/5 have PostScript and/or network cards (I've got one) and

A network card is certainly useful. But why does a Postscript module

I've had a LaserJet 4MP in operation since 1994.  (I think the &quot;M&quot; in
the name stands for Macintosh, i.e. PostScript.)  Once nice thing
about having Level 2 PostScript built into the printer is that it
therefore has built-in FAX decoding.  I use it to make full-page
images at 600dpi.  I have a 600dpi scanner, too.  It would take a long
time to transmit uncompressed images via parallel port.

We have a couple of those here used for doorstops. Loud and dog slow.
Also their paper handling mechanisms are somewhat worn out - I recall
they liked to chew up paper a lot. Get a new printer, and forget
Postscript. It's just an interpreter to the native printer language.
Slows down printing dramatically.

I have an HP 4P that I bought for fifteen dollars about four years ago
at a Rotary Club garage sale.  No Postscript module in that, and likely
it would cost me more to buy said module separately than I spent on
the printer.

I do have a much smaller laser printer intended for the Macintish, I
can't remember the manufacturer, and I barely used it (again, I got
it cheap at a rummage sale).  It had built in Postscript.
It was terribly slow, which is why I didn't stick with it.

I suspect it's the Postscript bit that slows it down, since I
recall the big lag was in processing the pages before printing.  And
given that I was used to dot matrix printers at the time, it had
to be really slow rather than &quot;slow compared to something faster&quot;.

It depends on the stuff you print and on the CPU of the printer.  My
Laserjet 1200 has a slow CPU, and it's slow on printing most Web pages
as rendered by Mozilla (I guess all this dithering of colour bitmap
graphics to gray scale at 1200dpi is a bit much for the CPU, but the
results look great), but it's fast when I print papers generated with,
e.g., LaTeX, that contain text and vector graphics.

I never had any problem printing to a PCL printer either -  a Brother
HL-1050 - but the Postscript equipped H-P meant I didn't have to filter
stuff through Ghostscript first. Also I use old Macs too which expect to
see a Postscript printer.

Best to use the native PCL. The printer'll have less work, and you compter
has plenty of memory and CPU to deal with that.

&gt; Of course, if this is important to you, you've got to be careful;
&gt; &quot;PostScript support&quot; in an ad could mean a Windows driver that converts

I don't think you should apply a Linux way of thinking to a Windows
environment. The applications don't churn out PostScript. They print to this
virtual printer, using a set of API's. The Windows driver converts that to
Poscript / PCL / GDI / HPGL/2 / ... An approach used in OS/2, before it was
transposed to Windows.

The only Windows applications that generate a direct printer language like
PostScript, are those ported from another OS. (ie Mac).
And those are known for their poor printing performances, under Windows.
(PageMaker is a good example)

Lets reverse that for this argument. &quot;I don't think you should apply a
windows way of thinking to Linux&quot;. Why do you want to onload all of
the conversion on the CPU when you can avoid it? My Lexmark E232 has a
faster Postscript emulator in the printer than I get from running
Postscript -&gt; ghostscript -&gt; printer (pcl) -&gt; page. My Lexmark is now
maxed out at 80MB and works very well. it also works wonderful with my
Imac G3/400 both under Debian Sarge (ppc version) and MacOs 9.2.2. One
of the features of Postscript (in any form) is to allow the printer to
do the final processing instead of the computer telling the printer to
do all the steps. Granted most people don't use postscript to its
maximum potential but it can do more than just print pages. Its a
computer in a printer using a high level language (its similar to
Forth btw). that can even do mathamatics! Thats right, give it the
forumulas and the details on how to display the results and the
printer will do the math, print the results as you wanted them
printed!  How cool is that? REALLY COOL!

More likel &quot;personal&quot;.

My 4P is nice and compact.  I just saw a Laserjet 4 at a garage sale
today, and it's considerably bigger.  I didn't even bother asking about
the price, since I couldn't be bothered dragging it home even if it
was a great price.

It's very difficult to find a true PostScipt printer anymore. And they are
all expensive if you do find one. Most inexpensive 'postscript' printers
run PS as an emulation layer over their true page description language
which is generally a version of PCL - and because of that, they are
SLOWWWW.

What is your reason for requiring PostScript?

Your printer can interpret Postscript faster than your computer can run

Why do you think these properties of Postscript are lost if Postscript
is interpreted in the computer rather than the printer? Even assuming
the CPUs are of comparable speed, the only advantage I can see is that
less data might have to be sent down the wire.

&gt;  &gt; printer to do the final processing instead of the computer telling
&gt;  &gt; the printer to do all the steps. Granted most people don't use
&gt;  &gt; postscript to its maximum potential but it can do more than just
&gt;  &gt; print pages. Its a computer in a printer using a high level language
&gt;  &gt; (its similar to Forth btw). that can even do mathamatics! Thats
&gt;  &gt; right, give it the forumulas and the details on how to display the
&gt;  &gt; results and the printer will do the math, print the results as you
&gt;  &gt; wanted them printed! How cool is that? REALLY COOL!

&gt; Why do you think these properties of Postscript are lost if Postscript
&gt; is interpreted in the computer rather than the printer? Even assuming
&gt; the CPUs are of comparable speed, the only advantage I can see is that
&gt; less data might have to be sent down the wire.
">

It may partly be a matter of things like font embedding. For instance,
when I write self-formatting PostScript, to keep it small, and to keep
things at the best the printer can do, I use the printer's built-in
fonts, and I probe the characters' metrics at 'run-time' to micro-format
my layout accordingly. Printers vary in their capabilities and built-in
stuff, and having as much as possible happen on the printer's end lets
me keep the print job small until it gets there and, more crucially,
lets me write code in the print job that can query things about the
printing environment and adjust the job accordingly.

Having said that, PostScript printers are way too expensive! Last time I
bought a printer for home use, I settled for decent PCL5 emulation.

And, admittedly, you might need a microscope to see the difference I get
from delaying some formatting until the job gets to the printer.

(For jobs I really care about, I'll also try to bypass CUPS' 'helpful'
preprocessing of some print jobs and just nc the job to the printer. I
don't really get on too well with CUPS.)

It only needs to be fast enough to keep the print engine running at full
speed.  There's a PostScript ray-tracing demo (try writing a ray-tracer in
PCL :-) ) that runs much faster on my computer than it does in a printer.
That's not the kind of job most people run on a regular basis, though.  For
the typical print job (text, maybe with some simple graphics or one or two
small photos), a printer's built-in PostScript will be fast enough.

Its true. All of my Intel based boxen and the Darwin PPC
releases on my Imac G3/400 run WAYYYYY Slower than sending the raw
Postscript document to my Lexmark E232. I have tested it several ways
and on several processors from a Pentium 100 to a Pentium Celeron.
Simple text documents to fancy graphic layouts. Sending the raw
postscript to my Lexmark E232 is at least 4 times faster for text and
2 times faster in graphic intensive pages.

Isn't that enough of a reason? Especially if your page layouts
are complex, and yes, having the printer do the &quot;thinking&quot; can be a
major time saver in Data movement.
Its just like using a WinModem, Wny have my main CPU do what
should be done by the device itself. Give the board/printer its
assignment and do other things while the task is being processed by
the device.  When the device signals its done the task or an error,
then we service the device as required. Its like delegation of
authority in a business. And to me it makes more sense than having
the Computer become the &quot;octopus&quot; and make everything work via low
level software, just because my processor runs at 2.5 GHZ.
.
Thats not the UNIX/Linux way! If we want to use little
routines to break the work down. Why should we not consider giving the
specific work to the different devices and let them hash it out, thats
their purpose!

And I agree that PS is cool. At least, it was, up to a point.
Lately, I've noticed a series of problems with it.
Imagine this:
- take a PDF document (PS inside, right?)
- open it with Acrobat Reader (from the people that created PS)
- print it to a varaity of PS printers (PS inside)
- get various problems
I've allways had all our company's printers setup in PS. Now, the latest
batch of multifonction machines take MINUTES to *start* printing a PDF. And
I tried it with Acrobat in both Windows and Linux. When I use kPDF, the jobs
gets out immedialtelly.

The problem seem to be linked to conflicting versions/interpretations of the
language.

PS: I read an article somewhere that there is a idea to replace PS with PDF
as job format.
Great. Why don't I slice my wrists right now? (down, not across)

Meanwhile, we're creating PCL queues for those 40 multifunction printers.
The other 200 are kepts as is, but at the slightest trouble...

No, it's not. You can do things in PS you can't do in PDF, and

elsewhere in this thread, I couldn't have done using PDF. But, you can
do transparency much easier in PDF than you can in PS. That's why it's

Do you really care what the ppm rating is? It only comes into effect when
you are printing multiple copies of the same page. Otherwise, it is the
rendering speed which is of real interest. One factor in that case is the
speed of the cpu in the printer - another is whether it is using it's
native language or emulating PS - if emulating it usually takes about
three times as long.

No disagreement there. Many of the problems were that they either were
rs232 serial and limited to 19200 bps tops or used paraelle ports at slow
rates. Of course a slow printer cpu and little printer ram is a major
hurdle.

Been there, faced that ;* My printer is Level 3 and I had to
figure how to set it for Level 2 emulation. It also can do Level 1
according to its technical manual. (you download the pdf version of
the printer reference from Lexmark).

It's not more work than any other Postscript interpreter; just instead
of letting the graphics operators render the stuff, just collect them
into a PDF.  If you have a Postscript interpreter (e.g., gs), you can
do that by redefining the names of these operators to output the PDF
graphics commands and their parameters, then appending the Postscript
file you want to convert, and let all of that run through your
Postscript interpreter.  That's how early versions of the distiller
worked.

Er, yes, it's easy to write a converter from PS to PDF if most of the
work was already done for you! My point is simply that PDF isn't 'PS
inside' (as was alleged) which is one big reason why GhostScript is a
non-trivial program.

Mmmm, I've used the same trick myself, actually, for a sort of PS -&gt; PS
thing where I didn't trust the printer in particular ways so I redefined
a bunch of operators to have them output a much simpler PS program that
was simply strokes and curves and things and ran that through gs. It
would have been easy to convert the resulting PS to PDF.

For the benefit of these programs, some printer manufacturers have, at
least in the past (I haven't looked at this lately) sold &quot;PostScript&quot;
printers that are really non-PostScript models with drivers that can
accept PostScript output from programs and generate printouts on their
matched non-PostScript printers. My point is that if you want a PostScript
printer for use with Linux (or any non-Windows OS), you've got to be wary
of such marketing gimmicks. A non-PostScript printer that ships with a
Windows-based PostScript interpreter will be no better than any other
non-PostScript printer, assuming equally good support in Ghostscript. I've
heard of people who've bought such &quot;PostScript&quot; printers for use with
Linux, assuming they'd have no problems in Linux because they were sold as
PostScript models, only to discover that they've got poor or no
Ghostscript drivers and no built-in PostScript. I was simply cautioning
the OP (and anybody else who might need to know) that a printer that's
advertised as being a PostScript model might not actually be that, and
therefore might need explicit Linux driver support or be outright
unacceptable, depending on one's precise needs. Before buying, find out
where that PostScript interpreter exists -- in the printer or in Windows
software. The printer manufacturer may not make this distinction very
clear.
