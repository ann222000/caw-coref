Yes it is.  All of them will not leave it alone. I got it at a hillbilly
shop in Kentucky years ago and they all take turns chewing on it and playing
with it.  Except Spirit who hates it with a passion and smacks at it every
time I use it

It surely was.  We have one like that although Missy plays with the
other end.  It has a hole in it through which we've tied about 1 meter
of dental floss and make it jump.  She will wear your arm out dangling
it for her.

Cats playing is always a good thing.  You relaxing and enjoying your cats is
an even better thing.

Dante has a back scratcher, too.  He loves slapping at it, and he
doesn't mind getting scratched with it either.

I Have a similar "kitty toy". Tippy just loves it, he will roll around on the
floor while you scratch him with it and will jump up and grab it when you stop.

In my house, *I* am the one who has back scratchers. I have one by my bed,
one on my computer desk, plus one at my (work) office, and one in my car.
I use them all. When I get an itch on my back, it's intense and doesn't go
away until I do something about it!

The one next to my bed often serves as a kitty-enticer, though, when I'm
trying to get them onto the bed to settle down with me. Licky is particularly
interested in rapid movements it makes, and in how it can dart in and out
from under the covers. Amazing how fast that cat's pupils can dilate!

You should see Tippy and Kramer playing. Those two are just about inseperable.
They will be running through the house chasing each other and wrestling and the
next minute they are curled up and Tippy will have his paws wrapped around him
giving him a through washing. They are so cute together. They truly love each
other.

And Tippy is evidently the top cat in that situation!

Hope you get some pictures of them together sometime - I'd love to see
that.

Aww, that's lovely. I sure would like to see a picture of that cuddling.
