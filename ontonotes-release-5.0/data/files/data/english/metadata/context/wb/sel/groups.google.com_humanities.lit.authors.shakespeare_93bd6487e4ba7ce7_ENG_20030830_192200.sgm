Whether or not Collier concocted the annotation in Camden's 1590 edition
of Britannia or tampered with an existing annotation remains to be seen.

What is interesting is to read Sir Sidney Lee's list of forgeries (many
by Collier) in his famous Shakespeare biography which appeared in 1898 with
many editions over the next quarter century. Lee does not indicate how and why
these documents were determined to be forgeries. One or two of them I was
aware of. Perhaps the most interesting is a reference to a performancee of
Othello in August 1602 only days after the registration of Hamlet with the
Stationer's Guild/Register for publication. The references points to a
performance of Othello by &quot;Burbage's players&quot;...not Shakespeare's
players....presumably a reference to the Lord Chamberlain's Men. The document
in question is a pay-out from moneys in the budget of Lord Egerton, the Lord
Chancellor by Sir Arthur Mainwaring...the same fellow who in 1614-1616 (along
with the Combe brothers and the Stratford man tangentially involved) promoted
the highly controversial plan to enclose the commons in Welcomb to graze sheep.
This project led to a passionate feud among residents of Stratford on Avon
which was white hot at the time the Stratford man died in April 1616.

In any case, any performance of Othello in August 1602 would pose a
serious problem for Stratfordians who place its composition and earliest
performance to 1604...after...after Hamlet was written which they for the most
part date very late to 1601-1602....well after numerous indications that the
Shakespearean drama with this name was performed many years earlier...such as
in June 1594 with two other Shakespearean dramas as cited in Henslowe's records
being performed at the theater in Newington Butts. Also, Mainwaring should
(since he evidently knew the Bard) refer to &quot;Shakespeare's players&quot; not
Burbage's players.

In any case, for the Bard to have been composing Hamlet and Othello...at
the same time in 1601-1602 would be amazing...which would have to be the case
if this particular document were genuine. Whatever the truth, it would be
interesting to how and where the determinations were made as to what documents
and references were forgeries by Lee and others in the 19th-century.

In 1589, Nashe writes of one who &quot;will afford you whole Hamlets, I
should say handfuls of tragical speeches,&quot; in his preface to Greene's
Menaphon.

Also, Mainwaring should

I agree. It would be interesting to know. Perhaps some docs were
dismissed out-of-hand because they didn't square with what the
biographers THOUGHT was the case.

Of course many plays were of uncertain authorship, and without dispute
I've said that some 30% of everything published back then was of
uncertain authorship. However that might be, let the buyer beware, as
Ben Jonson tells us in the quarto edition of &quot;The Alchemist&quot;.

&quot;TO THE READER -- if thou beest more, thou art an understander, and
then I trust thee. If thou art one that tak'st up, and but a
pretender, beware at what hands thou receiv'st thy commodity's, for
thou wert never more fair in the way to be coz'ned than in this age of
poetry, especially in plays....&quot;

Anyone with a few chips of memory left ought to keep that in mind,
ready to quote, and we should all light a candle to &quot;Honest Ben&quot; for
saying it, and mumble some latin: &quot;Orare Ben Jonson.&quot;

Gray Dog's observation is the crucial point. Was this particular document
pertaining to a performance of Othello by &quot;Burbage's players&quot; on August 2 or 3
in 1602...only a few days after the registration of Hamlet in July 1602 for
publication dismissed because it threatened the conventional wisdom about
Shakespeare and the Stratfordian take on the composition/chronology of the
works? I would love to know the grounds for the rejection of this document and
many others as well. I do not doubt that Collier forged a lot of stuff
but...but...how and why was the call made on specific documents?
