I'm running the latest version of Firefox on a Mac. Every now and again
all flash elements on the page stop working and get replaced with a
faded out QuickTime logo with a question mark on it. The only way I've
found to remedy it is to rerun the Flash installer.

Does anyone know why this is happening?

Cheers!

Try whipping into System Preferences, the Quicktime Pane, n' going to the
Advanced tab. When there, ensure &quot;Enable Flash&quot; is on. Click on &quot;MIME
Settings&quot; and go down to the misc. panel at the bottom, expand it, and
make sure &quot;Flash media&quot; is disabled.

Any joy?

5. Scroll down to &quot;MISCELLANEOUS - MISCELLANEOUS FILE FORMATS&quot;.
6. Turn OFF the &quot;FLASH MEDIA&quot; option and klick &quot;OK&quot;.
7. Restart your computer.
