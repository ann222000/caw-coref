Just bought a new mini mouse in Currys. It is a PC Live black wired
optical mouse. Nice design.

However I cannot get it to work on my Vaio laptop.

Can I reword that... It worked when I plugged it in.... fully ... but
after I installed the driver properly............

The curious thing is that the pointer works, the right hand button works
and when I scroll over a button etc the colour changes recognising the
mouse.

But the left hand button will NOT work no matter what I do :-(

I have uninstalled the old drivers, reinstalled the new driver several
times and restarted several times during a two hour session this
afternoon ......grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

The web shows that this is one of those shit companies with no support,
no download sites ...

Any ideas ?

Have you tried it with another PC? I wonder about the possibility of a
faulty button.

Probably a silly question then, but why did you bother installing the
driver?  A lot of stuff you buy these days doesn't really need one (in
addition to what already comes with the OS), even though it comes with one.

PC Live or the actual manufacturer?
I have a Dell optical mouse that is really a Logitech.
There may be an updated driver from the 'real' manufacturer's website.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Try booting a Linux live CD (Knoppix, Ubuntu etc.) to see if the
hardware works ok - most mice work fine in Linux with no additional
drivers.
Also typing this at a linux command prompt should allow you to see the
actual make/model:

dmesg|grep -i mouse

Or just plug into another PC and see if it works.

Are you using XP ? If so do a system restore to the point that would
have been created when you installed the driver first and leave it @ that.

Tried that but no luck....

I will have to return the damned mouse...

I saw lots of products by this company PCLine one sale in Currys.

All I can say is that I will NEVER buy a product from a company that
does not even bother to have a support web site or driver download
facility and anyone who buys one knowing this is a fool.

mmm, I am just wondering how much prices would be if they had to  supply
extensive technical support on everything. Its a bloody cheap ol' mouse just
stop whingeing and get down the shop and change it over for another one for
goodness sakes. I could understand you being peeved if it was a PC item that
cost hundreds and didn't supply support but come on its a bleeding mouse!! -
most probably made in Hong Kong or china and made cheaply, and sold cheaply.
More than likely the button is faulty. Take it back to currys and they will
swap it over no probs if you have the receipt.

I bough a mini usb optical mouse in Homebase the other day for 4.39 Euro -
yes just over 4 Euro!! not a clearance job or sale price they had loads on
the shelf.

I am sure these companies that do not even bother to have a support web site
or driver download are really going to miss people like you if you are never
gonna buy of them again!!!  ;-)

Jeez!

I bought a wheeled mouse with roller wheel from fairyhouse about 6
months ago for 1Euro. It's a PS/2 connection but works perfectly with my
dell laptop. I bought a 'red velvet' mouse with 5 wheels and it would
work but the centre wheel didn't!

I like using the centre wheel for scrolling down webpages and my song
folders. For my DJ work I use a flashing usb optical mouse from hong
kong off eBay. Only 5Euro and looks funky!

BTW I use XP pro with SP1. I put SP2 on it and thought hang on, I got a
spam filter, anti-virus, popup stopper, and spyware checker. So took it
off. Saves a lot of HDD space.

Have a good week all.

There is no spam filter, anti-virus, popup stopper or spyware checker in
SP2! There is a whole lot more however and anyone using xp should
really have it installed for security and stability.

There was when I installed it about 3yrs ago. The popup stopper was
intergrated with IE, the junk filter was in OE. So OK there wasn't
spyware or anti-virus. I have been using XP Pro with SP1 for about 5yrs
and have Spybot, AVG free, Zone alarm, I also use a router with firewall
running. I have had only about 4 serious probs in all that time.

If you wonder why I use free programs and not something like McCafee or
Norton, it's because the people writing viri don't pay me, so why should
I pay to stop them? Also I have heard there is a virus that tell Norton
it's not a virus and spreads through OE. I had a neighbour who had
McCafee, I went round one night and we were sat on the stairs chatting,
he had his PC in the hall left on Yahoo games site, in the space of
about 30mins he got over 50 warnings he had viri, trojans or other
nasties! He used the M$ firewall and was on Tiscali broadband, (In the UK)

So there you go, M$ firewall as good as pi55ing in the wind!

A firewall alone will not stop your Windows PC being infected with a
virus. They have tons of different ways of propagating themselves.. One
example of a very large ISP in dublin (Whom I won't name) being hit by a
virus was one that used Skype to propogate itself. They spent ??? on
Perimeter and client defence! There is an interesting article on using
Skype ona corporate network actually but I won't go OT..

I don't use a Microsoft Operating System anymore however I would say
that Microsoft Firewall actually does what it says on the tin believe it
or not..

sorry to say it but I have used both Ubuntu and WinXP lately and....... I
have reverted back to XP much easier to use, get programs/drivers for and IE
better than FF. There were really some nice things though I liked about
Ubuntu thogh so I keep dipping my toes in every now and again (have it on a
spare IDE Drive). I particularly also like the fact as well that in Ubuntu
if you go into 'computer' it shows my Card Reader the different drive
letters as MMC/SM/MEMORY Stick etc ..... whereas in XP its a guessing game
in 'My Computer' it just says Removable Disk E: F: G: H:   I find it really
irritating. - Its really good that Ubuntu is totally free though especially
if you had a PC with no operating system on it at all and you wanted to get
it up and running.

I wouldn't go as far as to call the Windoze operation Shite though even
though it does have its problems -

Yep, still learning with Ubuntu so its difficult. Just the other day I was
just trying to play a wmv file and totem came up and wouldn't play it. So I
searched 'playing wmv in Ubuntu' and the instructions on it and the
programs/plugin details were ultra confusing to me so I gave up in the end.
Too much techie talk about edge and other sayings to do with Linux which I
am just not familiar with. Using Windoze over the years though is second
nature and WMP seems to play everything! - so as I say I find Ubuntu good
but when it wont play or run something familiar if you have to search for a
plugin/program then I find it for one very confusing. So I go back to
windows.

I must say that it did recognise a lot of my hardware very good except for I
have a couple of problems. Downloading driver for Epson photo printer like
the Epson scan part I don't think I found a driver/program for that and when
I press the volume up down on the keyboard the onscreen bar icon moves up
and down but has no effect on the turning up or down the sound at all. and
as I say having trouble playing wmv videos. Niggly things but still ruin the

There has been quite a few things that work/show OK in IE but I have found

after I have downloaded an IE plugin for FF.

How will you ever learn anything if you won't try?

Try Kubuntu, it's much closer in 'look and feel' to windows than
regular Ubuntu.

But the real problem there is (yet again) Microsoft using a
proprietary format. Most if not all of these CAN be played
successfully under Linux but, for legal reasons, code which may
infringe on US software patents / the US DMCA Act is often not shipped
with the distribution. You have to download and install it yourself
(usually not too hard though.) This is NOT the fault of any of the
Linux distributors, it's a legal issue.

Only because you're used to its quirks and got it pre-installed on
your hardware. Put yourself in the place of a novice Windows user who
has to install it by themselves on their new PC (and without any
driver disks from the hardware manufacturers) and see how they'd get
on - the answer is not well!

Again h/w manufacturers who choose not to support linux (or Mac) isn't
the fault of linux distributors (or Apple).
Microsoft are STILL illegally putting pressure on OEMs to not ship
pre-installed Linux, or at least to make it far more
difficult/expensive to order a Linux-preinstalled PC than it should
be. M$ then go on and on about how they make up 90-something % of PC
sales, well is it any wonder with their monopolist tactics?
Dell supposedly sell Linux systems, good luck ordering one online on
their Irish site though. The other day I wanted to look at their

Andy,

You can just add the KDE enviroment to ubnutu without downloading the
whole thing!

sudo aptitude update &amp;&amp; sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop

During the installation process, you should be asked whether you want to
use KDM or GDM as your default display manager. If you think you'll use
KDE more frequently, make KDM your default. If you think you'll use
Gnome more frequently, keep GDM as your default.

The default can always be changed later by modifying the
/etc/X11/default-display-manager file. For KDM, the file should read
/usr/bin/kdm; for GDM, the file should read /usr/sbin/gdm

When KDE is done installing, log out.

You can then choose which windows manager you want to use.

If you don't want kde in the end (I personally don't like it) just

sudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How will you ever learn anything if you won't try?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Try Kubuntu, it's much closer in 'look and feel' to windows than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regular Ubuntu.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But the real problem there is (yet again) Microsoft using a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proprietary format. Most if not all of these CAN be played
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; successfully under Linux but, for legal reasons, code which may
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; infringe on US software patents / the US DMCA Act is often not shipped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the distribution. You have to download and install it yourself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (usually not too hard though.) This is NOT the fault of any of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Linux distributors, it's a legal issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks, I am downloading Kubuntu as I write this I a will give that a try
&gt;&gt;&gt; (694MB!!) and 3hrs 17mins estimated finishing time!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Andy.

&gt;&gt; Andy,

&gt;&gt; You can just add the KDE enviroment to ubnutu without downloading the
&gt;&gt; whole thing!

&gt;&gt; sudo aptitude update &amp;&amp; sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop

&gt;&gt; During the installation process, you should be asked whether you want to
&gt;&gt; use KDM or GDM as your default display manager. If you think you'll use
&gt;&gt; KDE more frequently, make KDM your default. If you think you'll use Gnome
&gt;&gt; more frequently, keep GDM as your default.

&gt;&gt; The default can always be changed later by modifying the
&gt;&gt; /etc/X11/default-display-manager file. For KDM, the file should read
&gt;&gt; /usr/bin/kdm; for GDM, the file should read /usr/sbin/gdm

&gt;&gt; When KDE is done installing, log out.

&gt;&gt; You can then choose which windows manager you want to use.

&gt;&gt; If you don't want kde in the end (I personally don't like it) just

&gt;&gt; sudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop

&gt;&gt; BC

&gt;&gt; And your laughing.

&gt; You have just proved that its bloody confusing - what the hell is sudo
&gt; aptitude when its at home? - 24% and 2hrs 5mins estimated finishing time as
&gt; we speak :-)

Indeed you can - if I was a *buntu user I'd have remembered to mention
that :)

On the other hand, with OpenSUSE you can do all that with Yast without
hitting the command line at all, if you prefer.

I think the *buntu (and OSX for that matter) security model of not
having a proper root user is fundamentally flawed - of course still
likely to be far better in practice than the average windoze setup...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, no need to remove it unless one needs the space. I must have
hundreds of packages installed that I'll never use, the whole OpenSUSE
install still only takes up 5-6GB of hard disk space so there's no
point bothering to untick packages when installing, I basically just
go with the defaults (unticking Acrobat Reader though - it phones
home, Adobe are poor at addressing security issues, and the free
alternatives are good.)

The problem is that &quot;everything&quot; actually means &quot;everything that Microsoft has a
lock on&quot;. Basically legally and ethically Linux simply cannot play a lot of
Microsoft proprietary files - this is of course a matter of degrees, and some
people in the Linux world chose to ignore both the legalities as well as the
ethics. However, the major distributions cannot afford to ignore either.

The problem, as Ulick indicates, is a legal one.  The software required to
play WMVs (at least those without DRM protection), DVDs, and many other
multimedia files is strangled by patents in many countries. The bigger
Linux distros decided to drop support for these in the free versions to
avoid the risk of being sued, particularly in the USA. It is usually
available in their paid versions where they have licenced the codecs and
pay royalties on each sale.

Free Linux users are not stuck though - multimedia codecs, uncrippled
builds of well-known Linux software, and some no-cost but still
proprietary software can be obtained from repositories hosted outside the
USA - you just need to add one of these repositories to your package
manager to gain access.

Automatix2 for Ubuntu will help you with this.

When you have KDE installed (as I see you're about to do), add in a

With FF market share hitting 28% on average across Europe (and above 38%

Sites with FF issues already tell me the site is old and the owner is too

sudo = run the following command as superuser (aka root, administrator).
There is an option ('switch' in DOS-speak) to run commands as another user
but package management is done by superuser.

APT = Debian package management utility (Ubuntu family is built on Debian)

- Aptitude = a textmode frontend for APT
|
- Synaptic = a GUI frontend for APT

I don't use Ubuntu myself but I imagine you can do this using Synaptic.
Thing is, it is easier, faster, and less subject to error to give you a
specific command you can paste into a terminal rather than describing
which menus to navigate and buttons to click.

If you ever need help on a command, call up the command's man page in a
terminal.  Arrows and PgUp/PgDn to navigate, q to quit.

man sudo
man aptitude

There has been discussion on this point ad-nauseum about the lack of
proper root user in ubuntu. I didn't like it at first.. All you have to
do is drop to a shell and type sudo passwd root. Remember the default
user has no admin rights unless you use sudo to run a command. This
times out after 15 minutes.. Is this not more secure than having people
logging in as root?

So why doesn't &quot;disabling root user by default and making it available
only if really needed&quot; fall into that category?  Sudo is a perfectly
good solution for the market Ubuntu is aimed at.

I've also used OS X for years, and although I do have the root user
enabled, I can't remember the last time I needed it... my admin user
account (separate from my regular user account) does the job for 99% of
all routine maintenance and configuration tasks.

I do use root more often on Ubuntu, but only because there's no
out-of-the-box equivalent of OS X's admin accounts.  (I know you can set
up something roughly equivalent, but I never bothered.)

FWIW, I spend my working days on Solaris, which has proper RBAC so you
never really need to use root _or_ sudo once your account is configured
properly :)

I still have one of each in a box upstairs... ironically, the older 500+
still works, but the 1200 no longer powers up (and its hard drive died
long ago anyway).

Well, sort of true... the Kickstart part of the OS was in ROM, but you
couldn't do much without the Workbench floppy on a 500 (other than play
games)-- on the 1200, Workbench was just installed on the HD of course.
It certainly was amazing what they crammed into that 512Kb ROM though.

&gt; I had an Amiga for years. First a A500+ with 1mb memory, then a A1200 with
&gt; 4 yes *4* mb! I added a external cd drive and 40mb hard drive though! How
&gt; times have changed!

&gt; The arguments from Amiga users that it was better than a PC were, plug n
&gt; play into a TV, full stereo sound, 16million colours and no OS needed! But
&gt; what about storage? LOL I now have a Dell Latitude C640 laptop, 786mb RAM,
&gt; 20GB internal, 230GB and 300GB external drives, external DVDRW and a
&gt; printer I found in the office my other half's boss moved into. Nice one
&gt; actually HP 990cxi Professional series, prints both sides of the paper
&gt; without turning it over!

&gt; I wont bore you with the specs of my 00DJ, just look here

I had a Dragon 32! once......  ZX81, ZX Spectrum 128, Commodore 64 Briefly
before my 386sx 25 PC.   never had an Amiga. Was heavily into Video Filming
at one time and was tempted to get an Amiga with a Genlock to overlay titles
and there was some great titling software packages for the amiga at one
time.

LOL Only kidding!
I the main video program for the 'miggy' was lightwave IIRC. I think it
was used by nick park of the wallace &amp; gromit fame, channel four in
thier titles, the spinning, exploding 4, star trek and babylon 5. You
used to be able to get disks with babylon 5 type GFX on, called holodeck
disks, and the LSD disks were a great source of information.

Does anyone remember the Demos they used to do? IIRC one was called
Jesus on E's? I'm sure someone will correct me. But my fave all time
game had to be the one where you were a titan or something, it was by
the bitmap brothers, can't remember for the life of me what it was
called! (obviously very good!?) as well as Ruff n Tumble.

When I lived in Weymouth about 7 yrs ago, I bought a A1200 with HDD and
CD drive from a charity shop for £3, I sold it for £30, but only after
playing all the old games that were on the HDD. Does anyone remember the
paint package, deluxe paint, I saw a copy in London a few yrs ago,
selling for £5!
