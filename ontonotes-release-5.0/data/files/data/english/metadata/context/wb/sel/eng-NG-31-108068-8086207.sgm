I have an Arisaka (type 38, 6.5mm with 30&quot; barrel) and was wondering
about the proper brass for this rifle.
I know the head spacing is loose which I have found typical in
these rifles. I bought some loaded ammunition (I believe Yugoslavian or
something east European). It is marked 6.5x51mm Jap. It has Russian type
writing on the base and measures reasonably close to what the Sierra
reloading manual states, but the brass looks as if the last 1/4&quot; does
not contact the chamber when fired. I can not for the life of me find
head space gages for this rifle so I have no way of knowing for sure,
but either this thing has a giant head space issue or this east European
brass is not the right size for the Arisaka. It fires and the cases did
not split or anything but I do not plan to fire this thing again till
this issue is resolved. The primer does not look flattened or to be
pushed out of the case after firing.
Are there issues with the Arisaka bolt that one should know about?
I noticed that it only locks on the one lug like a Springfield Krag.
But, I was told by two gun shops that the Type 38 Arisaka has a really
though receiver and with its' small gas ports on the top of the
receiver, they do not blow up or anything even with a total case head
separation. I'm sure most kind of think I'm simple minded wanting to put
my Arisaka back into reliable shooting condition but I just plain like
old military rifles and have always wanted a type 38. So [please, if you
are going to give me an engineering treatise on why all mil-surp rifles
are junk, save your breath. I enjoy collecting these vintage rifles and
like them for what they are. My goal is to make it a safe shooter NOT to
make it some sporterized 1/2 MOA wonder.
If anyone has information or tips on how to tune these old Japanese
rifles so they are safe to shoot as well as things to look for in these
rifles please enlighten me. Oh, this is not a &quot;Last Ditch&quot; rifle. It was
made prior to 1940 at the Nagoya arsenal and is a series 27 if that helps.
Thanks,
Bill

OOps,
I must have had the wrong glasses on. It locks up on two lugs like a
Mauser. One looks somewhat wore while the other looks to have far less
wear.

Yugo ammo (Prvi Partizan Yugoslavia) has cryllic headstamp reading PPY where
the P looks kinda like Pi or an upside down U.

6.5 arisaka is semi-rimmed so I think it &quot;headspaces&quot; on the rim and can
tolerate a somewhat loose fit, but you say no chamber for 1/4&quot;

you mean the brass comes out looking like a .45-70 case? full diameter all
the way to the mouth?

many many many arisakas were victims of hamfisted gun butchers in the 50's
who tried to rechamber them for something americans could buy, there was a
famous article about someone firing a .30-06 in a 6.5 that had had a chamber
reamer run thru it but still retained the original 6.5mm bore........

gunsmiths have a material called cerosafe or something like that, basically
a metal with a low melting point you melt, pour in the chamber and then pull
out and measure the chamber dimensions, Midway has it. If the chamber
casting looks significantly different than your ammo, some butcher may have
vandalized you gun years ago.

Hello WB.  First you are on the right track.  The first thing you want
to do is have a gunsmith put some headspace gauges on it to make sure
its safe to fire as many of these guns had their bolts replaced,
although most will still headspace properly.

I would tell the gunsmith to take a look at the one locking lug that
you do not think is head-spacing.  It may surprise you but many &quot;brand
new bolt&quot; guns do not lock up on both lugs either as this comes from
the great CNC precision machining. Just being facetious, I thought
this would give you a smile as both of us know what great workmanship
went into many of the old bolt action military rifles as opposed to
what we have today i.e. cheap plastic, stamped sheet metal and cast
parts.

As far as ammo.  If I were you I would not fire any surplus ammo.  Not
only is the ammo often dangerous to shoot because it is so often
outdated but much of it is corrosive too and if you use this stuff
often enough sooner or later you will not only ruin the bore but the
action too as the corrosive residue will also get back into the action
and the magazine box.  Leaking primers will also spray corrosive gases
back into the action.  On humid days the rusting can actually take
place in minutes and the corrosive salts are also sucked up into the
pours of the metal only to leach out over a period of the following
days even though you have previously cleaned it.

If you do use this nasty, unsafe stuff, plain only hot soapy water
will wash some of the corrosive salts out but remember the water
itself will also cause your gun to rust if not followed up with a
moisture displacing oil like say WD 40.  WD40 should not be used to
store your gun as it will evaporate off leaving the barrel and action
unprotected. Use a good gun oil to store the gun.

Hoppe's no. 9 has also been used for years when cleaning out
corrosive ammo and Hoppe's also has a black power solvent that will
also work.  Never use Windex as its strong ammonia content will
eventually roughen the bore. Never use any home made witches brews
when cleaning or oiling or greasing firearms.  Even motor oil,
although it is a great lubricant does not prevent a gun from rusting.
Take it from me, I have been all through that.

I suggest you take up hand loading as this is 90 per cent of the fun
of shooting any firearm.  If you shoot cast bullets out of your guns
they will last 3 times longer before barrel burn out  that can take
place in as little as 6,000 round of shooting providing we are talking
about an unfired brand new barrel not an older gun that already has
had many rounds fired out of it.  Cast bullet shooting is as cheap as
the bore destroying corrosive military ammo.

Remember your very finely made military rifle will go up in value by
leaps and bounds in the years ahead if you keep it &quot;military original&quot;
never sportsitize it and never shoot corrosive ammo out of it.  You
have great investment and you should keep it as well preserved as
possible.  Some of the military arms I bought years ago for less than
75 dollars are now worth hundreds and hundreds of dollars because I
kept them in mint condition by never ever shooting corrosive ammo out
of them as over time using this stuff extensively  is guaranteed to
eventually cause you bore and action damage.

If you want to hand load places like &quot;Buffalo Bullets&quot; and &quot;Graef &amp;
Sons&quot; can provide you with bullets both jacketed and cast, bullet
molds, empty brass, loading dies etc. etc.  In the winter time you can
spend many fascinating hours creating your own ammo by casting bullets
and loading super accurate ammo and you can tailor your loads &quot;down&quot;
so they do not beat the snot out of you when you shoot your rifle,
while at the same time making your gun barrel last a lot longer.

The Japanese 6.5 is outstandingly accurate and was proven by P.O.
Ackley the great Gun
Smith to be the strongest bolt action rifle ever made.  His book &quot;Hand
loading for Shooters and Reloaders Vol. 1 and 2 has some fascinating
stories in them.

With your super accurate hand loads and your 6.5 Arisaka you will
probably be able to outshoot the fellow sitting next to you that has a
modern cheaply made plastic and stamped sheet metal rifle hunting
rifle.

If it were mine, I would neck size the brass then head space wouldn't be
an issue.

Thanks for all the replies. First, what I noticed is that the last 1/4&quot;
of the case looks to be stretched and straight as opposed to having the
slight taper of the brass along the other 90% of the case. Also, it
looks obvious that the bulk of the case has expanded as it should
against the chamber while that last 1/4&quot; is as shiny as if it had never
touched the chamber. My plan was to just neck size brass. From what you
all say, this would eliminate a lot of head space issues after the
initial firing of the brass. i tried a fired case in the gun and it
chambers well. It is not super tight nor does it feel loose.
I think I am going to have a chamber cast made at my local gun
shop. I had this done for my Husquevarna Mauser as well as my 1896 Krag.
It kind of takes the guess work out.
I was looking at this bolt and was wondering why one could not make
a 10 mill stainless steel shim or something to affix to the face of the
bolt to make up for some of the wear on the lugs. I know it sounds odd,
but it looks like it would work. The firing pin dent in the primer is
plenty deep. Normally I'd just look for another bolt that fits tighter,
but finding such an animal is kind of hard for these rifles. I found a
couple people on the web who claim to have bolts for sale, but none
answer emails. I've had my fill of dealing with web based businesses
that don't communicate and who seem to take months to put an item in a
box and drop it off at the local post office. Well, I have a set of
reloading dies on the way and have both 120 and 140 grain 6.5mm bullets
since I reload for the two Swedish Mausers I have.
Thanks for the information on this rifle.

The last 1/4&quot; didn't expand because it's the solid head of the case in
stead of the thinner wall. It shouldn't expand on firing. If there are
headspace issues here, neck sizing only is OK, but it's not safe to
fire ammo in the rifle to size cases, safer to pull the bullets, fire
form the cases in the chamber, then reload the cases.

An old (and bad) idea that creates more problems than it solves.
Affixing the shim permanently isn't easy, brazing it can affect the
heat treatment of the bolt, glues can fail, you lose the shim and
you're back to excessive head space but YOU DON'T KNOW IT! Extractor
would probably need to be altered, too, which would weaken it in a
critical dimension.

If you want good headspace, the only real solution is to have the
barrel set back slightly in a lathe. If this is done carefully, you
won't need to ream the chamber. The sights would have to be
unsoldered, turned and resoldered for alignment.

Depending on your concerns about the originality of the rifle, another
option might be to ream the chamber to 6.5x55, since you already load
that round. The only issue would be whether the magazine is long
enough for the Swede round.

I did a quick and crude test of head spacing with a cartridge and a
couple 5 mil shims and the thing has just over 5 mils of play before you
can not close the bolt. This does not seem overly loose for a military
rifle.  I did a chamber cast and the rife seems to be within spec but
with the last section of the chamber a little wide. I did reload some
cartridges and only neck sized the cases. I  had a gunsmith take a look
at it and he said it looked good. Not perfect, but better then average
for a WWII Japanese rifle. I do want to keep the rifle original. It has
not been sporterized or anything. The only change is grinding of the
imperial 'mum'. I do believe I am going to fire form any new cases as
you said. This sounds like a good idea for any older rifle.

This is a good idea for any rifle with a bottleneck cartridge, not just
older milsups - fireform the brass to fit the chamber, then size the minimum
amount it takes to be able to chamber the brass without extra effort.  That
way, the cases only have to stretch once and all subsequent firings are a
minimum headspace.  Not sure how this works with a neck sizer, since I don't
have any of those, but it works just fine with a FL die.  All you have to do
is watch the marks in the lube on the neck as you gradually screw the sizing
die down tighter.  When the sizer reaches the bottom of the neck and just
contacts the shoulder, that's where you stop.  To maintain minimum
headspace, you do not want to set the shoulder back any more than absolutely
necessary for easy chambering.  Because its an FL die, this operation
simultaneously squeezes the main part of the case a little bit, more than
enough to permit easy chambering. - CW
