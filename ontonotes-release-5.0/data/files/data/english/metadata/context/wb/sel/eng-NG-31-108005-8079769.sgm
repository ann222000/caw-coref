We just had a thread on what we collect, and many of us are collecting
specific kinds of prints or specific colors of fabric for one quilt
idea or another.  But most of us never really have to collect our
favorite color because it nearly jumps into our hands whenever we are
shopping for fabric, clothing, or even interior house paint.  So, what
is your all time favorite color?

Mine is royal blue.

I think probably a greeny-blue or bluey-green.  Doesn't matter what
proportions, or how light/dark; but, yes, I think that must always be my
first choice, if I have to have just one!

I'm a member of the green team. &lt;VBG&gt; but that is not just one color, it
is many different colors all of which fall under the label of green,
from deep rich forest green, through the Kelly/emerald greens and into
the yellowy, limey greens.

Red. Absolutely. It causes me to make some very garish quilts.
It's also the color I just gravitate toward. If I'm not mindful of
that, I
end up with a closet full of red clothes.

Lime Green - is there any other color?  It's a neutral for me.  I just had
to purchase an additional yard &amp; a half of a batik lime green for a project
I'm working on.  The lady at the LQS said if I took the end of the bolt, I
could save 25% - it was only 4 yards - &amp; heck - it's LIME GREEN - one can
never have enough lime green:)

If I had to pick one colour it would be purple, but in
reality it's the spread of colours from claret through
purple to deep pink.

I would have to say lime green is my top one at the moment but in reality I
don't think any one colour is a run away. A true red is a very close second.

I like &quot;true&quot; colours. I do NOT like pastels in any form nor the &quot;shaded&quot;
colours. My eyes love to fall upon true colour. The deep and satisfying
colour of green, red, blue, brown, etc but not a shade of the colour, just
THE colour. (did that make it as clear as mud for you all?)

I guess that is why I am drawn to jewel tones. They are a true, bright and
clear colour that just appeals to my senses.

If you looked in my home you would see my choices run towards yellow, lime
green and red. I do have one room that is done in &quot;leather&quot; browns with a
hint of forest green. Of course my base colour is the ever popular and
complained about, boring beige.

&gt; We just had a thread on what we collect, and many of us are collecting
&gt; specific kinds of prints or specific colors of fabric for one quilt
&gt; idea or another.  But most of us never really have to collect our
&gt; favorite color because it nearly jumps into our hands whenever we are
&gt; shopping for fabric, clothing, or even interior house paint.  So, what
&gt; is your all time favorite color?

&gt; Mine is royal blue.
