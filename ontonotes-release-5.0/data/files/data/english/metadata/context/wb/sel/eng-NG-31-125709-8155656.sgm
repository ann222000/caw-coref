Alien Invasion: NAFTA, Bush, war &amp; the great migrations to the EU &amp; here
By Jane Stillwater http://jpstillwater.blogspot.com

Birds fly south for the winter.  That's what they do.  Why?  Because, in the winter, it's freaking COLD in the north.

Mexicans stream across America's southern borders.  Why?  Because NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) and globalized corporate interests have sabotaged their economy and made their country pretty much intolerable for the average working stiff there.

Iraqis, Afghans and Palestinians are flooding into Europe.  Why?  Because Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld and their past and present cohorts Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert have totally screwed up the entire Middle East.  According to the London Telegraph, &quot;Palestinian infighting, almost daily Israeli air strikes, and a steadily worsening economic situation triggered by an international aid boycott has made life unbearable for many Palestinians.  Those who can are leaving.&quot;

According to a recent report from the Iraq Slogger, &quot;Scores of Iraqi men, women and children gathered on the pavement of Baghdad's central Salihiyah area waiting for the big grey bus to take them to neighbouring Syria and help them flee their country's violence.  'Staying in Iraq is like committing suicide,' said Hala Numan Jabre, a 41-year-old mother of three girls as she threw her six coloured bags onto the bus.  'There is no safe life in Iraq, it's like a jungle. There are no public services, there is no rule of law, and everywhere there is killing and kidnapping.  That is why we've decided to take our daughters away until things get better, God willing,' Hala, a teacher of English, said.&quot;

What to do?  Well, we don't have to worry about the birds flying south any more because as the effects of global warming try to turn the Arctic into Miami, more and more of the snowbirds are staying home.

And if you want to stop the illegal migration of aliens up from Mexico, just give THEM a reason to stay home too.  They don't really want to come here.  What they really want to do is stay home where everyone speaks Spanish.  And listen up, EU.  If you don't want to be completely overrun with illegal aliens either, don't even bother with increased border patrols.  We've already tried that here in America.  And are they effective?  Ha.  However, there is a much less expensive and much more effective solution to hand -- just get Bush and Cheney the hell out of the Middle East so that the people who live there and like it there can stay there without fear of getting blown up!  End of problem.

From the Telegraph:  Palestinians flee Gaza as infighting rages [thanks to US-Israel stupid policies for the last umpteen years]: http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:CVqqt21W0ucJ:www.telegraph.co.uk/...

From the Iraq Slogger regarding Iraqi refugees: &quot;If we stay in Iraq we will definitely be killed.  Outside we will suffer but at least we will feel safe and secure,&quot; Hassan said as he queued with his children to get the bus to Syria.  Citing Iraqi government figures, the UNHCR said some 1.4 million Iraqis are now in Syria, up to 750,000 in Jordan, 80,000 in Egypt and some 200,000 in the Gulf region. Syria alone receives a minimum of 30,000 Iraqis a month, according to the agency. http://www.iraqslogger.com/index.php/post/3241/Refugees_Must_Choose_E...

From CCUN:  Saving President Abbas, by Uri Avnery:  Ehud Olmert is the opposite of Midas, King of Phrygia.  Everything the king touched turned into gold, according to Greek legend.  Everything Olmert touches turns into lead. And that is no legend.  Now he is touching Mahmoud Abbas.  He lauds him to high heaven.  He promises to &quot;strengthen&quot; him.  He is about to meet him.  If I might offer some advice to Abbas, I would call out to him:  Run!  Run for your precious life!  One touch of Olmert's hand will seal your fate! http://ccun.org/Opinion%20Editorials/2007/June/25%20o/Saving%20Presid...

From Iraq Slogger:  Strategic Reset:  Reclaiming Control of U.S. Security in the Middle East:  ....Develop a Realistic Strategy to Resolve the Arab-Israeli Conflict and Stabilize the Broader Middle East:  The United States needs to pick up the pieces left by President [sic] Bush’s flawed Middle East strategy by building a comprehensive sustained diplomatic approach across the region.  We need to revive steady and regular diplomatic efforts to resolve Arab-Israeli conflict, stabilize Lebanon, more effectively manage our interests in Syria, and address the threat posed by Iran.  All of these challenges are interlinked, far more than when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/strategic_reset.html

From Judy:  Baghdad Dating Game Adapts to War:  Wherefore art thou, Kareem?  Well, he could be making the daily cell phone call to his girlfriend, Dalia.  Or maybe he's off somewhere typing her a tender text message or e-mail.  Basically he's anywhere but on an actual date with the woman he says he loves.  Romance always has been one of the expected casualties of war.  So in Baghdad — with no end to the violence in sight — the dating game has been forced to adapt. http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2007/06/27/804834-baghdad-dating-game-a...

From Larry Wilson [reminding us once again that illegal aliens are not the biggest threat to our economy, our jobs and our freedom.  Bush and Cheney are!]:  However, there is now Directive 51.  This gives Bush all of the power he needs to cancel any election and to remain in power as long as he wants.  Directive 51 is called the National Continuity Policy.   Ostensibly, if there is a national crisis, our government could be in danger of being decapitated, so we need to make sure that some kind of government survives.
Ok, I can buy that.  This kind of survival policy was initiated with the Cold War and fears of a first strike.

So, what's so bad about Directive 51?  First, it says that Bush can declare the directive in force if....

From Me:  &quot;Life is a competition.  The winners are the ones that do the most good deeds.&quot;

****

I have become shocked and amazed lately at how bitter and cynical and mean my e-mails are becoming -- but ever since Bush, Rove, Rumsfeld and Cheney bombed several defenseless countries into rubble, failed to protect my country on 9-11, scalped our treasury and blatantly STOLE two national elections, I've just not been the same.  I WANT to be a kind and loving and caring person but the example being set for me by America's &quot;leaders&quot; has precluded that from happening.  My apologies.

In defense of my country, I must fight fire with fire.  Those people in the White House are NASTY.

If you like getting my outside-the-box essays but your in-box is too full and you need a break, that's okay.  Just e-mail me, say &quot;Dear Jane&quot; on the subject line and I will take you off my list.  Thanks.

And if you get more than one copy of this, blame it on my jankity old computer.
