Liar who cries liar.

page 38 &quot;I think&quot; of the God dillusion, Dawkins &quot;claims&quot; that
Einsteins referenced to god, were taking the michael.

E.G, If I remember rightly, he claims that Einsteins statement
&quot;God doesn't play dice&quot;, was a word play, that uncertainty rules, ergo
god is fake.

Now whats bugging me, is that Einstein never believed in uncertainty.
His statement was a cry for the most authorititive backing he could
muster.

Einstein was obviously wrong about uncertainty, but why does Dawkins
try to claim him as his own?

Why does big DICK lie?

BTW, I reread selfish gene. No mention of junk DNA!

Do you have any evidence for this claim? Einstein made references to god
throughout his life. He also explained what he meant by them, and he
didn't mean a literal god, but a metaphor for the universe. He never
mentioned that his views had changed, as far as I know.

He didn't like the non-causal nature and randomness of quantum theory,
true. I don't remember his ever seeking &quot;authoritative backing&quot;. His
statement was simply disagreeing that the universe wasn't completely
determined.

Einstein wasn't very confrontational, but he was not a a theist by any
standard a concrete thinker such as yourself would be comfortable
with:

&quot;A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the
manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty -
it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly
religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply
religious man.&quot;

&quot;I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but
have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called
religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the
world so far as our science can reveal it.&quot;

&quot;I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony
of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and
actions of human beings.&quot;

To be technical, he was a pantheist, and always had been as far as
anyone can tell.  Whenever anyone tried to attribute any sort of faith
to him he usually got (mildly) irate about it.

&quot;God does not play dice' should be translated as 'Randomness does not
lie at the heart of all things&quot;

Why the translation? In the 1920's Einstein believed in God, had his
faith shaken by hubble but later...

Quote http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607298,00.html

&quot;But the awe part comes in his 50s when he settled into a deism based
on what he called the &quot;spirit manifest in the laws of the universe&quot;
and a sincere belief in a &quot;God who reveals Himself in the harmony of
all that exists.&quot;

Einstein NEVER believed in uncertainty.

Einstein's parents, on the other hand, were &quot;entirely irreligious.&quot;
They did not keep kosher or attend synagogue, and his father Hermann
referred to Jewish rituals as &quot;ancient superstitions,&quot; according to a
relative.

Consequently, when Albert turned 6 and had to go to school, his
parents did not care that there was no Jewish one near their home.
Instead he went to the large Catholic school in their neighborhood. As
the only Jew among the 70 students in his class, he took the standard
course in Catholic religion and ended up enjoying it immensely.

Despite his parents' secularism, or perhaps because of it, Einstein
rather suddenly developed a passionate zeal for Judaism. &quot;He was so
fervent in his feelings that, on his own, he observed Jewish religious
strictures in every detail,&quot; his sister recalled. He ate no pork, kept
kosher and obeyed the strictures of the Sabbath. He even composed his
own hymns, which he sang to himself as he walked home from school.

Einstein did, however, retain from his childhood religious phase a
profound faith in, and reverence for, the harmony and beauty of what
he called the mind of God as it was expressed in the creation of the
universe and its laws. Around the time he turned 50, he began to
articulate more clearly--in various essays, interviews and letters--
his deepening appreciation of his belief in God, although a rather
impersonal version of one. One particular evening in 1929, the year he
turned 50, captures Einstein's middle-age deistic faith. He and his
wife were at a dinner party in Berlin when a guest expressed a belief
in astrology. Einstein ridiculed the notion as pure superstition.
Another guest stepped in and similarly disparaged religion. Belief in
God, he insisted, was likewise a superstition.

At this point the host tried to silence him by invoking the fact that
even Einstein harbored religious beliefs. &quot;It isn't possible!&quot; the
skeptical guest said, turning to Einstein to ask if he was, in fact,
religious. &quot;Yes, you can call it that,&quot; Einstein replied calmly
...

Viereck began by asking Einstein whether he considered himself a
German or a Jew. &quot;It's possible to be both,&quot; replied Einstein.
&quot;Nationalism is an infantile disease, the measles of mankind.&quot;

I call it confused, Dawkins should claim the same. Einstein went

You call Dawkins a liar but the quotes support him. If you are
attempting to portray Einstein as a Christian, Albert, himself, calls
you a liar.

Einstein defined his religious views in a letter he wrote in response
to those who claimed that he worshipped a Judeo-Christian god: &quot;It
was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a
lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a
personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it
clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it
is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as
our science can reveal it.&quot;

Do you understand that Dawkins didn't mention junk DNA in &quot;The Selfish
Gene&quot; because there was no evidence of it when he wrote the book?

Hmm, when I look at Time magazine online they have this to say(among
other things):
The pudgy first child of a bourgeois Jewish couple from southern
Germany, he was strongly influenced by his domineering, musically
inclined mother, who encouraged his passion for the violin and such
classical composers as Bach, Mozart and Schubert. In his preteens he
had a brief, intense religious experience, going so far as to chide
his assimilated family for eating pork. But this fervor burned itself
out, replaced, after he began exploring introductory science texts and
his &quot;holy&quot; little geometry book, by a lifelong suspicion of all
authority.

Oops, you seem to have left out most of the paragraph:

Do you believe in God? &quot;I'm not an atheist. I don't think I can call
myself a pantheist. The problem involved is too
vast for our limited minds. We are in the position of a little child
entering a huge library filled with books in many
languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It
does not know how. It does not understand
the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a
mysterious order in the arrangement of the
books but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the
attitude of even the most intelligent human being
toward God. We see the universe marvelously arranged and obeying
certain laws but only dimly understand these
laws.&quot;
--------------

hth

The next coule are pretty cool too:
--------------
Is this a Jewish concept of God? &quot;I am a determinist. I do not believe
in free will. Jews believe in free will. They
believe that man shapes his own life. I reject that doctrine. In that
respect I am not a Jew.&quot;

Is this Spinoza's God? &quot;I am fascinated by Spinoza's pantheism, but I
admire even more his contribution to
modern thought because he is the first philosopher to deal with the
soul and body as one, and not two separate
things.&quot;

Do you believe in immortality? &quot;No. And one life is enough for me.&quot;

Personal Perspective? No he did not believe in a personal god.
Simply put (very simplistic) he did not believe in a god that is a
person.
i.e. no anthropomorphism
A god that IS not a god that DOES

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Einstein's parents, on the other hand, were &quot;entirely irreligious.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; They did not keep kosher or attend synagogue, and his father Hermann
&gt; &gt; &gt; referred to Jewish rituals as &quot;ancient superstitions,&quot; according to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; relative.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Consequently, when Albert turned 6 and had to go to school, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; parents did not care that there was no Jewish one near their home.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead he went to the large Catholic school in their neighborhood. As
&gt; &gt; &gt; the only Jew among the 70 students in his class, he took the standard
&gt; &gt; &gt; course in Catholic religion and ended up enjoying it immensely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Despite his parents' secularism, or perhaps because of it, Einstein
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather suddenly developed a passionate zeal for Judaism. &quot;He was so
&gt; &gt; &gt; fervent in his feelings that, on his own, he observed Jewish religious
&gt; &gt; &gt; strictures in every detail,&quot; his sister recalled. He ate no pork, kept
&gt; &gt; &gt; kosher and obeyed the strictures of the Sabbath. He even composed his
&gt; &gt; &gt; own hymns, which he sang to himself as he walked home from school.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Einstein did, however, retain from his childhood religious phase a
&gt; &gt; &gt; profound faith in, and reverence for, the harmony and beauty of what
&gt; &gt; &gt; he called the mind of God as it was expressed in the creation of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; universe and its laws. Around the time he turned 50, he began to
&gt; &gt; &gt; articulate more clearly--in various essays, interviews and letters--
&gt; &gt; &gt; his deepening appreciation of his belief in God, although a rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; impersonal version of one. One particular evening in 1929, the year he
&gt; &gt; &gt; turned 50, captures Einstein's middle-age deistic faith. He and his
&gt; &gt; &gt; wife were at a dinner party in Berlin when a guest expressed a belief
&gt; &gt; &gt; in astrology. Einstein ridiculed the notion as pure superstition.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Another guest stepped in and similarly disparaged religion. Belief in
&gt; &gt; &gt; God, he insisted, was likewise a superstition.

&gt; &gt; &gt; At this point the host tried to silence him by invoking the fact that
&gt; &gt; &gt; even Einstein harbored religious beliefs. &quot;It isn't possible!&quot; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; skeptical guest said, turning to Einstein to ask if he was, in fact,
&gt; &gt; &gt; religious. &quot;Yes, you can call it that,&quot; Einstein replied calmly
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Viereck began by asking Einstein whether he considered himself a
&gt; &gt; &gt; German or a Jew. &quot;It's possible to be both,&quot; replied Einstein.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Nationalism is an infantile disease, the measles of mankind.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;To what extent are you influenced by Christianity&quot;? &quot;As a child I
&gt; &gt; &gt; received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; You accept the historical existence of Jesus? &quot;Unquestionably! No one
&gt; &gt; &gt; can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His
&gt; &gt; &gt; personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life.&quot;
&gt; &gt; In 1929, Einstein told Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein &quot;I believe in
&gt; &gt; Spinoza's God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world,
&gt; &gt; not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of
&gt; &gt; mankind.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Note that Albert said that the same year your story is set.

&gt; Yes, but note Spinoza's God, as it has become known, was still a
&gt; belief in god.

It's an admiration of a non-god.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Spinoza's critisised religious hypocracy, Jewish tradition, just as
&gt; jesus had done. But he still believed in some god, so did Einstein.
&gt; Dawkins tries to make out that he was athiest. Obviously he wasn't.

&gt; &gt; You call Dawkins a liar but the quotes support him. If you are
&gt; &gt; attempting to portray Einstein as a Christian, Albert, himself, calls
&gt; &gt; you a liar.

&gt; I never said Einstein was any denomonation, simply that he had &quot;some&quot;
&gt; belief in something. Dawkins tries to portray him as an athiest, that
&gt; is a lie!
">

I don't know what Dawkins may have said but is it relevant to
anything? Einstein explicitly says he didn't believe in a Judeo-
Christian god. He simply admires the structure of the world instead of
believing in a god. This is shown in the quote previously posted
below.

He explicitly says he doesn't believe in a personal god. It couldn't
be stated any clearer. If I say I don't believe in a pink god, it does
not imply that I believe in a god of some other color.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Do you understand that Dawkins didn't mention junk DNA in &quot;The Selfish
&gt; &gt; Gene&quot; because there was no evidence of it when he wrote the book?

&gt; Yes, I was reffering to some other thread, when someone claimed he
&gt; &quot;explained&quot; the existance of Junk  DNA quite well in that book.
&gt; Obviously another lie!

Oh, I didn't see that thread.

&gt; &gt; &gt; page 38 &quot;I think&quot; of the God dillusion, Dawkins &quot;claims&quot; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; Einsteins referenced to god, were taking the michael.

&gt; &gt; &gt; E.G, If I remember rightly, he claims that Einsteins statement
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;God doesn't play dice&quot;, was a word play, that uncertainty rules, ergo
&gt; &gt; &gt; god is fake.

&gt; &gt; Cite?

&gt; Quote
&gt; &quot;God does not play dice' should be translated as 'Randomness does not
&gt; lie at the heart of all things&quot;

&gt; Why the translation? In the 1920's Einstein believed in God, had his
&gt; faith shaken by hubble but later...

&gt; Quote http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607298,00.html

&gt; &quot;But the awe part comes in his 50s when he settled into a deism based
&gt; on what he called the &quot;spirit manifest in the laws of the universe&quot;
&gt; and a sincere belief in a &quot;God who reveals Himself in the harmony of
&gt; all that exists.&quot;

&gt; Einstein NEVER believed in uncertainty.

Whether Einstein was an atheist or an agnostic depended on one's point
of view, according to him:

&quot;From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course,
and have always been an atheist...I have repeatedly
said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is
a childlike one. You may call me an agnostic, but I do
not share the crusading spirit of the professional
atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of
liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination
received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility
corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual
understanding of nature and of our being.&quot;

&quot;My position concerning God is that of an agnostic. I am convinced
that a vivid consciousness of the primary importance of moral
principles for the betterment and ennoblement of life does not need
the idea of a law-giver, especially a law-giver who works on the
basis of reward and punishment.&quot;

--Albert Einstein (in a Letter to M. Berkowitz October 25,
1950; Einstein Archive 59-215)

You jumped from Einstein at age six to Einstein at 50.

A few things happened in between:

He said in his autobiographical notes (translated from German):

&quot;Thus I came -- despite the fact that I was the son of entirely
irreligious (Jewish) parents -- to a deep religiosity, which, however,
found an abrupt ending at the age of 12. Through the reading of
popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in
the stories of the bible could not be true. The consequence was a
positively fanatic [orgy of] freethinking coupled with the impression
that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies;
it was a crushing impression. Suspicion against every kind of
authority grew out of this experience, a skeptical attitude towards
the convictions which were alive in any specific social environment
.... &quot;

In his writings Einstein calls himself agnostic, but agreed that, from
the point of view of a Jesuit priest, he was an atheist.
