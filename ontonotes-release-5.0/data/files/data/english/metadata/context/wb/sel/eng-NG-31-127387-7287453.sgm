*** What HORRIFIES me is the Jack Tomsky´s (Stanford Ph. D. 1974) total ignorance concerning the Fundamental Theorem of Statistics (Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem) and his insistence that confidence intervals cannot be evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations.
*** What HORRIFIES me is that Jack Tomsky not only didn't read the pioneer paper of Hubert Lilliefors in this matter but since that date didn't take into account the *thousands* of papers it was written for the purpose.
*** What HORRIFIES me is the belief that Null hypotheses can be proved true when a simple reasoning says that’s impossible.
For example: how many flips should be performed to prove that a coin is fair?
*** What HORRIFIES me is the belief that a equality (say H0. m1=m2) should be understood as a parameters (algebraic) equality and not that there is not sufficient evidence (by the data and taking into account the significance level) to reject the null hypotheses.

*** I'm not aware of a specific word for that purpose. As you may suspect, I'm horrified at how casually so many people with minimal knowledge of statistical methods pump data through software.  This article in BadScience is... to me... a warning of worse yet to come. OMU ***
