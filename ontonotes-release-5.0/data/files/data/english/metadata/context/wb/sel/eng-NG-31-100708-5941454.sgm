Medieval Christian cemetery smashed to dust by Muslim militias

A video showing Muslim soldiers destroying an ancient Christian
cemetery is posted at YouTube . The vandalism of Djulfa archaeological
site was compared to the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, but the
world kept silence.

Featuring a never-seen-before satellite image of a vandalized medieval
cemetery at the Iranian-Azerbaijani border, "The New Tears of Araxes,"
a five-minute film, tells the tragic story of thousands of ancient
Armenian headstones flattened to the ground by the Azerbaijani
authorities in Djulfa (Jugha), Nakhichevan.

On December 15, 2005, eyewitnesses across the River Araxes videotaped
Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian burial monuments - khachkars (cross
stones) - some as old as 1,500 years. Azerbaijani officials denied the
vandalism, but banned European Parliament members from visiting the
site in March of 2006. Only a few outside news sources tried to
publicize the tragedy.
