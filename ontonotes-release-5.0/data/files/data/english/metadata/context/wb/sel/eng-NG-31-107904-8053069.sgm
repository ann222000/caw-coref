Yes and his daddy was the same way and so was clinton. The legal system
is such a joke. The rich and powerful are never held accountable. We
should just empty all the prisons right now.

I figure it was a matter of time.  Your Corvette is certainly faster
than Aunt Judy's beater. :)

&gt;Actually, it depends on how he drives it.

&gt;my Corvette ever could:

&gt;I bet if Aunt Judy drove his beater off a cliff he could go LOTS
&gt;faster. Here's hoping he tries. :)

That guy survived a six floor drop!!! Do THAT sober!

Aunt Judy's beater going off a cliff will reach maximum speed just
prior to contact with the ground.  Toonces the Cat at the wheel not
required.

Have a troll for lunch (no, not as a date!)
