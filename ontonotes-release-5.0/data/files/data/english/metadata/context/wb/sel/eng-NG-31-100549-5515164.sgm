'89 900S Avg Mx Costs??

Wondering what to expect from my car down the road so to speak.

'89 900S w/ 155K miles. I've been spending approx $900-$1000 per year over
the last 9 years on non-routine maintenance (everything other than oil
changes pretty much).  I got this cost from averaging my bills from an
independent SAAB mechanic in the central US. I'm the only owner of the
automobile, bought it new in 1989.

Is this maintenance cost par for the course? I'd appreciate any advice on
the next 50 to 100K miles from current owners. I'm not a trained mechanic so
do-it-yourself is not a savings option. My current mechanic is very honest
and priced about right for the market.

I'm asking becasue I've got a new driver in the family coming on board next
year. My spouse is leaning toward a car with airbags for the new driver
(safer?). I've recently inherited another vehicle for my use. I may want to
cut loose of the '89 and buy up to a newer model. All part of the decision
matrix. TIA

You have a 16+ year old car.  There are bound to be repairs.  Yes
those sound reasonable if you have to pay a hired wrench to do the
work.  You might count on the costs being about 1/3rd that (or less)
if you did the work yourself and ordered your own parts.

OTOH, there are few cars that would depreciate less than $1000 per
annum and that's if they don't have any problems of their own needing
repair.

Airbags are not that big of a deal IMO.  Drive safely, drive a safe
car (such as a classic SAAB) wear the seat belt and the incresed risk
is negligble if any.

My opinion, keep the SAAB.

YMMV,

I will point out here that there are plenty of routine maintenance items other
than oil changes. For example, brake pads/rotors.

I am not a trained mechanic either, but every time something breaks on my car,
I get a little closer to being one :)

Ah, my parents got rid of an older 900 turbo as I approached driving age, and
replaced it with a non-turbo airbag model.

It's a tough call, as I'm sure you are aware. If you have somewhere to keep it,
you might consider keeping the '89 and also getting another car. You probably
won't get much money for it anyway, and you can always unload it later. But
you'll never be able to get another one-owner 1989 Saab.

Smart parents!  My daughter is NOT driving my 900 turbo!

I concur.  You will not get much cash if you sell the 1989 900S.  If it
runs great and it is costing you $1,000 a year - keep it.  What kind of
car would you get for a car payment of $83 a month?  At least you know
the history and the original owner of the 1989 900s :-)
