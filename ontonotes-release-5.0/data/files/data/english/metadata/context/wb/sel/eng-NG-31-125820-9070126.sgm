I've got a new HTC S710 phone which is supposed to have EDGE (2.5G)
connectivity but I've only ever seen the G symbol to indicate GPRS. Does the
T-Mobile network support EDGE?

Thanks, Rob.

I saw an &quot;E&quot; symbol on my n95 once.  I ignored it and it went away
after 10 minutes.

AFAIK only Orange in the UK bothered with Edge ie 2.5g.

I use an unlocked SPV M700 (aka HTC Trinity) with T-Mobile and get
HSDPA speeds ie 3.5g - occasionally I have to force it back onto GPRS
(2g not EDGE 2.5g).

I live on the coast so the handset might have been picking up a French
signal?  There was no signal quality there so either the signal was
too low to do anything with or it doesn't list signal strength with
EDGE.

I've never seen it before and haven't since as I have excellent 3G
coverage at home and work.

Nope, EDGE is only available on Orange in the UK.

Too much choice still :-) The Trinity is indeed 3G. I knew the HTC S710
wasn't 3G which was a little disappointing but otherwise it's a good
mobile/PDA compromise.

In Germany, the whole network should support EDGE by End 2007, in
Czech Republic, USA, Hungary, Poland, Austria, Slovakia it is supported,
too.

So there is a good chance it will be supported in UK in future.

Am I correct in assuming that our 3G permits a faster service than
EDGE?

EDGE can carry data speeds around 200 kbit/s[1] (depending on the
network and handset capabilities).
3G supports 384 kbit/s, or with a HSDPA handset supports 3.6 Mbits/s

&gt; Edge is inferior to our existing 3g network, why would they down grade
&gt; the system they spent millions licenceing.

&gt; The only reaso to down grade it at the moment is the iphone needs it
&gt; hence why it's around in some cities.

ISTR that it's a lot cheaper to bolt an EDGE 'add-on' to a standard GSM
transmitter than it is to upgrade it to 3G

Yes it does but current mid-range Windows Mobile phones often don't have 3G.

And many other devices which haven't got 3G but do have EDGE. I assume
because it's an extension of GSM technologies not a completely new one.

Doesn't EDGE also double the GSM call capacity of each cell where it
is deployed when the handsets support it?  It is a dirt cheap upgrade
compared to 3G.
