We own a 2001 Maxiwagon that we use mostly for travel to dog shows,
field trials and the like.  I have the bench seats stored in my garage
and would like to advertise to find them a new home.  (I'd even be
willing to donate them to a church group or the like -- just want my
garage back).  I'd like to be able to tell anyone who inquires what
year-range the seats will fit.  Any ideas where to find out this
information?

TIA,
Mark
