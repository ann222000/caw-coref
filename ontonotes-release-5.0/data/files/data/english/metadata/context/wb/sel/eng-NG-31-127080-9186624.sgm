Medical schools urged to teach about obesity

Institutions at the forefront weave knowledge into lectures and
clinical rotations.

By Myrle Croasdale, AMNews staff. Nov. 12, 2007.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Obesity is a national epidemic, yet most medical schools are not
equipping their students to address it, nutrition advocates say.

The Assn. of American Medical Colleges would like to see this
situation change. In an August report, an expert AAMC panel lays out
guidelines on how medical schools can incorporate obesity prevention
and treatment into their science courses and clinical clerkships.

&quot;This is a big issue confronting our future doctors, and we want
[medical schools] to better address these problems,&quot; said Rika
Maeshiro, MD, MPH, a co-author of the AAMC report and AAMC vice
president for public health and prevention.

Most schools teach nutrition, but no data exist on how many integrate
obesity into basic science and clinical courses. A few schools have
embraced curriculumwide changes, while others include lectures or
single clinical rotations with an obesity focus.

One school the report touted as a model is the University of Wisconsin
School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. It made obesity part
of its curriculum 15 years ago, said Patrick McBride, MD, MPH, dean of
students.

&quot;We saw the trend coming for quite a while and started emphasizing
prevention in our curriculum,&quot; said Dr. McBride, who chaired the AAMC
panel that developed the report.

Wisconsin's second-year students learn obesity's etiology and
pathophysiology during a nutrition class. In the third year, they get
a hands-on lesson before starting their clerkships that comes in the
form of a buffet lunch of whole grain salads, lean meats, fruits and
vegetables.

Students make their choices, then learn about how national guidelines
relate to what is on their plates. The goal is to show them that
healthy eating can taste good, while teaching them such practical
lessons as portion control, Dr. McBride said. Piling on three pieces
of chicken is two more than recommended, for example.

A collaborative clerkship curriculum in family medicine, general
internal medicine and pediatrics takes lessons further. Family
medicine emphasizes communication and interviewing. Students get a
weight and activity assessment and evaluation tool to assess a
patient's motivation for change and are taught to help patients
determine small behavioral changes.

Metabolic syndrome and treatment options, such as pharmacotherapy and
surgery, are stressed in the internal medicine clerkship. In
pediatrics, activity, diet and family history are focuses.

The goal is to give students in-depth exposure to these issues rather
than superficially dealing with them during each clerkship. The
training extends to residents as well.

Sarah Fox, MD, a third-year family medicine resident at Wisconsin,
said weight issues are a constant in her patient population. &quot;People
come in for other things and hope the doctor doesn't mention it,&quot; Dr.
Fox said. &quot;They hope for a silent endorsement of their lifestyle, or
they'll say they'll work on it and then ignore it.&quot;

But she has found that methods she learned are useful. She encouraged
an overweight, pre-diabetic patient with serious osteoarthritis in her
knees to try Tai Chi. Then she helped the patient decrease the amount
of simple carbohydrates in her diet and add more green vegetables.
When her blood glucose came down, the patient was motivated to try
walking.

&quot;Now she is starting to lose weight,&quot; Dr. Fox said. &quot;If I had started
with walking and dieting, she never would have gone through with it.&quot;

Efforts at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston include the
surgical side of the equation. Scott Shikora, MD, surgical director of
the obesity consult center at the Tufts-New England Medical Center, is
adamant that students need to understand obesity's dynamics and become
familiar with the general clinical implications of bariatric surgery.
A third of Tufts medical students rotate through his surgical center.

&quot;Whatever they go into, they will take care of patients who have had
this surgery or will counsel patients who are interested in having
this surgery,&quot; Dr Shikora said.

At the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Goutham Rao, MD,
clinical director of the pediatric weight management and wellness
center, is driving obesity's place to the curriculum. He has opened up
the center for one-week clerkships and hopes to get students thinking.

&quot;We treat high cholesterol, but don't pay attention to the fact the
patient weighs 300 pounds,&quot; Dr. Rao said. &quot;We want students to stop
and say, 'Wait a second.' &quot;

Comments:

(1) As revealed by this article, most current physicians are simply
unable to help patients eat less, down to the optimal amount, because
they themselves do not know how to eat less nor do they know what is
the optimal amount.

(2) Bariatric surgery and not portion control has been clinically
proven to help people achieved sustained (&gt; 5 yrs) clinically
meaningful amounts of weight loss (&gt;10% body weight) that has resulted
in curing weight-related chronic conditions such as hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and type-2 diabetes.

(3) Weighing meals to eat less, down to the optimal amount is
bariatric surgery without the surgery.

(4) Note: This discussion will be mirrored on Sermo, which is like
Usenet but exclusively for physicians only.

Smile, he tries this bit of bad logic from time to time.  The change in
diabetic status happened quickly long before weight loss.

It was because of a large increase in gut incretins which normalized the
diabetes before weight loss.

Weight loss maintained for 5 years or more down to the normal range does
not produce the same effect in diabetics.

Had he been reading the scientific literature he would know this.  But
it was handed to him on a silver platter previously but his false paper
face prevents him from accepting it. The two pound diet,aka 2 pd etc.,
is trash science.

He can be ignored with complete peace of mind.

Someone asked about the effect of by pass surgery on diabetic symptoms
which occur long before weight loss:

&quot;Do you have any web sites where that is shown?&quot;

Most of it is in the scientific journals which are not usually available
in full on the web without subscription except in abstract form.  Below
is a cut and paste from one such article hitting the important points of
the topic:

from Annals of Surgery

Possible Mechanisms of Action

One might think that surgically induced weight loss and decreased food
intake are the most reasonable mechanisms for remission of diabetes
after surgery for obesity, but most reported series do not support
this explanation.

Role of Weight Loss

Most reported series show that return to euglycemia and normal insulin
levels occur within days after surgery, long before there is any
significant weight loss.^[15,24,25] In 1995, Pories et al^[24]
reported the results of GBP in a series of 608 morbidly obese
patients. Preoperatively, 146 patients were diabetic (type 2) and 152
had impaired glucose tolerance. GBP achieved normal levels of plasma
glucose, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin in 83% of diabetic
patients and in 98.7% of patients with impaired glucose tolerance
within 4 months after surgery, without the need for any diabetic
medication or special diet, and before any weight reduction occurred.
In 1998, Scopinaro et al^[15] reported normalization of glucose levels
in 100% of their morbidly obese patients after BPD with no need for
medication and on a totally free diet as early as 1 month after
operation, when excess weight was still more than 80%. Hickey et
al^[25] demonstrated significantly lower levels of fasting plasma
glucose, plasma insulin, and serum leptins in a group of patients
maintaining stable weight after GBP compared to a group of patients
matched in weight, age, and percentage of fat who did not undergo
surgery. A clinical case described in detail by Pories and
Albrecht^[29] is instructive. This woman with a fasting blood glucose
of 495 mg/dL despite daily administration of 90 units insulin
underwent GBP. On the first day after surgery her blood glucose fell
to 281 mg/dL and her insulin requirement was only 8 units. By day 6
she no longer required insulin, and she subsequently remained
euglycemic without insulin or other hypoglycemic agents on a regular
diet for the following years.

Role of Decreased Food Intake

If decreased food intake explains how the GBP and BPD procedures
control diabetes, gastroplasties should be effective too, since these
operations significantly lower food intake by reduction of gastric
volume. Gastroplasties do indeed improve glucose metabolism,^[30,31]
but there is no evidence for long-term cure of diabetes in morbidly
obese patients. Furthermore, vertical banded gastroplasty results in
less reduction of hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia than GBP
does.^[32] Also, patients undergoing BPD show only temporary food
intake limitation; over time, their eating capacity is fully restored
or even increased,^[15] while blood glucose levels remain under
control.

Other Possible Mechanisms Responsible for Diabetes Control

To understand what the mechanism of diabetes control might be, we
should look at the anatomical and physiologic alterations that these
surgeries cause. GBP and BPD differ in terms of the volume of the
gastric remnant and the length of bowel exposed to the mixture of food
and biliopancreatic juices. However, these procedures have in common
the exclusion of duodenum and at least part of the jejunum from the
transit of food. This bypass has two obvious consequences: undigested
or incompletely digested food is presented early to the ileum, and the
duodenum and jejunum are excluded from the enteroinsular axis. Both
mechanisms suggest that the effect of GBP and BPD on diabetes is
mediated by a change in the pattern of secretion of gastrointestinal
hormones.

Pories et al provide one possible explanation.^[29] Their hypothesis
is that GBP (we would include BPD also) excludes the site responsible
for the production of the hormone causing type 2 diabetes. In their
model, the hyperinsulinemia in type 2 diabetes is the result of an
abnormal incretin signal from the gut, while the insulin resistance is
a secondary protective phenomenon.

Other explanations are possible. For example, a hormone overproduced
in the proximal foregut in diabetic patients might not directly
increase the production of insulin, as suggested by Pories et al, but
rather counteract the action of insulin, thus inducing insulin
resistance and only secondarily hyperinsulinemia. For instance, in
susceptible individuals, chronic exaggerated stimulation of the
proximal gut with fat and carbohydrates may induce overproduction of
an unknown factor that causes impairment of incretin production and/or
action, leading to insufficient or untimely production of insulin so
that glucose intolerance develops (Figs. 1 and 2). In our opinion, the
bypass of the duodenum and jejunum avoids this phenomenon, while the
early presentation of undigested or incompletely digested food to the
ileum may anticipate the production of hormones such as glucagon-like
peptide 1 (GLP1), further improving insulin action (Fig. 3).

VAT loss can be rapid with decreased intake even before any
significant weight loss.  For some folks, only a few ounces of VAT are
causing problems.

Actually, this section supports decreased food intake as the common
denominator for curing insulin resistance:

&quot;Gastroplasties do indeed improve glucose metabolism.&quot;

&gt; Someone asked about the effect of by pass surgery on diabetic symptoms
&gt; which occur long before weight loss:

&gt; &quot;Do you have any web sites where that is shown?&quot;

&gt; Most of it is in the scientific journals which are not usually available
&gt; in full on the web without subscription except in abstract form.  Below
&gt; is a cut and paste from one such article hitting the important points of
&gt; the topic:

&gt;    from Annals of Surgery

&gt; Possible Mechanisms of Action

&gt;    One might think that surgically induced weight loss and decreased food
&gt;    intake are the most reasonable mechanisms for remission of diabetes
&gt;    after surgery for obesity, but most reported series do not support
&gt;    this explanation.

&gt; Role of Weight Loss

&gt;    Most reported series show that return to euglycemia and normal insulin
&gt;    levels occur within days after surgery, long before there is any
&gt;    significant weight loss.^[15,24,25] In 1995, Pories et al^[24]
&gt;    reported the results of GBP in a series of 608 morbidly obese
&gt;    patients. Preoperatively, 146 patients were diabetic (type 2) and 152
&gt;    had impaired glucose tolerance. GBP achieved normal levels of plasma
&gt;    glucose, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin in 83% of diabetic
&gt;    patients and in 98.7% of patients with impaired glucose tolerance
&gt;    within 4 months after surgery, without the need for any diabetic
&gt;    medication or special diet, and before any weight reduction occurred.
&gt;    In 1998, Scopinaro et al^[15] reported normalization of glucose levels
&gt;    in 100% of their morbidly obese patients after BPD with no need for
&gt;    medication and on a totally free diet as early as 1 month after
&gt;    operation, when excess weight was still more than 80%. Hickey et
&gt;    al^[25] demonstrated significantly lower levels of fasting plasma
&gt;    glucose, plasma insulin, and serum leptins in a group of patients
&gt;    maintaining stable weight after GBP compared to a group of patients
&gt;    matched in weight, age, and percentage of fat who did not undergo
&gt;    surgery. A clinical case described in detail by Pories and
&gt;    Albrecht^[29] is instructive. This woman with a fasting blood glucose
&gt;    of 495 mg/dL despite daily administration of 90 units insulin
&gt;    underwent GBP. On the first day after surgery her blood glucose fell
&gt;    to 281 mg/dL and her insulin requirement was only 8 units. By day 6
&gt;    she no longer required insulin, and she subsequently remained
&gt;    euglycemic without insulin or other hypoglycemic agents on a regular
&gt;    diet for the following years.

&gt; Role of Decreased Food Intake

&gt;    If decreased food intake explains how the GBP and BPD procedures
&gt;    control diabetes, gastroplasties should be effective too, since these
&gt;    operations significantly lower food intake by reduction of gastric
&gt;    volume. Gastroplasties do indeed improve glucose metabolism,^[30,31]
&gt;    but there is no evidence for long-term cure of diabetes in morbidly
&gt;    obese patients. Furthermore, vertical banded gastroplasty results in
&gt;    less reduction of hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia than GBP
&gt;    does.^[32] Also, patients undergoing BPD show only temporary food
&gt;    intake limitation; over time, their eating capacity is fully restored
&gt;    or even increased,^[15] while blood glucose levels remain under
&gt;    control.

&gt; Other Possible Mechanisms Responsible for Diabetes Control

&gt;    To understand what the mechanism of diabetes control might be, we
&gt;    should look at the anatomical and physiologic alterations that these
&gt;    surgeries cause. GBP and BPD differ in terms of the volume of the
&gt;    gastric remnant and the length of bowel exposed to the mixture of food
&gt;    and biliopancreatic juices. However, these procedures have in common
&gt;    the exclusion of duodenum and at least part of the jejunum from the
&gt;    transit of food. This bypass has two obvious consequences: undigested
&gt;    or incompletely digested food is presented early to the ileum, and the
&gt;    duodenum and jejunum are excluded from the enteroinsular axis. Both
&gt;    mechanisms suggest that the effect of GBP and BPD on diabetes is
&gt;    mediated by a change in the pattern of secretion of gastrointestinal
&gt;    hormones.

&gt;    Pories et al provide one possible explanation.^[29] Their hypothesis
&gt;    is that GBP (we would include BPD also) excludes the site responsible
&gt;    for the production of the hormone causing type 2 diabetes. In their
&gt;    model, the hyperinsulinemia in type 2 diabetes is the result of an
&gt;    abnormal incretin signal from the gut, while the insulin resistance is
&gt;    a secondary protective phenomenon.

&gt;    Other explanations are possible. For example, a hormone overproduced
&gt;    in the proximal foregut in diabetic patients might not directly
&gt;    increase the production of insulin, as suggested by Pories et al, but
&gt;    rather counteract the action of insulin, thus inducing insulin
&gt;    resistance and only secondarily hyperinsulinemia. For instance, in
&gt;    susceptible individuals, chronic exaggerated stimulation of the
&gt;    proximal gut with fat and carbohydrates may induce overproduction of
&gt;    an unknown factor that causes impairment of incretin production and/or
&gt;    action, leading to insufficient or untimely production of insulin so
&gt;    that glucose intolerance develops (Figs. 1 and 2). In our opinion, the
&gt;    bypass of the duodenum and jejunum avoids this phenomenon, while the
&gt;    early presentation of undigested or incompletely digested food to the
&gt;    ileum may anticipate the production of hormones such as glucagon-like
&gt;    peptide 1 (GLP1), further improving insulin action (Fig. 3).

I wish our medical institutions would begin teaching our future
physicians the following truths:

&quot;Do not eat food produced by publicly traded corporations.
Remember,
large publicly traded companies are the enemy. They are
producing
food
that is genetically modified, loaded with chemicals, growth
hormones,
drugs, trans fats, and other ingredients specifically and
purposely
created to increase your appetite, get you chemically
addicted to the
food and make you fat.

You cannot trust any of the mass produced food they sell.
They are
using deceptive advertising techniques in their ads intended
to
trigger compulsive urges for their food.

Staying away from any brand name heavily advertised food is
the best
course of action.

Knowing that every publicly traded company large food company
will
use
deceitful and misleading tectniques and fancy food labels to
get us to
buy their products that damage our health and make us fat is
reason
enough to avoid supporting them and to avoid buying their
products.&quot;

I'm in a journey of loosing weight. Since I started, I'm finding out a
lot about nutrotion and the right foods to eat.  This should be taught
in our schools!

Our armchair dissembler by editing opined:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    but there is no evidence for long-term cure of diabetes in morbidly
&gt;    obese patients. Furthermore, vertical banded gastroplasty results
in
&gt;    less reduction of hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia than GBP
&gt;    does.^[32] Also, patients undergoing BPD show only temporary food
&gt;    intake limitation; over time, their eating capacity is fully
restored
&gt;    or even increased,^[15] while blood glucose levels remain under
&gt;    control.
">

&quot;Actually, this section supports decreased food intake as the common
denominator for curing insulin resistance:&quot;

&quot;Gastroplasties do indeed improve glucose metabolism.&quot;

Note the word &quot;less&quot; not included in the snip.

Actually, the entire article slams the view our dissembler asserts and
then he clings in desperation to a one line blurb that does not in the
least alter the whole of the rest of the article.  In by pass but not
banding the glucose change happens within days long before weight loss
because of a huge increase in incretins which does account for the
change in glucose control status.

Typical, saddly too often these days.

The two pound diet,aka 2 pd etc., is still trash science.

One can with complete peace of mind ignore the poster in this area and
have pity for his desperation.

God bless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You fail to specify which issue and other details where the rest of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    One might think that surgically induced weight loss and decreased food

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    this explanation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; [snip]

&gt; &gt; &gt; The arguments presented are not logical, since they ignore the effects
&gt; &gt; &gt; of small amounts of weight loss, which are known to be significant,
&gt; &gt; &gt; they mostly ignore and generally trivialise the very well known fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the effects of food intake restriction on BG levels are
&gt; &gt; &gt; immediate, and they ignore or trivialise the fact that surgical
&gt; &gt; &gt; removal of bits of the digestive system affects the efficiency of
&gt; &gt; &gt; digestion, i.e. has the same effect as eating less.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Whereas they focus with great emphasis on the reduction of hormonal
&gt; &gt; &gt; effects by the possible removal of hormone producing or absorbing
&gt; &gt; &gt; tissues.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, the extract inflates every argument in favour of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; particualr kind of surgery, and ignores or minimises every argument
&gt; &gt; &gt; against it. It reads like a rather biassed advertisement for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; benefits of a specific kind of surgery.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So you post an alleged extract from a scientific journal which only
&gt; &gt; &gt; tells half the story, you don't supply any reference anyone can check,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and you pretend that the full article is not freely available on the

A request for an example of the effect by pass surgery has on glucose
control was requested.  It was the easist to hand, not the only one.
There have been several such articles published pointing to the large
increase in incretin output that happens quickly long before significant
weight loss occurs and best explains the large change in glucose control
status that also happens quickly.  A few with the surgery have in fact
had problems with constant hypo glucose reactions.

I do follow this line of research and there is at present no model that
explains as much as well as does the incretin response given the levels
of glucose control change involved and the logic of the sequence with
which they appear.  If you have another I would be happy to consider it.

Your reaction taken as a whole and the questions you raise suggests you
are not familiar with this line of research and the related line of the
production and effects of native incretins in glucose control.  There
was never any attempt at a formal research presentation, just a friendly
response for a basic request for information.

Most likely all those additives only become relevant if one eats more
than two pounds so there is no reason for  our dear blessed

There really have been no deaths attributable to food additives.

Our GI tracts are wonderfully made to detoxify most things.

There is also the cytochrome P450 system.

When we give thanks for the food that GOD has provided and ask HIM in
prayer to bless that which HE has provided, we no longer believe that
what we are eating can possibly be harmful.

However, two verses from the Bible come to mind here:

&quot;Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to
your taste.&quot; (Proverbs 24:13)

&quot;He who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry even what is bitter
tastes sweet.&quot; (Proverbs 27:7)

May these verses help you with your concerns about the food you are
eating.

Be hungry... be healthy... be hungrier... be blessed:

&quot;Eat right and exercise&quot; is a mantra that was issued more than 10
years ago.

The fact that rates of obesity have accelerated since this mantra was
issued convinces us that it is false.

What we should have advised people to do from the outset to cure
obesity is:

&quot;Eat less:&quot;

&gt;          You cannot trust any of the mass produced food they sell.
&gt; They are
&gt;          using deceptive advertising techniques in their ads intended
&gt; to
&gt;          trigger compulsive urges for their food.

&gt;          Staying away from any brand name heavily advertised food is
&gt; the best
&gt;          course of action.

&gt;          Knowing that every publicly traded company large food company
&gt; will
&gt;          use
&gt;          deceitful and misleading tectniques and fancy food labels to
&gt; get us to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for subscription!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Possible Mechanisms of Action

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You fail to specify which issue and other details where the rest of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the article from which this alleged extract has been copied.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    One might think that surgically induced weight loss and decreased food
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    intake are the most reasonable mechanisms for remission of diabetes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    after surgery for obesity, but most reported series do not support
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    this explanation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [snip]

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The arguments presented are not logical, since they ignore the effects
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of small amounts of weight loss, which are known to be significant,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they mostly ignore and generally trivialise the very well known fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the effects of food intake restriction on BG levels are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediate, and they ignore or trivialise the fact that surgical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; removal of bits of the digestive system affects the efficiency of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digestion, i.e. has the same effect as eating less.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whereas they focus with great emphasis on the reduction of hormonal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effects by the possible removal of hormone producing or absorbing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tissues.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, the extract inflates every argument in favour of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particualr kind of surgery, and ignores or minimises every argument
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against it. It reads like a rather biassed advertisement for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; benefits of a specific kind of surgery.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So you post an alleged extract from a scientific journal which only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tells half the story, you don't supply any reference anyone can check,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and you pretend that the full article is not freely available on the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What's your game, &quot;tr ... @is.best.com&quot;?

&gt; &gt; &gt; His game is to pretend to be the truth.

&gt; &gt; I'm in a journey of loosing weight. Since I started, I'm finding out a

Dear Chris,

I believe it is a type-2 diabetic receiving &quot;lizard spit&quot; injections
to become more euglycemic (this would explain the incretin fixation).

One particular ASD'er comes to mind.

May GOD bless you in HIS mighty way making you healthier (hungrier)

I'm sorry brother, I should have been more clear...Aside from its
appearance in this passage, the origins of which are dubious, it is
the following idea that we do not see affirmed elsewhere in Scripture;
&quot;they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly
poison, it will not hurt them at all.&quot;

I certainly affirm that all the gifts are operative in this day...

&quot;Many expect that God will keep them from sickness
merely because they ask him to do so. But the prayers
of those who do not regard the laws of life, God cannot
answer, because their faith is not made perfect by works.
When we do all on our part to insure health, then we may
expect that good results will follow, and we can ask
God in faith to bless our efforts. And he will answer
our prayer, if his name can be glorified thereby. But let
all understand that they have a work to do. God will
not work in a miraculous manner to preserve the health of
persons who are, by their careless inattention to the laws
of health, taking a sure course to make themselves sick.&quot;

by a health reformer of the late 1800's

We have His life in us as we abide in and partake of Him....

Correct, the true mantra for stopping HIV infection is abstinence from
sexual relations except in marriage.

Truth is simple.

Oh, it's a simple enough question; I'm sure you can answer it
here, on the spot: was &quot;laying on of hands&quot; your method of
choice for your cardiology patients, and if so, did it cure
them after a single visit?

Let's see how &quot;bold&quot; you actually are.
