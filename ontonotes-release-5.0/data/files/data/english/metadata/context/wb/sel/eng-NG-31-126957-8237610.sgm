At least it's a clearly defined example of stupidity.

She seems to be talking about three cults;  Church of the Subgenius,
Heaven's Gate, and some third cult based on sex between children and
adults, and she talks about them more or less interchangeably.  She
doesn't seem to see any reason to differentiate between them since
they seem similar to her anyway.  She has only a vague idea about the
actual facts in the case but doesn't seem to see any reason to
differentiate between her vague, fuzzy impression and reality, despite
having it pointed out to her repeatedly that she is wrong about a lot
of details.

That's the great thing about being a christian I guess, you don't HAVE
to separate your vague prejudices and irrational impressions from
facts.  That's what FAITH is for.  Something doesn't have to make
sense for you to believe in it.

That was an interesting read!  I studied the entire thing and I really
learned a lot, particularly about what a woman wants.  If there is any

swords standing by, in case anyone didn't find this a likely
story.

That will be thirty merkin dollahs, for activating the
SubGenius Compulsive History Lesson-autist that lives in my
Corpus Calossum. I need them to buy somtehing, anything,
that will knock him out again.

&gt;&gt;  &quot;SubGenius recruitment has been especially dedicated among the ranks

&gt;&gt; disbelievers, blasphemers, pranksters, rebels, hackers, pornographers,

&gt;&gt; We have pornographers?  Have I just not met them yet? I mean I know we
&gt;&gt; have folks who do weird things with pornography, and we have some
&gt;&gt; pr0nographers.

&gt; Do we have many amateur nographers?

Sure. I can very easily make no graphs for no money.

She has ALMOST stumbled on the secret of the SubGeniuses!

She's kinda cute, if you get her to show her tits, be sure and let me

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At least it's a clearly defined example of stupidity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She seems to be talking about three cults;  Church of the Subgenius,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heaven's Gate, and some third cult based on sex between children and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adults, and she talks about them more or less interchangeably.  She
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't seem to see any reason to differentiate between them since
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they seem similar to her anyway.  She has only a vague idea about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actual facts in the case but doesn't seem to see any reason to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differentiate between her vague, fuzzy impression and reality, despite
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; having it pointed out to her repeatedly that she is wrong about a lot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of details.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's the great thing about being a christian I guess, you don't HAVE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to separate your vague prejudices and irrational impressions from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; facts.  That's what FAITH is for.  Something doesn't have to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense for you to believe in it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Whereas, say, Islam is based on empirical evidence?

&gt; &gt; In all fairness, Muslims don't believe in crucified men coming back to
&gt; &gt; life.  They just believe that they are going to get mad pussy in
&gt; &gt; heaven if they die in a really stupid way.  The first is idiocy
&gt; &gt; without purpose, the second is wishful thinking.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; I thought Muslims believed in Jesus too. They're always claiming to,
&gt; whenever they're in a bind.

&gt; Isn't Islam just Mohammed going up to Jews and Christians and saying,
&gt; &quot;Uh, yeah, your God talked to me, and said you should all follow me
&gt; now&quot;?
">

They believe he existed, but they don't believe that he was crucified
and rose again.  According to Islam Allah-1 (Slack be upon him)
switched Jesus with one of the men in the crowd.  Allah would be too
merciful to allow one of his followers to die such a terrible death.
Of course, it still really sucked for the poor sap who was crucified,
but hey, that's god for ya.

DAMN! It was just starting to get good. I should have saved it. She
had just started to believe the posts that suddenly started coming in
from ALCANDOR... And then suddenly, a day later, she erases the whole
thing from existence! Gosh, I wonder what could have horrified her so
much. It's almost as if something grossed her out more than the Church
of the SubGenius itself.
