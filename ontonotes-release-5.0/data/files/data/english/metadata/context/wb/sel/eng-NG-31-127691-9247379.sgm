*Chilling truth about Vietnam's boy fixation

*Straits Times/ANN
HaNoi, Oct. 22: Visitors to primary schools in Viet Nam often feel
chillingly uneasy to see rooms packed with boys. At a typical Ha
Noi kindergarten, teacher Nguyen Thi Thuy has noticed a rather dramatic
change over the past five years.
&quot;This year, my class has 25 children,&quot; said Thuy. &quot;Seventeen are boys and
only eight are girls. When the little boys grow up, most of them will not be
able to find a wife&quot;&quot;
A preference for sons has skewed birth ratios across Asia, especially in
China and India, but its sudden appearance in Viet Nam and the size of the
imbalance has stunned experts. Ten years ago, Vietnam's gender birth ratio
equalled the accepted international average of around 104 boys to 100 girls.

But over the past few years, in tandem with rising incomes and easier access
to clinics that determine foetal sex and conduct abortions, the number of
male births has raced ahead of female ones.
Already, the number of boys born in many regions of Vietnam exceeds those of
girls by 20 per cent or more.
Recent surveys by the Population, Family and Children Science Institute show
that the male-female ratio is as lopsided as 135 boys to 100 girls in some
districts.
Last month, Deputy Health Minister Nguyen Ba Thuy revealed that in the first
quarter of this year, 337,600 babies were born, of which 183,600 were boys
and 154,000 were girls, for a national ratio of about 118 boys to 100 girls.

The imbalance may worsen because the current lunar year of the golden pig
has raised hopes for sons to bring good fortune to families.
Vietnam has a two-child policy. Many couples try to have a boy as their
first-born, and then would not mind if their second child is a girl.
It is common to see couples with two sons, or a son and a daughter, but rare
to find those with two daughters.
It is now expected that the national gender ratio at birth may be as high as
120 boys to 100 girls this year.
Experts become uneasy when the boy-to-girl disparity hits a ratio of
106:100, but when it exceeds 110:100, alarm bells start ringing about
potentially calamitous long-term effects.
Said Mr Ian Howie, the United Nations Population Fund's Vietnam
representative: &quot;An imbalance of sexes fuels human trafficking and sexual
exploitation. It endangers economic development and increases social
instability as a growing population of men searches for partners.&quot;
He said skewed gender ratios occur when there is a strong preference for
sons, access to determining the sex of unborn babies and readily available
abortion services.

Dear CACC,

This is really alarming.  The imbalance will show dire consequences very
soon.  We need to educate people on gender equality and the serious social
consequences of imbalance of the sexes.

BTW, why the heck would someone prefer boy over girl, or girl over boy?  I
don't get it.  I have 2 daughters and no boy and I am perfectly happy.
What's the big deal?

Have a great day!

Hoanh

A Hoanh, wrote, &quot;... why the heck would someone prefer boy over girl, or

I'm sort of surprised to see you, A Hoanh, asking these questions. Or are
they rhetorical?  Anyway, think &quot;historical and current lack of social
security, pensions, insurance, etc&quot;.  Think of a nation where 80% of the
population is still in the agricultural sector, even while some small, young
percentage of the 20% of urbanites are trying to reconcile their info' age
careers' requirements, ethics and ideals with the ever-present ideals born
of economic priorities of the overwhelming mass of rural folk surrounding
them along with those born of the recent cultural histories of the older
members of their own families.

In traditional farming cultures, a parent's only social security is the
children they can keep in their own immediate family, and keep devoted to
the family's well-being as a priority beyond all others.  That means
strongly preferring boys to girls and constantly propagating &quot;family
values&quot;.

Even the post-industrial conservatives' mindset is still ultimately a
product of trying conserve rural values born of the basic economic
pragmatics inherited from an era before reliable social security existed.
It's older folks' subconscious survival strategy.

And looking back on my own words here, it comes to mind that the reasoning
above could well explain why the US remains basically more politically
conservative than Canada or most European nations, why the propaganda of
&quot;family values&quot; is still so much more prevalent in the US.  The US still
lacks a social security system that is widely expected to be reliable by the
time the majority, of baby boomers and the generation immediately after
them, are going to need it. And the Bush Admin' has undermined that system
even more, in favor of private investment favoring the micro-minority of the
mega-rich, not the vast majority who cannot expect to live off dividends for
the rest of their lives. Someone should look into this, see if such
propositions actually hold water...
