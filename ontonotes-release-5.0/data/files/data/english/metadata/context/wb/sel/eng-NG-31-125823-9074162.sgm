Folks,

Am I right in thinking that the Manchester - Glasgow services
currently run by VXC will shortly be going to Transpennine Express? If
so, what stock will they be using? I get the first Manchester -
Glasgow train in the morning most weeks (07:41 from Lockerbie) and
even with a 4 coach Voyager it's often fairly busy, though not
packed.

It will be TPE, and they will use 185s - which have very nearly as many
seats as a 4-car Voyager, but no shop, and only one disabled toilet and one
standard toilet.

It will be the 3 car 185's. They may have a slower top speed but they
do have marginally quicker acceleration.]

HOWEVER the 0741 from Lockerbie (1S31 0458 Manchester Piccadilly -
Glasgow Central) will be operated by Virgin West Coast until December
2008 and will be a 5 car Super Voyager.

A quick comparison of the NR journey planner shows no real difference to end

In fact the longest journey time each day for the next year will be
the Virgin 04.58 Manchester - Glasgow as the likelihood of overnight
engineering overrunning has meant Network Rail adding a large amount
of padding into the timetable.

TPE are well aware of the limited space on the 185s apart from the
seating and have made this very clear to DfT (I heard this being
explained to Tom Harris last week whilst he was sat on a 185..). The
case has been made for 4th vehicles, at no expense to the DfT, but
currently the government is still saying &quot;no&quot;....

From memory, the maximum speed is 110, but only with tilt. It was apparently
thought that, although 125 was possible in places, the amount of extra
energy used meant it wasn't worthwhile. The 185s will only be allowed
whatever the non tilt limit is, or of course 100 if the line limit is over
that figure.

I hope the Doc manages to appreciate the engine noise and riding
characteristics of the 185s.

There's an EPS maximum of 125, and 110 without tilt, I'm pretty sure.
But this (whether the 185s' higher acceleration will allow them to
match Voyager schedules etc) has been discussed in endless threads
already.

I have travelled on both of these trains (£1 MegaTrain, thank you), they use

It's not so much the top speeds as the ability to keep up reasonably
high speeds over Shap and Beattock. Electric trains have no problem

The Platform 5 book shows the same engine, a Cummins QSK19 rated at
560kW(750hp) in both trains, but at 2100 rpm in the Desiro, 1800 rpm in the
Voyager. Desiro 163t, Voyagers (220) 185t, (221) 276t.  HOpe that helps, but
all the indications from the timetables, post Dec 07 and the proposed Dec 08
suggests they can keep to Voyager timings, and the DfT have obviously
convinced themselves its true, cos they've mentioned it in one of their many
WCML documents...

Worse, the 185 is almost as heavy as the 221 with all its extra bits needed
for tilt.

I do hope that Ian Walmsley gives a suitably adverse opinion of this weight
bloat next time Modern Railways lets him. I'd hate to think that someone in
such a prominent industry position is just complaining about Voyagers.

Ah - but the 185 is a full UK loading gauge item, not a pygmy special
for those who specialise in limb contortion on long journeys.

Perhaps that accounts for some of the difference

I am quite looking forward to the removal of the Voyager fleet from
Manchester to Glasgow, full size seats, no smelly toilets, just a
shame we have to keep them for Southampton - but I suppose it makes
you appreciate the QE2 more when you get there!

The real scandal in all this is that after billions in public money
has been spent on the upgrade to 125mph not to mention the years of
disruption, still ongoing, the reality is that the DfT are
increasingly getting away with specifying services to run at 100mph
without anyone holding them to account for this monumental wastage.

So, for more than the cost of a brand new North - South TGV we now get
Manchester - Scotland at 100mph, Birmingham - Liverpool at 100mph,
Trent Valley - London at 100mph (via Northampton) and Manchester -
Birmingham at 110mph.

Worst of all consideration is being given to new 110mph trains for
Birmingham - London to free up Pendolinos for elsewhere.

I'm sorry but someone should be shot for this and it can only make you
wonder how typical this sort of value for money is when we are
throwing endless billions times billions at the NHS and education.

Perhaps not.

The 185 shouldn't be much heavier than a 170 or 175 - extra engine and
cooler group weight. But it is. A lot.

Given the seriously bad vibration that comes through into the 185 passenger
saloon, it might not be just the other manufacturers' products that fall to
bits.

The 185 is not a good unit. Herr Siemens has produced some reasonable EMUs -
although SWT are still not getting the expected availability - but the
diesel sets vibrate badly and ride like pigs.

This reminds me a little of Cravens: their DMUs were pretty bad, but the A
stock for LT is still going strong after 45 years.

No, Neil, the sets are just overweight. Quality does not enter.

The 185s are rather over-powered beasts and will take the hills in their
stride. They barely notice the climb out of Huddersfield. In the
acceleration stakes they beat the Voyagers and I reckon they could hold
their own against a Pendolino. As an illustration - I've timed one
starting from Northallerton southbound over on the ECML (125mph line
speed) and it hit the ton in 52 seconds.

I can't imagine Ariva will bother with tilt full stop.

Firstly they will be losing most of their tilting Voyagers to WC.

Then for most of their remaining network where 125mph running is
allowed it's without tilt.

The only part of the network utilising tilt is Birmingham - Manchester

So people keep posting - but VXC were using tilt on the Cherwell Valley line
before the WCML, and as far as I am aware still were. But because they don't
guarantee 221s or 220s to particular services, the 'clockface' timetable
works for both. So it was always a waste of money...
