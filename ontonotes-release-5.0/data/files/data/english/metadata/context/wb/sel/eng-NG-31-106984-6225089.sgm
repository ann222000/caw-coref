Hi,
I am new here and don't know my way around the site yet.
I have been on odsp for quite some time now,10 years or more.
I am wondering what happens when one of us gets married.
I know if two odsp clients get married the cheque goes into the name
of the client who has been a client longer. Or when a married couple
one on odsp and the other becomes disabled the cheque goes into the
persons name already recieving odsp support. But what happens when you
marry someone who is not an odsp recipient and Is working full time ?
I hope someone can help me with this question. It seems that I have
only come across one worker willing to disclose all and that was in
another city. I wish I could remember his name I would call or try to
see him for this information.
Thanks
ROBOT

You will be called in for an interview and they will look at your spouse's
income - if it's over a certain amount, you will be cut off ODSP. If it's
under the threshold, then the ODSP cheque will be in your name, and his
income will be subject to the same deductions (50%) as yours would if you
were working.

Hi Rosie,
Thanks for your input, I  appreciate it very much, but what exactly
do you mean by "his income will be subject to the same deductions
(50%) as yours would if you were working." I don't understand what you
are saying here. You aren't saying that ODSP will deduct 50% 0f what ?
from his pay are you ? I don't see how they can if he is not on ODSP ?
Do you mean his normal deductions are all that apply here ?And does
anyone know what their threshold is ?
I hope I don't seem thick about this.
Thanks
ROBOT

if you are getting married, ODSP will deduct 50% of anything he makes
working, does not matter if he is not the one with the ODSP and you have to
report that he is living there if you are married.  No way around that.  he
would be included in the benefit unit and all income of the benefit unit is
considered.  SO if the 50% he keeps  is more than your check that would be
the threshold.  Example, say check is 784 you make 1600 a month.  You keep
800 of the 1600 that is more than the check is to begin with so you would be
over the threshold.  Im only using those figures as thats what I got when
working at startek and was on the ow system as ow also loses the 50% they
just don't get the extra $100

Yes, they will deduct 50% of his net earnings, which is what they do when an
ODSP recipient and/or their spouse works. He will also get the $100 work
benefit. So, he will keep 50% plus $100 is what it works out to.  The
threshold, from what I was told when I inquired at our local office about
it, is that you will stay on ODSP as long as after the deductions are taken,
you still get a cheque from them. So, for instance, if (to use round
numbers) you get $1000 on ODSP and you or your spouse makes $1900 a month,
they will take $950 leaving you with a $50 ODSP cheque. (As a couple, you
would have more, though) I'm not sure if they allow for the $100 work
benefit or not.

ROBOT,
Getting married would lead to ODSP creating a new benefit unit
now comprised of both you and your new husband.  This benefit
unit can would be about $1,450 (or something, Brian can give
the exact amount), depending on whether or not you are paying
the maximum in shelter, etc.

Then your husband works and earns money.  Every time he earns
a net dollar (after deductions), you lose fifty cents from your
$1,450 ODSP cheque.  Every month, your new husband has any
earnings, you will also get an extra $100 "work related" benefit
on your cheque.  If he makes enough money, where deducting
50% of his net income adds up to a negative figure from your
$1,450 (or whatever), then you will cease to be eligible for ODSP.

I hope this is clear.  If you still have difficulty, you can email me
at browne200 ... @yahoo.com and I can give examples and so
forth.  Okay?

abrowne,Rosie,Darryn
Thank you so much that is much clearer and I understand a lot more. I
really appreciate the three of you giving me a clearer view of all of
this.
It sure doesn't seem to matter which way we turn they take from us.
Who wants to have to go to their spouse and say "Hey hon can I have
$50. to buy you a birthday present ?"
Thanks for making this all so much clearer for me.
Hugs ROBOT

What you will lose is privacy. If there is any way your future spouse
can support you without ODSP, I'd go for it and he can claim you at
year's end with Rev. Canada. You will be accounting to ODSP if his
income changes, be it a raise, a bonus. Considering how income is
calculated, and the invasion of your privacy, the stripping of your
rights, it may not be worth claiming ODSP.  Or, keep him as a
boyfriend and maintain separate addresses.  No one says he can't have
a sleep-over.
