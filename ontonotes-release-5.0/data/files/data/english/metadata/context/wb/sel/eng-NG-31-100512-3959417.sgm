Hey guys,

I just purchased a 2003 Honda Accord LX Sedan Automatic and moved to
Colorado Springs.

Loaded down with all of my personal belongings, I got 32mpg during the
770 mile drive from Dallas.  This was fine with me.

During the first few weeks that I was here, my driving was evenly split
between city, small highway (55mph) and mountain driving.  I averaged
24mpg.

Determined to do better, I committed to keep the TAC under 3,000 for
the entire volume of gas in the newly-filled tank.  I just filled it up
last night and did the calculation.  22mpg.

My eyes are crossing...

Almost all of my driving for this past tank has been city driving.  I
have not been an A/C fiend, and I shift into Neutral and coast downhill
rather than let the engine do it.  I take my time getting places and I
don't jackrabbit starts or stops.

What am I doing wrong?  Or does Colorado just suck?  Is my expectation
of 25mpg city driving unreasonable?

Yes it is, especially considering your altitude and mountainous terrain.

EPA estimates on the V-6 Accord are 21 city, 30 highway.  In your
driving conditions, anything over the EPA city number is a good result
for city driving.

It's illegal to shift into neutral when going downhill, in some
juristictions. It's for a couple of good reasons. Don't do it.

The altitude should not affect mileage. (Empirical evidence of this is my 91
Civic: Got 40 mpg at sea level for several months. Still getting 40 mpg at a
mile high altitude, late spring through fall.)

Driving in mountainous terrain may be the problem.

The car is two years old, though. It is about due for a tuneup. Have you had
one done recently? Check your owner's manual. It may specify new

fuel filter
air filter
plugs

at a minimum.

Much of the speed reduction when going downhill is achieved by taking
your foot off the gas and letting the engine do the "brake" work.  By
putting the transmisison in neutral, you have to rely entirely on
your braking system, risking rapid overheating of the brakes.
Overheated brakes work very poorly, leaving you open to destruction.

The lower octane gas in the Rocky Mountain states is appropriate for the
altitude.

I doubt the lower octane affects fuel mileage.

I hadn't considered that. The altitude has the same effect as not opening
the throttle all the way, so lower octane works fine.

apart from the very obvious danger of what you describe, coasting in
neutral also /raises/ gas consumption on an injected car.  if the ecu
sees no throttle above a certain rev, it assumes coasting mode and shuts

coasting in neutral could arguably save gas on a carburetted engine so
that's probably where this bad practice arose, but for injected engines,
absolutely leave it in gear all the time.

you're in reformulated gas territory, which probably means lower calorie

Not to mention that it will cause worse gas milage. Modern fuel-injected
engines shut off fuel flow when decelerating, but have to maintain
fuel flow for the engine to idle.

Hello,
Great post. I just wanted to add that it's a bad habit to get into. I
doubt that it saves any gasoline. In addition, it adds more "wear" to the
transmission. In other words, your transmission will wear out quicker if
you shift into neutral every time you go downhill.

We've just had a past that states it saves on carb cars, but not,

despite the fact that the poster only considered immediate
consumption, and not the increased downhill speeds and its

following the slope.

I'm intrigued though, by your asertation that being in neutral puts
INCREASED wear on a transmission, since it was my understanding that
since it would ahve no load, and not be spun beyond the rated ranges
(in all probability slowly, depending on gearbox design), that it
wouldn't increase wear, but instead decrease it.

for the clutch packs, slipping in &amp; out of neutral is more use than they
would experience in coasting, hence it can cause more wear.  less of a
deal on the honda, and completely irrelevent in the face of the safety
arguments however!  either way, there's no justification for coasting in
neutral.

For this to work as you say, you'd need the following to happen
badly ventilated/cooled brakes.
constant application of brakes
weakened brake lines
under-spec brake fluid

Any of these would occur in any sudden deceleration from a high speed
(such as an emergency stop on the highway) and be in all probablility
more fatel then.

Modern brakes are designed to cope with small aplication loads for
longer periods of time. Many car manufacturers do these kinds of
manouvers as tests in their brake systems, to prevent precisely this
from happening. /whats more, its the very first fade test. Were you
then to take the car on a long winding downhill run from the mountains
you'd have a lot more heat buildup in your brakes, and a lot greater
application of wear, having heaier repeated applications of the
brakes, with a lower ventilation speed.

You're also on the assumption tha when coasting, people ride the brake
instead. you know, i've never done that. if i coast, i don't then ride
the brake, instead i'll make a check application, every so often.

As for the 'not in full control' argument, again, thats from the 50's
and 60's before the advent of the nice modern synchromesh. For an
avoidance measure, engine power or no will make no difference. For
stopping, your braking speed is limitedby the static friction lmiit of
the vehicles tyres. In fact, you're not having to brake the rotational
inertia of the engine and connected gearbox componants, so you're
ahead there too. The only way i can see the engine being of any
benefit is if you ahve to go FASTER, or a 90dergee+ oversteer

Please tell me what law you're speaking of, and what jurisdiction you're
referring to.  There is no such reference in the US Code (federal law).

Although I've found one place that indicates that there is such a law in
British Columbia, that forum points out that each province makes its own
laws.  I found a reference to a California law and a Texas law as well,
so wherever this guy is (looks like Florida), he may be covered, he may
not.  In either event, simply saying coasting is illegal generally is
incorrect.

I'm not arguing that the brakes will generate more heat. I did not at
any time say that. however, brake fading is only an issue in modern
brakes if the temperature goes over a certain temperature. The amount
of fade, and the temperature at which it occurs is variable depending
on the brake type/composition. For instance, brakes in a Formula 1 car
INCREASE in braking abaility as they get hotter, until they actually
burn. there is virtually no fade. They get hot, they get better, they
get too hot, they burn, they dissapear, but it takes a GREAT deal of
heat to burn the,.

I saw some test figures from the development of the Lotus Elise some
10 years ago. They tested the vehicle on an extreme downhill section
of the Alps, at racing constions, and found less than 1% fade. Those
are two clear examples that countradict your blanket assertions.
Modern brakes do not decrease in retardation ability in direct
relationship to their temperature, and haven't for many years.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2. you can easily have constant application of brakes.  you're never

So, i can't pick when i'm going to coast? My gearbox has a life of its
own?

What it seems you fail to distinguish here is the difference between
coasting on ALL slopes, regardless of grade, and only doing so where
needed. I will give you two examples from here in Georgia - thers a
series of hills on US19 betwen thomaston and zebulan, they're not
steep gradients, and quite long, i will often coast down them. no
brakes needed, except for the occasioanl momentary check-brake as my
speed rises too high (the southmost slope is by the county line, and
often deputies will hide there checking for speeders).  The second
example is a hill much further north - Barnes Mill Road, in Marietta
(just off the 120 loop by exit 265 of I75) a much steeper slope, of
about 1 mile in length, where not only do you keep  it in gear, but
have to use your brakes over aout 40% of it. Gradent of the second is
about double that of the first. no-one is suggesting its an 'all or
nothing', and i for one certainly haven't. its you that suggesting
that in all situations, in all circumstances, you're risking life and
limb

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;3. brake lines deteriorate with age!  fact.

Certainly, and if a brake line was to go, it'd be more likely under
the greater heat and pressure of a high speed emergency deceleration,

at all, see above.

fraid not. go look up some test results, there is no direct
corrolation between fade and temperature on modern brakes. no straight
line graph that starts with retardation ability being at max when the
temperature is some 'cold point' that we should take to be air ambent
temp, with retardation ability dropping in direct response to
temperature increase. There is instead a gradual decrease from the
brak systems optimal temperature (whichis NOT air ambient) to the 'max
operating' and then a more rapid decrease.

prior to the synchromesh, when changing gear, entering a gear etc. -
it was neccesary to adjust the engine speed to match, to select the
gear, and so on. with a synchromesh, its easy to put the car in any
gear suitable for the speed of the vehicle. That was the basis of the
original 'loss of control' arguments - you had no near-immediate

how does engine braking work to increase safety?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; For
&gt;&gt; stopping, your braking speed is limitedby the static friction lmiit of
&gt;&gt; the vehicles tyres.

&gt;only if the brakes can supply sufficient friction.  if they're toast,
&gt;you can have the best tires in the world, but they won't mean a damned
&gt;thing to stop you running into that kid that's just kicked their ball
&gt;into the road.
">

ok, so let me get your argument straight. engine braking is required
because its unsafe to coast. Its unsafe to coast because everyone that
does so, does so with badly adjusted and maintained brakes, and
insists on riding those brakes to the point of failure whilst
coasting. thus when there is an emergency, the small engine
retardation effect is then VITAL to stop the car.

I did some tests this adrernoon, using two automatic vehicles, using
an old airstrip here. I weighted things in your favour, by using older
vehicles (which would have brakes more liekly to fade, and have worn
brake systems - a 87 caravan, and an 88 civic. one big car, one little
car. Unfortunatly, both are automatics, but on the upside, they have
drum brakes with cable-operated handbrakes.

I used a speed of 50mph, and attempted a stoping manouver with ONLY
engine braking, so as to measure the braking distance, which can then
be compaired to a standaised figure, such as ohh, the UK DOT standard
braking distances ( http://www.highwaycode.gov.uk/09.htm at the bottom)

the civic with its 4speed autom box, with me manually downshifting
managed to slow to 8mph in 450ft, and wouldn't slow any further. on
the second run, engaging the handbrake at 20mph reduced the vehicle to
8mph in 420ft and to a stop in 460.
The caravan, with a 3lv6, and 3sp auto, slowed to 9mph in 390ft, and
stopped in 430ft with the handbrake application. (well, foot activated
parking brake)

by constrast, the UK figures show the braking distance to be a total
of 120ft, INCLUDING THINKING DISTANCE - not a factor since it was a
pre-planned stop

When you admit you have ceased to speed on a regular basis, then you might

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Much of the speed reduction when going downhill is achieved by taking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your foot off the gas and letting the engine do the &quot;brake&quot; work.  By
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;putting the transmisison in neutral, you have to rely entirely on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your braking system, risking rapid overheating of the brakes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Overheated brakes work very poorly, leaving you open to destruction.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whilst yes, that was the case in the 60s, not since the late 70s at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the latest has this even been an issue. A semi, comming down a

&gt;&gt;&gt;For this to work as you say, you'd need the following to happen

&gt;&gt;&gt;constant application of brakes

&gt; I'm not arguing that the brakes will generate more heat. I did not at
&gt; any time say that. however, brake fading is only an issue in modern
&gt; brakes if the temperature goes over a certain temperature. The amount
&gt; of fade, and the temperature at which it occurs is variable depending
&gt; on the brake type/composition. For instance, brakes in a Formula 1 car
&gt; INCREASE in braking abaility as they get hotter, until they actually

not really. depends on the hill, the situation, my speed, the speed of

noted previously, on the hills i coasted down (LEGALLY) yesterday, the
brakes were not used at all, and the engine was not put back into gear
until a mile after the last hill, when my speed 'boost' from coasting
had diminished.

&gt;really. then why is it, after 6 heavy braking runs, one after another

&gt;a 4 wheel lockup on demand. 6 times I'd dumped excessive amounts of
&gt;heat, with little ventalation cooling into the brakes (6 stops from
&gt;50mph to 0mph, with the resulting lack of airflow over the brakes that
&gt;comes with motion) and they hadn't faded. This was both vehicles. No
&gt;standard pads, both vehicles at their standard weights, a bit over if
&gt;anything, what with the car seats, vcr, tools+fluids in the van, and
&gt;200lb of batteries in the back of the civic (lots of lovely hawker
&gt;SBS30's- never know when they'll come in handy). They were hot, yes,
&gt;faded, no. Both vehicles had standard pads, regular ones from
&gt;autozone, civic's changed in december (all 4, plus master cylinder)
&gt;and the caravans in march (front only, plus master cyl). Lovely and
&gt;humid here too, so when i check the fluid levels, you can be sure they
&gt;get some moisture from the air. Brake lines are original, but don't
&gt;appear to have any cracks. Heavy loads, lots of heat, possibly wet
&gt;brake fluid, not-new pads, still NO FADE. perhaps you ought to rethink
&gt;your theory somewhat. I could even probably work out for you the
&gt;approximate brake temps after the first run, if you really wanted. I'm
&gt;sure that would be 'hot enough' for you.
">

Ok, i just spent the last half hour or so getting some figures to
match to my facts.

The difference in values for the figures for a fast emergency stop to
zero, and for riding the brakes was even greater than i thought. and
to vastly simplify the maths (so i comfortably got the entire set of
calculations on s single sheet of paper, i even made many assumptions
in your favour. Lets see them brakes burn!.

I'm using for the vehicle, my 88 honda civic DX - partly since its
relevent, this being a honda group, but also because i had the figures
for it to hand, unlike the caravan, and its been so much longer since
its brake service (which plays to you)

Mass, approximatly 1000KG (2200lb) Its about right, and makes a nice
easy figure for calculations. for the rapid braking, i'll use the
50mph distance from yesterday, but attribute itt o a speed of 55mph -
eases to your argument, since its more energy dumped into the brakes,
and saves me calculating too many values. For the 'coasting and riding
your brakes' which i'll call 'coasting' now, I used the model of the
hill on US19 that i've previously mentioend. cresting the hill at
55mph, in gear the engine braking keeps the speed at 55mph, or
thereabouts, unchecked it gets to about 65mph, in the distances of
about 1 mile. Thus, i'll call the difference in KE between 55mph and
65mph (now see why i picked 55mph as the speed for the braking
distance above) as the amount dumped into the brakes, or engine going
down a hill.

Kinetic energy: (1/2 Mv^2)
brake - 0.5 x 1000 x 24.5872^2 (using meters/sec)
=  302,265.2 J
coast - 0.5x 1000 x 29.6576^2 - 302265.2
= 422172.05 - 302265.2
= 119,906.85 J

Hmm, the coast energy is only just over 1/3 the brake energy. Oh dear,
not looking good for your argument...

Lets see about how much energy per second is put into the brakes per
second. I'm assuming, of course, that the vehicle only has front
brakes. Again, simplifies for me, and is biased towards your claims.

assuming a linear speed decrease - it isn''t, i know, but as its a
quadratic decrease, divide it by your straight line assertation of
brake performance decrease with temp,a nd it comes to a near linear
line

55-0 mph in 100ft is a time of 2.47sec. 55mph to cover 1 mile is 65.44
seconds.
joules per second works out as
brake - 302265.2 / 2.47 = 122374.57 J/s
coast - 119906.85 / 65.4 = 1832.3174

Hang on, notice something there? in one second, the emergency stop has
absorbed more energy than over the entire run of the coast. Odd...

Now, i mentioned temperature just before. how hot will it get? Again,
for simplicity, all the energy is going into heating the brake discs
only. There is NO cooling effect allowed for. This HEAVILY favours
your arguments, and this is where you win through, clearly. The weight
of each brake disc for a honda civic is 10lb, or 4.54Kg. The specific
heat capacity of cast iron is 460J/Kg/K - or, in other words, for
every 460J of energy put into it, 1Kg of cast iron will be raised 1
Kelvin (or 1 Centrigrade) in temperature. Lets dump those energies in,
shall we? Remember, 2 discs, (or rotors if you will) so 9.08kg

lets see then
brake - (302265.2 / 9.08) / 460 = 72.36K rise.
coast - (119906.85 / 9.08) / 460 = 28.70K rise.

Lets say the ambient temperature here in georgia was 90F, or 32.2C. We
add those figures, and what do we get?

brake - 104.2C - 219F
coast - 60.9C - 141F

look att hat, If we used water as our brake fluid, assuming it was run
right onto the disc, it would have boiled.

What are the boiling points for brake fluid?
acording to govt. specs, the WET boiling point of DOT3 brake fluid
(3.7% h2O by vol) is 284F - significantly higher than the maximum
possible temperature of any braking componant in these tests.

in short, your claims and assertations are utter bullshit. I've given
the amth, worked it through. Where i've had to approximate, i've done
so heavily biased in your direction (front brakes only, no cooling,
all temperature udmped into one comonant only) and even then they were
a ways away from failure point. As I said, only very badly maintained
brakes would fail the way you claim happens, and only then if you
heavily ride the brakes as you coast, and if that were to happen,
you'd be a lot more fucked if you had to do any kind of emergency
stop. Just as an aside, any ideas what sort of speed that coast energy
figure represents? just 35mph. So, a car that has the braking from
35mph spread over a mile and still has brake failure - sounds like
you've got a lot of problems there.

thats the brake failure utterly annihilated, even for your claims that
you have to be riding the brakes. AS for 'full control' - the only two
manouvers, as i've said before now, is aceleration (which was what you
were trying to counter with your engine braking anyway) and to correct
rear wheel skids. anything else you do NOt want the application of
power, and thus having the engine connected to the wheels is
meaningless.

hope i've enlightened you with how things actually, numerically work
in the real world, or even in heavily biased 'jim beam world'. If you
can prove any factual, or numerical problems with my figures, then go
ahead, if not, why not act like a man for onec, and actual admit you
were wrong.

Whats more to say, the maths is there. Its broken down simply. Its
heavily biased towards your degrees, and it STILL doesn't come close
to your predictions of doom.

Taken a car, made it stop from a faster speed, using front brakes
only, eliminated cooling, eliminated heat dissipation, eliminated heat
spread, and its still only equating a 35mph stop.

you're talking shit. If you can disprove the maths, do so. You can't
get more 'tech stuff' than simple mathematics and physics. You know,
energy calculations. I'm Kinda busy at work myself too - you know, got
car designs to work on, funnily  enough, i start work ona  braking
system on thursday. The maths though i purposefully kept simple, just
so you could follow it - took me less than half an hour, start to
finish, and that included getting references. Any website you care to
try and use, as a reference will actually detract from your argument.
theyll point out heat dissipation, ablation energy disipation, thermal
transference, ventilation and all those other things which DROP the
temperature of the brakes from the peak temp.

None of this matters though, as you still claim that riding your
brakes as a check speed causes excessive heat buildup and failure. As
i more than amply demonstrated, all things being equal, the braking
energy required to keep a vehicle at a speed when it would normally go
faster is insignificant in reference to any form of sudden stop. in
short you say that putting 1832J of energy into a braking ssytem per
second leads to failure - equivilent to a stop of 2mph.

You'd best get back to work though, must be time for you to change all
the oil at the McD's you work at. You sure as hell don't work in any
technologically related field.

Factually incorrect in many areas. A good example was the MMC piece,
which is WAY off the mark. The MMc brakes didn't require a high
temperatureand ran cooler, due to the differing method of ablation
used. The manufacturer is still very much in operator (and theres not
just one, there's many) the reason for the change was for reasons of
cost. The first few thousand were done 'cheap' but after the initally
licensed 2000 sets, the full costs were passed onto lotus. Hence after
chassis number 3700-ish, they switched perminantly back to cast iron
discs. Oh yeah, there was also some question of wet operational
ability.

Drum brakes, utterly irrelevent. Thermal masses and mass ratios, plus
heat dissipation figures are massivly different to those of disc
brakes. Also, unless i'm very much mistaken, drum brakes haven't
provided more than about 40% of braking ability in any vehicle made in
the last 30 years.

in short, what little research you have done has turned up one usefull
page, which is basically a thermal buildup animation, with no
accompanying data. Thus whilst it is contributory, and shows how the
heat builds up, it doesn't explain under what conditions this buildup
of heat over time occurs. Persoanlly, i'm betting its a static jig, as
in no ventilation. Again, we'll wait and see.

first, for this to be a safe vehicle, you have to assume max gross

this is way off.  the "coast" is the energy difference.  you're not
trying to calculate the energy dissipated by just drifting along, you're
trying to calculate how much difference engine braking makes to brake
temperature.

per the above, if the engine is not braking the car, you need to

that's true, for one single stop, from cold.  here's where we get to the
point, and where your water tank analogy comes in: you don't just
operate a brake once.  for example, like my descent of filbert st,
coming to a halt at each stop sign.  each time you brake, you "fill the
tank".  particularly if you're at mgvw.  now we need to figure out how
quickly is the heat "leaving the tank"?  in other words, to what already
existing disk temp are you now adding your delta T?  you want to take a
shot at the heat dissipation rate?  [hint: it's /less/ than the heating
rate.]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; in short, your claims and assertations are utter bullshit. I've given
&gt; the amth, worked it through. Where i've had to approximate, i've done
&gt; so heavily biased in your direction (front brakes only, no cooling,
&gt; all temperature udmped into one comonant only) and even then they were
&gt; a ways away from failure point. As I said, only very badly maintained
&gt; brakes would fail the way you claim happens, and only then if you
&gt; heavily ride the brakes as you coast, and if that were to happen,
&gt; you'd be a lot more fucked if you had to do any kind of emergency
&gt; stop. Just as an aside, any ideas what sort of speed that coast energy
&gt; figure represents? just 35mph. So, a car that has the braking from
&gt; 35mph spread over a mile and still has brake failure - sounds like
&gt; you've got a lot of problems there.
">

ok, let's get to the links i posted.

if you'd bothered to scroll to the bottom of this page:
http://www.whnet.com/4x4/brakepads.html
you'd see this:
http://www.whnet.com/4x4/pix/hot_brake.jpg

that looks remarkably like a disk that's exceeded 176C to me.  how could
that possibly be?  [rhetorical].  easy, multiple brake applications that
"fill the tank", just like the one i described to you for filbert st.

and let's look at this:
http://www.e-z.net/~ts/ts/Brakfade.htm
that graphic shows brake fade.  you try to assert it's "irrelevant"
because it happens to mention drums, not disks.  that's an
extraordinarily incorrect statement considering that the friction
material and the drum material in both systems is identical and their
friction characteristics are temperature dependent in exactly the same way.

disks don't get hot?  from:
http://encyclopedia.laborlawtalk.com/disc_brake
we have:
http://encyclopedia.laborlawtalk.com/Image:1901.jpg
now, that's a stretch because it's a racing car driven to the limit, but
the disks still look warm to me.  [i initially included the article for
the carbon disk discussion, since you raised them.]

finally, from:
http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~jbarber/animation.html
we have the animated disk warming measurement where delta T is shown
settling at 236C after peaking at 242C.  this exceeds your worse case
scenario, and still does not approach the temperatures seen in the links
i've just posted.  did you notice hot the temp rise starts at 98C?
that's only possible if the time for heat dissipation to ambient is
somewhat slower than the period to brake re-application, i.e. real world
usage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; thats the brake failure utterly annihilated, even for your claims that
&gt; you have to be riding the brakes. AS for 'full control' - the only two
&gt; manouvers, as i've said before now, is aceleration (which was what you
&gt; were trying to counter with your engine braking anyway) and to correct
&gt; rear wheel skids. anything else you do NOt want the application of
&gt; power, and thus having the engine connected to the wheels is
&gt; meaningless.

&gt; hope i've enlightened you with how things actually, numerically work
&gt; in the real world, or even in heavily biased 'jim beam world'. If you
&gt; can prove any factual, or numerical problems with my figures, then go

now, to be fair, i acknowledge that your opinion may be colored by your
never having experienced brake fade, particularly if you live in
flatlands that surround airfields and drive a well-braked car like a
lotus elise, but to say fade does not happen is simply incorrect.

let's just re-state some facts for the record:

1. fade can and does happen.

2. brake heating is exacerbated by not taking advantage of engine braking.

3. fade is partly dependent on brake materials.

Oh, naturally, i 'get them' in the sense that i ut them on a piece of
paper, and work them out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The difference in values for the figures for a fast emergency stop to
&gt;&gt; zero, and for riding the brakes was even greater than i thought. and
&gt;&gt; to vastly simplify the maths (so i comfortably got the entire set of
&gt;&gt; calculations on s single sheet of paper, i even made many assumptions
&gt;&gt; in your favour. Lets see them brakes burn!.

&gt;&gt; I'm using for the vehicle, my 88 honda civic DX - partly since its
&gt;&gt; relevent, this being a honda group, but also because i had the figures
&gt;&gt; for it to hand, unlike the caravan, and its been so much longer since
&gt;&gt; its brake service (which plays to you)

&gt;&gt; Mass, approximatly 1000KG (2200lb) Its about right, and makes a nice
&gt;&gt; easy figure for calculations. for the rapid braking, i'll use the
&gt;&gt; 50mph distance from yesterday, but attribute itt o a speed of 55mph -
&gt;&gt; eases to your argument, since its more energy dumped into the brakes,
&gt;&gt; and saves me calculating too many values. For the 'coasting and riding
&gt;&gt; your brakes' which i'll call 'coasting' now, I used the model of the
&gt;&gt; hill on US19 that i've previously mentioend. cresting the hill at
&gt;&gt; 55mph, in gear the engine braking keeps the speed at 55mph, or
&gt;&gt; thereabouts, unchecked it gets to about 65mph, in the distances of
&gt;&gt; about 1 mile. Thus, i'll call the difference in KE between 55mph and
&gt;&gt; 65mph (now see why i picked 55mph as the speed for the braking
&gt;&gt; distance above) as the amount dumped into the brakes, or engine going
&gt;&gt; down a hill.

&gt;&gt; Kinetic energy: (1/2 Mv^2)
&gt;&gt; brake - 0.5 x 1000 x 24.5872^2 (using meters/sec)
&gt;&gt;          =  302,265.2 J

&gt;first, for this to be a safe vehicle, you have to assume max gross
&gt;vehicle weight [mgvw].  that's ~3000lbs or 1363kg.  the brakes are no
&gt;good if they can't stop the vehicle when fully loaded.
">

as long as the vehicle weights are the same for both calculations,
they cancel out. using MGVW for coasting, and for braking, the 1/2MV^2
for both has the same M, and  thus is equivilent. I didn't actually do
the tests at mgvw either, so the braking distances, and so on are not
empyrically correct. If you want to increase the value of m by 30%,
you are free to do that, although it becomes experimentally incorrect,
and will just raise all figures by 30%.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;that's KE = 0.5 x 1363 x 24.5872^2
&gt;i.e. 412,180J from your 55mph velocity.

&gt;&gt; coast - 0.5x 1000 x 29.6576^2 - 302265.2
&gt;&gt;          = 422172.05 - 302265.2
&gt;&gt;          = 119,906.85 J

&gt;to clarify &amp; grossly simplify, &quot;coast&quot; is the _additional_ energy that
&gt;needs to be dissipated by the brakes if it's not being dissipated by
&gt;engine braking.
">

Yes, exactly. At the bottom of the hill, after a coast, i would be
travveling at 65mph. that is what the first of the 3 lines above
calculates. The secondline removes the initial starting energy (ie
that of the car at 55) o give the figure of the third line, or the
energy gain through free coasting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;using mgvw, KE = (0.5 x 1363 x 29.6576^2) - 412,180
&gt;i.e. 599,429 - 412,180 = 187,249J is dissipated by engine braking.

&gt;&gt; Hmm, the coast energy is only just over 1/3 the brake energy. Oh dear,
&gt;&gt; not looking good for your argument...

&gt;not sure you understand the concept, but let's continue...
">

the 'concept' is that quite simple one. in short, cancelling out 0.5M
we get
55^2 = k (65^2 - 55^2) where k is some constant. this is the raw
difference in energy values. this is the crux of the argument.
3025= k (4225 - 3025)
3025 = 1200k
2.52 = k
the coast energy is 2.52x SMALLER than the emergency stop energy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Lets see about how much energy per second is put into the brakes per
&gt;&gt; second. I'm assuming, of course, that the vehicle only has front
&gt;&gt; brakes. Again, simplifies for me, and is biased towards your claims.

&gt;&gt; assuming a linear speed decrease - it isn''t, i know, but as its a
&gt;&gt; quadratic decrease, divide it by your straight line assertation of
&gt;&gt; brake performance decrease with temp,a nd it comes to a near linear
&gt;&gt; line

&gt;&gt; 55-0 mph in 100ft is a time of 2.47sec. 55mph to cover 1 mile is 65.44
&gt;&gt; seconds.
&gt;&gt; joules per second works out as
&gt;&gt; brake - 302265.2 / 2.47 = 122374.57 J/s

&gt;ok, let's just get back to mgvw, so we have:
&gt;412,180J / 2.47 = 166,874W

&gt;&gt; coast - 119906.85 / 65.4 = 1832.3174

&gt;&gt; Hang on, notice something there? in one second, the emergency stop has
&gt;&gt; absorbed more energy than over the entire run of the coast. Odd...

&gt;this is way off.  the &quot;coast&quot; is the energy difference.  you're not
&gt;trying to calculate the energy dissipated by just drifting along, you're
&gt;trying to calculate how much difference engine braking makes to brake
&gt;temperature.
">

no, Lets reiterate what goes on, shall we? going down a hill of 1 mile
length with a starting speed of 55mph. if the engine is left in gear,
the vehicle stays at 55mph. if it is taken out of gear, it reaches
65mph at the bottom. Thus, the energy difference between 55mph and
65mph is dissipated by the engine over that 1 mile. In one second of
braking from 55mph, the amount of energy transfered to the braking
system is greater than the ENTIRE rise in energy due to coasting over
64 secondsLater on, i even calculate for you that the change in
vehicluar energy due to the coast is equivilent to a stop from 35mph.
thats if you want to incease the figures by 30% for 'mgvw' or not,
since mass is purely a linear variable in all the calculations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;per the above, if the engine is not braking the car, you need to
&gt;dissipate an additional 187,249J / 2.47 = 75,809W.  this is a GROSS
&gt;simplification ignoring wind, friction, etc., but it'll do for first order.
">

an additional amount? wheres this come from? you seem to have just
gone ahead and generated some additional energy value and added it to
the emergency stop value, something to do with engine braking. Is this
the added enegery value required to stop the rotational inertia of the
engine in an emergency stop?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Now, i mentioned temperature just before. how hot will it get? Again,
&gt;&gt; for simplicity, all the energy is going into heating the brake discs
&gt;&gt; only. There is NO cooling effect allowed for. This HEAVILY favours
&gt;&gt; your arguments, and this is where you win through, clearly. The weight
&gt;&gt; of each brake disc for a honda civic is 10lb, or 4.54Kg. The specific
&gt;&gt; heat capacity of cast iron is 460J/Kg/K - or, in other words, for
&gt;&gt; every 460J of energy put into it, 1Kg of cast iron will be raised 1
&gt;&gt; Kelvin (or 1 Centrigrade) in temperature. Lets dump those energies in,
&gt;&gt; shall we? Remember, 2 discs, (or rotors if you will) so 9.08kg

&gt;&gt; lets see then
&gt;&gt; brake - (302265.2 / 9.08) / 460 = 72.36K rise.

&gt;the running surface of the disk, the bit that gets hot, is less than
&gt;that because the 10lbs includes the hub part, not just the rotor.  that
&gt;does not heat significantly for this first order calc, but hey...

over the 3 seconds of the emergency stop, no it wouldn't. Over the
60-seconds or so of the coast, sure it would. thats more than enough
time to transfer heat.

&gt;so, with mgvw, that's 412,180J / (9.08lbs x 460) = 99K rise.

&gt;with mgvw, that's 187,249J / (9.08lbs x 460) = 45K rise.

&gt;that gets /added/ to the rise in disk temp if you're coasting because no
&gt;energy is being dissipated by the engine.

&gt;&gt; Lets say the ambient temperature here in georgia was 90F, or 32.2C. We
&gt;&gt; add those figures, and what do we get?

&gt;&gt; brake - 104.2C - 219F
&gt;&gt; coast - 60.9C - 141F

&gt;make that:
&gt;131C for normal braking, and
&gt;176C without additional engine braking
">

see, this is the bit i don't get. You've taken the value for a 2.5
second emergency stop, and THEN you've added the 55mph emergency stop
figure. What i'm guessing is that you're assuming someone coasts to
the bottom of the hill riding their brakes, and THEN makes an
emergency stop.thats something completely different, but ok.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

flobert was totally wrong on the rear fog light thing, too. I checked. It
seems the rear fog light in the UK is the sole exception to the "all lights
must work" general rule. The driver's side is the ONLY one that has to work
if two rear fog lights are fitted.

It further seems that there are many MoT testers who are not fully familiar
with their own rules. It is common for testers to fail cars based on their
own personal pseudo-knowledge, and not the actual law, especially when it
comes to older vehicles.

I'm damn glad Ontario has no MoT.

If/when you coast, you generally don't ride the brakes. If the hill is

The science is grade school eh. Its very grade school. Energy
dissipated by a d15b2 (the one in my civic, which we've been using for
caculations) is 1800W. Doesn't matter how much mass you put in a car,
its 1800W, if you're stopping the car in, or out of gear, those 1800W
don't matter. in fact, if you're stopping it in gear, you end up
loading the brakes MORE since you've also got to stop the rotational
energy of said engine. It can't dissipate any more, or any less. It
dissipates by operating, the energy is used to have the engine
continue to operateat that speed. It takes 1800W to keep the engine at
that speed. If the vehicle speed is producing a load on the engine of
1800W (as the downhill segment does) then the engine dissipates that,
and keeps it at a steady speed, If you then try and suddenly reduce
the engine speed, the engine, which has this great inertia (just try
leaving it idling in netrual, then jam is straight into gear, and see
how much inertia there is transfered to vehicular momentum.

you can't ahve it both ways, you see. the engine braking you attribute
to 'saving the brakes' is loading the brakes up similarly in an
emergency stop when you're not coasting. wheels, transmission, engine,
all connected. when you try and stop, you see, the wheels have an
inertia, the transmission has an inertia, the engine has an inertia
(hell, thats the point of the damned flywheel) In gear, that has to go
somewhere. When engine braking, the momentum of the car is used to
move that, This is what engine braking is. Under REALy braking, its
stoping those same moving parts.

It all comes down to one thing, we've established that you believe
that if you've taken the car out of gear, you must automatically apply
the brakes to do the same job - fundamentally untrue, but it is the
basis of your argument. We then proved, mathematically, under a worst
case scenario, that even riding the brakes at 55mph for a mile, then
an emergency stop, does NOT casuse significant heat rise, that the
riding of the brakes doesn't impart more than a comparitively
minescule amount of energy. If you want to think about it this way,
that coast down the hill, and the sudden stop from 55, is the EXACT
same thing, using our calculation parameters, as a single stop from
the 'free' speed (or the speed of the vehicle had the brakes not been
ridden, nor the car in gear). After all, in the simplistic model we're
using, the instant before the brakes are applied, its KE is equal to
the initial KE and the Pe at the start. Work backwards through your
own figures. In practice, the airflow through the brakes wilst going
down the hill dissipates the heat over the free speed stop.

You stated it was bad, because it was illegal, but could only site the
most knee-jerk of the US states, where laws are made with more regard
to the spin, and the perception, than the actualfacts. (single
occupancy hybrids counting as carpool, the fuel additives are two
examples)

In short, and in conclusion, coasting, and then stopping, the brakes
will recieve the same amount of braking energy. Go down the hill in
gear, the engine will contribute in its momentum what it took from the
vehicles speed, minus a small amount for friction. The higher speed of
the free, will cause greater wind resistance (its a square increase,
like KE) the greater the speed, the greater the air ressitance. so
energy is lost there. increased brake wear, loss of control, you never
did respond with any manouvers or measures in which the engine being
connected was required, except the two i listed. One, the speed up,
runs counter to your argument of being unsafe because you're going
faster, and the other (power application to correct oversteer) can be
avoided by better driving practice.

I will prove this one way or another. This weekend, i will get some
more sensitive measurement devices, some friends, and we'll go and
actually measure the forces, temperatures, etc. I'm willing to put the
theories, both of ours, to the test. We will see then which one is
accurate. I will put my money where my mouth is, will you?

&gt;Wow .. you guys are writing some long replies in this thread!
">

Yeah, i tend to get a bit frothy at the mouth when i see sloppy
thinking touted as fact. Comes from my nature i guess. and my father,
who as a rally driver, and mechanical engineer, often tried and forced
me into arguments just be sure i know my stuff. He was a hard bastard,
but he really drummed into me how to make a complete and concise
argument, which should bend to your opoonants view as much as is
reasonable, in order to prove how silly it is. This is something i do
a lot of. Since part of my job involves prototyping vehicles, for
various uses, safety systems are where my priority lies, mainly in
overestimating them - Half the time, i'm the one inside (if i won't
ride it, its not safe enough)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'd like to point out two facts, which may be contrary to an extent to what
&gt;each of you are saying:

&gt;1)  Modern cars do suffer from brake fade (I had a Civic as my last car and
&gt;when I drove it like I stole it, there came a point after a few *really*
&gt;heavy stops from high speed where the pedal would disappear to the floor
&gt;virtually with the pressure before doing anything much - get out of the car
&gt;and smell the wonderful baking smell of toasted brake pads!).  However, with
&gt;a normal person driving it legally, there are very few situations in the
&gt;world where it's going to be a worry.  OK - some of us live in the Alps and
&gt;drive for 15 mins as fast as we can down a hill ... worry!  The rest of us
&gt;rarely see a hill more than 1km long!
">

not at any kind of grade, no. one of the worst of that length that i
do quite regularly, is the 0.85mile one 9about what, 1.2km) which
averages a 1in16, just north of atlanta. We've both given examples of
a steeper one, but much shorter (some 0.3km only). You are someone
who's had real wold practical experiance with heavy braking, hills and
fade, or lackthereof.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I now have a ATR - no matter what I've done to it so far, it's coped fine.
&gt;But then it's got whopping great vented discs that are built to take a
&gt;constant heat input and dissipate it as quickly as possible and keep all of
&gt;the braking materials at an operational temperature.
">

Yep, brakes dissipate lots of heat when the vehicle is in motion -
something we deliberately removed from the calculations, primarally
because i have no way to measure, but also because it leans to Jim's
side (see above)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2)  Driving out of gear is rightly illegal in many places.  This is because
&gt;you are less in control and less able to respond to any given situation.
&gt;The engine breaking is a bonus for those of us who aren't so goddam tight
&gt;that we'll do anything to save £1 a year on fuel costs.  Many situations
&gt;occur where you need to take evasive action and drive out of trouble.  A car
&gt;is also more stable and &quot;drivable&quot; in gear.  If you're coasting around in
&gt;neutral, you're doing two things - concentrating less than you should on the
&gt;road because you're worrying about keeping your toboggan going fast enough
&gt;for your lazy arse not to get back into gear again and perhaps taking risks
&gt;by going faster than you should in places to keep up that precious momentum;
&gt;and two, you're probably annoying the living hell out of the driver behind
&gt;you by driving in an unexpected and erratic manner (too slow at times,
&gt;correct or too fast at others), thus increasing the likelihood of a crash
&gt;out of frustration from other road users.
">

Here i'm not too sure. We agree that about the only use being in gear
has, is accelerating, or 'driving out' of a situation. Avalanches,
yes, not situations you'll see on either cost of the US though, where
we are. If it were really that important to accelerate, I'd be
changine gears anyway, for a lower one, for better acceleration, if a
tornado is comming (a more common risk over here at least, 4rth or 3rd
would be a better gear to aceclerate in, than the 5th gear i'd be in
for the cruise down the hill.

i wouldn't say its unpredictable, or 'less concentrating' though. When
keeping the momentum up, you end up glacing at the speedo, yes, (but
isn't that the point of all those speed cameras, to make you watch
your speedo!) but putting it into gear from neutral is no more
involved than just changing gear, after all, in a manual car, part of
changing gear is 'coasting'. Eratic speeds don't match either, since i
will put it into gear to keep my speed to a point i set myself at.
i'll aim to keep that speed above that minimum regardless. downhill
you'll be going faster, not slower, so you'll be leaving those brake
riders, or engine brakers behind. (assuming of course, they don't
either coast, or accelerate down the hill themselves).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Please, guys - life is too short!!  There is a reason why coasting is
&gt;frowned upon - you don't know better than most driving standards across the
&gt;civilised worlds.  Also, car brakes are more than able to cool themselves
&gt;adequately under normal driving conditions.
">

I've fuond that only a few palces actually BAN coasting, or at least
make it a ticketable offence. Many others frown on it, the same way
corsing your hands on the wheel, or changing gear ina  corner is fornw
upon. Of course, there is something i've been longing to say, but have
avoided it hoping someone else would. Automatic hgearboxes, in the
main, do not offer any form of engine braking at hgiher speeds, in
higher gears. Lock them into 2, or ! and they will, but regular D,
nope.
"Many automatic transmissions use overrunning or one-way mechanical
clutches to transmit power through the transmission. These devices
make upshifts smooth because only one clutch has to apply during a
shift instead of one applying and another releasing (the overrunning
clutch releases automatically). The disadvantage of overrunning

Hello,
I just wanted to let people know that plan to coast their vehicles down
hill that it causes more WEAR on the transmissions. It also causes more
WEAR on the clutch. In other words, if you two people have the same type
of cars, the person that coasts down the hills is more likely to have to
have the transmission or clutch repaired or replaced than the other person
that did NOT coast down hills.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; upon. Of course, there is something i've been longing to say, but have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; avoided it hoping someone else would. Automatic hgearboxes, in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; main, do not offer any form of engine braking at hgiher speeds, in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; higher gears. Lock them into 2, or ! and they will, but regular D,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; nope.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Many automatic transmissions use overrunning or one-way mechanical
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clutches to transmit power through the transmission. These devices
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; make upshifts smooth because only one clutch has to apply during a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shift instead of one applying and another releasing (the overrunning
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clutch releases automatically). The disadvantage of overrunning
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clutches is that they can only transfer torque one way so they provide
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no engine braking.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (source http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/jk/030806.htm - the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; very first link ona  google search for &quot;Automatic transmission&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Engine braking&quot; You'd have to manually shift an automatic box to a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; non-overdrive situation, to a gear with engine braking. Maybe you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; didn't understand how the civic was coasting. (lovely overdrive, which
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is neutral). The van has no such lovelyness (being a crappy american
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; slushbox) but since i've uprated the brakes anyway, to the point
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; where, if needed, under normal use any one wheel will function to slow
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the vehicle under normal loading on its own (since on occasion, i take
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it right upto its mgvw, with all the hills and stop-starts here for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; deer and such, i don't like to take chances with substandard parts,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; like jim does 9after all, he uses cheap pads, and had them burn outt o
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; nothing ona short 1 in 7.5 grade, at low speed)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Oh dear, its gotten another long post again (sorry, i'm a windbag) but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i hope you get my intent.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Just for the record, I have an '03 Toyota Corolla that was bothering me
&gt; &gt;for some
&gt; &gt;&gt; time until I finally realised that it downshifts from overdrive when the
&gt; &gt;brakes
&gt; &gt;&gt; are applied (fairly hard) going downhill. I haven't determined
exactly why it
&gt; &gt;&gt; does it (that, the parameters of when it happens), but it definately does
&gt; &gt;&gt; downshift.

&gt; &gt;Hello,
&gt; &gt;I just wanted to let people know that plan to coast their vehicles down
&gt; &gt;hill that it causes more WEAR on the transmissions. It also causes more
&gt; &gt;WEAR on the clutch. In other words, if you two people have the same type
&gt; &gt;of cars, the person that coasts down the hills is more likely to have to
&gt; &gt;have the transmission or clutch repaired or replaced than the other person
&gt; &gt;that did NOT coast down hills.
&gt; &gt;Jason

&gt; You said this early as well, and then, as now, you gave nothing to
&gt; back it up.

Murphy's Law and common sense. The more that a transmission or clutch is
used, the more likely it is to develop problems. That's one of reasons
that most people trade in or sell their cars after they are three or four
years old.
They know that those older cars will have more problems than a new cars
will have.

Hello,
Those cars don't develop problems due to WEAR. They develop problems due
to other problems. New cars are covered by warranties. The issue in this
case is the extra WEAR that is caused by over use of the clutch and

have to spend several thousand dollars replacing the clutch or

Dont it for years, in mainly older cars. Only in one have i had to
replace transmissions/clutches - my 89 mg metro twin turbo, snapped
clutch cable, and once i also overfilled the engine with oil a bit -
those engines are real finicky, as the oil is also shared with the
gearbox. it seeped out and into the clutch itself. took about an hour
or twos work, to clean the oil off the plates, a few hundred miles of
driving,a nd it was good as new.

i think you minsunderstand just whats going on. In coasting, the
cluthc is used to disengage the transmission, as it would be in
changing gear. it is then left out of gear, meaning that the wheel
side is going at the road wheel speed, as is ormal, so no difference
in wear there, and the engine side is going at the engine speed, which
is lower, thus LESS wear there. Struggling to see how this increases
wear myself...

Hello,
I drove a dump truck one summer and learned from one of the other drivers
on the construction crew that the engine could be used to slow down a
loaded dump truck while going down hill. I use the engine in my Honda
Accord to slow down the car when going down grades. I have a question for
you: How often did you have brake problems as a result of making use of
your brakes (instead of engine) while going down grades.

Precicely zero. Why? simple
I don't coast down steep grades. Where engine braking is important,

&gt;One word - depreciation!!  Why would you buy a new car and see its value
&gt;halve in 3 years (or worse)?  Who cares about replacing the odd clutch
&gt;compared to loosing maybe £3000 a year in depreciation for your average £20k
&gt;car?

&gt;Most expensive thing I've ever had happen to me is when the distributor
&gt;bearings exploded on my old Civic.  Managed to limp to my local garage as it
&gt;happens, so now towing needed.  About £600 in repairs IIRC.  Tyres and
&gt;brakes are what I land up spending big money on most regularly - and that
&gt;wouldn't matter a damn no matter how old the car!
">

too true - i used to burn through tyres in my old 340, and my mg metro
- i'd be lucky if a pair of rears for the volvo, or fronts for the
metro lasted 3000 miles. only replaced the brakes once on the volvo -
and i still have the scars on my shin from that 3 day job, back in jan
2002.

Ahhh ... sense(ish) at last!  ;)

However I still disagree and I never ever coast in my car unless I'm about
25m away from lights or I'm slowly moving down a car park ramp, a few cars
at a time!  I can't help but think you're all missing the point though.
What's with all this braking/coasting?  Accelerate down the damn hill and
quit pussying around!!  That'll put some real heat in your brakes when you
need them!!!

&gt; Here i'm not too sure. We agree that about the only use being in gear

&gt; we are. If it were really that important to accelerate, I'd be

Hmm ... I still think you understate the usefullness of being in gear.  A
car looses certain handling characteristics when out of gear too - hard to
explain, but from trying both, it certainly feels less surefooted without
drive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; i wouldn't say its unpredictable, or 'less concentrating' though. When
&gt; keeping the momentum up, you end up glacing at the speedo, yes, (but
&gt; isn't that the point of all those speed cameras, to make you watch
&gt; your speedo!) but putting it into gear from neutral is no more
&gt; involved than just changing gear, after all, in a manual car, part of
&gt; changing gear is 'coasting'. Eratic speeds don't match either, since i
&gt; will put it into gear to keep my speed to a point i set myself at.
&gt; i'll aim to keep that speed above that minimum regardless. downhill
&gt; you'll be going faster, not slower, so you'll be leaving those brake
&gt; riders, or engine brakers behind. (assuming of course, they don't
&gt; either coast, or accelerate down the hill themselves).
">

When you change gear, you really don't coast - you momentarily interrupt
drive.  If you stay out of gear, it takes time to react, grab the knob, get
it in gear (you'll probably miss if you panic) and drive away.  Much better
to be in gear in the first place.  Sometimes just a small bit of throttle is
needed to minimise risk - not quite the live/die evasive action scenario you
refer to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oh dear, its gotten another long post again (sorry, i'm a windbag) but

I get what you're saying, and you're defending against an opinion that goes
too far the other way, but I still don't think you should coast - it's kinda
lazy driving.  That in conjunction to the points above to me means you could
be slightly (not a lot, but a little) more likely to suffer misfortune than
if you didn't.

So to sum up, I agree and disagree with you both, on separate points  ;p

&gt;&gt; Hey guys,

&gt;&gt; Loaded down with all of my personal belongings, I got 32mpg during the
&gt;&gt; 770 mile drive from Dallas.  This was fine with me.

&gt;&gt; During the first few weeks that I was here, my driving was evenly split
&gt;&gt; between city, small highway (55mph) and mountain driving.  I averaged
&gt;&gt; 24mpg.

&gt;&gt; Determined to do better, I committed to keep the TAC under 3,000 for
&gt;&gt; the entire volume of gas in the newly-filled tank.  I just filled it up
&gt;&gt; last night and did the calculation.  22mpg.

&gt;&gt; My eyes are crossing...

&gt;&gt; Almost all of my driving for this past tank has been city driving.  I
&gt;&gt; have not been an A/C fiend, and I shift into Neutral and coast downhill
&gt;&gt; rather than let the engine do it.  I take my time getting places and I
&gt;&gt; don't jackrabbit starts or stops.

&gt;&gt; What am I doing wrong?  Or does Colorado just suck?  Is my expectation
&gt;&gt; of 25mpg city driving unreasonable?

&gt; you're in reformulated gas territory, which probably means lower calorie
