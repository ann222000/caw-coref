HOWE abHOWET a nice VIDEO, janet? I think we GOT SOME RIGHT HERE:

Here is a video from Fred which I have a few concerns
about (and maybe Fred can weigh in if he sees fit), THE
SAME "FRED" that johnny would invite to heelp his
shelter dogs learn RESPECT.

This is a video about Nero being taught to get on
a skateboard.

http://www.studioonline.com/playvideos.asp?crypt=A7E284B9ABDFCE0F

http://tinyurl.com/389al
In this video, the dog is constantly jerking his
head all around. I'm not SHORE why he's doing that.
If he's doing it because he is being shocked repeatedly
into getting onto that skateboard, then it is my
opinion that Fred Hassen is a dog abuser in the
extreme. As would anyone be, no matter how much
"experience" they had shocking dogs, nor how
nationally "respected" they are/were.

If, HOWEver, the dog is jerking his head all around
because he is happy and for no other reason, well,
then, never mind. I've just never seen this kind of
behavior from a dog before, so maybe Fred can
explain what would cause a dog to move his head
like that.

Here's a other:
http://tinyurl.com/2v9oh
Even your PALS the "DOG LOVERS" on the
abuse groups were HOWEtraged by those stunts.

"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good
of its victims, may be the most oppressive. Those
who torment us for our own good will torment us
without end, for they do so with the approval of
their own conscience." - C.S. Lewis.

"Death is better, a milder fate than tyranny",
Aeschylus (525BC-456BC), Agamemnon.

"Only the unenlightened speak of wisdom and right action
as separate, not the wise. If any man knows one, he
enjoys the fruit of both. The level which is reached by
wisdom is attained through right action as well. He who
perceives that the two are one knows the truth."

"Even the wise man acts in character with his nature,
indeed all creatures act according to their natures.
What is the use of compulsion then? The love and
hate which are aroused by the objects of sense arise
from Nature, do not yield to them. They only obstruct
the path." Bhagavad Gita, adapted by Krishna with

Aside from being incredibly offensive and self-

in the differences in dogs' temperaments, or perhaps
a lack of ability to perceive same.

The fact that you, Alison, have never met a dog to
whom corrections and discomfort, even pain, were
unimportant does not mean that such dogs do not exist.

What it means is that you don't know as much about
dogs as you think you do, and you surely don't know
a damn thing about Harlan or anyone else's dog here.

I had a Dalmatian that would instigate fights with
one of her housemates; that dog had no fear or
anything, and pain incurred during a fight meant
nothing to her.

I know that that dog is not unique, and I'm sure many
people here can tell similar stories.  The fact that
you, Alison, continue to say things to people such as
what you said to Theresa about causing her dog to
suffer (at least I guess that's what you meant by

&gt;--
&gt;--Matt.  Rocky's a Dog.

and apparently pretty sneaky too - can't figure this one out still!

FYI - He ingested a mystery sock.
Hadn't done that in well over a year.

When he was a puppy we were very lucky - they went through or
came up. We've done "sock work" with him leaving them alone,
but mostly are pretty conscientious about not making them available.

The risk is obviously too high.  One of his littermates beat him to
the punch with the same surgery, and his great grandfather had this
habit until he died at age 12.

My MIL was visiting (sockless!) and since he wasn't with
me every waking moment as usual as a result, I can only
imagine that the sock presented itself somehow while she
was with him.

He was a very, very sick dog.  He had emergency surgery
on Monday, but was home by Tuesday - we lucked out that
the sock had advanced enough that they didn't need to
cut the bowel.

Once he was opened, they were able to manipulate the sock
out his rectum.  He thinks he's fine, so the leash is very
necessary! He's got about a foot of staples on his tummy,
and this was a very expensive sock!

&gt; Some dogs are really adept at getting out of things,

Yes indeed.  I crated Franklin when I had to leave yesterday.
He's post surgical and needs to be confined and rest/kept safe.
He is used to crates, has not problem with them and does not
"escape" (mesh crates, wire crates, etc - he takes them all in
stride, whether strange places or at home).

When I got home, both dogs greeted me at the door.  He had
managed to bend the clips on the end panel of his metal crate
(General Cage 204) and squeeze out the top/side of the end
panel that has the door.  The door was securely closed.

THAT was NOT a good thing to do with a foot of staples
in your tummy. He hadn't done it before - but he's not his
usual self obviously.

We won't be trying that again any time soon!

Yeah, what do I know about genetically determined behavior? At some
point in the evolution of Franklin's breed a mutation occurred that
determined a propensity for sock-swallowing; and, considering the fact
that this acquired behavior conferred such an evolutionary advantage to
the breed, natural selection favored it all the time until it was
passed on to Franklin's parents and grandparents, and hopefully to
Franklin's offspring, so that such a valuable trait wouldn't, God

Bagel escaped from the kitchen and ate about 10
pounds of puppy food and proceeded to deposit it
all over my house.

He esp. liked my living room sofa which was my

literally stood on it and peed.

I think my poor dog walker needs therapy now.

It was a rough dog weekend for her and not
just with my kids.

I didn't know until the last minute I was going away
and NEXT time, the furbabies will go to furbaby camp

Subject:       Muttley: Now a question of Life or Death

"Paul E. Schoen" &lt;pst ... @smart.net&gt; wrote

Hello everyone:

If you have followed some of my posts, you know something
about the ongoing story of Muttley, the large GSD/Chow dog
I have been trying to adopt or place in a better home.

I will add a bit more history later in this post.

Last Tuesday, toward the end of Janet's obedience class,
Muttley and I had just finished fairly successfully performing
a sit/stay/come routine, and then he was sitting by my side.

The final routine was to be a "down", which Muttley has had
some difficulty with, and frankly I have not had the time to
work with him much on that.

I was kneeling at his side, trying to hold his collar while
pushing his front legs down to the position, while he resisted.
Suddenly he lunged, knocking me over onto the parking lot, and
I lost grip of the leash as I reflexively broke my fall.

Muttley took the opportunity to attack a young black male
Lab to my left, and it was a very brutal attack. Janet and
the instructors tried to gain control, and as soon as I
could get to my feet I grabbed the leash and pulled him off.

That was  the end of the class, and the other dog, Bernie,
was taken to an animal hospital for treatment. When everyone
had left, Janet counseled me about what should be done about
Muttley.

She said this was more than ordinary aggression, and only
intensive (and expensive) one on one training would have
any chance at working, and in any case, he was not suited
to group training.

She advised me that Muttley could be dangerous, and she
recommended that he be euthanized. "They can't all be saved".

If I did not have to worry about my cat, I would probably
keep him, and I am certain I could avoid any more dangerous
episodes. I probably would not have taken him to obedience
classes at this time if that was not such a difficult issue,
and if people here had not essentially shamed me into doing so.

Then he would only be a bratty dog with a mind of his own,
but he would not have been identified as dangerous.

Subject:          The crate escape - my brilliant puppy!

1 From:  Janet B
Date:  Wed, Apr 5 2006 7:44 am
Email:   Janet B j ... @bestfriendsdogobedience.com

After Rudy came to stay with us, I got tired of running into an open
crate door, so I bought a new crate, with a door that folds up and in.
"can't be opened from the inside" says the ad.  I always looked at
these and hought "right", but for the last few months (yes, folks,
it's been 3.5 months) it has worked great.

Until Monday.

That's when Mr Smarty-pants decided he knew how to open it.
And greeted us at the door after 6+ hours of freedom.

A chewed wastebasket lid and a puddle inside the front door (he
loses it if very excited and yesterday morning I found evidence
that a smallish dog had apparently "visited" right outside my full
view front door) was all that was wrong.

So yesterday, when I left for a short errand, I made sure to
clip the door closed securely.  And once again came home
to an unconfined puppy.

So, today, the crate will get clips on the door to ensure this doesn't
happen again.  I need him to learn that he shouldn't let himself out.
But it looks like he's going to be allowed house freedom within a few
days, and since he'll be 9 months old on Monday, that'll be the day.

I'll take the next few days to put some shoes away and check out other
things he may be interested in, and get out the bitter apple.  My house

is not exactly the neatest place in the world, and there's a lot of
stuff that may be too available and interesting.  We shall see.

My puppy is growing up and too smart for his own good!

It does.  My lab mix died 13 years ago in 104 degree heat.  I felt
very guilty that I didn't come home just 1/2 hour earlier from work
to MAKE him come in from the heat.

He did have that choice though.  He could have been indoors in
air conditioning via a dog door, but chose to be outside in that
brutal heat.

My neighbor said he was barking at a passerby just 1/2 hour
before I came home (a favorite activity).  It was a horrible
day, but had he been alive and in distress when I came home,
I would have stopped passing cars if I hadn't been able to
lift him myself, if it meant getting him to the vet to LIVE!

He was 15.5 years old - his time was going to be up one way
or another, but the day still haunts me 13 years later.  No
dogs since have been given a choice but to stay in the air
conditioning.

I don't KNOW that his was heat stroke, it could have been his
heart or a severe stroke.  At his age it was going to be something.
Heat had to have been a contributing factor though.

Rule of thumb - never own a dog you can't lift or figure
out how to lift.  Life may depend on it.

My homeowner's policy DID pay over $2300 to cover automobile

don't change, I'm not dropped, my dogs weren't questioned.

Perhaps there is more to the "judgement" criteria than meets the eye.

My insurance company paid over $2300 to fix someone's car after my
dog was hit and killed.  If the car had hit a deer, the car owner's
insurance
would have had to pay.  The leash law in my county meant that even
without INTENTIONAL off leash circumstances, the car driver had a
right to compensation from my homeowner's insurance, even though
he was very much speeding.

Even when the answers are bad, I like ANSWERS.  Where my little
Carey-kitty is involved, we never seem to have any.  She's been "sick"
for the last 3 years and we've never been able to figure out just
what's going on with her.  I'm trying to not add up the costs, as they
just keep mounting.

Carey is an almost 12 year old tortie with numerous problems over the
3 years, related to behavior, urinary issues, weight loss, and early
on, paralysis as well.  We've had tests out the wazoo, have seen
standard general practice vets as well as a neurologist, tried various
medications, and we still have no real answers.

I'm hoping those come soon, but the preliminary aren't great choices.

After raising her Elavil level to combat inappropriate urination, she
tore her ACL.  That appears to be healing slowly.  She's been at the
vet numerous times in the last few weeks and we started seeing a
different vet, closer to home this week.

That was after she projectile vomited 2 meals, and was passing bloody
urine, on Monday.  After a few small puddles of that, her urine was
not bloody and she was back to eating without problem.  All day
Tuesday was fine.  Saw vet on Wednesday, and x-rayed her bladder, and
embarked on more tests (last full bloodwork was last August).  She has
a HUGE palpable thyroid gland, yet her thyroid tests (free T-4 still
waiting) have all been normal.  She weighs 7# and is skin and bones,
and has been for quite a long time.  She eats well (1 full can of
Trader Joe's cat food and 1/2 can Fancy Feast daily) and plays with
the other cat, loves on the dogs, etc.

5 minutes after coming home from the vet on Wednesday, she squatted on
the floor and let loose a large puddle of bloody urine.  No blood in
urine since.  Her urinalysis shows no issues.

Her kidneys look fine on x-rays, but her test results show renal
insufficiency, but not failure.

We're still waiting for more test results, but so far, we have no
answers.  Does anyone have any thoughts?

Thanks.  Unfortunately, that's what my vet has said as well.
Having dealt with it with a few pets now, it didn't hit me
quite like the ton of bricks as the first time I heard that
diagnosis, but it still is hard to hear that it's a potential.

The last 2 days, she's been galloping and eating and acting
like "hey - I'm ok - no problem - don't worry about me!".

She's a tough little cat, but obviously not a well one.

She's adored by all beings in this household, so we'll do
whatever we need to for her as we find out (or not) more.
Right now she's curled up with her kitty-"brother" and
seems happy as she can be.

A scat mat directly in front of the door, can be stepped

Rather than have my youngest cat continue to ruin my
leather furniture, we have Scat Mats on the sofa and

When they are off, and we're sitting on that furniture,
Skip is allowed on and in our laps, etc.  When the mats

I fully understand that (and the analogy of other groups
who feel strongly about issue "x").  I think there is a
very, very large group of people who choose or think about
declawing, do so not because they want to take a chance
that the animal they love may be tortured, but because
of a variety of experiences/advice that says it's an ok
thing to do (not torture in general - declawing!).

Take the neighbor's attitude ("just" a cat?  NO cat is
"just" anything! ;-D). One shared by many, to some degree.
Lot's of priorities.  Interesting thread on RPDB recently
about people willing to die/put themselves in the line of
fire for their dogs.

It was interesting to read the range of thoughts on such
a thing.  Obviously, people give different weight to
different beings and things.

While I am their caregiver and friend, I don't put
pets in the same category as humans.

I declawed my first cat, because my experiences said that
is what you did with an indoor cat (had lived with many
cats owned by others).  She used her claws inappropriately
as a kitten, and my meager attempts at clawing devices
didn't work, so I thought nothing of it.

Since she exhibited no obvious ill effects, my experience
(and hers as far as anyone could tell) was a positive one.

Knowing more of what it entailed, I chose not to declaw my
next cat (owned in tandem with cat #1 and then cat #3).
He was an adult acquisition and I knew such a thing would
be more difficult for him, but also, he was very trainable
and I didn't even consider it.

Cat #3 was a claw maniac, and due to my experiences with
Cat #1, I went ahead with a declaw.  Once again, I have
never seen any backlashes due to the operation, and I
would put up with anything if I'm lucky enough to have
her for many more years, which isn't all that likely.

She's doing well on meds currently, and maintaining,
if not gaining any weight.

Once I was ready for cat #4, I knew that I wouldn't choose
this route again. Not because of gory pictures, not because
of scare tactics about what my declawed cat would become,
but because I realized that more tools could make the
difference and it wasn't something that I really wanted
to do.

I didn't want to cause a kitten pain (even though others
didn't seem to experience any!), nor any physical or
emotional problems.  So, I have a fully clawed cat who
pees on things - oh well! ;-D  He's a wonderful cat in
every other way!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you love your furniture more than your cat's right
&gt; to not be mutilated, you are going to draw some venom

Again, why is it either/or?

Can't someone value their belongings and their cat too?

I choose to protect my furniture with Sticky Paws (I forgot
they were there - probably time to take them off - it's been
almost 2 years with no interest!) and with Scat Mats (not
from claws but from urine).

Some folks posting here think that's a horrible thing to do.

People who have obviously never felt a Scat Mat!  But balloons,
snappy trainers, etc are recommended.  A lot of contradictory
thoughts here, so I can't say that it's all rational.

Passion rarely is though - and I actually appreciate
that for the most part!

It's obvious that each one of us has our own limits.
