Time travel/parallel worlds in roguelikes?

My brain started working today and spat out a silly idea. It blathered
about a roguelike where you would travel between different worlds/
times. Your actions in one world, or in the past, would affect things
in the future/other world.

Musing I: Has it been done? I haven't heard of any RL:s on this theme,
but:
* The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past had a Light and a Dark
world, with travel to the light world being possible once you got a
certain object, and with portals to the dark world scattered across
the light one. Also, a grand total of one puzzle based on pulling a
lever in the light world to activate its counterpart machinery in the
dark world. (Entering the water castle.)
* Day of the Tentacle. You control three characters scattered in the
past, the present and the future. Some puzzles let you affect the
&quot;future&quot;, for example tricking the Founding Fathers into mandating the
existence of a vacuum cleaner in every home. (Which spawns a vacuum in
the &quot;future&quot; setting.)

I'm sure there's others. Maybe even an RL?

Musing II: What the heck would you be DOING in an RL heavily based on
the concept of time travel/parallell worlds? The most important
question before making one, if you ask me.
* Time police? Master Kaen has created a time machine and is now
beating up random people somewhere in the 18:th century. As an agent
in the Time Corps, you must stop him before he kills the grandparent
of someone important. And so on. This would use the &quot;Procedural Time&quot;
I'll describe below.
* Feng Shui. Played the roleplaying game with that name? Its metaplot
is that various faction are fighting over possession of &quot;Feng Shui
sites&quot;, places with great power which give their owners good luck in
life. It has time travel too. (Four discrete time periods - dystopic
future where an evil corporation owns all the sites, contemporary, and
two past eras. You can only travel to those specific years, and when a
year passes in &quot;contemporary time&quot;, it has also passed in the times to
which you can travel.)
* Where in Time is Carmen San Diego RL? Carmen San Diego hits! Carmen
San Diego bites! You hit Carmen San Diego with your cockatrice corpse.
Carmen San Diego is slowing down... maybe not.

Can you tell I'm more interested in time travel than parallel worlds?

Musing III: Cool mechanisms and puzzle opportunities. Can't go without
these.
* Procedurally generated future. Basically, everyone has a rudimentary
family tree backwards in time to the earliest point the game handles.
The PC and their nemeses really want to keep their family lines
secret. Could give lots of opportunities for game-breaking meanness.
* Terminator-style travel. Can't bring anything that's not alive
through. Makes the player both think twice about travelling
unnecessarily, and lets them come up with ideas to make stashes where
items will stay around for a few hundred years to be picked up in your
future. (Think graves.)

Well, I'm tired and incoherent. Give me some pointers to more
inspiration if you want. I might do this at some point. (Maybe a 7DRL.)

Some number of zeldas after that was the Ocarina of Time - and Link went
bouncing all around time.

But! You have to make sure that you can mess everything up completely:
Steal your great grandmother from your great grandad
Kill yourself in the past
Sabotage yourself in the past (grab the key before old-you gets to it)
Spread advanced diseases to ancient peoples (or simple diseases to advanced
people)
Go back and steal some cool stuff that old-you has - now you have two of
them!
Go back to yourself and suggest that the both of you go back and suggest
that the three of you go back and suggest that the four of you........
Destroy/Birth the universe (they did it in 2001)
Unravel time?
Paradoxically(?) create a new race - go 10000 years into the future and
bring back a couple of those 6ft tall intelligent roach beings to create a
colony and spread exponentially eventually destroying the human race

-Or cause some of the mayhem yourself:
Future-you pops up and starts warning you to do one thing - then
Future-future-you pops up and starts warning you not to do that and to do it
this way and the two of them start arguing back and forth - then if they
take too long Future-future-future-you pops up yelling at all three of you -
and then your girlfriend walks in
Just toss in people and have them say you are going to commit some horrible
act against them/their family in the future
You are witness to some horrible cataclysm and go back in to the past to try
to warn whatever inhabitants get decimated (could be a little town getting
swarmed by a horde of orcs but nobody believes your crazy stories - damn
maybe you should stick around and tell yourself, whenever you arrive, to get
some evidence of the attack they next time they come back)
Get lost while time travelling - (and you can not just jump around! you need
to know what month/day/year you are in so you can calculate (using the stars
or soemthing I guess) exactly where and when you will arrive in the
past/future (so you still appear on the planet and not in space or
something?-whatever)) then try to figure out what time it is in the hostile
enviroment you are trapped in
Start out the game testing a mundane time travel machine (as a time travel
mechanic or something) and you seemingly don't do anyhting special in
whatever past place you travelled to but when you travel forward in time
everything is completely different (an oppressive society, some horrible
disaster has occured, aliens took over etc.)

Hmm.. the &quot;simplest&quot; thing to do would probably be to do the classic
timetravel story - you go through time until you get to some point where you
realize you have made a horrible mistake - You get the chance and you take
it to go back in time and try to warn yourself (or give yourself some nice
equipment) - Once you do you will then take over your old self (and the
future-self that you just played gets sucked back into the future or
something) and you get to try it all over again, but you will have an extra
piece of information or magic sword (so you can unlock new paths, and/or get
extra abilities and/or be able to take on stronger encounters ) but it will
not be good enough and so you must warn your old self again but this time
with a little more information/ other items  (and then as many times as you
want to keep that up)

Time travel is cool

I played an infocom adventure once involving time travel.  It was one
of a series - I think it might have been Sorceror.

You had to behave in conformity with how a previous avatar of yourself
saw you behave earlier on in the game, I think.  I can't remember the
details.

One of the few such games i completed without spoilers.

The most advanced time travel game I've seen so far is this one :

http://www.eyezmaze.com/chronon/v0/index.html

You'd better try it with a spoiler else it will blow your mind...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the site :
">

The purpose of this game is to let the little yellow dwarf out of a
center cage.
The master of this house will come back at 7pm.
You make the way to escape with moving and mix-and-much things in this
house
at each fixed hour until the master comes back.
Everyone would get it so far,but difficulty arises in time axis.

For example, first,[put the pan from the wall onto the desk at 12:25],
then as far back as 6:15[put the pan into the fireplace].
after that, the pan placed in the fireplace, not the wall.
It means that situation changes the fact that pan was on the wall at
12:25,and also it doesn't exist the fact that you did first,[[put the
pan from the wall onto the desk at 12:25]]
What is more, if you do such thing at latter time[put the flour into
the pan on the desk.] Since the place of the pan has already changed
above(on the desk -&gt; fireplace), it doesn't exist the fact that you
put the flour into the pan on the desk, then the flour returns again
to the original position.

I can't believe you didn't mention Chronotrigger.

One time-travel-related idea that pops here once in a time is about
going back in time similar to loading a saved game -- more or less
technically advanced, depending on how you track things. I think that
Prince of Persia: Sand of Time used something similar, and I am sure that
the 7drl &quot;Savescummer&quot; does that, but allows you to travel both ways.

One interesting thing that could rsult is meeting yourself re-playing all
the moves you actually performed in the past. The problem with it is how
to avoid interactions that would make the recorded moves invalid, which
actually boils down to resolving the killing-your-own-grandpa paradox.

You hit your past self.
Suddenly you sense that something has gone wrong in the space-time
continuum... [you have just created a parallel universe, so your past
self is controlled by AI from now].
Your past self hits you.
You miss your past self.
Your past self misses you.
You cast a huge fireball. Your past self is burned to ashes!
On the ground you see your past self's corpse.
Hmm... Delicious!

Most of us can't even write a roguelike with one world and one time.
I've definitely considered it (like most people, I'm sure), but there
are WAY too many details to consider.  For a good time travel RPG,
you'd need to have a pretty crazy cause - event system.  Without that,
it just becomes, &quot;Well, I don't see any way to do this necessary task
in my current time.  I must need to go into the past to this
location!&quot;  That's no fun.  You should be able to, like pol says, do
all sorts of crazy things.  Balancing would be a royal pain though.

If paradox is a problem, allow time travel into the future only.
Perhaps the player can control the flow of time (from a slow crawl to
burning days/weeks/months with each action.)

There are more of these nowadays: http://baf.wurb.com/if/genre/27

Many of those games probably don't deal with the paradoxes and causality
loops you can get from time travel and just treat time travel as means
of reaching interesting settings. _All Things Devours_, however,
implements a very intricate player-controllable time-travel system.
Definitely worth checking out.

Time travel games are most interesting when time travel actually takes
you in the past of the game itself. Instead of time travel from the 20th
century to ancient Egypt, travel back 10 minutes in game time. Now
instead of interacting with a completely different setting, you're
actually interacting with the history the player has been involved in.

The problem are causality loops. A classic Infocom puzzle has you
closing a causality loop for a rather perplexing object. But here the
implementors of the game have set up the loop for the player to stumble
into. What if the player in Nethack with a time travel patch collected
the Ascension Kit and the Amulet of Yendor and then time travelled to
turn 1 on dungeon level 1 and dropped the Kit in front of the version of
the PC who has just stepped in the dungeon?

Obviously, this is a bit of a problem. If the player could do this, then
the player should have had the kitted-out high-level PC pop in at the
beginning of the game and drop the kit. This of course didn't happen, as
the game had no idea what the player was going to do when the game
started.

One idea that I think has been discussed already is the one from the new
Prince of Persia games. Instead of transporting into the past as their
current physical self, the PC can rewind time, themself included, and
then act differently starting from some past point. This is basically
just a variation of the retry save game system made into a part of the
actual game. The future gets wiped out as time is rewound, so there can
be no Ascension Kit brought into the past. But since that's just
legitimized save scumming, it's not that novel or interesting.

Maybe there could be actual time travel, but with paradox checking. Once
the player has been in some situation at some point in time, that
situation must play exactly the same way after all subsequent time
travels, or paradox will ensue and the universe will be eaten. So
obviously the PC mustn't be seen or interact with their past self in any
way. The PC mustn't drop extra items or move existing items where the
past self has seen them. The PC mustn't alter the behavior of NPCs in
the past. Creatures and NPCs are quite difficult in this system, as it
really isn't easy for the player to figure out what consists or doesn't
consist of perturbing their behavior. My common sense says that any
interaction at all with an intelligent creature can cause unpredictable
and possibly very significant changes in its future behavior. Which
might be an argument for not having many other sentient creatures beyond
the player character in the setting where time travel takes place.

This is pretty much what All Things Devours does. It has the player
going back and forth in time in an empty building, with any interaction
with the PC from the past or the past state of the surroundings
resulting immediate game over. But I'm not sure if this is feasible
beyond a short and tightly crafted adventure game.

I think this is actually doable, only I'd rather block the player when
he's attempting to perform forbidden actions, rather than kill him.
You know, the old cheezy &quot;A mysterious force stops you&quot;.

Now, you can have the area that will be explored by the &quot;past self&quot;
marked in the game, and &quot;out of limits&quot; for the &quot;future self&quot;. As
the &quot;past self&quot; explores, this area will shrink, allowing the &quot;future
self&quot; access. The &quot;future self&quot; might be blocked when trying to enter
this area, or he might become somehow ephemeral and invisible to the &quot;past
self&quot; -- or he might even be just hiding on purpose to avoid the meeting.
Of course, he would refuse dropping any items. An interesting use would be
to &quot;ride&quot; at the edge of the &quot;past self&quot; perception, so that you can avoid
fighting, and stay back once in a while to become physical and collect
items.

I just had another idea, a little ironic, though. The &quot;future self&quot; is
allowed to do anything, but as soon as any of the &quot;replayed&quot; moves of
the &quot;past self&quot; becomes invalid, he becomes aware of his presence, and,
naturally attacks his &quot;future self&quot;, always fighting to death. No matter
which side wins, it's game over.

OK, I've been thinking about a good plot that could make such a game
interesting and I've come up with this:

THE LAST DAY

The evil wizard Moloch's plan for world domination is nearly
completed. Tonight, when the solar eclipse gets to its climax, the
last of the Seven Rituals of Koth will be completed, and a Gate to the
Plane of Darkness will be opened. Once the Gate is opened, there is no
way to close it again, so the world will be swarmed with evil
creatures and all sentient races will be enslaved.

Many brave heroes have tried to stop Moloch's plans, but none of them
has returned. Seeing that the world was running out of time to stop
the evil plot, Ellnod the Sage has worked long hours during the last
days to complete his last invention: the Temporal Anchor. This
powerful artifact allows you to set an anchor in time to which you can
return as many times as you wish.

You are the last chance for saving your world. Inexperienced as you
are, you're the last fighter left in the village of Zondra (near
Moloch's lair) after all the others have disappeared into the evil
wizard's dungeon. The elder Ellnod hands you the Anchor, sets an
anchoring point at that same moment and instructs you on what you must
do: you must try to find Moloch and stop him, but as one day will
surely not be enough, you must use the Anchor before the time of the
eclipse, so as to return one day back and have another day to find the
evil wizard. However, you should not abuse the Anchor, since each time
you use it will make your quest slightly harder, for you will have to
avoid all the past incarnations of yourself: if you interact with any
of them, you will spawn a paradox that will destroy you, and probably
the world as well.

Two reasons:

Taking the paradoxes question a bit further, what happens if you go to
the past and remove some item that you, just 10 minutes ago (in
regular time), used *in the game's future*? It's not just seeing
characters and interacting with them. Anything can screw up the future
that you just played...

Why not just create parallel universes?

As you play, the events in the world are recorded. When you go back in
time, these events are replayed until you interact with something that
makes the events invalid. After that, things are just controlled by
the AI, including your past self. Events still get recorded when you
travel back in time, including the actions future-you takes in the
past.

So, killing your grandfather means that when you go back to the
present will take you to a universe where you never existed, where
supposedly the game would have simulated accordingly.

Of course, if time travel is unlimited then this allows situations
like going back to the start over and over again until you've amassed
an army of yourself. Whether this is a feature or a bug is up to the
developer.

As an aside, I've always wondered what a Dr. Who RL would be like.

You know, taken out of context this statement would raise eyebrows :)
&quot;it's simple!!&quot;

Anyways, I guess the whole record/simulate thing would probably be the
most sane way to deal with it. I would, however, prevent paradoxes by
overwriting everything the player does each time, so when you go back,
what you did in the future simply didn't happen (you traveled to a
parallel history, not the new one).

However, I *do* like the whole non-interference thing as a plot and
gameplay device, very interesting!

Just to run with the parallel universe idea, what about basing it on
alignment?  Starting off with the true neutral world, you can jump to
lawful neutral world or chaotic evil world.  Same maps, perhaps even
the same NPCs, but with the appropriate 'taint' of that world/
dimension.

I did realize a flaw in my previous message; it depends on how well
you can simulate your world.

If it's just a single dungeon and you go only a few hours back in
time, just simulating monster and past-self actions should be enough.
If you're creating a whole world and the player can travel hundreds of
years or more, you'll have to simulate family trees, wars, weather and
crops, ... The list just starts to inflate.

You also need a good way of recording every performed action, pending
action, and AI goal to be able to play them back when the player
travels back in time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My brain started working today and spat out a silly idea. It blathered
&gt; &gt; &gt; about a roguelike where you would travel between different worlds/
&gt; &gt; &gt; times. Your actions in one world, or in the past, would affect things
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the future/other world.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure there's others. Maybe even an RL?

&gt; The most advanced time travel game I've seen so far is this one :

&gt; http://www.eyezmaze.com/chronon/v0/index.html

&gt; You'd better try it with a spoiler else it will blow your mind...
&gt; (Rest snipped)

Yeah, the guy who does the Eyezmaze stuff is a genius in general. I
had actually tried that one before, but jeez, the brainwarping
difficulty.
Good catch, it's the kind of stuff I was looking for. Sort of.

Mostly because I hadn't played it. Which is probably against some

&gt; One time-travel-related idea that pops here once in a time is about

Yeah. Well, that wasn't quite what I was looking for, but it helps.
Chrono Trigger is more like it. Procedurally generated CT would be
even better. (Future people reacting to your time tampering by way of
algorithms instead of set code.) Hard to do well, I understand.

Absolutely. The easy way out is of course to decide that you can't

I've downloaded and checked out All Things Devours. Neato. It solves

As you say, maybe not very useful in a roguelike. Maybe.

I like this, too. Goes back to the Zelda: A Link To The Past game. Not

Actually there are several moments in Chronotrigger where you do meet
yourself and interfere with your own actions. One is simple, it's when
you replace Crono who is being killed by Lavos with his clone (and rescue
the original Crono in the process) -- it's all a movie sequence, so the
player cannot interfere in any way.

The more interesting moment is when you try to prevent Lucca's mother
becoming injured in one of their old experiments. You can see Lucca and
her family from upstairs, but you can't really reach them to interfere.

These are actually two places in the game where I really wanted to try
and interfere -- even when I knew it would be bad. You know, just to see
what happens. The limits imposed on me are really jarring in those two
moments.

I was playing World of Warcraft this last few days, and I got to the
bit where you travel back in time to Durnholde Keep (AKA Old Hillsbrad
Foothills).  The instance is hectic, but in spare times - or after
completing - you can visit a town called Southshore that still exists
some years later in (your) history.  You see characters you have fought
with, or against, or otherwise interacted with - in instances that were
recent in your timeline, but are still in their future.

You see some little kids playing, Sally Whitemane and Renault Mograine
(and their friend Vishnu who grows up to be the torturer).  They have a
mock fight with a frog, and reprise the battle where you (in your
timeline) have already killed them (a long time ago - thirty levels or
so) in the Scarlet Cathedral.  But for them the Cathedral event must
have been the reprise; they remember that little battle they had as
kids, and say the same words.  I found that rather affecting.
