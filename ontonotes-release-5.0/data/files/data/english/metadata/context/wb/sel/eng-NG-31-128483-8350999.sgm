Yeh I was just drunk. I think there is about 20% chance it would fly,
and that if it was published that it would get a 10% interest in anti-
zionism. But its a long shot. Not like tattsloto. It depends on the
mass pysche.

You seem to redress it so well. But perhaps I am just a 'fan'. But
then the only people I have seen attempt to deride you just say &quot;They
suck&quot;. And after trying to engage them intellectually they refuse and
attempt and succeed often to continue a play ground fight.

It wasn't until I began fighting 9/11 that I returned to kindergarten
where assholes throw sand in your face as though it is fair. I have
never known this anywhere else than 9/11 Truth activism.

Yeh, I dont know where the truth movement would be today without your
input. I can guess. For example without Alex Jones I think it would be
finished - as in, criminals found and tried.
You can't replace one king media knobster with another.

Hmm. I was just thinking - you and Daryl, your greatest voices on
humanity will ever be now, when 'no one' listens to you. lol.

Letter to myself about www.911oz.com

The three stooges
------------------
When ME got back from Israel in spring he met up with his jewish mates
John Bursill and Hereward Fenton and said to them. &quot;Hey I've got some
funny stories about the 9/11 Truth Movement. We've been starting the
local groups with Mossad when the indexes and locals are brimming to
found them theirselves. So what they do at Mossad is send out a
recruit to start one up in their locality. So guess what?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;We have to set up 911oz. For Israel. For life.&quot;

And so for the last three months ME, Hereward, and John have been
laughing their tits off. Not such much at the members who joined, but
at the walkers in the street-vigils of the 11th of every month who are
so fluoridated
indifferent that they probably couldn't give a flying shit whether
they are slaves because of it nor whether its true.

lol.

Alright boys, I'm off to Israel to become a jew.

See you in a couple of years when I get out of the Mossad.

But you missed something. I'm a digger. My great-grandfather was a
digger and he died in the trenches for the jews and their secretive
Balfour Declaration. And my mother was an orphan. Her parents died in
the airraids of WW2, again, incited by the jews and their economic
boycott on Germany.

So guess what is coming to you jews? A mighty aussie digger invasion.
We are going to invade Israel on our own, fuck the US, me and the SAS,
1100 strong supreme trained hand-to-hand sniper fuck-you-uperists, and
kick some Israeli butt. We will rape your hot women and make children
with them. And this time we won't be hunting for your WMDS, we'll be
hunting for the gold you lifted out of the WTC with your 120 special-
force IDF you had allowed to fly into NY during the NO-FLY US Airforce
embargo on the 12th of September looking for that one Israeli who
died.

We are coming to get your gold, not kill you. We know you fear the
loss of your gold more!
lol.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And my mother was an orphan. Her parents died in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the airraids of WW2, again, incited by the jews and their economic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boycott on Germany.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, she was the daughter of Anakin Skywalker

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So guess what is coming to you jews? A mighty aussie digger invasion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Will it be as &quot;mighty&quot; as your non-existent 'revolution' last year?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are going to invade Israel on our own, fuck the US, me and the SAS,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1100 strong supreme trained hand-to-hand sniper fuck-you-uperists

&gt; &gt; &gt; Bwehehehe. What exactly is a &quot;hand-to-hand sniper&quot; Jakey?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Back to your rubber-room child.....

&gt; &gt; lol. What are you doing in
&gt; &gt; Australia?????????????????????????????????????????????????

&gt; Poor Jake, sending five responses to one post. Hehehe

&gt; BTW, when is your &quot;revolution&quot; starting?
">

I'm not sure yet. Bascially I was born in Australia. You know once I
got in a fisty with a bloke in the surf. and he broke my fucking nose
the cunt - thats not digger. Many times I have thought about how I
will kill that fucker next time I see him.

But jews don't understand any of that. Look at you Tropi claim you are
a jew and defend for one second that we wouldn't kick ass in
Israel.What kind of an Aussie are you man? A jew? lol.

GO on man, flee to Israel. They don't have extradition treaties there
with ANY country.

The US will not intervene next time though,.not without civil war; Not
even with a NEW New Pearl Harbour. lol.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And my mother was an orphan. Her parents died in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the airraids of WW2, again, incited by the jews and their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; economic

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Speaking of WW2...Tex reckons the US forced the Nazis to surrender
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dropping atomic bombs on Japan.  LOL

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ah yes, that ever-changing mysterious quote you've been unable to find
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (much like your moon-hoax evidence :)

&gt;&gt; &gt; That's a bit rich from someone who's on record as saying that Yuri
&gt;&gt; &gt; Gagarin's orbit of the Earth was a hoax.

&gt;&gt; Except I've said over and over it wasn't a hoax. Now, was the Apollo 11
&gt;&gt; mission a hoax, yes or no?

&gt; Are you saying that you never said that Yuri Gagarin's orbit of the Earth
&gt; was a hoax?
">

Nope. I said it as a joke. Gagarin orbited the earth. I keep saying this
over and over, yet I noticed you avoided the question yet again :)

So, here it is once more: was the Apollo 11 mission a hoax, yes or no?

Take a chill pill ME. Its not you I'm going after its the jews. And
the reason my posts became demented on Usenet is because the jews
refuse to confront rational argument. When you are a scientific
rationalist like me, irrational conflict sends you to the drink. There
are only about three people on Usenet who oppose me ME. They are jews
and they have several sockpuppets each.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Letter to Eric Hufschmid | 08.23.07 - 9:55 am | #

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Letter to myself about www.911oz.com

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The three stooges
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When ME got back from Israel in spring he met up with his jewish mates
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John Bursill and Hereward Fenton and said to them. &quot;Hey I've got some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; funny stories about the 9/11 Truth Movement. We've been starting the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; local groups with Mossad when the indexes and locals are brimming to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found them theirselves. So what they do at Mossad is send out a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recruit to start one up in their locality. So guess what?&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What?&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We have to set up 911oz. For Israel. For life.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And so for the last three months ME, Hereward, and John have been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; laughing their tits off. Not such much at the members who joined, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the walkers in the street-vigils of the 11th of every month who are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so fluoridated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indifferent that they probably couldn't give a flying shit whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are slaves because of it nor whether its true.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lol.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alright boys, I'm off to Israel to become a jew.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See you in a couple of years when I get out of the Mossad.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But you missed something. I'm a digger. My great-grandfather was a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digger and he died in the trenches for the jews and their secretive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Balfour Declaration. And my mother was an orphan. Her parents died in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the airraids of WW2, again, incited by the jews and their economic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boycott on Germany.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So guess what is coming to you jews? A mighty aussie digger invasion.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are going to invade Israel on our own, fuck the US, me and the SAS,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1100 strong supreme trained hand-to-hand sniper fuck-you-uperists, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kick some Israeli butt. We will rape your hot women and make children
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with them. And this time we won't be hunting for your WMDS, we'll be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hunting for the gold you lifted out of the WTC with your 120 special-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; force IDF you had allowed to fly into NY during the NO-FLY US Airforce
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; embargo on the 12th of September looking for that one Israeli who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; died.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are coming to get your gold, not kill you. We know you fear the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loss of your gold more!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My great-grandfather was a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; digger and he died in the trenches for the jews and their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; secretive Balfour Declaration.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sure Jake. That's why there's no record of him ever having
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; served. What a surprise

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And my mother was an orphan. Her parents died in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the airraids of WW2, again, incited by the jews and their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; economic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; boycott on Germany.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Speaking of WW2...Tex reckons the US forced the Nazis to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; surrender
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; by dropping atomic bombs on Japan.  LOL

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ah yes, that ever-changing mysterious quote you've been unable to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; find (much like your moon-hoax evidence :)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That's a bit rich from someone who's on record as saying that Yuri
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gagarin's orbit of the Earth was a hoax.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Except I've said over and over it wasn't a hoax. Now, was the Apollo
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 11
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mission a hoax, yes or no?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Are you saying that you never said that Yuri Gagarin's orbit of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Earth was a hoax?

&gt;&gt; Nope. I said it as a joke. Gagarin orbited the earth. I keep saying this
&gt;&gt; over and over, yet I noticed you avoided the question yet again :)

&gt; Oh, I see it was only a joke, was it?  LOL

&gt; Like your &quot;joke&quot; about the US dropping atomic bombs on Japan to defeat
&gt; Nazi Germany.

No such joke was ever made Sergey

You squirmed away from the question yet again Sergey. Why are you so scared
of it? Hehehe

Here it is again: was the Apollo 11 mission a hoax, yes or no?

&gt;&gt; No, that's your job Sergey. You always do a runner and scurry away for a
&gt;&gt; few weeks getting your nerve back. Your unconditional surrenders are well
&gt;&gt; documented.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I notice you can't point to that record &lt;snort&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'll ask you again, squirm merchant.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Did you, or did you not, say that &quot;Most Jews are Jews&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Yep

Nope :)

Like your claims that Stalin defended Australia, that the Apollo 11 mission
was a hoax, and that 2 minutes is &quot;equal&quot; to 10hrs 44min :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Now, I'll ask you again squirm merchant: was the Apollo 11 mission a

I don't have a &quot;Yuri Gagarin conspiracy theory&quot; Sergey. I'll say it again:
Gagarin's mission was real.

Now Sergey, here's the question you've been running away from: was the
Apollo 11 mission a hoax? Yes or no?

Here's the question again: was the Apollo 11 mission a hoax? Yes or no?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Which Jews exactly aren't Jews?  &lt;snigger&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; None of them

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well what did you mean when you said &quot;Most Jews are Jews&quot;?

&gt;&gt; As has been explained to you over and over, it was a play on words from
&gt;&gt; what your white-supremacist friend The Rev said. He said &quot;most Jews are
&gt;&gt; athiests&quot;.

&gt; You mean the guy you tried to insult by calling him &quot;black&quot;?

No, I mean the guy you called &quot;nigger&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ....or was that just another one of your 'jokes'?

You're the one who called him &quot;nigger&quot; Sergey (just like you refer to others
as &quot;kaffirs&quot;, &quot;slopes&quot;, &quot;quarter-breeds&quot;. I guess it's part of your

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Stop avoiding the issue and tell us which Jews aren't Jews.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Already done.

Why are you scared of such a simple question Sergey?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, speaking of avoiding the issue, why haven't you been able to find
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; any evidence to support your Apollo 11 theory?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Where's your evidence that Yuri Gagarin's orbit of the Earth was a hoax
&gt;&gt; &gt; you conspiracy freak.

&gt;&gt; His orbit wasn't a hoax, as I keep saying over and over.

&gt; Then why did you say that it was?

As you've been told over and over, you brainless dolt, I was mocking your
kook Apollo 11 hoax theory. If you believe Apollo 11 was a hoax, then you
must believe Gagarin's mission was a hoax.

I'll say it again: Gagarin's mission was real.

Now Sergey, was the Apollo 11 mission a hoax, yes or no?
