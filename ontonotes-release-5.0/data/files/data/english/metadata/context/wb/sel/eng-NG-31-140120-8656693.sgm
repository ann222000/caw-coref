EXCLUSIVE: Barry Bonds' Home Run Record Tainted by Mechanical Device

By Michael Witte

NEW YORK (Commentary) Beyond his alleged steroid use, Barry Bonds is guilty
of the use of something that confers extraordinarily unfair mechanical
advantage: the “armor” that he wears on his right elbow. Amid the press
frenzy over Bonds’ unnatural bulk, the true role of the object on his right
arm has simply gone unnoticed.

This is unfortunate, because by my estimate, Bonds’ front arm “armor” may
have contributed no fewer than 75 to 100 home runs to his already
steroid-questionable total.

Bonds tied Henry Aaron’s home run record of 755 on Saturday night and will
go for the new standard this week back at home in San Francisco. As a
student of baseball – and currently a mechanics consultant to a major league
baseball team -- I believe I have insight into the Bonds &quot;achievement.&quot; I
have studied his swing countless times on video and examined the mechanical
gear closely through photographs.

For years, sportswriters remarked that his massive &quot;protective&quot; gear –
unequaled in all of baseball -- permits Bonds to lean over the plate without
fear of being hit by a pitch. Thus situated, Bonds can handle the outside
pitch (where most pitchers live) unusually well. This is unfair advantage
enough, but no longer controversial. However, it is only one of at least
seven (largely unexplored) advantages conferred by the apparatus.

The other six:

1) The apparatus is hinged at the elbow. It is a literal &quot;hitting machine&quot;
that allows Bonds to release his front arm on the same plane during every
swing. It largely accounts for the seemingly magical consistency of every
Bonds stroke.

2) The apparatus locks at the elbow when the lead arm is fully elongated
because of a small flap at the top of the bottom section that fits into a
groove in the bottom of the top section. The locked arm forms a rigid front
arm fulcrum that allows extraordinary, maximally efficient explosion of the
levers of Bonds' wrists. Bonds hands are quicker than those of average
hitters because of his mechanical &quot;assistant.&quot;

3) When Bonds swings, the weight of the apparatus helps to seal his inner
upper arm to his torso at impact. Thus &quot;connected,&quot; he automatically hits
the ball with the weight of his entire body - not just his arms - as average
hitters (&quot;extending&quot;) tend to do.

4) Bonds has performed less well in Home Run Derbies than one might expect
because he has no excuse to wear a &quot;protector&quot; facing a batting practice
pitcher. As he tires, his front arm elbow tends to lift and he swings under
the ball, producing towering pop flies or topspin liners that stay in the
park. When the apparatus is worn, its weight keeps his elbow down and he
drives the ball with backspin.

5) Bonds enjoys quicker access to the inside pitch than average hitters
because his &quot;assistant&quot; - counter-intuitively - allows him to turn more
rapidly. Everyone understands that skaters accelerate their spins by pulling
their arms into their torsos, closer to their axes of rotation. When Bonds
is confronted with an inside pitch, he spins like a skater because his upper
front arm is &quot;assistant&quot;-sealed tightly against the side of his chest.

6) At impact, Bonds has additional mass (the weight of his &quot;assistant&quot;) not
available to the average hitter. The combined weight of &quot;assistant&quot; and bat
is probably equal to the weight of the lumber wielded by Babe Ruth but with
more manageable weight distribution.

Bonds has worn some sort of front arm protection since 1992. In '94, a
one-piece forearm guard was replaced by a jointed, two piece elbow model. In
‘95 it got bigger and a small &quot;cap&quot; on the elbow was replaced by a &quot;flap&quot;
that overlapped the upper piece and locked the two pieces together when the
arm was elongated. In '96, the &quot;apparatus&quot; grew even larger and so did the
&quot;flap.&quot;

It seems to have remained relatively the same until -- interestingly— 2001,
the year of his record 73 home runs, when an advanced model appeared made
(apparently) of a new material. It had softer edges and a groove for the
flap to slip into automatically at full arm elongation. More important, the
upper half of the machine was sculpted to conform more comfortably to the
contours of Bonds' upper arm. Since 2001, the apparatus seems to have
remained relatively unchanged.

Several years back, baseball was rightfully scandalized by the revelation
that Sammy Sosa had &quot;corked&quot; his bat. The advantages conferred by the Bonds
&quot;hitting machine,&quot; however, far exceed anything supplied by cork.
Ultimately, it appears the Bonds &quot;achievement” must be regarded as partly
the product of “double duplicity&quot; -- steroidal and mechanical.

I buy the first part about body armor making him less afraid of being hit.
The rest, you'd really need to examine the device first hand.

But the elbow pad has secret compartments.  It's what's inside the

Baby Bonds wouldn't be setting the new career record for homeruns.

Speaking as a lifelong baseball fan of over 40 years I can state that
major-league baseball sold its soul for TV/radio/merchandise revenue in the
early '90s.  The owners wanted money, the players' union wanted money, so
this is what we end up with -- a disgrace.

Babe Ruth hit 60 homers in '27 and it took 34 years for someone (Maris) to
break that record.  It took another 37 years to break Maris's record not by
one person but by two (McGwire 70, Sosa 66).  Then it only took two years
for McGwire's record to be broken (Bonds 73).  In 1999, McGwire hit 65, Sosa
hit 63.  In 01, Sosa hit 64.  In '98, '99, and '01, you had three guys hit
between 63 and 73 homers.  There is no way they did it without the aid of
steroids or 'mechanical' devices.

Major-league baseball has become nothing more than sports entertainment,
just like professional wrestling.

Baseball, is the stupiest game ever invented.
Since the idiots bitch and moan about homerun
crap, but never about pitcher crap.
Since Ruth was mostly known as one of the first
grease-ball pitchers,  long before he was known as a slugger.

&gt; &gt; seven (largely unexplored) advantages conferred by the apparatus.

&gt; &gt; The other six:

&gt; &gt; 1) The apparatus is hinged at the elbow. It is a literal &quot;hitting machine&quot;
&gt; &gt; that allows Bonds to release his front arm on the same plane during every
&gt; &gt; swing. It largely accounts for the seemingly magical consistency of every
&gt; &gt; Bonds stroke.

&gt; &gt; 2) The apparatus locks at the elbow when the lead arm is fully elongated
&gt; &gt; because of a small flap at the top of the bottom section that fits into a
&gt; &gt; groove in the bottom of the top section. The locked arm forms a rigid
&gt; &gt; front
&gt; &gt; arm fulcrum that allows extraordinary, maximally efficient explosion of
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; levers of Bonds' wrists. Bonds hands are quicker than those of average
&gt; &gt; hitters because of his mechanical &quot;assistant.&quot;

&gt; &gt; 3) When Bonds swings, the weight of the apparatus helps to seal his inner
&gt; &gt; upper arm to his torso at impact. Thus &quot;connected,&quot; he automatically hits
&gt; &gt; the ball with the weight of his entire body - not just his arms - as
&gt; &gt; average
&gt; &gt; hitters (&quot;extending&quot;) tend to do.

&gt; &gt; 4) Bonds has performed less well in Home Run Derbies than one might expect
&gt; &gt; because he has no excuse to wear a &quot;protector&quot; facing a batting practice
&gt; &gt; pitcher. As he tires, his front arm elbow tends to lift and he swings
&gt; &gt; under
&gt; &gt; the ball, producing towering pop flies or topspin liners that stay in the
&gt; &gt; park. When the apparatus is worn, its weight keeps his elbow down and he
&gt; &gt; drives the ball with backspin.

&gt; &gt; 5) Bonds enjoys quicker access to the inside pitch than average hitters
&gt; &gt; because his &quot;assistant&quot; - counter-intuitively - allows him to turn more
&gt; &gt; rapidly. Everyone understands that skaters accelerate their spins by
&gt; &gt; pulling
&gt; &gt; their arms into their torsos, closer to their axes of rotation. When Bonds
&gt; &gt; is confronted with an inside pitch, he spins like a skater because his
&gt; &gt; upper
&gt; &gt; front arm is &quot;assistant&quot;-sealed tightly against the side of his chest.

&gt; &gt; 6) At impact, Bonds has additional mass (the weight of his &quot;assistant&quot;)
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; available to the average hitter. The combined weight of &quot;assistant&quot; and
&gt; &gt; bat
&gt; &gt; is probably equal to the weight of the lumber wielded by Babe Ruth but
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; more manageable weight distribution.

&gt; &gt; Bonds has worn some sort of front arm protection since 1992. In '94, a
&gt; &gt; one-piece forearm guard was replaced by a jointed, two piece elbow model.
&gt; &gt; In
&gt; &gt; '95 it got bigger and a small &quot;cap&quot; on the elbow was replaced by a &quot;flap&quot;
&gt; &gt; that overlapped the upper piece and locked the two pieces together when
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; arm was elongated. In '96, the &quot;apparatus&quot; grew even larger and so did the
&gt; &gt; &quot;flap.&quot;

&gt; &gt; It seems to have remained relatively the same until -- interestingly-
&gt; &gt; 2001,
&gt; &gt; the year of his record 73 home runs, when an advanced model appeared made
&gt; &gt; (apparently) of a new material. It had softer edges and a groove for the
&gt; &gt; flap to slip into automatically at full arm elongation. More important,
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; upper half of the machine was sculpted to conform more comfortably to the
&gt; &gt; contours of Bonds' upper arm. Since 2001, the apparatus seems to have
&gt; &gt; remained relatively unchanged.

&gt; &gt; Several years back, baseball was rightfully scandalized by the revelation
&gt; &gt; that Sammy Sosa had &quot;corked&quot; his bat. The advantages conferred by the
&gt; &gt; Bonds
&gt; &gt; &quot;hitting machine,&quot; however, far exceed anything supplied by cork.
&gt; &gt; Ultimately, it appears the Bonds &quot;achievement&quot; must be regarded as partly
&gt; &gt; the product of &quot;double duplicity&quot; -- steroidal and mechanical.

&gt; &gt; EXCLUSIVE: Barry Bonds' Home Run Record Tainted by Mechanical Device

&gt; &gt; By Michael Witte

&gt; &gt; Published: August 06, 2007
&gt; &gt; Editor And Publisher

&gt; &gt; NEW YORK (Commentary) Beyond his alleged steroid use, Barry Bonds is
&gt; &gt; guilty
&gt; &gt; of the use of something that confers extraordinarily unfair mechanical
&gt; &gt; advantage: the &quot;armor&quot; that he wears on his right elbow. Amid the press
&gt; &gt; frenzy over Bonds' unnatural bulk, the true role of the object on his
&gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; arm has simply gone unnoticed.

&gt; &gt; This is unfortunate, because by my estimate, Bonds' front arm &quot;armor&quot; may
&gt; &gt; have contributed no fewer than 75 to 100 home runs to his already
&gt; &gt; steroid-questionable total.

&gt; &gt; Bonds tied Henry Aaron's home run record of 755 on Saturday night and will
&gt; &gt; go for the new standard this week back at home in San Francisco. As a
&gt; &gt; student of baseball - and currently a mechanics consultant to a major
&gt; &gt; league
&gt; &gt; baseball team -- I believe I have insight into the Bonds &quot;achievement.&quot; I
&gt; &gt; have studied his swing countless times on video and examined the
&gt; &gt; mechanical
&gt; &gt; gear closely through photographs.

&gt; &gt; For years, sportswriters remarked that his massive &quot;protective&quot; gear -
&gt; &gt; unequaled in all of baseball -- permits Bonds to lean over the plate
&gt; &gt; without
&gt; &gt; fear of being hit by a pitch. Thus situated, Bonds can handle the outside
&gt; &gt; pitch (where most pitchers live) unusually well. This is unfair advantage
&gt; &gt; enough, but no longer controversial. However, it is only one of at least
&gt; &gt; seven (largely unexplored) advantages conferred by the apparatus.

&gt; &gt; The other six:

&gt; &gt; 1) The apparatus is hinged at the elbow. It is a literal &quot;hitting machine&quot;
&gt; &gt; that allows Bonds to release his front arm on the same plane during every

&gt; &gt; 2) The apparatus locks at the elbow when the lead arm is fully elongated

Before comparing statistics. how many games are they playing in a season?

Or.. rather than Babe Ruth hitting 60 homers in a season. how about. 60
homers in how many games/ who many turns at bat? much more meaningful
unless game numbers are the same...

If your team makes a conference final (I'm guessing here) that adds
games to your season... so on a winning team you get more chances to
bat, = more chances of home runs...

Then compare that with the others..

It's just like the highest grossing films.. notice how they all tend to
be modern.. Inflation will do that to you if you don't have a
standardised unit of measure...

Before comparing the math, you should also compare
Ruth's 1927 Team roster and Marris' 1961 Team Roster.
Since it's the ABs and carreer hitting stats vs good fastball
pitchers that are going to determine single season HR records,
not the press.
