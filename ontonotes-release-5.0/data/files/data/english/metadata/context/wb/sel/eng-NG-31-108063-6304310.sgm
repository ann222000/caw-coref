I am in the midst of removing some overgrowth on a slope in my
backyard.  Previous owners let the hill go crazy.  After removal of
some large yucca trees the remaining honeysuckle (which the yucca
supported) looks woody and bare... It grows through the border fence
from my neighbor's side and looks horrible.

My question is two fold.  First, the roots/base are on his side and
the plant curves through the iron fence into my yard (roots/branches),
about a foot and a half in and 10 feet up, then the crown leans back
into his yard.  Can I cut the branches and roots back to the property
line?  Really my intention is to replace the overgrown trees and
shrubs with new landscaping and restore privacy (eventually).  The
neighbor wants the tree left as is.  I want to accommodate but I also
want my property unfettered by this honeysuckle.  Trouble is if I cut
the tree where it encroaches on my property it will take down the bulk
of the tree... However, the bulk of the tree *is* in my yard.

Second, the woody portions of the honeysuckle that support the leafy
crown, will it grow leaves on it disguising the brown woody mess with
leaves and flowers?  I would be inclined to leave the tree if it did
not look so messy and brown.

I live in Southern California...

Thanks,

Harison

First you have to have the answer to a question. What does state and
local law say about your neighbors plants encroaching on your property?
Where I live if it's on my side of the property line I have the right to
cut off that which is encroaching. Neighbor's wishes not withstanding.
Either look it up on line or ask a lawyer, then do what is allowed.

Regardless what the law allows, pissing off a neighbor is rarely a good
thing in the long run.

Are you saying that the tangle of honeysuckle roots are on his side
and yours?  And it's like a viney tree?
If you trim back the vines they should resprout.  You might want to
just try a few first. If you trim it back too much all at once you
could kill the tree / vine.  It sounds like trimming it all back the
way you want might be too much for the plant.

As a short term fix you could plant some annual vines like sweet peas
or nasturtium to fill in the bare parts.

good luck
Laura

up here cutting it to the ground without removing the roots is called renewal
pruning.  honeysuckle will come back lush from ground level stump.  Ingrid
