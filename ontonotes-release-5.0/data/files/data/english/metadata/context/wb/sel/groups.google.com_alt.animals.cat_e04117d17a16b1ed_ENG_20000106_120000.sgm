"/> Cats fart, they burp and some of them have dandruffs as well.

The only difference with humans is that they don't scratch their belly
button sitting on the sofa in front of a football match. (But yes, they do
have a belly button. By the way, has anyone ever seen their cat's belly
button ??? I've tried so many times without any success !)

Honestly, I wouldn't bother for the cat's farting problem. Probably the Max
Lite food is quite rich in fibers because it is lite and your cat has some
problems to digest it.

"/> Yep. My 2 kittens, Shadow &amp; Ebby, fart all the time. And they're on a
super-premium food (Flint River Ranch) and in perfect health. I have no
idea why they fart, but they do and good grief, it stinks worse than their
treats!! *G*

per say, but it does exist, at least for a small portion of the cat's life.

if my cat would even let me touch his belly let alone hold him down and
touch his belly, it would make him very upset, he doesn't like me to touch
his tummy, dunno why, I guess it is just his thing I guess....I wouldn't
mind seeing if he has one, he is still young enough I could if he would only
let me touch his tummy...

hello alkhemy,

A so called diet food is filled with fiber which can cause gas. Try
switching the brand of diet food.

You should also know that IMO, these diet foods are meant to reduce the
weight of the cat. It should not be used as a long time maintenance
food. If it takes too long, then the cat may suffer from other health
problems. Though the manufacturers will probably deny this.

As with people, exercise is a key factor in weight loss and some people
can be on diets all their life without success. Try to get the cat more
active. Keep a record of how heavy the cat is. Ask your vet how long
it will take to get the cat back to normal weight. If it takes longer,
perhaps you might get another cat. This should give your cat a little
something to keep it busy.

Good luck, Sandy in Laval, Quebec

thanks for the info, I just started him last month on this lower fat food,
as he is not too overweight, he was almost 12 pounds last vet visit last
summer, when he had his shots and had a bladder infection, (that is one
reason I have to feed him special food) and he doesn't seem to *fart* that
often that I can smell, this food that i get him has no corn and fillers as
most store bought food, and is low in the stuff that crystalizes their
urine, as he was neutered at 4 months so he is more prone to bladder
infections (or so the vet told me), and this food is like science diet, but
a litter more user friendly on the checkbook, although I would spend what is
necessary to keep my little furball healthy. thank you again...D ;)
