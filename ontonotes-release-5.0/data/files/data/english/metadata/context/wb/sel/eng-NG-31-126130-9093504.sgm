Does Bruce Like Rap?

Does anyone here know if Bruce likes or listens to rap music at all? I
am a big fan of rap going way back and also listen to a lot of gansta
rap and curious what Bruce thinks of the genre. I think it would be so
cool if he did a duet with a rapper or maybe even rapped a bit himself
to reach out to the younger generation.

He liked disco and said so, citing the anti-disco &quot;disco-sucks&quot;

He also said in an interview yers back that Eminem was Really good, or
great or some other superlative.

I can't remember the interview, but I distinctly remember him making
some positive comments about Ludacris.

He should get Dr Dre to produce. That guy did wonders for Snoop Dogg's

Rap has just about replaced English as the American language. Bruce
should keep up with the times. I think he might make a really good
rapper especially with his social conscience. Having Clarence as a
hype man and a cast member from the Sopranos would add to his street
cred.

One's opinion on this thread will likley dcopme down to how much you
liked or disliked the Steven Mix of 57 Channels, which I loved and
still love.

I'm interested in hearing Bruce do any Genre.  I&quot;m least interested in
him doingmainstream pop/rock.

I like to hear somehting hip-hop-Rap from him.

I'd like to hear him do Metal.

Pure Country (old school, like Hank, or Conway, would be nice).

I'd like to hear him do a straight SOUL album full of stuff like Back
in Your Arms AGain where he just gets his Otis Redding on and rips
it.

I'd like him to do an album with only five or six LONG songs on them
with long icvomplex instruemtnal passages like NYC Seranade.

And I'm happy to hear another album like The Rising or Magic too.
Like everyone here, whatever he brings, I&quot;ll check out.

But I think I'm pretty repdisposed to being more excited about a
deprature or immersion into a style he doesn't usually immerse in.
Virtually Any departure is always insteresting to me, thats why I
loved the Seeger sessions stuff so much, and still listen to it a lot.

I dunno, Disco was huge in white suburban Ohio where I grew up. Only
the hard rock people and/or California Sound afficinados despised it.
But Brucey might be onto somehitng, as I recall reading that the one
region of the country that DIsco never really took hold with whites
was the South, except in Florida.

Or is it just plain wrong of me to draw a connection between racism,
veiled or not-so-veiled, and the south?

This was exciting stuff and a direction he could have followed on
record. The HT/LT band would have been good for this, with the right
producer.

I think a Bruce rap album would be a comic misstep. To allow it to
heavily influence, sink into his music. That's another story.

Does he have any inclination towards it? Post Steel Mill? I'm not
sure.

Seems like this will probably happen at some point. But more of an
alterna-country vibe I'd think.

Anything that gets us another Back In Your Arms again is welcome. How
he doesn't regard that as a nightly fixture, I'll never understand.

This is a BRILLIANT idea. I would flip for this. TWTIATESS is an album
almost without precedence or followup in his canon. I wonder if he
could do long, brooding, romantic anymore without undercutting it with
real-world lyrics or subtleties. He seems incapable of that anymore
(not that that's a good or bad thing). Livin' In The Future is a real
mind-bender as the music tells you to dance and let go and the lyrics
suggest your lack of vigilance is the problem. Sha na na na.

Terrific record. Its relative failure said more about his fans'
conservative taste and nostalgia than anything else.

Any chance the white suburban Ohio you grew up in was a good part the
the result of white flight?  Or is it just be plain wrong of me to
