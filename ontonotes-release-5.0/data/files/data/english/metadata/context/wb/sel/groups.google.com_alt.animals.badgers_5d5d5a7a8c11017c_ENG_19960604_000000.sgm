I dont think your'e going to do much buisness for a few reasons.

1) Nobody in particular owns a newsgroup, so there is no specific person
that is going to plop down $$ to buy them.

2) Newsgroups are purely non-graphical. Even graphic binarys posted have
to be turned into textfiles to be on a newsgroup.

I would guess that you mean web pages. You know, I even thought that holograms
needed to be specially imprinted with lasers and such, so a hologram on a
computer screen would not work..

Look at me, I'm replying to a spam!
