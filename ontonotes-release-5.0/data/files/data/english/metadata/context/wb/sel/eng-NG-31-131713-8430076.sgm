I just listened to this, and though I may get voted off the island for
this opinion, like so much of Goldsmith's output post-1990, I just
don't get the fuss that surrounds this score. It's dominated by a
nice lyrical melody that Goldsmith very nicely pounds into our
heads, and...well, it's just &quot;nice&quot;. It never really rises to anything
or plumbs any particular depths. This is yet another of the long list
of scores from Goldsmith's late era which I believe would not be
held in nearly as high esteem had it been written by some guy
named Frank Friggleheimer.

Oh well...I'll always have &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot;.

You are being cast OFF our island..Kidding.

I admire Rudy and think there is more depth
there than you think, Jaq.  But hey, different
strokes.  He does have two themes, I think.
There is the lyrical melody, and the there is
the rousing work-out music which I really love.
His orchestrations for the work-out music I
feel are great, especially the violins.  I always
felt sorry for the violinists  who had to play
that piece.  I heard they applauded him at
the end of that piece.  Anyway, I personally
believe it is Great Goldsmith from the 90's.
I also felt that way about his 13th Warrior
and Mulan, but differing opinions are just
fine.  (However, we all know that
Cleo's opinions reign supreme.:))

Cleo hears two themes cuz she had funny ears... but Rudy to ME is a
one theme, albeit a lovely theme, opera... that is tiresome after
endless repetition.  Remember Dave M from long long ago on r.m.m.?  He
even owns all things Goldsmith (including underpants) and had gone to
England to see him perform... and a 15 minute suite of Rudy nearly
drove him insane.  So even the faithful have their breaking point.  I
don't consider Rudy one of Goldsmith's late era works, however.

Silly Mummified Queen... Parsnips are good for your health and never
wrong... except that possibly Hari Krishna's MIGHT enjoy bouncing up
and down to the repetitive quality of Rudy.  Much has been made of
this film and how Goldsmith wept after conducting a cue (probably from
relief) and the orchestra applauded (probably from relief)... but then
it seems that Goldsmith always receved standing ovations from his
orchestras.  Such things are handed out too cheaply now a days.

Tyer Bates was probably ordered to box his up and ship 'em to
Goldenthal. (I still like 3/4 of the 300 score no matter where it came
from)

Rudy came out in 1993, and Goldsmith's fifty-year career ended with
his death eleven years later. When exactly WAS his late era, then???

And sorry, Cleo, but there's nothing at all in this score that doesn't
sound to me like it could have come out of the typical Alan Sylvestri
or James Horner score of the same period. Great Goldsmith of the
90s? Rudy's not even close to &quot;LA Confidential&quot; in quality...but then,
I'm one who thinks that Goldsmith's final decade mostly produced
dull and interchangeable music.

I like 13th Warrior, although it too tends to pound away on
a single melody (thus falling into line with Hobgood's notion
that audiences are too aurally stupid to follow more than one
melodic line in a filmscore) and the action music is pretty
much the same action music Goldsmith wrote in every other
epic action flick he scored the last years of his life. Mulan,
though, bores me to tears. Never liked it, and I nearly choked
when I read Southall praise it as the &quot;finest music ever written
for an animated film&quot;. Five minutes of Carl Stalling's pastiche
work for a Looney Tunes short is better than all of Mulan!

I'd say his late era was The Mummy, 13th Warrior, The Haunting and
Timeline.... (*)

I would never say tha-at!  I like The Mummy (hated the film), liked 13
Warrior (hated the film), didn't care for his score for the Haunting
(despised the film), and enjoyed Timrline even though it wasn't in teh
film (which was stupid except for Gerald Butler).

Rudy is one of those much beloved scores... it has one thrilling cue
and that's about it.  The Ghost &amp; the Darkness has one thrilling cue
other wise its sinks with its silly Irishy ditty.

Goldsmith obviously loved movies, even the duds, but did on occasion
write a dud.

(*)

Powder came earlier, and is a delicate and special gem of a score.
There are about 2-3 bits of music missing from the sound track release
as well as the recreation of a 'main theme' opener that doesn't happen
in the movie.  I could carp about wanting a new version of this score
that includes those 2-3 bits... but I'm okay.

Especially when I am getting a gift of that new Wind &amp; the Lion
release.

Hobgoblin and Southpaw are just mere nobodies who have risen to higher
nobody standards thanks to the Internet where anyone can set up a soap
box and call themselves KING.  Who cares what they say?  Who cares
what any of us say?  It certainly isn't going to colour our opinion of
something we already enjoy.

I mean, we aren't talking Star Wars here, are we?

(heh)

What counts is if we succeed in introducing one another to a piece of
music that we HOLY COW actually enjoy.

I mean, again, think of TRUE WOMEN... a western (gulp) of great merit.

Or, the Zimmer pieces that Gummy introduced to me, or Black Stallion
that Cleo introduced to me.

No go listen to Star Trek Nemesis or Ravel's Bolero and calm down.

Goldsmith's score for THE SECRET OF NIMH towers over his one for
MULAN. Though once again, it's different strokes for different folks.
I read somewhere that Patrick Doyle thinks it's one of Goldsmith's
crowning acheivements. So there you have it. We all find something
different to like or dislike within a certain piece of writing.

I read that Goldsmith was confused (as eventually was the audience)
whether or not Nimh was for children or for adults... so in the long
run he scored it as an adult movie.  It was a very beautiful movie in
its day.  Every once in a while I like to watch a film that doesn't
remind me of anything human... this was one of those.... now I just
watch 300.

I think Cleo sent me something of Mulan... if she did... it didn't
connect.

It fascinates me that a majority of collectors 'hate' this NEMESIS
score. I've seen the film several times on the big screen and have the
dvd. The music Goldsmith wrote for a number of specific scenes is
brilliant. All of the music for the final third of the film is spot
on. Unfortunately, Varese only released 45 minutes of the score
leaving out a huge chunk of excellent music. Fortunately, I have the 2
disc recording sessions of the score and all that wonderful music is
included. Tense action scoring that takes no prisoners. That builds
and builds with intensity, leading up to the fateful ramming of the
saucer section into the enemy craft. All that music is grand and super
thrilling. A solid B effort from Goldsmith. The music won't rank as
some of his best action scoring but it sure as hell isn't the turkey
everyone who hates the score would have you believe.

&gt; whether or not Nimh was for children or for adults... so in the long
&gt; run he scored it as an adult movie.  It was a very beautiful movie in
&gt; its day.  Every once in a while I like to watch a film that doesn't
&gt; remind me of anything human... this was one of those.... now I just
&gt; watch 300.

&gt; I think Cleo sent me something of Mulan... if she did... it didn't

Yes, it is. It's a complete dud. Sorry, but this is by far the worst
thing
I ever heard Goldsmith write. I saw the film and found that great
action
music to be the same stuff that he wrote for most of his action scenes
during his last years...page after page of string ostinatos and

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh well...I'll always have &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You are being cast OFF our island..Kidding.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I admire Rudy and think there is more depth
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;there than you think, Jaq.  But hey, different
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;strokes.  He does have two themes, I think.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;There is the lyrical melody, and the there is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the rousing work-out music which I really love.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;His orchestrations for the work-out music I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;feel are great, especially the violins.  I always
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;felt sorry for the violinists  who had to play
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that piece.  I heard they applauded him at
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the end of that piece.  Anyway, I personally
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;believe it is Great Goldsmith from the 90's.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I also felt that way about his 13th Warrior
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and Mulan, but differing opinions are just
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fine.  (However, we all know that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Cleo's opinions reign supreme.:))

&gt; &gt;&gt; Cleo hears two themes cuz she had funny ears... but Rudy to ME is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; one theme, albeit a lovely theme, opera... that is tiresome after
&gt; &gt;&gt; endless repetition.  Remember Dave M from long long ago on r.m.m.?  He
&gt; &gt;&gt; even owns all things Goldsmith (including underpants) and had gone to
&gt; &gt;&gt; England to see him perform... and a 15 minute suite of Rudy nearly
&gt; &gt;&gt; drove him insane.  So even the faithful have their breaking point.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; don't consider Rudy one of Goldsmith's late era works, however.

&gt; &gt;Rudy came out in 1993, and Goldsmith's fifty-year career ended with
&gt; &gt;his death eleven years later. When exactly WAS his late era, then???

&gt; I'd say his late era was The Mummy, 13th Warrior, The Haunting and
&gt; Timeline.... (*)

&gt; &gt;And sorry, Cleo, but there's nothing at all in this score that doesn't
&gt; &gt;sound to me like it could have come out of the typical Alan Sylvestri
&gt; &gt;or James Horner score of the same period. Great Goldsmith of the
&gt; &gt;90s? Rudy's not even close to &quot;LA Confidential&quot; in quality...but then,
&gt; &gt;I'm one who thinks that Goldsmith's final decade mostly produced
&gt; &gt;dull and interchangeable music.

&gt; I would never say tha-at!
">

I would, and I did! Sorry, folks, but for me, whenever I listen to a
selection
of Goldsmith's post-1990 output, a feeling of depressing same-ness
settles over me. The same orchestrations. The same rhythms. The same
approach to scoring action, suspense, tender moments. The same brass
writing. The same figures in the strings. The wonderful sense of
freshness,
of experimentation, that so often marked his earlier (and greatest)
scores
is almost entirely gone. I am almost always disappointed by what I
hear
in his later work, and I am almost always thrilled deeply by what I
hear in
what had gone before.

I own a lot of these scores, and I've listened to each and every one
of them
multiple times in various attempts to find whatever it is in them that
I'm
missing, and almost without exception, I find that it all sounds
almost
entirely the same, with only the melodies to make the difference (or a
few
ethnic percussion instruments thrown in). Now, that's not to say that
I
detest all that music, since I do think there are some keepers there
(Timeline,
Star Trek First Contact, Powder, LA Confidential), but even those
don't even
begin to approach in quality scores like Planet of the Apes,
Chinatown,
the Omen trilogy, Patton, Tora!Tora!Tora!, or the towering Legend.

&gt; &gt; I like 13th Warrior, although it too tends to pound away on
&gt; &gt; a single melody (thus falling into line with Hobgood's notion
&gt; &gt; that audiences are too aurally stupid to follow more than one
&gt; &gt; melodic line in a filmscore) and the action music is pretty
&gt; &gt; much the same action music Goldsmith wrote in every other
&gt; &gt; epic action flick he scored the last years of his life. Mulan,
&gt; &gt; though, bores me to tears. Never liked it, and I nearly choked
&gt; &gt; when I read Southall praise it as the &quot;finest music ever written
&gt; &gt; for an animated film&quot;. Five minutes of Carl Stalling's pastiche
&gt; &gt; work for a Looney Tunes short is better than all of Mulan!

&gt; Goldsmith's score for THE SECRET OF NIMH towers over his one for
&gt; MULAN.

I completely agree with that. NIMH is terrific. Mulan? Meh.

Well, given that his career started in the early 1950s, it seems easy
to
me to demarcate his &quot;late period&quot; with everything after Total Recall
(which
I hold to be the last unquestionably great thing he composed). In a
fifty-year
career, the last fourteen years seems to me to be a good &quot;late
period&quot;,
especially since so much of it is cut from similar cloth.

Those long chords in the brass is the stuff. Especially the music
dealing with the first battle confrontation(which was ommitted from
the Varese release). This is the only portion of the score where he
has the greatest number of brass players unify to produce a powerful
release of sound as the Enterprise is being bombarded by phaser fire.
It's one of my favorite pieces of music on the entire soundtrack. I
would play that two minute track over and over again, being swept up
by the power of the brass playing. Damn thrilling stuff! There's a
wonderful assurance about that piece of music . . . that Goldsmith and
the players 'nailed it' with the visuals.

Nothing to be sorry about. It's only opinions. I've been able to
derive great pleasure from those specific tracks of music and I'm not
sorry for the journey at all. The fact that you find it dull means
that . . . you find it dull. That's all. Fortunately we're not dealing
with absolutes. Yuk Yuk.

Hmm... but ST First Contact, Powder, La Confidential are different
films than his earlier efforts... I would expect them to sound
different.  It is not EASY to strike a homer every time you come to
bat, or create a masterpiece everytime you set down to create... but
Goldsmith even at his weakest could still outshine the efforts of the
films as well as other composers around him.... and yes, LEGEND is his
tower.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I like 13th Warrior, although it too tends to pound away on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a single melody (thus falling into line with Hobgood's notion
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that audiences are too aurally stupid to follow more than one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; melodic line in a filmscore) and the action music is pretty
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; much the same action music Goldsmith wrote in every other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; epic action flick he scored the last years of his life. Mulan,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; though, bores me to tears. Never liked it, and I nearly choked
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; when I read Southall praise it as the &quot;finest music ever written
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for an animated film&quot;. Five minutes of Carl Stalling's pastiche
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; work for a Looney Tunes short is better than all of Mulan!

&gt;&gt; &gt;Goldsmith's score for THE SECRET OF NIMH towers over his one for
&gt;&gt; &gt;MULAN. Though once again, it's different strokes for different folks.
&gt;&gt; &gt;I read somewhere that Patrick Doyle thinks it's one of Goldsmith's
&gt;&gt; &gt;crowning acheivements. So there you have it. We all find something
&gt;&gt; &gt;different to like or dislike within a certain piece of writing.

&gt;&gt; I read that Goldsmith was confused (as eventually was the audience)
&gt;&gt; whether or not Nimh was for children or for adults... so in the long
&gt;&gt; run he scored it as an adult movie.  It was a very beautiful movie in
&gt;&gt; its day.  Every once in a while I like to watch a film that doesn't
&gt;&gt; remind me of anything human... this was one of those.... now I just
&gt;&gt; watch 300.

&gt;&gt; I think Cleo sent me something of Mulan... if she did... it didn't
&gt;&gt; connect.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I just listened to this, and though I may get voted off the island for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this opinion, like so much of Goldsmith's output post-1990, I just
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don't get the fuss that surrounds this score. It's dominated by a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nice lyrical melody that Goldsmith very nicely pounds into our
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; heads, and...well, it's just &quot;nice&quot;. It never really rises to anything
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or plumbs any particular depths. This is yet another of the long list
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of scores from Goldsmith's late era which I believe would not be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; held in nearly as high esteem had it been written by some guy
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; named Frank Friggleheimer.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh well...I'll always have &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You are being cast OFF our island..Kidding.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I admire Rudy and think there is more depth
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;there than you think, Jaq.  But hey, different
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;strokes.  He does have two themes, I think.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;There is the lyrical melody, and the there is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the rousing work-out music which I really love.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;His orchestrations for the work-out music I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;feel are great, especially the violins.  I always
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;felt sorry for the violinists  who had to play
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that piece.  I heard they applauded him at
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the end of that piece.  Anyway, I personally
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;believe it is Great Goldsmith from the 90's.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I also felt that way about his 13th Warrior
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and Mulan, but differing opinions are just
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fine.  (However, we all know that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Cleo's opinions reign supreme.:))

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cleo hears two themes cuz she had funny ears... but Rudy to ME is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one theme, albeit a lovely theme, opera... that is tiresome after
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; endless repetition.  Remember Dave M from long long ago on r.m.m.?  He
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; even owns all things Goldsmith (including underpants) and had gone to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; England to see him perform... and a 15 minute suite of Rudy nearly
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; drove him insane.  So even the faithful have their breaking point.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don't consider Rudy one of Goldsmith's late era works, however.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Rudy came out in 1993, and Goldsmith's fifty-year career ended with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;his death eleven years later. When exactly WAS his late era, then???

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'd say his late era was The Mummy, 13th Warrior, The Haunting and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Timeline.... (*)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And sorry, Cleo, but there's nothing at all in this score that doesn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;sound to me like it could have come out of the typical Alan Sylvestri
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;or James Horner score of the same period. Great Goldsmith of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;90s? Rudy's not even close to &quot;LA Confidential&quot; in quality...but then,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I'm one who thinks that Goldsmith's final decade mostly produced
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;dull and interchangeable music.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I would never say tha-at!

&gt; &gt;I would, and I did! Sorry, folks, but for me, whenever I listen to a
&gt; &gt;selection
&gt; &gt;of Goldsmith's post-1990 output, a feeling of depressing same-ness
&gt; &gt;settles over me. The same orchestrations. The same rhythms. The same
&gt; &gt;approach to scoring action, suspense, tender moments. The same brass
&gt; &gt;writing. The same figures in the strings. The wonderful sense of
&gt; &gt;freshness,
&gt; &gt;of experimentation, that so often marked his earlier (and greatest)
&gt; &gt;scores
&gt; &gt;is almost entirely gone. I am almost always disappointed by what I
&gt; &gt;hear
&gt; &gt;in his later work, and I am almost always thrilled deeply by what I
&gt; &gt;hear in
&gt; &gt;what had gone before.

&gt; &gt;I own a lot of these scores, and I've listened to each and every one
&gt; &gt;of them
&gt; &gt;multiple times in various attempts to find whatever it is in them that
&gt; &gt;I'm
&gt; &gt;missing, and almost without exception, I find that it all sounds
&gt; &gt;almost
&gt; &gt;entirely the same, with only the melodies to make the difference (or a
&gt; &gt;few
&gt; &gt;ethnic percussion instruments thrown in). Now, that's not to say that
&gt; &gt;I
&gt; &gt;detest all that music, since I do think there are some keepers there
&gt; &gt;(Timeline,
&gt; &gt;Star Trek First Contact, Powder, LA Confidential), but even those
&gt; &gt;don't even
&gt; &gt;begin to approach in quality scores like Planet of the Apes,
&gt; &gt;Chinatown,
&gt; &gt;the Omen trilogy, Patton, Tora!Tora!Tora!, or the towering Legend.

&gt; Hmm... but ST First Contact, Powder, La Confidential are different
&gt; films than his earlier efforts... I would expect them to sound
&gt; different.  It is not EASY to strike a homer every time you come to
&gt; bat, or create a masterpiece everytime you set down to create... but
&gt; Goldsmith even at his weakest could still outshine the efforts of the
&gt; films as well as other composers around him.... and yes, LEGEND is his
&gt; tower.
">

See, that last is what I don't agree with: Goldsmith at his weakest
is,
for me, pedestrian and boring. I'd much rather listen to Horner's best
effort, or Silvestri's best effort, or Shore's best effort, or
anyone's best
effort than Goldsmith's weakest. I know the films I listed are
different
films, but so what? I'm talking about the scores, not the films.

And what always gets me about Goldsmith is the hyperbole around
each score, the insistence that every one of 'em actually WAS a
homer.

&gt; &gt;&gt; leaving out a huge chunk of excellent music. Fortunately, I have the 2

&gt; &gt;&gt; and builds with intensity, leading up to the fateful ramming of the

&gt; &gt;&gt; some of his best action scoring but it sure as hell isn't the turkey
&gt; &gt;&gt; everyone who hates the score would have you believe.

&gt; &gt;Yes, it is. It's a complete dud. Sorry, but this is by far the worst
&gt; &gt;thing
&gt; &gt;I ever heard Goldsmith write. I saw the film and found that great
&gt; &gt;action
&gt; &gt;music to be the same stuff that he wrote for most of his action scenes
&gt; &gt;during his last years...page after page of string ostinatos and
&gt; &gt;repetitious
&gt; &gt;percussion and long chords in the brass. Dull, dull, dull. Sorry, but
&gt; &gt;Nemesis is just plain bad.

&gt; (should lock Jaq in a small room and replay Medicine Man repeatedly

I actually kind of like Medicine Man, actually. The movie is utter
shit,
but I did like the score somewhat.

maybe
Aaron Copland, who apparently late in his career went for atonalism or
some such, but you never hear that stuff, so I don't know and could be
completely wrong -- but in any case, with Goldsmith, I followed his
career as it was happening for more than twenty years (ST:TMP was

Then you are hanging around with some very dopey people because I

But when the film ALONG CAME A SPIDER was on TV, playing in the

DID catch my ear and make me run for the computer to look it up.
Yep... it had a Goldsmith score.  Not a great one.  But most certainly
a Goldsmith score.  And it wasn't so bad.
