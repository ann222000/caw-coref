Ambassador Gerald B. Helman writes:

" In an op-ed piece published in the December 11 Washington Post ,
Secretary of State Rice provides an important statement of the
Administration's global strategic posture. She underscores its
importance by comparing the international environment the Administration
confronted when it took office to that faced by Truman/Acheson following
World War 2 and the rise of the Soviet Union. In short, as Acheson felt
that he was "present at the creation" of a new international system,
Rice observes that "centuries of international practice and precedent
have been overturned in the past 15 years" and thus she, as well, is at
the point of a fundamental genesis. In effect, the Administration's
policies are intended to change the terms by which states conduct their
relations.

While Rice does not describe the international system
Truman/Marshall/Acheson/Dulles put in place, it is important to state
their elements in order to better understaand the Administration's.
America's post-World War 2 leadership faced a world that had been
through almost seven years of massive warfare (some would take the
starting date back to 1914) on a global scale, with civilian and
military death, destruction and atrocity beyond imagination. The enemies
of the victorious allies lay in ruins and occupied, Germany by four
powers, Japan by the United States alone. Within months of the end of
the war, the ambitions of the Soviet Union became increasingly manifest,
first in political and conventional military terms, but soon in its
strategic nuclear posture. The USSR rapidly developed into a power that,
for the first time in history, had the capability to obliterate the US.
Geographically, the area of contention was Europe but in a few short
years it became global.

What the Truman generation created was an international system that
combined economic development (the Marshall Plan), institution building
(the United Nations, NATO) and the rules of conduct embodied in their
charters, and the strategic posture of containment and deterrence backed
by the real military forces of the US and its allies, and the US nuclear
deterrent.

The Bush/Rice new world is one in which conflict among major powers
is now unthinkable, which in turn allows the building of a lasting
global stability that will amount to a balance of power "that favors
freedom." Further, the 350 year-old international state system based on
the sovereignty of individual actors no longer holds. There are some
states, those weak and failing, that can no longer contain the threats
emerging from their territories. These, rather than strong and
competitive states, are the greatest threats to our security. Thus, the
fundamental character of regimes matters more than the international
distribution of power. Creating democracies, particularly in the Middle
East (the source of radical Islamic terrorism), is not idealism, but the
only realistic response to present challenges--"stability without
democracy will prove to be false stability."

While not mentioned by Secretary Rice, it should be fair to conclude
that to her new international system would be added at least two
elements of the "Bush Doctrine" published in 2002, that the US retained
the right to preemptive war (the basis for the invasion of Iraq) and
would not allow any other power(s) to challenge the US in military
strength.

The Bush Rice international system thus would consist of one in which
the U.S. is accepted by all others as being the perminent dominent
military actor. Whether for this or additional reasons, conflict among
major states would be unlikely; these states (which would include Russia
and China) would be increasingly available, under US leadership, to
establish durable global stability that would amount to a balance of
power favoring freedom. Those states that are weak or failing,
principally in the Middle East, would forfeit the traditional
protections of sovereignty so that outside powers can guide them to
democracy. By thus abolishing their "freedom deficit," the swamps of
terrorism would be drained and the world's security enhance. Within this
world, the US would be able to operate largely unconstrained, employing
shifting, ad hoc coalitions, monitoring and correcting as necessary
national political systems and as a result preserve US security.

The Bush/Rice international system certainly is subject to criticism:

--It is unrealistic to consider Russia and China as willing actors
today in establishing a balance of power "favoring freedom."

--It is even less credible that China and Russia (and others) will be
willing to concede to the US a permanent role as military and political
hegemon. To the extent that the US considers itself relieved of
institutional and treaty constraints, others will insist on the same
freedoms. In such circumstances, bloody conflict could be as likely as
cooperation.

--Weak and failed states exist, largely in Africa and recently in
Afghanistan. They typically are the byproducts of failed colonialism.
They do represent a danger to others because they cannot exercise the
responsibilities of a sovereign to control its own territory and meet
its international obligations. They are poor, sources of disease and
crime and too often generate massive refugee flows. Their problems can
be addressed politically, socially and economically by the an
international community that organizes itself to do so through existing
institutions. But Iraq was not a failed state and neither are most of
the others in the Middle East. Iraq was bad and so is Iran and Syria. It
is unlikely that the US will get early support for the invasion of the
latter two.

--It also is seriously open to question whether democracy, in the
Middle East or elsewhere, is best advanced by other states asserting the
right to do so because of the diminished sovereignty of the beneficiary.
The existing NGO's that historically have promoted democracy, such as
the German political foundations and those groups associated with the US
National Endowment for Democracy, have over the past decades established
admirable records of achievment, initially in Eastern Europe
(pre-liberation) and elsewhere around the world. It's a slow process and
unlikely to be easily advanced through state intervention.

--Thus while more representative institutions may in time deny
terrorism of a breeding ground, its growth will be slow. In the
meantime, much more will be needed in terms of police work, public
information, covert action, acquisition of intelligence and military
action. This will require strong, continuing international cooperation.
Insisting on the Bush/Rice international order as the framework could
well get in the way.

And, finally, Secretary Rice confides that she has hung Dean
Acheson's portrait in her office, the same office that he occupied as
Secretary of State. Wrong. Acheson's office (much more impressive than
Rice's) was in what is now called "Old State." "New State," now called
the Truman Building, was not opened until about 1960. Acheson's office
was also occupied by George Marshall and John Foster Dulles. All would
certainly have been astonished at this Administration's policies and
pretensions. I can only imagine the language Acheson would have used.

That aside, the Bush/Rice world vision seems intended seriously. They
owe the Congress, public and America's allies a clearer exposition of it
so that it might be properly and vigorously debated. "

Helman "was United States Ambassador to the European Office of the
United Nations from 1979 through 1981."
