I collect special slide rules - such as cylindrical and circular slide
rules, military or medical slide rules, etc. Especially interested in 19th
century slide rules including Keuffel &amp; Esser, Tavernier-Gravet, and Faber
Slide Rules. If you have found an interesting old calculating instrument
with scales based on the logarithm, please contact me, and I will make a
fare and honest offer - and give your slide rule a good home. Slide rule
books, catalogs, and instruction manuals are also of interest. Will also
answer your questions related to slide rules, their use, and
collectability. . . . Thanks, Ed Chamberlain
