Hey, Matt,

I've come to realise that there's a way to recover the old MV site,
but we need to act fast, and we need some scripting tools: if you type
in 'site:motovarsiti.org' you could get a full listing of all the
pages on the old MV site. By accessing and saving Google's cache, we
could recover most of the contents. Would you be able to help to give
it a try?

:-)

I gave it a shot. You can only recover URLs, and the
URLs seem to be only the mails. But there is no way to
recover the contents because it will still try to
access motovarsiti.org for them.

BTW, how did you register us to googlegroups? Say I
want to login on the Google Groups page, but I have
never created an account using s ... @yahoo.com, so how
does that work?

BTW, I just **ahem** a copy of Ong Bak, the Thai
movie. If you liked Jacky Chan of the past (not the
comic type), you've gotta watch this show!

Hey, Matt,

You can recover the contents by clicking on the 'Cache' link, which
will bring up the cache copy. I think we can only recover the mailing
list archive this way, but not the homepage. Probably because the
homepage wasn't indexable.

Not to worry about that, I have paid USD79 for a hard disk recovery
tool and have recovered most of the pix and html files from the hard
disks (with mangled filenames). I would try to sieve out the homepage
files to you for re-indexing. As for the mailing list archive,
recovering from Google's cache might be the easiest way.

To get to the Google homepage of MV, use this link:
&lt;http://groups.google.com/group/motovarsiti&gt;

I don't know if you can register for a new Google group without a
Google account. If you need one, let me know - I have 100 more to
spare :-)

Thanks Glenn.

I found out that Ong Bak is actually history! ha ha
... and yes, I managed to find Tom Yum Goong in the
world-wide-share ;-) I think the story line in Ong Bak
is still better though.

Just a couple of days ago, I pop into the movie rental
and found that there is yet another movie by the same
team. Forgot the title, but it also involved members
from the Olympic team.

Lo Sheng,

How embarrasing ;-) I didn't notice the cache link.

No worries, I have a GMail account, but the thing is
if I went to the location you gave, I can only browse
and not post. This is because I'm not logged in and I
can't log in with my gmail account because it was
registered under s ... @yahoo.com.

And that comes back to the original question how you
did it ;-) I suppose the administrator of the group
can do it, but the interface forces you to have a
gmail account to use it to post messages ... unlike
the Yahoo eGroups.

Hey!

Yep, what I did was to sign in with my goole account, created a new
group, and added the emails of your addresses to it.

Interesting point that you have raised - so no gmail users can't do
anything about their subscription! I suppose you could sign in with
your gmail account, subscribe yourself to the group, and set one of
the email address to no mail?
