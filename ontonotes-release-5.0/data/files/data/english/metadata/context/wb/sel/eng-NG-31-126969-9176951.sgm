There was a rerun of L&amp;O CI and I think the same actress who played
Fred played a guest role on this episode (she was a whistle blower
assistant at the FDA).

The credits went by too fast to confirm.  Would anyone know if this
was true?  Thanks.

Using that, I checked imdb and found it was indeed her playing
&quot;Leslie&quot; on the show.

I also wondered if a judge on SVU was the actor who played the camp
owner in the original Meatballs, and it was.

Sandra Bernhard, who played a very quirky woman on Roseanne, played a
defense attorney.  Also Lecy (Alicia) Goranson played a wrongly
convicted mother on SVU.

I'd like to see the House episode with Trachtenberg, but they
apparently they don't rerun House very often so there may be a wait.
(Trachtenberg was a bit of a disappointment on a late night talk show;
she plugged the episode and tried to portray herself as slutty as
possible having turned 21.)

Yup that was her, with the rather dumb name &quot;Leslie Le Zard&quot;.  Maybe her kid
has a toy named Leslie Lizard?
