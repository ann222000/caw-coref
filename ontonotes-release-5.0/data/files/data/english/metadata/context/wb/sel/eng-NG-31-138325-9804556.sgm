Address is    408 Paulette Cir
Lynchburg, VA  24502

Phone is       434-237-2150

I think I sent this info to all your family but might be a good idea to forward this on.
Also would you give it to Betty Tully.  What is Noranne's situation?  Is she in a nursing home?

I had a nice long conversation with John O'Connor a few days ago.  He has completed all his treatments and has been declared cancer free!  That's amazing.  A few months ago he was getting his affairs in order on the assumption he wouldn't be around long.

We're doing fine.  I was doing my fast walk the other day and started looking at a big bird overhead and tripped over a curb and went down like I'd been pole axed!  Right on a pebble type concrete.  Fell perfectly flat and hands came up reflexively and saved me from a broken face (Maybe that would have resulted in an improvement. Bumped my right knee cap pretty hard and jimmied up my back a little.  OK now. I need to watch where I'm going.

Did you know there will be a Charlo all school reunion this year  on 4th of July weekend.  And I'd like to get to see Gen on her birthday again but not sure I'll make it.

Bring me up to date on your family.  How's Denny doing?  Kathy?  Gerry?  All of them!

All the best,

Phil
