Tom, does that count as your entry?  If that's the only one we get,
then I suppose you'll win the prize by default.  Trust me, otherwise

I am thoroughly sick of the Beatles, but I admire what they did.  It's
not just the great melodies, but the structure of their music that's
important.  They attempted to bring the genre of rock music into the
realm of art music.  Rock music is  guitar based, diatonic, uses
ostinato bass lines, is pre-arranged, is non-improivised, relies
almost completely on gimmicy electronics for inspiration, and is
played mainly by non-reading muscians.  Of course there are exceptions
to everyone of the above statements and even some rock pieces that
follow the party line certainly attain near art music status. But the
whole genre is fake and has out lived it's usefullness as a form by at
least 30 years.  It your grandfather's music and even your grandfather
can't stand listening to those columns of speakers blasting out that
crap year after year.

Kent, you have written by far the most moving and thoughtful essay
yet.  However I counted at least two spelling errors and the spacing
between words was inconsistent.  Raw technique is not sufficient to
win this contest but I'm afraid a modicum of technique is required.
We can't sit idly by and allow &quot;grade inflation&quot; in the Beatles Essay

Professor, it would be a kind gesture towards us all if you begin the
contemplative practice, and retrospective analysis, using the
knowledge gained, applying it to your redundant moronic self
entertaining fixation of driving something into the ground. Just a

yourself behave so badly.  Don't you have a reputation to protect?
Why don't you do something useful like make a CD or something.....

The Beatles were popular because their four personalities were
consistent with the four Jungian personality types:  Mcartney was
intuitive/thought, Lennon was thought/intuitive, ringo was sensation/
feeling and harrison was feeling/sensation.  They had all their bases
covered and played ball like champs.  Don't go around trying to tell
us that their music was anything above par (or below par depending on
your perspective).  They made money.

I am a little unsure why YOU love the Beatles and why you are asking
others to write an essay on your feelings. I would like to ask you a
few questions before submitting my essay:

1) Have you met the Beatles?
2) How do you define love?
3) Are you sure you love them? Is it not possible you are confusing
this feeling with another emotion or condition?

I've always thought of McCartney as the heart/mother and Lennon as the

The Beatles were a great inspiration for me.  Sure, there was Hendrix,
Clapton, Janis, the Stones, and scores of other rock bands and
performers that used various psychedelic and narcotic drugs, but it
was The Beatles who really turned me on to turning on.  Had it not
been for The Beatles use of narcotics and hallucinogens and the songs
they wrote about them, I may have never tried those drugs myself.  It
is because of The Beatles that I can partially recall fond memories of
sneaking into the computer room at work to do a few lines to keep me
going.  Or the times I tripped on mushrooms on cold winter nights,
laying on a frozen pond, looking up at the stars and feeling my mind
bend.  So, to The Beatles, I would like to say, &quot;I love you man!&quot;

For those who want to send Larry a card for Christmas:

Larry's, the sentient creature at 9702 Crosby Ave, Garden Grove, CA
92844 Phone No. (714) 638-9485

His anxiety disorder and panic attacks have escalated to the point he
never leaves the house or turns on his computer.
He plays for the cat.

Sigh,

I love the Beatles, because without them getting famous the arrogant,

Mr. Dofrenzy, you are way too polite. You are fully aware that: 1) J can
write many words about media figures and that, 2) he is unlikely to
write convincingly on most topics as he has a nasty habit of stringing
together conclusory statements without backing anything up. This is
unlikely to make a believer of anyone except the writer and those
dazzled by bs. This was Jackson's fatal flaw.

BTW, you should have won the essay contest - you wuz robbed! :-)

When they were in Germany, John Lennon kicked bass player Stuart Sutcliffe
in the head with a pointed-toe shoe, which, it is said, brought on the brain
hemorrhage that Sutcliffe died from.
Yet Lennon, (a thug and a bully), had the cheek to preach to the world about
peace.
Urghhh.

Jez, how do you know this to be true?  Does Astrid Kirchherr support
this as fact?
