PATTAYA, Thailand — They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. Among
Filipino journalists who have only been away for 12 hours from Manila, it
was more like boredom that got everyone to talking about the latest &quot;news&quot;
in the Metro.

Unfortunately, the news was not really news but gossip and controversy. Did
she or didn't she? Is he gay or isn't he gay? Are they a couple or not?
&quot;Frankly my dear I don't give a damn!&quot;

To begin with, don't we have anything better to do than to talk about other
people's lives? The long running talk, rumors and character assassination
about a certain actor and his lifestyle is clear proof of the bias and
hypocrisy of people, particularly some in the entertainment industry.

I find it ironic that certain people in the industry flaunt and fight for
their gay lifestyle but are equally guilty of &quot;gay bashing&quot;. Even worse some
insist and persist in claiming that certain individuals ought to come
&quot;clean&quot; about their &quot;gayness&quot; and put an end to the rumors.

This I believe is the height of hypocrisy. They talk about &quot;personal
choices&quot;, &quot;to each his own&quot;, and respecting lifestyles but go to town and
bash people for keeping their privacy. Some idiot even justified the
invasion of privacy as a natural consequence of &quot;Celebrities being public
property&quot;. That sadly is a mistaken notion and one of the most abused
excuses in Philippine media.

The right to privacy was a burning issue in the US entertainment industry
for over three decades. After years of being harassed, the celebrities began
to avoid or elude the hounds. Eventually things got physical so the stars
got bodyguards and things got violent. In recent years things took a turn
when celebrities started winning multi-million dollar law suits not only
against entertainment writers but even against publishers, producers and
owners.

We certainly have a long way to go before having a more mature situation,
but current events point to the fact that there is a serious need for the
media, entertainment industry professionals and even the readers and viewers
to reflect on our attitudes and practices.

For starters, we definitely need to professionalize and regulate the
entertainment media for its own benefit or there will be more harm than good
to reap. While the focus might naturally turn to reporters, writers and
&quot;columnists&quot;, the fact of the matter is that publishers, editors, producers
and media owners have become irresponsible or simply greedy.

They rejoice when juicy reports and gossips generate controversy and results
in bigger sales or profits but they often don't take the blame or get
punished for a &quot;crime&quot;.

Whenever the MTRCB decides to penalize any offensive scene or material on
television or film, the studios or the stations simply suspend or punish a
helpless talent or &quot;star&quot;. They are subjected to humiliation while the
bosses go about totally unaffected by the event.

The talents on the other hand have to show their act of contrition, shed a
few tears and in some cases go without work or pay for two to three weeks.
It's about time that the MTRCB, the KBP and their equivalent for print media
came out with cash fines for the station or for legislators to pass a law to
this effect.

This would fall squarely under the &quot;concept of Franchise&quot; and not &quot;abridge
freedom of expression&quot; but rather the abuse of the freedom. In fact our
Libel laws in itself along with general laws are clearly subject to
manipulation. You can sue the practitioner but don't necessarily have to sue
his boss or his employer.

It's tantamount to charging the hit man with murder but not the people who
put out the contract. Unfortunately there is honor among thieves as well as
company lawyers so in most cases the lawyers always avoid a nasty and
complicated legal battle among the networks or media outlets. In the end,
the writers, entertainment commentators face off with the celebrities or the
stars. The people who depend on each other for career advancement end up in
the center ring while Caligula and associates cheer!

The KBP leadership which allegedly is responsive might want to take the lead
on the matter. For beginners why must entertainment coverage be largely
about negative, destructive and critical reporting on the private lives of
celebrities? Considering their impact on society particularly young people,
why should we highlight their failures or degenerate behavior? Why should
scandal or scandalous lifestyles be the meat of entertainment news?

Mainstream or entertainment media has to stop allowing the use of blind
items because it is used more to cause injury than for legitimate
journalistic endeavors. It is not impossible. We are simply lazy or have
elevated gossip into the category of being a &quot;professionally accepted tool&quot;.

In this politically correct environment everyone talks about gender
sensitivity but the gender bias is so evident. Not only must you be gay, you
have to be a screamer or a troublesome woman ready to pick a fight even with
God for your 2 to 5 minutes of fame.

Perhaps the most powerful people in the situation are none other than the
public. The 90 percent population of Filipinos who are suppose to be
practicing Catholics along with all the Catholic priests in the country
ought to review and revive one of the TEN COMMANDMENTS…&quot; Thou shall not bear
false witness&quot;.

The five percent or more vocal evangelicals or protestants can also pull
their collective weight and join in the effort of telling all media outlets
to clean up or close down. What we are seeing or reading on a daily basis is
seen and read or heard by our children. If they have learned the word
kickback, they already know the words separation, living in, sex or worse.
We certainly have the voice and the pesos to tell the owners what we want to
be entertained with and who we want to entertain us. The most important of
all being: we want the truth.
