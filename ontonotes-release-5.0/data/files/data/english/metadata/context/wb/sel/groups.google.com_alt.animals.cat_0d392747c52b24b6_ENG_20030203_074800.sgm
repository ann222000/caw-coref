Last month, we lost one of our two cats, due to old age. During her last 2
weeks, she was being bullied by the younger and MUCH bigger cat. She decided
that the safest thing to do would be to use the dining room carpet instead
of the closely guarded litter box that was always kept clean.

I cleaned the carpet twice. Once with &quot;Nature's Own&quot; or something like that
(it was a liquid enzyme cleaner) and a few days later, a second time with
regular carpet cleaner. Smelled clean to humans.

Since then, the remaining cat has agreed with the other cat that the dining
room is easier to use than the litter box, toiletting in the same place as
the late cat.

Add that to the fact that she's been hissing at our grandson, who has never
mistreated her, (She's never liked kids. We think that she was abused by
kids before we adopted her), we have decided that she needs a new home. One
with no kids and no other cat.

So, now we are, for the first time in 35 years, a cat-less family. Before we
get another one, we want to get the carpet so clean and fresh smelling that
a new cat won't have any idea that carpet is not their litter box.

I know, get to the point!!

1. Is there anything that I can spray on the carpet and by using a black
light, see where the cat urinated? Or any other means?

2. What is the best way to actually clean the carpet? We live in Florida,
carpet on top of concrete slab, and no pad. I have a small &quot;Dirt Devil&quot; Easy
Steamer (Deep Cleaner) so I can clean as many times as I need, but I would
like to keep it in the single digits!

Thanks for your patience for a post that should have been just the 2
questions.

and it should work well.

"/> Certainly an enzyme cleaner works. I use Oxi Clean (Oxy Clean) when I've
got cat urine getting on to the floor. Any cleaning agent using oxygen
bleach would work though. Before using a cleaner that uses a lot of oxygen
use it in an inconspicuous corner. Some organic dyes can be destroyed with
oxygen, indeed that is why it works on cat urine - the odors are all organic
compounds and are readily destroyed by oxygen. Whatever you use though make
sure that the fluid gets all the way down through the rug, undermat, and
onto the sub floor, otherwise you are just doing a surface clean and any cat
will find the spots again.. Sprays tend to stay on top and so don't clean
the underlying material.

Best wishes.

One of my cats tends to spray the inside of the litter box and the lid takes
it down the outside of the litter box. I'm considering attaching some heavy
plastic on the inside of the lid to hang over the inside edge and act as a
drip edge inside the litter box. You would think litter box makers would
know enough to ensure that any spray on the lid would end up inside the
litter box.

you can. Take some rubbing alchol and wipe down the top part where the two
parts come together. Wipe down the other half (where the top makes contact
with the bottom) with some kind of oil. [the lips that are around a 1/4 inch
wide]
Now you take and put a small bead of silicone like you seal a bath tub with,
and put it on the top part. The silicone will stick to the part you cleaned
with alcohol, but not to the part where you put the oil. After the bead of
silicone is laid out and before it dries, put the two together as normal.
Now you have a gasket that should stay there after it sets up. You can open
it, as it will not stick to the bottom but will be in one piece on the top
part.
Where did I get this idea? Well I used to work for Chrysler as a tech and
the automatic transmission pans had to be removed every once in a while to
change the fluid. In order so it would not be hard to remove (the pan) we
were told how to do this with the silicone. [we would clean the pan with
brake cleaner and put a little transmission fluid on the rails where the pan
went up against] If you did not do this the pan would be very hard to get
off as silicone is an adhesive. [made it easier on me if I got it back in
the future]
It worked for me on the box I have but check out a small part with the
alcohol as there are so many types of plastic before you do all of it. Also
don't use too much silicone as it will stick where the is no oil on the
bottom, and be liberal with the oil.
Use a oil like you cook with in case the cat takes a likening to it not a
car or machine oil. Let the silicone sit over night to set up. [see label on
silicone]

There is no question it would be better looking than mine.. I was going to
use silicone to glue the plastic to the upper half with a strip of silicone
around the top to prevent the urine from getting behind it.

I buy gallon jugs of PetZyme at Pet Smart. It will take the smell out. Also
works great added to a steam cleaner to freshner the entire carpet.

To see the markings with a black light - just turn it on. The dried urine
glows without having to spray it with anything. Amazing but true!

Some things to keep in mind: The glow is faint so you'll need to do it at
night with the other lights out. Furballs and other items leave glowing
spots as well. And you'll have to hold the light fairly close to the
floor to see this.

*Do* use a fluorescent tube lamp, not a filtered incandescent lamp.

Best to you!

Jim (lots of cats)

I've always used window cleaner as it has alcohol in it and gets rid of all
of the odor. I've never had a problem with it staining the carpets (or
anything else I've used it on). And none of my cats have ever been the wiser
that there was ever anything there.

&gt;&gt;Jim,

"/>  A few years ago, we had the same problem. We called a reputable
carpet cleaning company who came out and soaked the concrete slab
under the carpet with the enzyme cleaner, replaced the stained padding
and cleaned the carpet. Not cheap, but the best way to go, as surface
cleaning won't get rid of the smell that attracts the cat...and
because the urine soaks into the slab.
Then, they told us that, to be safe, it wouldn't hurt to put some
heavy piece of furniture over that spot just in case our other cats
still smelled urine and tried to use that spot.
We did all that and had no more problems. We have new carpeting
since then and the aged cat that was doing the urinating has since
died.
You might get some good ideas from the book &quot;Cats for Dummies&quot;.
I got it last year when we started fostering cats. That might help if
you have further problems.
Good luck.
