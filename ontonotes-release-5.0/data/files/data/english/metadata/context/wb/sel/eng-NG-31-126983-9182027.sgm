FBI Job Opening

For the final test, the FBI agents took one of the men to
A large metal door and handed him a gun. &quot;We must know
That you will follow your instructions no matter what the
Circumstances. Inside the room you will find your wife
Sitting in a chair. Kill Her!!!&quot;

The man said, &quot;You can't be
Serious, I could never shoot my wife&quot; The agent said,
&quot;Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife
And go home.&quot;

The second man was given the same instructions. He took
The gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5
Minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, &quot;I tried,
But I can't kill my wife.&quot; The agent said, &quot;You don't have
What it takes. Take your wife and go home.&quot;

Finally, it was the the woman's, Mrs. Childers's, turn. She was given
the same
Instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went
Into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They
Heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few
Minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there
Stood Mizz Childers. She wiped the sweat from her brow.
&quot;This gun is loaded with blanks,&quot; she said. &quot;I had to beat
Him to death with the chair.&quot;

I prefer the term &quot;big fish in a small pond.&quot;  It builds on his false ego.
Therefore in the future one should equate the following...

big fish in small pond = mental midget

Fer instance, Guv BoB has always seen hisself as bein' indispensible as Guv
of New BoB.  Of course we all know as it was with FDR, if Guv BoB would stop
with his tax 'n take programs (fancy werd for socialism), New BoB would
thrive economically.  Therefore Guv BoB is truly a big fish in a small pond.

See how it werks?

So, we can use all kinds of code.  It really is most inneresting to apply
this code to Larry.  Whenever he gets going on one of his diatribes, and
uses insults as reasoned argument, one must think moron as in Larry is a
moron.  Big baboon, and mokee boy werks too.

Anyone who imagines a Usenet group can build on anyone's ego has a
petty imagination indeed.

Actually, the &quot;Guv Bob&quot; thing started as an intended satire of the ARC
and the &quot;state of New Franklin&quot; nonsense in TN a decade or so back.

Wilston couldn't maintain the satire and sank into faux Li'l Abner
dialect soon after.

I guess you won't be votin' for the Guv.

of what yew mean.

Fer instants:
&quot;I thank the Guv is a wonderful feller, and should move to Mr ER's town so
they can tighten up their friendship, and collaborate on a few novellas
together.  That they should be happy in each others company.&quot;

Translashun:
I think the Guv is a despechtable person, and as punishment to ER, the Guv
should move in raht next door where the Guv will harangue ER to the point
where he cain't write no more.  One or the other - it don't matter who -
gets a nervous breakdown, and winds up in the looney bin.&quot;

See how compliments can go a long way to bring community unity.

The earliest post I can find from myself to alt.appalachian,
BoulderButt™, is January of '97, but I think I was posting earlier
than that.  A lot of early posts were lost in the transition from
DejaNews to Google, but in any case I _was_ posting to this newsgroup
throughout '97 and '98.

The &quot;big change&quot; in the newsgroup, seems to me, came with your
schoolyard scatology.

There'd been eruptions of political differences, and every now and
then JoeSeth pranced in and then flounced out.  That's how it was till
your debut appearance as &quot;Appieman&quot; vice &quot;Mallrock, with the laughable
claim of having lurked &quot;for five years&quot; without posting _anything_,
whereupon you became a daily participant.  Remember your pitifully

&gt; There'd been eruptions of political differences, and every now and
&gt; then JoeSeth pranced in and then flounced out.  That's how it was till
&gt; your debut appearance as &quot;Appieman&quot; vice &quot;Mallrock, with the laughable
&gt; claim of having lurked &quot;for five years&quot; without posting _anything_,
&gt; whereupon you became a daily participant.  Remember your pitifully
&gt; inept attempt at sock puppetry, John?

Almost forgot:

--
Mallrock's family asked me
to examine his laptop to clear
off stuff. I happened to be
working on it when I responded to
your post.
-- Mallrock in his Appieman suit,
trying out a preposterous explanation
of how he screwed up and posted
under his original pseudonym
