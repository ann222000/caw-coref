Congressman Hobson said, among other things:

&quot;ALCOHOL TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN WAR

The Army War College at Washington made an investigation of the
destructiveness of war.  Taking all the wars of the world, from
the Russo-Japanese War back to 500 B. C., the War College found
that the total number of killed and wounded in battle amounts
to about 2,800,000, of which it is estimated that about 700,000
were killed and something over 2,000,000 wounded.

The comparative figures show the appalling fact that alcohol is
killing off as many Americans every year as all the wars of the
world have killed in battle in 2,300 years.

Applied to the whole white race, we find that alcohol is
killing 3,500,000 white men every year, five times as many as
have been killed in war in 2,300 years; so that, stated
mathematically, alcohol is ten thousand times more destructive
than all wars combined.  No wonder the Governments
investigating the subject have found that war has been only a
secondary cause of national decline, and that alcohol has been
the real destroyer that has overthrown all the great nations of
the past and is now undermining the great nations of to-day.&quot;

From page 5 of The Great Destroyer, by Hobson:

What others say:

Adam Smith said:

All labor expended in producing strong drink is utterly
unproductive; it adds nothing to the wealth of the community.

Count von Moltke:

Beer is a far more dangerous enemy to Germany than all the
armies of France.

John Stuart Mill:

My liberty ends when it begins to involve the possibility of
ruin to my neighbor.

Gladstone:

The ravages of drink are greater than those of war,
pestilence and famine combined.

Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton:

Light wines -- nothing so treacherous!  They inflame the
brain like fire, while melting on the palate like ice.  All
inhabitants of light wine countries are quarrelsome.

Wendell Phillips:

In America the statute book rests not on bayonets, but on the
hearts of the people.  A drunken people can never be the
basis of a free government.

Sir A. Pease Gould:

Alcoholism is universal in its range, no order or class is
free from it.  It takes its dreadful toll of both sexes and
all ages.  To lessen its influence would be to benefit the
whole community.  It is an evil which touches every one of us,
and every one of us has his part to play in the war against
it.

General William Booth of the Salvation Army:

Nine-tenths of our poverty, squalor, vice, and crime spring
from this poisonous tap-root.  Society by its habits,
customs, and laws, has greased the slope down which these
poor creatures slide to perdition.

President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard College:

The lesson of the East is that alcoholism of the white race
must be overcome, or that vice with the licentiousness it
promotes, will overcome.

John Mitchell:

The happiness, the security, and the progress of the nation
depend more upon the solution of the liquor problem than upon
the disposition of any other problem confronting the people
of our country.

Prof. T. G. Masaryk, of Prague:

The ethics and religion which will tolerate alcoholism is the
ethics and religion of death.  For not only is alcoholism the
cause of numerous diseases, it leads directly and indirectly
to ruin.  The cost of alcohol in human life far exceeds that
of war and the victims of alcoholism do not die out.  They
drag miserably through a sick life and transmit their decay
to following generations.

Hon. William Windom:

Considered socially, financially, politically and morally, the
licensed liquor traffic is, or ought to be, the overwhelming
issue in American politics.  The destruction of this iniquity
stands next on the world calender.

So, someone who is too weak not to drink himself to oblivion is going to
be influenced by my pledge not to drink? I don't think so.

That wasn't my point, anyway. Even if someone chooses to drink
themselves to death, they made the choice. Not so, with war, pestilence,
and famine.

Not yet.

I'm all in favor of locking up drunk drivers and throwing away the key.
But I'm not in favor of banning alcohol because someone might abuse it.

Is this a general rule, you aren't in favour of banning things because

And more importantly, we've tried that and it doesn't work. Same as it

What, you've got a problem with that? Just think of it as an unorthodox
public assistance program. After all, the people who become drug dealers
aren't going to just disappear if the drugs become legal. They'd just
turn to some other sort of crime, like mugging or burglary or accounting
or something. Sure, we could create some government bureaucracy to take
care of them, but that would just be inefficient. This way, they get
paid directly by dopeheads, instead of good, upright taxpayers. And they
kill each other off fairly regularly. Sure, we have to pump a litttle
tax money into the DEA to keep the system working, but it's probably
less than we would spend otherwise to either support them or prevent
them from terrorizing regular citizens.

Of course, the downside is that it makes it less convenient for me to
get wasted and listen to &quot;Europe '72&quot;, but that's the price we sometimes
have to pay.

We're talking marijuana here. Most of the dopeheads *are* good, upright
taxpayers.

They could be retrained to direct (vehicular) traffic. The growers, who
have the expertise, can grow it legally.
