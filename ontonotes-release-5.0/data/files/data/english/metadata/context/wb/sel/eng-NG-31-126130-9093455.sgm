God, the idiots who are Joe Buck and Tim McCarver never cease to amaze
me.
They seem to have forgotten (even though McCarver initially noticed)
that the glove Torrealba tagged Ramirez with HAD NO BALL IN IT!
Then they play the ump's explanation to Francona, who then agrees with
the ump--did he forget that the ball was not in his glove hand as
well?
Have they recently changed the rules, and the catcher just has to be
in the same ZIP code as the runner in order for it to be an out?
If these idiots were not so busy thinking about the next factoid to
spew, maybe they could keep their minds on the job at hand--announcing
the baseball game that is happening before their eyes (though not
necessarily before ours--they barely showed Dice-K's hit--except in
replay).
All right--I know the Sox are winning, but it just really rips me how
poorly these games are produced.
Give me NESN any old day...

I wish baseball would go to instant replay like football does and start
enforcing the rules.  No &quot;neighborhood play&quot; at second, no calling outs at
first when the first baseman is coming off the bag, and no more, of this:

It's almost axiomatic that on tag plays when a ball thrown to get a runner
on a non-force play, the runner will be called out if the ball gets there
first, even if the tag doesn't actually get made before the runner hits the
bag.  This is because, unlike first base where the umpire bases his call on
the sound of the ball hitting the glove while he watches the runners feet,
on tag plays the umpire cannot watch both the fielder's glove and the
runner's body at the same time.  Often, when they show the play on replay,
there's some doubt about whether the runner was tagged before he hit the
base.  Generally, if the ball gets to the fielder before the runner hits the
bag, the runner will be out, regardless of whether there's a high tag that
was technically too late.  Instant replay could fix this, although it would
lengthen an already too-long game.

I hate to tell you, but no way instant replay would have changed that

***************

His HAND was in the glove.
The BALL was in his other hand--the one w/o the glove.
He tagged Ramirez with his glove hand.
Then AFTER Ramirez touched home and stood up, but BEFORE the ump made
the call, Torrealba tagged him AGAIN, this time with the ball.

I might just pop that 2004 Sox/Yankees Game 7 DVD in today, just to
get pumped &amp; jacked for tonite's game.

Patrick - you're missing the entire point (shocking!) about NESN. It's
the in-game presentation, the quality of the play-by-play man &amp; the
analyst DURING the game that Maureen and most of us in Sox Nation miss
when we get national broadcasts w/ the likes of McCarver and Joe
Morgan. Joe Buck is tolerable, as is John Miller on ESPN.  But the
analysts, the so-called &quot;experts&quot; are just awful.  Here's a novel idea
- have a 3-man booth for the World Series, with the local TV analyst
from both teams in the booth w/ Buck. Nobody would know more about the
respective teams than the day-to-day color analysts for the two
participating teams.

NESN is a sports network partially-owned by the Sox - what else are
they going to do w/ their time before &amp; after the games? As Curt
Schilling once said, &quot;that's a stupid idiotic comment&quot; that you made
about the pre-game &amp; post-game shows and it had no relevance to what
Maureen was lamenting.

For all of the commercials and promotions involving or about the
RemDawg, he is most definitely one of the premier analysts in the
game.  And THAT'S why we miss him and THAT'S why we want him on
national broadcasts.

JJ
(I think I might replay Games 4-7 of that 2004 Yankees/Sox series
today - Big Papi's walk-off homer, Schilling's bloody sock, Damon's
grand salami....ahhhhh.....that was fun!)

(Ellsbury &amp; Pedroia were IMMENSE last night, even if Francona panicked
and took out Dice-K too soon)

Derek is spot-on on this one. As a person who has extensive umpiring
experience(of course none at the professional level) this drives me
crazy. If you loook at slo-mo replays of steals of second where the
ball clearly beats the runner, many, if not most of the time, the tag
will not be applied until after a hand or foot has touched the base.
If a runner is tagged above the knee, or on the shoulder, he is safe
90% of the time.
I think umpires are outstanding at calls at first base.
Of course, as a longtime first baseman, the call that drives me
furthest up the wall is the refusal to call a runner out for running
in fair territory as he approaches first base. The rule is explicit
and ignored, and when they discuss it (rarely) umpires look like
fools.

You're a Yankee 'homer'..... does that mean the only announcers
you've heard are Sterling and Suzy?     Ever heard of Gary Schulte, Pat
Hughes, David Van Horne, Ken Harrelson, Dan Dickerson, Jerry Howarth or Eric

You really do need to get out more...... maybe travel a little......

Ken Harrelson actually used to be a Yankee announcer.... bet you
didn't know that did you ?    I have been around,  I have seen and
heard most of the broadcasters in all sports,  Remy is OK if you are a
Red Sox homer,  he is kind of the Phil Rizzuto ( RIP )  of the Red
Sox.

Oh  yeah....   we lost to those pesky Marlins.  The Yankees were
clearly the better team that year, but the Marlins played with more
heart.   I realize you wrote this comment as an attempt to insult me,
it didn't work.

&gt; &gt; Does Remdog really &quot;booze it up&quot; in the broadcast booth.  I pulled the
&gt; &gt; following off the net:

&gt; &gt; &quot;Boston.com is reporting (and, thanks to corporate synergy, they should
&gt; &gt; know) that Sox TV color analyst Jerry Remy has been signed to a contract
&gt; &gt; extension that will keep him calling games and boozin' it up in the NESN
&gt; &gt; booth through the 2010 season.&quot;

&gt; Ummmm....no.

&gt; &gt; Oh yeah  NESN,   Go Sox,  we love the sox,  we love Remdog...  let's
&gt; &gt; show the 2004 world series every 10 minutes,  let's have a 2 hour pre
&gt; &gt; game show and a 1 hour post game show...   we love Remdog,   oh, did
&gt; &gt; we mention how much we love Remdog ?

&gt;         Have you ever watched a game on NESN?    There are few...... if
&gt; any...... announcers who are as knowledgeable as Remy.    And they are FUN
&gt; to watch, too.
&gt; Would you expect them to do a 15 minute pre game show when the team is in
&gt; the Series?     The post game show is at least an hour long because they
&gt; give fans the pleasure of hearing the post game comments by the players and
&gt; Tito.
&gt;      It's time to take donations and buy you a clue.    But somehow, I don't
&gt; think even that would help you.

&gt;His HAND was in the glove.
&gt;The BALL was in his other hand--the one w/o the glove.
&gt;He tagged Ramirez with his glove hand.
&gt;Then AFTER Ramirez touched home and stood up, but BEFORE the ump made
&gt;the call, Torrealba tagged him AGAIN, this time with the ball.

I have watched it many times and I think the hand with the ball was in
the glove when he attempted the tag, still not sure he tagged him or
not. And I think the unp was waiting to check and see if Torrealba
held on to the ball, not to tag him again, because he called him out
before the next tag attempt. Point is moo now, but if Manny had not
deliberately knocked his helmet off, thereby almost tripping himself
when it hit his leg, and made a detour through the Boston dugout
rounding third, he would have beend safe by a mile. And this from a
Manny and Red Sox fan, sort of.
