&gt; I understand you want to pun on 'times,' but three score times four is

&gt; &gt; Bob and me
&gt; &gt; Go way back, and there we were,
&gt; &gt; Your man up there,
&gt; &gt; Thinking like me, darkly stirring rhymes
&gt; &gt; In my bowed head.

&gt; &gt; We heard
&gt; &gt; The voice of reason, sang the songs,
&gt; &gt; Righted wrongs,
&gt; &gt; Sure, all those years ago, Bob and me and us
&gt; &gt; The future dead.

&gt; It looks clear to me that you feel powerful emotions when you think of
&gt; Dylan; but you're not communicating them to this reader. You're
&gt; telling me how you're feeling, but not getting me to feel anyof it

&gt; Take your last line, 'the future dead.' That did make me feel
&gt; something, but only because it reminded me of a line in a more recent
&gt; Dylan song:

&gt; &quot;It's not dark yet; but it's getting there.&quot;

&gt; Just thinking about Bob singing that in his old-man voice, I feel
&gt; death right here in the room with me, peering over my shoulder.

The Dylan fanatics around here are giving the new &quot;I'm Not There&quot;
soundtrack heavy rotation, these days. Though it only contains one
actual performance by Dylan, his legendary masterpiece from 1967 &quot;I'm
Not There&quot;, never before officially released, the gems included by his
followers, from the very old (Willie Nelson, Ritchie Havens and
Rambling Jack Elliot all turn in spine-chilling renditions, Willie
turning out the best vocal I've heard from him in a long time on
&quot;Senor&quot;) to the very young (members of Sonic Youth, Pavement, and a
few I've never heard of before) make for some mighty fine driving
music... which will very likely be appropriate, since I won't be
surprised if we have to drive to Atlanta to actually see the film,
when it finally is released.

Phew. If you rate Sonic Youth as being &quot;very young,&quot; you must be

What exactly makes it such a &quot;masterpiece?' Is is the wavering,

Seems, if my mem'ry serves me well, that it was once upon a time
available at http://www.bobdylan.com but it seems they've stopped
doing that sort of thing.

I found it online as an Mp3 on some website not too long ago,
though... a Google on it may turn that up.
Great to have it out &quot;official&quot; after all these years... I still have
hope that another dozen or so Basement Tapes will be made available in
my lifetime...

The church of Bob Dylan has decreed it so.  And I suspect Dylan has many
more in the same vein -- gestations of songs that never went anywhere, or
just gibberish for a jam session.  &quot;The Rolling Escalade Tapes.&quot;

Besides the fact that we seem to be listening to different songs, my
fascination with &quot;I'm Not There&quot; began years before I finally had a chance
to hear it, I suppose it was reading Paul Williams'  &quot;Bob Dylan Performing
Artist&quot; (first vol.):

&quot;Sometimes the sketches are obviously
unfinished, and then what is fascinating is how very much they manage to
communicate in spite of everything that's missing.  &quot;I'm Not There&quot;, an
unreleased Basement Tapes track that *Telegraph* editor John Bauldie
believes is 'one of Dylan's greatest vocal performances,' has lyrics that
can't be transcribed because they don't really exist: Dylan makes slurred
noises that only sound like words, like the dummy copy in the rough of an
advertisement that only looks like text.  Further, when Dylan does use
real words, they don't fit with the other words-but they do a good job of
*sounding like* sentences; the transitions in particular are powerful and
convincing.

&quot;What's astonishing here is that we can feel with great intensity and
specificity what the singer is talking about, because of the
expressiveness in his voice, even though 80% of the lyrics have not been
written yet!  It's as though we're listening to Dylan in *Visions of
Johanna*  sing&quot;Louise, she's all right, she's just near/She's delicte and
seems like the mirror&quot; and we're experiencing all the subtle, conflicting
feelings of the situation, communicated through the inflections in the
singer's voice, only he hasn't found the words for the feeling yet, just
the inchoate sound of it, so he's actually singing, &quot;Louise, Saturday,
under cheer/It's wafflish, she slumps out of fear&quot;-and the second word is
slurred, it could be slaughterhouse or samuri for all we know. But the
sound of the singing and the sense of the sond are so moving and so clear
it brings tears to our eyes.

&quot;It's bizarre.  It's as though when Dylan writes, the finished song is
not constructed piece by piece as we might imagine, but tuned in, there
in it's entirity from the first but still out of focus, like the
photograph of a fetus, a blur whose identifying characteristics are
implicit but not yet visible-not because they're obscured but because
they haven't taken shape.  'I'm Not There' is a performance complete in
feeling-'Dylan's saddest song,' says Bauldie-achieved without benefit of
context or detail.  It's like listening to the inspiration before the
song is wrapped around it.&quot;

Yeah, we must be listening to different songs... here's a post from the
archives worth repeating, in my opinion, from the archives (Martin
Grossman):

Here are two versions of &quot;I'm Not There&quot; from the Grossman (Martin, not
Albert)
Archives. The first is what Ed DiBiase thought he heard; the second is what
Dylan
claims he wrote. The sheet music which accompanies these transcripts shows
them in
the key of B. The copyright is attributed to Dwarf Music 1969. I think this
is one of Bob's
most beautiful melodies. The song is clearly basement tapes era word play,
but still
seems like a dummy for what might have emerged had he continued to work on
it.

I'M NOT THERE (first transcription by Dylan's transcriber, ed DiBiase,
Forest Hills, N.Y.)

Ev'ry thing all right and then she's all on the time
In my neighborhood
And she cries both day and night.
I know because it was there.
It's a milestone but she's down on her luck
And the day makes her lonely and it's so
Hard to buck.
I was -- I believe --
That she'd stop him if she would start to care --
I believe that she'd look upon the side and t'care
And I'd go by the Lord and when she's on my way
But I don't belong there.
No, I don't belong to her.
I don't belong to anybody.
She's my prize-forsaken angel
But she don't hear me cry.
She's a longhearted mystic
And she can carry on.
When I'm there she's all right
But she's not when I'm gone.
Heaven knows that the answer,
She don't call on no one.
She's a wave, a thing beautiful
She's mine for the one.
And I'm also hesitatin' by temptation lest it runs
Which it don't follow me
But I'm not there, I'm gone.
Now I'll cry tonight like I cried the night before
And I'll feast on her eyes
But I'll dream about the door.
So long, Jesus, savior, blind faith worth to tell?
I was born to love her
But she knows the kingdom waits so
High above her.
And I run but I race
But it's not too fast to
But I'll not deceive her
I'm not there, I'm gone.
Well, it's all about confusion and I cry for her ... I'M NOT THERE(1956)

(second transcription, corrected by Dylan, by Ed DiBiase, on 19 December
1969.

Ev'rything's all right and she's all the time
In my neighborhood.
She cried both day and night,
I know because it was there.
It's a milestone but she's down on her luck.
And the day makes her lonely
And it's so hard to buck.
I was there.
I believe == that she's stop him if she
Would start to care,
I believe that she'd look upon this side
And t'care and I'd go by the something
When she's on my way,
But I don't belong there.
No, I don't belong to her
I don't to ev'rybody,
She's my price for Lake and Angel,
But she don't hear me cry.
She's a long-hearted canner and she can carry on,
When I'm there she's all right,
But she's not when I'm gone.
Yes and no's but the answer
She don't call in though
One - she's a wave, a thing, beautiful,
She's buy temptation lest it plows
Which it don't
Follow me, but I'm not there, I'm gone.
Now, I'll cry tonight like I cried the night before
and I'll feast on her eyes
But I'll dream about the door.
So long, Cheeze, us aviators and blind faith wants to tell,
It don't have consolation,
She's my cornstack and my cabbage,
I was born to love her, but she knows
that the kingdom waits so high above her.
and I run but I race
But it's not too fast a pace of course,
I'll not deceive her,
I'm not here, I'm gone.

-Bob Dylan

Well, thanks for the lyrics. I was wanting those. I have both versions
and all I can say is maybe if I listen to them enough times their
genius will shine thru. Or maybe they're just not my cup of tea. Much
of The Basement Tapes is like that, for me. Shine on brightly, brother
Bob ..... I belong to the church.

The song sure is a puzzle, I'll give it that... I listened to it twice
driving through the night and damned if he doesn't seem to be saying
somewhat different things every time I listen to it... in the archives, I
found this interestin comment, from Christopher L.: &quot;If I were a
psychologist I would use the recording of &quot;I'm Not There&quot; as
sort of an audio Rorschach test, since however you hear the lyrics might
give insight to your personality (if any psychologist actually decides to do
this, be sure to give me a royalty cut).&quot;

And so many translations, this one has an interesting and very different
first verse:

She's all right and she's all too tight
In my neighborhood she cried both day and night
I know it - because he was there
It's a milestone, but she's down on her luck
And she's daily saloonin' but to making hard to buck
Now and then ...
I believe that she's stopping if she wants time to care
I believe that she'd look upon him deciding to care
And I go by the law, anyway she's on my way
But I don't belong there

John Howells' transcription also seems worth looking at:

&quot;...I'd like to take a stab at this because I believe that even though
the lyrics are nearly impossible to accurately transcribe, there
are some lines that stand out for me. It's not perfect, and a lot
of lines are transcribed phonetically and make little sense, and
others are words that sound different than what he pronounces but
I estimate that he may have intended to sing them but his tongue
got twisted.  There are some lines that I insist on. For instance,
lines two and three. Everyone always assumes &quot;in my neighborhood&quot;,
but doesn't it make much more sense the way I've written it? Listen
to those lines closely and you'll see that I'm correct.

I'M NOT THERE

It's all right and she's all too tight
and my neighbor heard she cried both day and night
I know it because he was there
it's a milestone but she's down on her luck
and she daily so loading but to making hard to buck
out of them

I believe that she's stopping if she wants time to care
I believe that she'd look upon deciding to care
and I go by the load anyway she's on my way
but I don't belong there

no I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every pie
she's my prize forsaken angel but she don't hear me cry
she's a long hearted mystic and she can't carry on
when I'm there she's all right but when she's not then I'm gone

heaven knows that the answers she's don't calling no one
she's the way for sailing beautiful, she's mine for the one
and I lost her hesitation by temptation as it runs
but she don't holler me 'cause I'm not there I'm gone

now I'll cry tonight like I cried the night before
and I'm leased on the heights but I dream about the door
it's alone, she's forsaken by a fate worse to tell
it don't have compensation, she's my own fare thee well

now when I treat the lady, I was born to love her
but she knows that the kingdom waits so high above her
and I run but I race but it's not too fast or slow
but I don't perceive her I'm not there I'm gone

well it's all about temptation as I cry for her veil
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell
and it's all affirmation I receive but it's not
she's a lone-hearted beauty but she don't block the spot
and she won't

yes she's gone like the rainbow that was shining yesterday
but now she's home beside me and I'd like for her to stay
she's a form forsaking beauty and it don't trust anyone
I wish I was beside her but I'm not there I'm gone

well it's too hard to staking and I don't quite believe
it's a bag fort (?) amusing that she's hard too hard to leave
it's a load it's a crime the way she won't be around
but she told for to hate me but just a dawn forsaken clown

yes I believe that it's rightful oh I believe it in my mind
I been told like I said when I before carry on the cryin'
and she saw get to told her like I said carry on
I wish I was there to help her but I'm not there I'm gone

-Bob Dylan

Hmmm... I think I need another listen...

I was surprised how little improved the fidelity of this song is on
the soundtrack...  It would have been nice to have a few more
unreleased songs on it...

I think the next Bootleg Series should be a Basement Tapes box...
entitled, 'I Shall Be Released'... or 'Remastered' at least... and
then released...  It's high time... and you're not there...

Yeah, that's exactly what I hope for... sure hope they don't have yet
another live set in mind... a good run of studio cuts for a few
volumes would suit me fine.
