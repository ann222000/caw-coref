Rational and Irrational, Thought and instincts

Fire!!!

Is it ever justifiable to shout fire, where there is none?

I am thinking of the man who shouts fire, not caring for the
truth of that statement. The man attracted to the irrational.
The thrill seeker, or the mob leader, who is suddenly in his
elements amongst amidst the ensuing panic. Exploiting our
fears, enraptured by his function, as he promotes the the
instinctual response so as to dominate all reason.

Fire!!!

There is no time to question the shout, there is just haste,
the actions of those around you. In that state, rational or
irrational, matters not. In that situation we adapt to the
behaviors we see around us. What logic we claim to observe,
takes it cue from those dominant behaviors.

Who in that situation would stop to question their perception,
who would stop to test their logic. Fire or not, we would see
smoke and smell burning.

I am thinking of the logic founded on lies, his cries. The
absences of thought, or question as those cries force our
oldest instincts to the fore.  Reason it seems, can only
exist where a state of measured calm allows, Reason thriving
when no other alert dominates.

fire!!!

In the confusion there is no  time to question our behavior,
no time to question our motives. Instinct has no time, instead
there is the assumption no rational person would create, or
exploit this state of panic for their own self-serving ends.

We will find that there are a great number of those who are very well suited
to the task of reasoning very clearly precisely within the panic senario. It
is the reinstitution of this "natural alignment" between the trying task and
the capable which conjurs up the necessity for all social upheaval.

I took my daughter to a class on what to do if you are attacked by a
stranger. The teacher recommended to the children that if they are
grabbed by a stranger, they should shout "fire!".

I asked her about it after class. It seems that when a child shouts
"help" few people bother to take notice, but if he shouts "fire" then
others will look (if for no other reason than to make sure they are not
in danger.)

In other words, yes it can be justified. A person in danger is more
likely to receive help if he can convince others that they are also in
danger.

There again, the act of reasoning in this senerio, might lead
some to call that contrary voice an arsonist, just for drawing
attention to the near invisible alarmist exploiting our instinctual
responses. Irrational i know, but such is the group, caught up
in a panicked response.

I find myself observing what almost defies thought. Surrounded
by the irrational. I look for, but fail to find, these people you
say think clearly in panic scenarios. Maybe it takes training and
an element of experience, maybe there is too much to be gained
in panic, too few reasons to promote thought, on what has always
defied thought.  Instead one has these simple answers which none
dare contest. Simple, cheaply constructed answers making those
who accept these answers, equally simple and thus so much easier
to panic.

== Natural alignment ==

I am intrigued by your response. It could almost read as, a social
experiment, where this 'upheaval' is used to inspire the 'capable'
to 'try'. You speak of a "Natural alignment", and yet there are
some many forces at work, such that whatever results, will find
itself shifted further from any previous notion of alignment.
We've become so much better at hiding the reasons for alignment.

On another level, I can think of better ways to promote effort,
than cracking this whip, or prompting the panicked into a response.
The states promoted with these sharp sticks, has a way circumventing
any ordered response, making a nonsense of thought.

So how does one align between, say, the comfortable and those in
discomfort? This 'experiment', has always relied on the other side
to balance its designs. Yet one has to wonder if this is accounted
for by the over-zealous designer.

When those in discomfort are denied the means to a voice, denied
the insights to make sense of their discomfort, labeled so that
whatever they might offer as counter, is ignored as non-sense,
where does one find that necessarily contrary voice? Without
those with the keenest sense of this discomfort, there will just
be the tiniest perception of the whole, offered by the comfortable.
Existing within the allowable answers, seeing only what he has
been shown, shaping his answers from a culture which is itself
a limited view of the whole. So we devolve our perception of
truth.

Interesting take. It says something for the potency of certain
instinctual cues, these older hardwired responses.

The question is how might this be used counter to our actual safety.
The group stampeded, panicked as they occupy the frame of mind where
instincts are given precedence over rational thought.

The power of instincts to circumvent our normal rational, can limit
our otherwise rational judgment, leading to the use of instincts to
promote the irrational.

Given the right circumstance we will jump to form the conclusions
demanded by that situation, and not see how myopic that judgment is.

This is *exactly* when you should test your logic. Thinking clearly in
panic situations promotes survival. If we are paying attention, we will
not see smoke and smell burning. It is possible to pay attention in a
panic situation. Calm is a mental state. It is possible to be
completely calm and reasonable while surrounded by panic. It is
possible to think clearly while jacked on adrenaline. Just because
everyone around you is flailing about, doesn't mean that you
necessarily have to follow suit.

In some situations like this you might have time to use reason.  Do I
smell anything? etc.  But the truth is in most cases you would have to
make an irrational, intuitive call.  Especially if you were with your
kids in the theater.  You wouldn´t stand around deducting and
anylysing and thinking of statistics of false alarms.  You would
decide intuitively between the dangers potentially present and
obviously present - other panicing people, for example.

You would, though, be thinking of other things, such as:  Are all my
kids here?  Where are the exits?  Which exit is the closest?  Which is
the easiest exit to reach through the crowd?  Those might be quick
judgements, but there's nothing 'irrational' about any of them.

The point is, you would decide; the only question being whether you
think of what to do by reason, or by some other mechanism: in your
case, 'intuition.'  But just what is this strange 'intuition?

I say 'strange' because it's apparently not the normal method of
deciding; for example, the decision to take the kids to that movie
would not have been based on 'intuition,' but a process of reasoning
all the steps of which could be identified.  And the decision to take
one's kids out of the theatre, using this or that exit, looks no
different except for the limited time available to reach a
conclusion.

">

A part of me agrees with you, the group needs the example of those
who remain calm, those who continue to see the ordinary as the ordinary.
That said, the calm man might find himself trampled underfoot. Judged
against the group's instinctual reactions, he might find he was judged
harshly. 'What reason has he for not running as we do?' 'Why doesn't
his behavior match our own?'.

There are two kinds of minds at work, if you like, mindsets governed by
state. The calm can draw on his recently evolved functions, his reason
match to his state. The panicked, will find their state, activates those
older dormant functions, pre-thought, instincts, where our biochemistry
dominate our reactions.

Makes you wonder what exactly it is we evolve, function or state? what
would determine evolution in those regards? And yet as you say, that
Adrenaline rich state does come with its advantages, access to a greater
breadth of information, for one, even if there is a cost for that
short lived [?] advantage. Society encourages the inflamed, the passionate,
with its recourse to older goal oriented thinking. The inflamed which often
comes with some minor cost to health. Instincts we say are good, even as
they limit our more recent adaptions.

My point, is we often have little choice but to follow our oldest functions.
Also, predictable or managed responses often means this recourse to instincts.
If i still have a point, it is to reserve judgement for those shouting 'Fire',
or whatever cue used to force us to act solely on instinct. Is is too easy
to be manipulated on that level. You might even says there is too much
potential in that area of control, for it not to find a use....

The instinctual might very well lead to habits which contradict the rational,
If so how does the rational co-exist?

I don't think that's the assumption at all.  Rather, I'd say that the
audience member (particularly one with children) goes through a
reasoning process similar to that of Pascal's Wager:

There are four possibilities:
1A There is no fire, and I act as if there is a fire.
1B There is no fire, and I act as if there is no fire.
2A There is a fire, and I act as if there is a fire.
2B There is a fire, and I act as if there is no fire.
One and only one possibility, 2B is unacceptable.  The only way to
eliminate that possibility is to act as if there is a fire.

&gt; &gt; I took my daughter to a class on what to do if you are attacked by a
&gt; &gt; stranger. The teacher recommended to the children that if they are
&gt; &gt; grabbed by a stranger, they should shout &quot;fire!&quot;.

&gt; &gt; I asked her about it after class. It seems that when a child shouts
&gt; &gt; &quot;help&quot; few people bother to take notice, but if he shouts &quot;fire&quot; then
&gt; &gt; others will look (if for no other reason than to make sure they are not
&gt; &gt; in danger.)

&gt; &gt; In other words, yes it can be justified. A person in danger is more
&gt; &gt; likely to receive help if he can convince others that they are also
&gt; &gt; in danger.

&gt; Interesting take. It says something for the potency of certain
&gt; instinctual cues, these older hardwired responses.

It says no such thing, unless one presumes that the behavior of
responding to the word "Fire!" is 'instinctual' or 'hardwired' rather
than a reasoned response to the quite reasonable equation of fire and
danger.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The question is how might this be used counter to our actual safety.
&gt; The group stampeded, panicked as they occupy the frame of mind where
&gt; instincts are given precedence over rational thought.

Interesting thought experiment: postulate a person who spoke English
and was raised  in an environment in which he'd had plenty of
experience with fire (and so knew perfectly well what the word
referred to),  but had never come across any evidence tht fire was
dangerous.  Would that person have the same 'instinctive,' 'hardwired'
' reaction of panic when hearing the word shouted?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The power of instincts to circumvent our normal rational, can limit
&gt; our otherwise rational judgment, leading to the use of instincts to
&gt; promote the irrational.
">

I see some evidence that even the most 'irrational' and 'instinctive'
forms of reactions are acquired and changeable:  For instance, the hot
button responses to the words 'homosexual' and 'cigarette smoker', and
how those have changed in just my lifetime.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Given the right circumstance we will jump to form the conclusions
&gt; demanded by that situation, and not see how myopic that judgment is.
">

In what way is the judgement 'myopic'?  If it is risky to even attempt
to verify all one's premises, but one has to act as if some premises
are true, what is irrational about minimizing the worst possible
choice (in this case, acting as if there's no fire when there is one,
and having oneself or one's child die as a result)?

Very good. This instinct of ours to pick 2B quickly is even part of
the attraction of Pascal's Religious Wager, to, for what can you lose
if wrong. Some learn to exploit this jumpiness but they are then free-
riders as in games theory and we would expect the consequential
ridicule and ostricism to balance the desire to exploit these
weaknesses in order to move up rank in social dominance hierarchies.
Social ridicule could hinder the advantage possibly gained. Maybe this
is really why we have such laws about shouting fire, they are grafted
on top of other neural developments which bother the free-riders.
Instincts vs Instincts.

A new theory of cognitive biases, called error management theory
(EMT), proposes that psychological mechanisms are designed to be
predictably biased when the costs of false-positive and false-negative
errors were asymmetrical over evolutionary history. This theory
explains known phenomena such as men's overperception of women's
sexual intent, and it predicts new biases in social inference such as
women's underestimation of men's commitment.

Buss comments on Error Management Theory. In an uncertain world, two
potential errors in thinking: a. partner having affair (but isn't) b.
partner isn't having affair (but is) The cost of making those two
errors are very different. Those making the first error have less cost
(from a reproductive success standpoint) than those who make the
second. Theoretically we evolved toward vigilance and are more likely
to make adaptive error. Explains why men and women sometimes have
delusions that a partner is unfaithful or might be. "It's not paranoia
if they're really out to get you!"

Error Management Theory

Humans live in an uncertain world. We rely on our senses to pick up
information from the world, and then use our information processing
capacities to make inferences about the true state of the world. Real
threats to our survival and relationships are not always readily
apparent, given the ambiguity and uncertainty of the information.

Consider a relatively simple problem of walking through the woods and
fleetingly sensing a slithering object scurry underneath some leaves
in the path directly in front of you. There are two possible states of
reality: either there is a dangerous snake in your path or there is
not a dangerous snake in your path. Given the incomplete and uncertain
information that you have percieved, there are also two inferences you
could make. There is indeed a dangerous snake, and you act to avoid
it. Or you could conclude that there is no snake and continue walking
down the path.

There are also two possible ways that you could be wrong. You could
believe that there is a snake when in fact no snake exists. Or you
could believe that no snake when in fact a venomous rattler is lurking
right in your path. The costs of these two types of errors, however,
are vastly different. In the first case, your belief causes you to
incur the trivial metabolic cost of taking an unnecessary evasive
action. By giving a wide birth to the area that you believe harbors a
snake, you have merely gone out of your way a little, incurring a
minor delay in your walk. In the second case, however, failing to
detect a snake that is in fact lurking in your path can cost you your
life. THe two ways of being wrong carry substantially different costs.

Now imagine that this scenario not only repeats itself thousands and
thousands of times in your liftime, but billions and billions of times
over human evolutionary history. Those who made the first kind of
mistake tended to survive, whereas those who made the second kind of
mistake tended to die. As a result, modern humans have descended from
a line of ancestors whose inferences about the uncertain world erred
in the direction of believing that snakes existed more than they do.
These can be called adaptive errors.

Consider uncertainty about whether your romantic partner is having an
affair or is likely to have an affair.... Continued on page 76 The

I agree with most of what you say, except i would add
our Reason is bound to a collective idea of what is
fair to assume in that situation. If our culture were
one of people shouting hoax alarms, we might delay our
decision for a quick appraisal of the situation. In
other words we would factor that into our consideration.

Our culture, or our shared ideas for what is normal,
is a key part of our decision making process, short
of experiences to the contrary we act on the apparent
alarm.

or to put it another way....

Your logic isn't in dispute. I am say precisely because this
logic seems so clearly the right thing to do, it has the potential
of being hi-jacked. Its the unquestionable nature of this rational
which makes it instinctual, there is no need for thought. One acts
as the alarm dictates.

My point is the lack of alternatives in this state, can lead to
a misconstrued logic, one founded on lies. Alarms sought or
constructed for this response. Alarms exploited with this
unquestioned response in mind.

How do we reason on this level? With no example to aid us on
this level of control, what tools have we to see why we might
need to temper our almost mechanical response to the alarm.

The irrational comes out of this commitment to the alarm. With
no way to question what is done in its name, we act blindly,
doing whatever the alarm says must be done. All with no other
thought.

This is an old problem and from my perspective we seem no closer
to an answer. Modern or not, we are compelled to follow these
rules of survival.
