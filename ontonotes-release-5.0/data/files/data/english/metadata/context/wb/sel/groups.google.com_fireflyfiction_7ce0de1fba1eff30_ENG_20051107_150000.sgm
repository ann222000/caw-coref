Part 4
See part 0 for header information.

Simon hurried along the corridor, trying to look busy and not out of place. He
was self-conscious with the fear of discovery, and all too aware he had not
been around the research facility long enough to have absorbed its moods and
rhythms, or have a sense of how its staff acted normally. Somewhere like this,
he would normally expect to be able to fade into the background, but they did
not get many strangers or visitors out on Riarden, and he was a novelty. Should
there be trouble, they would remember they had seen him, and where.

&quot;Excuse me.&quot; He snagged a focused-looking intern. &quot;Have you seen Professor
Sherwin?&quot;

&quot;Not since this morning. He was working in lab 4.&quot; The intern shrugged an
apology and hurried on.

It hadn't been that long since the professor had left their company, near the
end of the treatment, the incriminating file under his arm. There must be
somewhere in the research centre where all of the files were kept, and while
Simon might not be able to ask where that was without drawing suspicion upon
himself, there was every chance he would happen upon someone whose last sight
of the professor had been as he headed there.

A tall woman he recognised as one of the senior researchers introduced to him
in the canteen that morning was just turning out of a room a little way ahead.
He sped his own steps to catch up to her.

&quot;Excuse me! I'm looking for Professor Sherwin. Could you tell me where I might
find him?&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; The woman looked surprised, and a vague sort of puzzlement crossed her
face as she thought it over. &quot;Oh, yes. He said he was going down to Files and
Records. It's at the end of corridor 6A. Just past the synthetic tissue
labs.&quot;

***

Inara looked sharply toward the bed as she heard Mal stir; heard a soft sound
almost a groan. She saw his eyelashes flutter, moved closer to watch him while
he tried to climb out of the anaesthetic, not quite able.

&quot;Mal,&quot; she said, and touched his arm, giving him something to focus on. And
again, as his head moved slightly, eyelids stirring over eyes still not yet
open, &quot;Mal.&quot;

&quot;You been... here all this time?&quot; he murmured sluggishly, so quiet she had to
pick the most of it up from the movements of his lips. &quot;How's your professor
feel about that one?&quot;

&quot;He's working,&quot; Inara said, finding herself unable to muster too much
irritation when he was barely even coherent yet. His eyes finally opened a
crack and his head turned fractionally her way. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;

&quot;At the moment, don't feel much of anything,&quot; he slurred, and halted,
premature, as though he'd have said more. His head turned experimentally, one
side to another. &quot;Huh. How about that? Gorram room's staying put.&quot; He turned
back to her, blinking several times quickly. &quot;Guess that means it worked.&quot;

&quot;I guess it does.&quot; Her skin felt too tight for her face, and her smile
threatened to split it, as she blinked moisture from her own eyes.

His next question surprised her, or at least the concern in it did. &quot;Where's
Simon?&quot;

&quot;He's around... He said he had to look up something that might help River,
while we were here... Mal, wait!&quot; She pressed him back down into the bed as he
tried to swing up only to end up lurching, almost falling. &quot;The sedative will
take time to fully wear off. You can't just start dashing about. Is something
wrong? Do you need Simon?&quot; She heard the concern ring through in her own
voice.

&quot;No,&quot; he said, and shook his head minutely, maybe distracted by nausea or the
residual weakness from the drugs. He sank back into the bed, and she noted how
his limbs flopped boneless in relaxation. &quot;No call for that. I'm good, Inara.
One thing you can say about Simon, he knows his doctoring.&quot; He grimaced,
frowned around the room, and slowly eased himself into more comfortable a
position. &quot;Doesn't look like I'll be going anywhere a while... how long was I
out, anyway?&quot;

&quot;It's been a little over seven hours. I have to confess, I don't think I've
ever seen you stay still for quite so long.&quot; She took her hands from him,
seeing him settled back, and perched on the edge of the wheelchair still at the
side of the bed. &quot;I'm sure Simon will be back soon, and then we can start
talking about returning to Serenity.&quot;

&quot;Your professor so keen to see you go?&quot; he prodded.

Of course, Mal being Mal, he wouldn't be able to resist making some comment.
&quot;He knows we can't risk lingering,&quot; she said. &quot;Hoyle and I, Mal... it's - &quot;

&quot;What? Complicated? Old news? Speaking of old news... I'll say. Must be a tough
job not to get him so wound up he don't drop dead on the spot, so to speak.
Can't say it ain't a hell of a way to go, but... that guy? Seriously, Inara,
you must've been practically a kid when you and he were... Right?&quot;

She folded her arms, annoyed. &quot;Not that it's any of your business, but I'll
service clients of any legal age. That's been true since I left the academy. I
don't see what it has to do with anything, but why don't you go ahead and say
whatever it is you're going to say, Mal? I can tell you've been itching to
since we arrived here.&quot;

He laughed that higher-pitched, off-balance laugh that was usually a sign to
tread softly. Inara had been trained well in the art of setting men
off-balance, but Mal in those circumstances tended to act more unpredictably
than most. &quot;So, you and grandpa...&quot; She sighed inwardly. &quot;You're telling me
this was a normal companion-client relationship?&quot;

&quot;He asked me to stay with him once, it's true.&quot;

&quot;Inara - half your gorram client base asks you to stay with them. Some more
than the once. I never saw any of them short of Atherton you were fixing to
accept.&quot;

&quot;Luckily there are men in the 'verse with more charm and personal integrity
than Atherton Wing,&quot; Inara told him fiercely. &quot;I could have accepted. He had
the money, back then. And even if he hadn't...&quot; She all but choked on the
words, and glared at Mal to pass the time until her voice came back. &quot;No, it
wasn't a normal companion-client relationship. We were friends. We've always...
seemed to fit together.&quot;

&quot;So you were... close.&quot; He put an uncommon amount of emphasis on that last
word. &quot;And this guy asks you to stay - for as short a time as that would be. I
mean, come on, Inara, by the time you were forty, he'd be dead - &quot;

She fixed him with a cold look. &quot;Even if that's the truth, anyone with a
*heart* would have refrained from speaking it.&quot;

&quot;Ain't got no heart, is the general consensus. Got an itty bitty chip of hard,
cold rock. You know that,&quot; he chided mockingly. &quot;Anyway, this guy asks you to
stay... and you don't. So why didn't you? Stay?&quot;

Inara looked down at her hands; realised she'd curled them up together, white
knuckles betraying emotion, and loosed them and spread them on her knees. &quot;Bad
timing,&quot; she merely said. His eye-roll forced her to elaboration. &quot;His offer to
settle down came at the time I was looking to start moving. Which isn't to say
I haven't ever regretted not taking it, especially in those early days. It took
me a long while to find a ship I felt safe on.&quot; She frowned at him
meaningfully.

&quot;*Serenity*. You know, I've always wondered what in the hell made you pick my
boat.&quot;

&quot;You didn't feel like a bunch of brainless brigands,&quot; she told him sourly. &quot;Of
course, first impressions can be so wrong.&quot;

&quot;No, really - &quot; He reached over and touched the arm of the wheelchair. &quot;What
was it made you pick my boat? Even saying you wanted to travel on a small ship,
and the why and how of that is something I've long given up asking... plenty
more of those around.&quot;

She sighed and stood, pacing away from the chair. By the time she turned back,
his hands had retreated to his sides. &quot;It felt like a home - I mean, look at
your crew, Mal. Even back then, you had a slip of a girl and a married couple,
*before* picking up the rest of your strays. And you do have a habit of...
collecting people.&quot;

He clicked his fingers and held one up, stalling her. &quot;If this is about to get
onto how it was my innate charm... why, I might just cry.&quot; And the bitterness
that came through in that unbalanced *her*. &quot;So that's why you joined. Why'd
you come back?&quot;

&quot;I told you why.&quot; She turned her back on him again, unwilling to watch his
face. &quot;*Serenity* feels like home to me, now more than ever. I missed her. I
missed Kaylee, and Zoe, and Book... maybe I even missed you, a little.&quot; She
cast a glare over her shoulder, making doubly sure he could not miss the
sarcasm.

&quot;I didn't expect you to.&quot; His helpless reply was softer, more awkward than
anticipated, and drew her to turn around fully. &quot;I mean, when you said you were
leaving, I really thought you meant it.&quot;

Inara tried to hold his gaze unflinching. &quot;So did I. When I said it, I did mean
it. &quot;

There was a long pause, where he looked as at sea in the conversation as she
felt herself, and they searched each others faces more in hopes of finding an
absence than the confirmation that, as always, they did find.

&quot;So why did you really - &quot;

&quot;Because I was weak,&quot; she snapped, despite the feeling he was only trying to
break the mood by annoying her.

&quot;Well.&quot; He swallowed and flashed a forced smile and looked decidedly ticked.
&quot;That's real nice. And it's glad I am you came back... not only for the
bribing-mine-officials thing neither, mind, 'cause, well... not to say it ain't
like there was no-one to argue with, lacking you aboard - hell, we both know
that's one thing can always be found on my boat - but it just weren't...&quot; He
pulled a face and shook his head, making a frustrated sound. &quot;I guess there's
just something you might call real special about these arguments 'tween you and
me just can't take no substitute.&quot;

&quot;Like their frequency, for one,&quot; Inara said.

Mal nodded; a curt jerk of his head. &quot;Fact almost every discussion we have
turns into one.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Certainly. And they're... very punctual, too. I've often considered
setting my hourglass by the five o' clock *shouting match*.&quot; She'd started to
raise her voice, but was increasingly aware of the smirk trying to break
through his very deliberately black frown, and the fact she was herself growing
nearer to laughter than shouting.

They both broke at the same time and he reached out to her, laughing, and she
batted his hand away.

&quot;Inara - &quot; he began, as they both quieted.

She swallowed and shook her head, and what came out was far too choked and
hushed to be her own voice. &quot;Even if everything else... *were* right, Mal - and
it isn't, and it can't be - you would demand of me that I give up a part of who
I am, and I don't know if I could do that. I don't even know if I *should* do
that... if it would be... fair.&quot;

&quot;Fair?&quot; he repeated, almost as quiet. &quot;We're talking about 'fair' now?&quot;

She looked down at her hands, then back to him. &quot;You have no idea.&quot;

&quot;Guess I never do give you enough credit for that ability to say 'no', after
all,&quot; Mal said, as she turned her head. &quot;Inara.&quot;

She didn't look his way.

&quot;Inara.&quot; There was something harder in his voice this time that cut through her
resolve. Different. Not right. His eyes drifted to the door and he'd pulled
himself up to sitting. &quot;Want you to go take a look around, see if you can't
find Simon.&quot;

It took her a moment to recover speech, to wonder how much she'd said that
hadn't been necessary at all. &quot;You think something's wrong?&quot;

&quot;I think he's been a long while. Could be there's a reason for that. You know
how the doctor is for finding trouble.&quot;

She nodded, half relieved for the excuse to leave him, but at the same time...
disappointed, despite herself. &quot;I'll find him, yes. We can always argue later.
We really should leave here as soon as we can.&quot;

&quot;Good girl.&quot; He nodded back, and since she was already all but out of the door,
she didn't waste too much time in feeling patronised by that comment.

She was several corridors away when Hoyle, turning a corner, practically ran
into her, his breathing so laboured she could actively worry about Mal's
uncharitable quip.

&quot;What's the matter?&quot; It was all too obvious that something was.

&quot;Your doctor friend - he's set off any number of system alerts picking through
our data files,&quot; Hoyle said, anger as well as urgency underlying. &quot;Security
picked him up. You have to take your captain and get out of here, Inara. You
have to go *now*.&quot;

***

_Chapter 5_

&quot;Hoyle...&quot; Her protest faltered as she searched his face, and she resisted when
he tried to steer her the way she'd just come, back toward Mal. &quot;Simon
wouldn't, I'm sure. He said there were a few things he needed to look up while
he was here, but he can't have meant to - it must be a mistake.&quot;

Her thoughts were racing. *Mal*, she decided angrily. Mal had known something
he had not shared with her. He'd known Simon would have reason to be in
trouble. And Simon - Simon had been so odd, earlier. Then he'd mentioned River
and she'd accepted it as though all her training counted for nothing.

&quot;You don't bypass security barriers to access restricted files by 'mistake',
Inara.&quot; He released her arm uncertainly. &quot;What are you intending to do?&quot;

&quot;I - &quot; She knew this man. She *trusted* him. She took a long breath. &quot;I have to
get Simon out. He can't be taken into Alliance custody. He's tagged,
Hoyle.&quot;

&quot;There isn't a way,&quot; he responded instantly, barrelling through his shock.
&quot;Security have him detained. They might not get much to do out here, but there
are still too many of them, and they're hardly going to let you walk in and
take him.&quot; He saw her expression and added defensively, &quot;You know I want to
help you. I didn't expect it to get so complicated.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; She bowed her head. &quot;I didn't intend to bring trouble down on you.
I'm sure Simon can't have meant... it must have been something very important,
for him to do this.&quot;

&quot;You still maintain these are good people?&quot; he asked; something of doubt in his
voice, but also a gentle note of tease.

&quot;They've been all but family for a year and a half,&quot; she told him with passion.
&quot;Hoyle, I need you to do something for me. I need you to go to Mal - to the
captain. He'll need to know what's going on, and he'll need help. Get him on
his feet if you can - &quot; She briefly clutched his shoulders with both hands.

He caught her wrists as she withdrew. &quot;There's no time. You both need to get
out of here quickly. Your captain will be under suspicion, and maybe you as
well once they've had time to do some digging. You can't rescue... Simon, but
right now there's still a chance for the two of you.&quot;

&quot;I'm not leaving him behind. If they take him, they take us all, Hoyle. That's
how it works. It... isn't just concern for a comrade. Please, just... do as I
ask.&quot;

&quot;What *have* you involved yourself in?&quot; He caught her shoulder as she turned
away. &quot;What will you be doing?&quot;

&quot;I need some things from my shuttle.&quot;

&quot;Take my ground-car.&quot; A code-key pressed into her palm.

Inara silently nodded her thanks, then hurried away.

It didn't take long to get from the research centre into the landing pad
outside Hoyle's apartment block in the vehicle. She parked it up clumsily in
the low gravity and all but ran across the hard ground to her own shuttle.

Inside, she beamed a hasty message up to Serenity. &quot;Wash, we need pick-up.
Simon's got himself taken in by security. We'll try to get him out and get away
in the shuttle, but we'll need you to meet us.&quot; The shuttle could not carry
them fast enough nor far enough to avoid scout ships should the local Alliance
policing forces be alerted. But Serenity could be out of there faster than it
would take the Alliance to prepare their more powerful, long-range vessels.
&quot;Wash?&quot; There was no reply, but they would get the message, hopefully sooner
rather than later. &quot;We'll see you in a few hours.&quot;

Silence and static, and she cut communication; her body sagged a moment in the
chair before she could force herself back to action. They had left all weapons
inside her shuttle - Mal could hardly go armed into the facility, but there had
always been the possibility they'd have to fight their way out. Now, Inara
strapped Mal's gunbelt on and hid her own tiny pistol in the folds of her
dress. Finally, she pulled on a shawl and let its heavy fabric hide Mal's
pistol at her hip.

She lifted off the shuttle, and guided it the short distance back to the
research facility.

***

&quot;Inara said she was coming back?&quot; Mal asked, a disbelieving - or perhaps just
despairing - laugh escaping him, as he yanked the edge of his shirt from
Professor Sherwin's grasp and started clumsily fastening the buttons. Gorram
fingers still felt like they belonged to someone else, and didn't it just top
off his whole week having grandpa help him dress?

&quot;Yes,&quot; the old man said crisply, and one thing at least, he wasn't sounding any
happier than Mal felt about having Inara in the thick of all this.

Mal swore in Chinese and abandoned the buttons, figuring half was plenty enough
for decency. He let the professor guide him to perch on the edge of the bed
while he helped him on with his boots, leaning over still not being a plan of
the recommended variety. Most movement still peppered his head with sparks, and
it was as though after four days not being able to stand straight his body had
forgotten quite how to manage it, even if it had all the parts required to do
so. He watched the professor, the strain that showed in his lined face.

&quot;Look, Prof, about the doc - &quot;

&quot;You don't need to explain anything.&quot;

And weren't that the most cynical... Mal dug his fingers into the man's
shoulder, making him look up and pay attention. &quot;We didn't set out to cause you
trouble. Know you helped us and all. Helped Inara. Simon's... just trying to
help someone that he cares about. Thought he could find the answer in your
files.&quot;

&quot;There's nothing in those except old research that has so many security codes
slapped in place I've never even seen most of it,&quot; the professor snapped. &quot;And
from what I know of the history of this facility, it's hard to see how that
information could *help* anyone, except yourselves to pocket the proceeds from
selling Alliance weapon technology on the black market.&quot;

&quot;'Cause obviously it'll only see safe and responsible use in Alliance hands - &quot;
Mal started, and cut himself off. &quot;No, gorram it.&quot; He shoved the professor away
and managed to get stood on his own two feet. Tottered the short distance over
to the wall next to the door, as much for leaning on as to be ready for any
security uniforms felt like bursting in. &quot;We didn't come here to steal. Didn't
set out planning to abuse your trust and, hell, even if I'm not so much for
caring on *that* score, I certainly didn't set out to abuse Inara's.&quot;

Professor Sherwin was quiet a moment. Mal took the time to pull his suspenders
up onto his shoulders. Stopped stone dead with the last one half-raised as the
professor said, &quot;You do care for her, don't you?&quot;

&quot;That's kind of complicated,&quot; Mal said cagily, setting the suspender in place
and rearranging his shirt. &quot;Reckon you know what I mean.&quot;

&quot;Inara's a free spirit.&quot; And that statement was all kinds of bland, but he
wondered, all the same, if all of Inara's wiles could catch the frustration -
even anger - under there, or if there wasn't a point she became too close,
wiles or no wiles.

As to whether you'd call that a flash of sympathy among the resentment... well,
Mal wasn't about to over-analyse, though it did occur to him that if Hoyle
could read him as clear then evasion was an exercise in pointlessness. &quot;It's
one way to put it. Plus, I ain't so keen on the whoring, and - like I said,
complicated.&quot;

The professor coughed and looked mighty uncomfortable at the 'w' word, and
asked in faint disbelief, &quot;Yet you rent out a shuttle to her, and she... stays?
She claims she's happy...&quot;

Mal shot him a put-out glare. &quot;Inara's just fine on my boat, don't you concern
yourself. Woman can give good as she gets, else I wouldn't never... you
know.&quot;

The door slid open, and he was halfway to either catching her in a stranglehold
or landing himself in a heap at her feet - a toss-up as to which - when she
said, &quot;Wouldn't what, Mal?&quot;

He caught himself against the wall. &quot;Professor and me just talking.&quot;

She rolled her eyes and reached into the folds of her shawl to unclip something
from around her waist. Moment later she dumped his gunbelt in his hands. &quot;'Just
talk' while you put that on, then.&quot;

He wasn't oblivious to her angry eyes on him as he awkwardly fastened the belt
into place and experimentally drew. Slower'n hell, hands a mass of thumbs. Good
enough. Staying on his feet would be the trickier part.

&quot;When were you planning to tell me, Mal?&quot; Inara asked.

&quot;What - ?&quot; he looked up, caught off guard, and saw her looking mighty pissed.

&quot;Simon,&quot; she stressed. &quot;He found something, didn't he? And there is only one
thing that could make him take such a risk - &quot;

She silenced as his eyes slipped over to Hoyle. Her outrage dissipated as she
cottoned on that it was as much a matter of protection as trust. But Inara
turned to the professor with betrayal in her face. &quot;What are you involved in?&quot;
she breathed.

Mal opened his mouth to tell her it wasn't like that, this was all long before
the fellow had even come to the facility, but Hoyle's face said otherwise, and
he remembered the information he'd passed to Simon. Alliance was using this
research centre to either develop or study the nastier of their weapon tech,
and grandpa... grandpa was in it up to his neck.

&quot;Inara,&quot; Hoyle said brokenly, hands reaching out but never connecting. &quot;It was
the compromise I had to make... to do the work I wanted to do. The funding,
after that first year, it was... I was failing. I had to start looking at the
options I'd ruled out. I couldn't run this place the way I'd envisioned. All
those old thoughts proved... unrealistic.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you'd have 'lost me'?&quot; Inara demanded.

Mal caught her as she took a confrontational step toward the professor, and set
her back a pace. &quot;We don't have time for this right now.&quot;

&quot;There won't ever *be* another time,&quot; Inara said, shaking him off.

He caught her again. &quot;The professor provided Simon the information to let him
sort this mischief of mine once and for all, so far as I'm concerned he gets
the benefit of a doubt with me, and *we don't have time for this, Inara*. We
need to get Simon and get out.&quot; He turned to the professor. &quot;You know where
they're keeping him?&quot;

Grandpa nodded. Not much in the way of hesitation, and Mal guessed he was
looking to redeem himself with Inara now.

And Mal wasn't averse to taking advantage. &quot;That case, we need you to lay out
the ground for us,&quot; he said. &quot;We got to formulate ourselves a plan.&quot;

***

The light in the office felt somehow like a harsher glare, though was the same
he'd been working under the past forty-eight hours. Simon clasped his hands
together and kept them still on the table top in front of him, trying not to
move at all. Perhaps it was the very fact they tended not to get many security
situations on this far-flung moon that seemed to be making his guards so
jumpy.

Even so, they'd taken a break in their inept questioning and just one of them
was holding a gun on him now, while the second poured out three coffees and the
flush of a toilet beyond the door at the back of the office advertised the
whereabouts of the third.

These were civilian security personnel, not Alliance, but he knew the Alliance
had been called, and Inara had mentioned there was no shortage of soldiers
garrisoned on Riarden. Once the Alliance ran his genetic profile, they'd find
out he was tagged and working under an alias...

The burlier of the guards walked behind him with the coffee and he stiffened,
half-expecting another knee in the kidneys or some other such delightful trick.
But as he came around and set the mugs down there was a tap on the door. The
guard who'd just emerged from the back incautiously went over to key in the
security code.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Simon tried to stifle his reaction when he heard Inara's voice. He
blinked rapidly as the companion stepped over the threshold, security too
astonished to stop her. Her green dress made her glitter like a jewel in their
midst, and it seemed nobody could form words or react. &quot;Steven,&quot; she greeted
Simon, with a sober nod, and looked around at the guards with indignation.
&quot;Would you care to tell me what precisely is the meaning of this? I was most
distraught to discover my friend had been *arrested*, of all things.&quot;

&quot;I - we - that is - &quot; The security man she'd rounded on - the one with his gun
out to cover Simon - stammered, and his arm wavered. Inara was half blocking
his aim, but faced with her swirl of finery and sexuality and, overwhelmingly,
anger, he could neither edge away nor muster protest. &quot;He's not arrested,
ma'am. We don't have the authority - but the Alliance are on their way. You'll
need to talk to Lieutenant Amner when he arrives.&quot;

Inara's gaze swept disparagingly over the small, shabby office and those
present in it, the three security men still stuck at the gawping stage. And
Simon did not miss the very deliberate catch in her eyes as she slid them from
Simon to the guard who stood almost at his side.

He barely stopped himself from acting the moment the gesture sank in. There was
still a gun upon him. There would be a moment for action - Inara's plan was
surely to create one. Doubts ate at him as he made himself remain stationary.
Even if they caught them by surprise, he and Inara could not take on three
armed men and hope to win.

Inara had turned back to the guard she'd marked out as her own, and she railed
in his face, &quot;I have no intention of waiting for Lieutenant Amner to arrive!
This is some wretched mistake on the part of you people. You took my friend in,
and you can let him *loose*. I'll have you know, I can have you tossed out of
this job in a *second*.&quot; Her voice rose to a painfully shrill level. His gun
hand wavered, and then Inara's body was blocking his shot completely.

The guard next to Simon proved they weren't completely inept by way of the hand
reaching for his weapon, but by that time Simon was already moving, praying
he'd judged the signal and the timing right. He tackled the guard, throwing all
his weight into the move, and for a moment was afraid he'd failed ridiculously
as the heavier man staggered but kept his balance. Then the two of them were in
a pile on the floor, the guard still trying to draw his gun as Simon
desperately ploughed his fists into the man's face, trying to gain himself
chance to find the pressure point at the neck that would send his opponent down
quietly.

&quot;Stop!&quot; Inara's voice rang out. Simon looked up even as the struggles of the
man beneath his grasp faded. Inara had drawn a tiny gun from... somewhere, and
she held it up under the chin of the guard she'd marked. As for the remaining
man...

Mal leaned against the wall by the door, looking very much as though he needed
that support to stay upright. The pistol in his hand might not be completely
steady, but the expression on his face provided threat enough.

Nobody moved. Then, slowly, Simon hauled himself up from the floor, taking the
unconscious man's gun from its holster on the way, feeling the aches of his
bruises.

&quot;...Big damn heroes?&quot; he asked weakly, looking between the barely-upright
captain and the glitter of finery that was Inara.

&quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Mal. &quot;If you've got a minute, doctor, reckon you could find
a hole in your schedule for a spot of daring escape?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Simon said slowly. &quot;How did you...?&quot;

Mal took a half-dozen determined steps, and delivered a solid pinch that
knocked down the third security man, wavered, landed on hands and knees on top
of the unconscious man, and had to drag himself up again. A sound caught
Simon's attention and he turned to see Inara standing over a final limp form.
He couldn't guess at what she'd done, although he'd long been aware she was by
no means defenceless.

&quot;Prof came through for us,&quot; Mal supplied, head turning to the door and back,
the pistol in his hand adjusting to cover the entrance.

&quot;Where is - ?&quot; Simon faltered as he realised how acid a glare Inara was
directing toward Mal at the mere subject.

Mal rolled his eyes and looked defensive. His hands moved in the air in vague
protest. &quot;I knocked him out, okay? Seemed the thing to do, 'less you want him
tarred with the same brush as the rest of us in this here escapade. Least this
way, the man has a chance of slipping under Alliance radar for his little piece
of treachery in helping us out.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Simon frowned and glanced furtively at Inara.

She said, &quot;We could have used his *help*.&quot;

&quot;And I got no time for this discussion. We need to make tracks. Run now, gripe
later.&quot; He waved them ahead of him out the door with the gun.

Simon only got a dozen feet before he realised nobody was following after.
Inara had turned around in the doorway, and as he started back himself, he
heard her say, softly appalled, &quot;Mal, *no*.&quot;

&quot;No... what?&quot; Simon posed slowly, looking 'round the edge of the door. Saw only
Mal on his knees by the nearest of the guards. &quot;Captain?&quot;

He turned and pinned Inara with his stare, ignoring Simon completely. &quot;I'm not
letting you take the fall for this,&quot; Mal said. &quot;They've all seen you hold a gun
on them. You used your real name here, damn it!&quot; Simon couldn't remember the
last time he'd seen the captain so harsh and bleak. Maybe those early days,
when Kaylee lay dying, and he was living under threat of being tossed out the
airlock.

&quot;It's not worth it,&quot; Inara said, very softly. &quot;Please. It's not... maybe Hoyle
can cover for me...&quot;

&quot;Professor will have hard enough a time covering for himself, mess we're
leaving him with.&quot;

&quot;It'll be harder if there's murder involved. He may choose not to cover for any
of us at all. You're not killing these men for me, Mal.&quot; They held that stare.
Simon might have not been there at all. &quot;If you kill them, then I will leave.
And I won't be coming back.&quot;

&quot;All right.&quot; Mal pulled himself upright furiously, reeling on his feet when he
reached them, arms flailing in a manner almost drunken, though his expression
was anything but funny. &quot;Your choice.&quot; Simon's heart sank at that look on the
captain's face, like she'd just sealed her fate. Despite Mal's hostility, Inara
went to him and caught his arm and from there practically manhandled him out
the door under cover of providing support. Mal turned his glare onto Simon.
&quot;Hope you found something useful, doctor. Looks like it might prove
expensive.&quot;

&quot;I - &quot; Simon began, and stopped, realising it was not the time. &quot;I think we
should get out of here and back to the shuttle before this facility is set on
full alert, captain,&quot; he finished.

***

Badger barged up onto the bridge. &quot;What's going on?&quot;

Wash shot a peevish glance his way and answered, with very apparent reluctance,
&quot;Message from Inara. They've got trouble, need us to fly in and pick them up.
We didn't bother telling you on account of that you not being a member of this
crew issue. You recall that one?&quot;

Biting short a snarl, Badger glared out at the Black. Gorram monster of a
planet still filling most of the view, the angle of it and the patterns on its
bulk visibly altering as *Serenity's* position moved relative to it. He'd been
down in the cargo deck when he felt the changes of the ship's motion - 'felt'
in this case being something of an understatement, given she'd banked near hard
enough to topple him off one of the walkways.

&quot;What about the rest?&quot; If they were headed into trouble, he'd be happier not to
be in the company of a girl, a preacher and a clown.

&quot;No time. We'll come back around for them later. Might have to double back, if
we head out of here in a hurry. It's cool. We've done this before.&quot; Wash
glanced up; eyed him as though asking 'why are you still here?'

Badger stayed anyway, eyes ahead on the void they traversed. After a while the
pilot either forgot he was there or pretended to do so with an unusual degree
of conviction. A while after that, the preacher came back, and Wash looked up
and looked sharp. &quot;Any joy?&quot;

Book nodded. &quot;Alliance radio traffic is... energetic. I'm not sure I'd call it
'joyful'.&quot;

Wash returned the nod, the set of his face tightening to something like
grimness, and called up a bunch of readings on various screens and dials were
only so much gibberish far as Badger was concerned. Frowned at one in
particular, and tapped it so that Book leaned over and promptly took on a
similarly downbeat sort of demeanour. &quot;There they are.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Badger asked. &quot;What?&quot;

The two of them wasted a moment exchanging looks before Wash turned and opened
his mouth - then delivered a string of curses in Chinese as a series of jolts
rocked the ship. &quot;That!&quot; he snapped, clawing at the instrumentation.

Everyone was already grabbing onto something when a jolt turned into
practically a bounce and spin. Sparks fizzled in the control deck, and Badger
lost sight of what was happening with everything else as he fought to cling
onto a locker that was bolted to wall and floor and threatening to come away
from both, preventing himself being batted clear from wall to wall by the
convulsive motion.

When the ship righted itself again, Book had a handhold forward of the pilot's
console, arms locked like he wasn't figuring letting go for anything. It was
ironically Wash, only gorram one of them with a seat, who hadn't been so lucky.
Man was flat out under his console, softly moaning. Badger looked around
nervously. The view outside the ship caught his eye as something bright flared
past them and popped in an explosion that looked tiny in the mass of space.

Book barked a curse in Chinese that good lecturing Shepherds shouldn't ought to
use and sprang to the unconscious pilot's side, a force and energy in his
motion that belied his age. Once there, he proceeded in having no luck at all
reviving the man. A glance showed Wash had a gash on his head to go with his
fading Alliance-issue bruises. Badger snapped at the preacher, &quot;Can you fly
this gorram ship?&quot;

Even as Book shook his head, *Serenity* shuddered again as though in empathy.
&quot;The captain knows a little, but Wash is - &quot;

&quot;Ohhhh, we are so very, very dead,&quot; Badger assessed.

More shudders. He could see the shapes of their pursuers on one of the readout
screens. Book followed his gaze.

&quot;ZN33s,&quot; the preacher said. &quot;Older model scout ships. Hornets. They'd have to
hit us a whole lot, or else have some uncommonly lucky targeting, before they
could cripple a robust cargo hauler like *Serenity*.&quot;

&quot;Newsflash for you - given we got precisely nobody to fly this thing, I'm
thinking they're gonna get that opportunity, no trouble.&quot; A thought struck him
all a sudden and he swallowed. A last look at the unconscious pilot - &quot;Where's
River?&quot;

&quot;She was in the passenger quarters - &quot;

Badger didn't wait, careening out of the bridge and ricocheting off the walls
of the corridor beyond as he worked his way down the ship, through the kitchen
and along past the infirmary to the passenger dorms. &quot;River!&quot; he yelled, and
almost collapsed with relief when she stuck her head around a door and
beratingly accused him of being very loud.

He grabbed her hand. &quot;C'mon, girl. Need you up on the bridge.&quot;

She met his eyes a moment, and he had the distinct feeling she was ingesting
every bit of what he knew. She nodded once and let him pull her along with him,
back the whole length of the gorram long bloody ship.

Book looked bewildered as he pushed her in front of him onto the bridge and
pointed her at the controls. &quot;River can't fly the ship,&quot; he said. &quot;She's never
- &quot;

&quot;Yes, she can,&quot; Badger insisted, looking at the girl.

Who slowly raised her hand and with it flicked a button, the result of which
was that the ride smoothed out noticeably. Nodding, smiling to herself, her
hands running over the controls in a 'getting to know you' kind of caress,
River sank down onto the edge of Wash's empty chair.

&quot;I do apologise, Badger,&quot; the preacher said. &quot;It seems she can. How ever did
you - &quot;

Badger shook his head. He wasn't about to own up about the events with the
shuttle.

&quot;She wants silence to work,&quot; River said, flat but oddly melodic. Her hands were
a dance.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; Badger said. &quot;Get us out of here.&quot;

&quot;We're not leaving,&quot; Book said, and his calm didn't completely obscure an
impression of steely threat in that statement.

&quot;I've found the shuttle,&quot; River provided, still robotic. &quot;They're too close.
Can't run. Caught in the eye of the swarm...&quot; She did something to the controls
that had the effect of turning the ship sharply, manoeuvring it out of a hail
of fire that sparked away into the black, and bringing into their view the
distant speck of the shuttle, limned in the twice-reflected light from the gas
planet. &quot;Too close...&quot; The hornets surrounded the shuttle already, trying to
herd it back down to Riarden's surface. Someone on board was taking issue with
that plan. Of all the suicidal... &quot;Engine room not manned. Rules out all
category N manoeuvres,&quot; River stated, starting to do something, then stalling
and taking her hands elsewhere on the controls.

*Serenity* juddered under another salvo. Badger swore. &quot;We don't get out of
here now, we won't be able to run.&quot;

Book was giving him that significant, preacherly look again. &quot;I know you have
it in you to rise above such thoughts... Badger. To do the right thing.&quot;

&quot;Nine times out of ten, the right thing gets you nothing but dead,&quot; Badger told
him. He gripped the girl's shoulder. &quot;We need to be burning gas out of here,
love.&quot;

She barely looked at him, attention pinned on the battle and... something else.
More fire directed to the shuttle. River's hands rose to her head and she
screamed. &quot;No! Simon...!&quot; She clawed at herself, collapsing into a mass of
incoherent talk. On the screen, the shuttle listed, wobbling in its flight,
trailing sparks.

&quot;Another hit like that and they'll be crippled,&quot; Book said, helpless. &quot;Maybe
dead.&quot;

&quot;I'm thinking maybe they already are. In which case, no reason at all for us to
stay.&quot;

&quot;They're not dead yet,&quot; River said. &quot;Simon's not - &quot; Her hands reached for
buttons, stalled halfway, ruled out by an ever-more-desperate denial.
&quot;No...&quot;

Something in the way she'd said her brother's name tugged at Badger's insides
unpleasantly. The affection there, the need... and it occurred to him the girl
wouldn't have much in the way of chances for a life at all without that brother
of hers around - her doctor, her keeper, the schmuck to watch over her... And
the way she said they weren't dead yet... well, it seemed to him, given the
abilities she'd proved so far, that it was all too clear they were about to
be.

*Gorram it*. &quot;We're close,&quot; Badger said. &quot;Must be something we can do. Alls
they need is to get into position to dock...&quot; He was thinking furiously.

&quot;Can't - too many - &quot; River insisted. &quot;The controls are - they talk to me but
it's all too - too much, too new, and - death... fire and death and - &quot;

&quot;Shhh.&quot; Badger set his hand on her shoulder, held tight. Okay, so the girl
wasn't going anywhere without her brother, and they weren't going anywhere
without the girl. All they needed was to get the shuttle into position to
dock... or get *themselves* into it. He swallowed; took a breath. &quot;All right.
Move us. Put us between them all.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Book asked.

Badger ignored him, concentrated only on River. &quot;Bring us around. This ship can
do that, right? Firefly's a heap of junk with all kinds of manoeuvring power.
So stick us in the way and bring her round for them to dock with us. Cut off
that fire from the shuttle.&quot;

&quot;*Serenity's* taken a lot of hits,&quot; the preacher said, though it seemed more a
warning than a protest. &quot;And she's a lot bigger a target than a shuttle.&quot; His
gaze slid doubtfully down to River. &quot;It's also a very precision manoeuvre.&quot;

Badger didn't need to respond that she could do it - girl already was. Maybe
she'd picked the idea from his head 'fore he even said it, maybe she'd just
come to the same conclusions. Trail of fire making a sound like ripping all
along the ship's belly and the view reeled, even if the grav system made sure
they didn't. Shook like crazy with the impact of those shots, had Badger's
heart in his mouth, but somehow they all held together, and River calming
beneath his touch surely had to be a good sign.
