I am not sure which is better the Dutchman or Lazy jack Sail Flaking
Systems.
Other prefer to have  in the mast main fuller for cruising.
I am looking at this new boat and cannot make up my mind which system to
get.
I wonder if someone can offer some comments based on their own experience.

I have owned a Dutchman and Lazy Jack system. My Dad had  Roller Furling.

His system fouled once which given his age was a b_tch.

Dutchman and Lazy Jacks work great. For semi-single handing, either
makes life easier. However, both really require heading into the wind to
drop the sail. I believe there are a few Lazy Jack systems (e.g., EZ Jax
and Jiffy Jax, etc.).

I prefer my Dutchman for two reasons. First, nothing is more magical
than having one's sail automatically flake on the boom. Not only does
the sail stay up, it stores itself automatically after a brief training
period. Elegant and time saving, especially with a longer boat.

Second, my Lazy Jack system required going forward to unclip the lines
(if I did not clip them to the mast they rattled around or flapped
against the main). My Dutchman is always there, invisible and silent. I
do have to adjust the topping lift before and after raising and lowering
the main, but I rigged the line back to my cockpit and it takes seconds.

Neither system interferes with reefing (if anything, the Dutchman helps
keep the excess sail out of the way).

If I did not respond to a concern you have for these two systems, just
ask.

I agree with everything Harlan said... I have the Dutchman on my
boat... works great and the "training period" for the sail was very,
very short. I've used LJs a lot, and I like them fine. My experience
with them is that they tend to catch battens on the way up, which is
really annoying, especially when single-handing. I just want to do it
one time, not up/down, up/down. That's why I went with the
Dutchman. Neither, as Harlan said will interfere with reefing, but I
do like the Dutchman better here also... fewer lines in your face.

The downside to the Dutchman is two-fold... you have to modify your
main and you have to modify your sail cover. Thus, you can just slap
on a new main when it needs to get replaced if you want to continue to
use the Dutchman system.

Cap JG,

On my main sail cover, all they did was take my existing one, see where
the dutchman lines showed up on the boom and sew in zippers to allow the
lines to come out the top. IIRC, I have three on a J/100. What approach
did you take?

I forgot that I did have to go to add a loose foot to my footless main
but otherwise there were no mods and no one sailing her has seen any
performance or sailing issues.

You also point out one weakness of the furling main for those who like
battens (especially full ones for light air). Don't most furling mains
preclude battens?

The comments on lazy jacks and the Dutchman are excellent.

Re: furling mains
They do jam at the worst times.
I had one start to come out of the grove, which meant I could not unfurl the
whole sail.
Because battens cannnot be used, the roach is nil is negative.  On boats
with high roach mains, like Hunters, roller furling takes out a huge sail
area.

I was actually talking about getting hooked on the LJs while raising
the main (no furler), but I believe that's true about not having them
available for in-mast furlers. I supposed something could work for a
boom furler... no experience with battens and furling mains, however.

I also removed the dangling intermediate lines the last owner had on
the main. The Dutchman does a nice job of keeping things tidy.

I had the Dutchman system on my recently sold boat and have sailed on
boats with Lazy Jacks. My next boat will have Lazy Jacks without
question. I would not use an in mast or in boom furling system.
Although I have never used one, I have heard enough complaints about
the difficulty of reefing in nasty conditions that safety would
override conveniece. In mast reefing also means a big fat mast which
means more windage, less effective main sail (due to greater
disruption of air flow around the fat mast) and more weight aloft. All
bad things in my opinion.

I found the Dutchman and LJ systems were about the same in ease of use
and had about the same level of sensitivety to wind direction when
lowering (you need to head straight into the wind for both). The thing
I didn't like about the Dutchman, besdes the need for widgets in the
sail and additional seams/zippers in the sail cover, is that the lines
are constantly rubbing against the sail. I got some chafing of the
sail and also ended up with stains on the sails where the lines touch
the sail. Not sure of the cause (rain water running down the lines
concentrating the dirt??). This was after 2 years of moderate use.

The biggest reason I prefer lazy jacks is because I am lazy and I love
the lazy bags (there are various names for them but I am talking about
the sail cover that is attached to the lower ends of he lazy jack
lines and the boom).  You simply drop the sail into the cover and then
zip it up. No more removing, stowing and then replacing the sail cover
on a regular basis. I imagine one of these boom mounted sail covers
could be added to a dutchman rigged sail but you would then need
additional lines to hold up the sides of the sail cover.

It's interesting how different things are important to people... I don't
have a problem with lowering the sail with either system, but I've had
problems with battens catching on the Lazy Jacks just about every time I've
used them. I've also not seen the need to be dead into the wind to raise the
sail with the Dutchman... close seems to work fine. Same goes with dropping
the sail..

I'm not a big fan of furling mains either, but if I had to pick, I'd pick
the in-boom system. At least you can drop the sail if there's a problem with
the halyard. With the in-mast species, you're pretty much stuck.

We have the MackPack system but I've sailed straight jacks.

Like you, I used to get the battens caught occasionally.  However, on
Flying Pig, we just drop them, pull them forward, hoist, and then
position them loosely again to restore the reefing hook.

Loose lets them not get involved in sail shape, but allows reefing.
When it's time to drop entirely we just snug them up, drop the sail,
pull the zipper on its string, and we're covered up.

The stack pack is similar except that they have a batten in the top of
the cover to keep it up on the jacks; ours has grommets, and is kept
up by tension.

I really like the concept and prefer it to the dutchman type for all
the reasons previously cited...

Well, that's not a problem if you have more than one pair of hands. The
extra effort doesn't seem worth it for something that's supposed to just
deal with the sails. It's yet another thing to do to get the sails raised or

Essie has "semi full battens" in her mainsail. No, it doesn't help the
battens from catching on the lazyjacks -- it's meant to gain the benefits of
full battens, but without the need for battcars. The battens are long, but
don't extend all the way to the mast. I like them -- they help maintain good
sail shape, something that regular length battens can't do, only being there
to support the roach.

One of our club members bought a 36-foot sailboat equipped with a Dutchman
system last year.

His comment after one season is that he could use a downhaul to get the main
down.  The main does not come down as easy and flaking as advised.
It could be that the Dutchman system is not properly installed or fully
tuned up yet. Nonetheless, it gave me food for thought.

&gt;&gt; Does it help the battens from catching on the Lazy Jacks?

&gt; I would think it would help minimally, but most of my experience with
&gt; battens/LJs have been with battens that are not full.

As a follow up, I should say that LJs are definitely preferable to not
having anything. When I got my most recent boat, it had nothing, and going
from scratch had the local sail loft (Quantum) evaluate the main as
appropriately "young" for the Dutchman (it was), sell me the unit, modify
the main, and install it. They were very inexpensive and it sure was easier
than trying to rig it myself. I may have mentioned earlier, the training was
painless... a few times. I think a lot of credit has to go to the previous
owner who was very consistent with his sail flaking.

The last boat also had nothing, but was so small I made and put my own LJs
on her. They worked but did occasionally snag one of the particial battens.
It wasn't a big deal because I could usually just reach up and fix it. I
can't do that on my Sabre.

My LazyJacks like to snag if I'm being a LazyJill. As long as I go forward
and slack them off, then pull the leeward LJ forward with a bungee before
hoisting sail, all's Jake.

Some sailmakers prefer to make the two lowest battens only half the
lenght or nearer three quarters of sailwidth. It helps in reducing the
friction as the "wagons" on the end of the longest battens tend to be
pushed a bit to the side and thus have more friction.

To make it easier to hoist the sail between the lazyjacks you have to
hang the lazyjacks about one foot from the mast to the spreaders and
then point the boat straight into the wind when hoistin the sail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's interesting how different things are important to people... I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a problem with lowering the sail with either system, but I've had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems with battens catching on the Lazy Jacks just about every time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used them. I've also not seen the need to be dead into the wind to raise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sail with the Dutchman... close seems to work fine. Same goes with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dropping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the sail..

&gt;&gt;&gt; We have the MackPack system but I've sailed straight jacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like you, I used to get the battens caught occasionally.  However, on
&gt;&gt;&gt; Flying Pig, we just drop them, pull them forward, hoist, and then
&gt;&gt;&gt; position them loosely again to restore the reefing hook.

&gt;&gt; Well, that's not a problem if you have more than one pair of hands. The
&gt;&gt; extra effort doesn't seem worth it for something that's supposed to just
&gt;&gt; deal with the sails. It's yet another thing to do to get the sails raised
&gt;&gt; or lowered.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Loose lets them not get involved in sail shape, but allows reefing.
&gt;&gt;&gt; When it's time to drop entirely we just snug them up, drop the sail,
&gt;&gt;&gt; pull the zipper on its string, and we're covered up.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The stack pack is similar except that they have a batten in the top of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the cover to keep it up on the jacks; ours has grommets, and is kept
&gt;&gt;&gt; up by tension.

&gt;&gt; I've used the stack pack also... it's ok but then there's this bag that's
&gt;&gt; just sitting there, and if for some reason the sail doesn't go in
&gt;&gt; completely, it can be a hassle pushing it in.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I really like the concept and prefer it to the dutchman type for all
&gt;&gt;&gt; the reasons previously cited...

For the Dutchman to work properly you have to have the vertical parts
properly lined with the holes in the sail, the grommets big enough and
the rope smooth and the lenght of the chord you splice the vertical
parts must be such that when you ease the hallyard the weight of the

Many conditions. If not properly set up, the gravity is not enough to
pull the sail down.

I agree with that, I think they're a big help getting the main under
control.

On my old Cal-34 we rigged something that I called "poor man's lazy
jacks".  Basically they were just two pieces of 3/8ths shock cord run
along each side of the boom, each with a small loop tied in the middle
of the shock cord.  When I wanted to use the "lazy jacks" I'd bring a
halyard aft around the shrouds on each side of the boat, clip each
halyard to the loop in the shock cord, and then hoist the halyard up
about 15 ft forming a triangle with the shock cord on each side of the
boom.  It was very effective, cost next to nothing, and was out of the
way when you didn't need it.

&gt;My one experience with the system was on one of Martin's boats last winter.
&gt;It worked very much as advertised. Let out the halyard, and the sail neatly
&gt;flaked itself on top of the mast. No hassle--just put on the sail cover.

Of course, if it flakes itself on top of the mast, you'll be having
other problems. &lt;g&gt;

Sure thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;My one hesitation about the system is that it's said not to work as well

Actually, I don't think that's the case. The old sail will retain it's
memory, even when ragged. I think the biggest downside to the system
is that you have to modify the new main.

The "fishing line" used to channel the sail does get worn, and it
needs to be replaced every few years, but it's cheap and easy to
do. There is an issue of getting dirt marks on the sail from water
running down the line, but so far has been minimal for me.

Okay, gotcha. I've a couple of spare halyards foward of the mainmast --
spinnaker halyard (drifter, actually) and staysail halyard. I suppose they
could be used for that purpose, but they'd chafe with much use. And when I
need to douse or reef the main in a hurry, it's awfully nice to have the
LJ's there -- even if they're somewhat slack, without having to go forward
and rig them up.

But a couple of dedicated small halyards could be just the ticket, along
with your shock cord sollution. My boat is a tangle of lines for this, lines
for that, more lines for the other thing, with spares in case I might want
to do something else. But I sure do have a lot of options.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;One of our club members bought a 36-foot sailboat equipped with a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Dutchman
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;system last year.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;His comment after one season is that he could use a downhaul to get
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;main
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;down.  The main does not come down as easy and flaking as advised.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It could be that the Dutchman system is not properly installed or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;fully
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tuned up yet. Nonetheless, it gave me food for thought.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;For the Dutchman to work properly you have to have the vertical parts
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;properly lined with the holes in the sail, the grommets big enough and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the rope smooth and the lenght of the chord you splice the vertical
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;parts must be such that when you ease the hallyard the weight of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;boom will make everything reasonably tight, not too tight. Then you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;hope
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;that the gravity will not fail you. :-).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Many conditions. If not properly set up, the gravity is not enough to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;pull the sail down.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;- Lauri Tarkkonen

&gt;&gt; &gt;Lauri, you're right... since I'm up at the mast when I drop the sail,
&gt;&gt; &gt;I do occasionally have to give the luff a yank or two to get it
&gt;&gt; &gt;going. And, I do usually have to give a flake a reset shake to get it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;in the grove.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;FYI, the Charlie Morgan sockpuppet is a liar. I bought mine through
&gt;&gt; &gt;Quantum out here.

&gt;&gt; Jon is good friends with Conrad &quot;Bart&quot; Senior, who works for the
&gt;&gt; Dutchman.
&gt;&gt; They

&gt; Charlie,

&gt; I think you're way off base here. The major part of the cost for the
&gt; system
&gt; is not going to be the parts. It's going to be the sail maker's labor in
&gt; modifying your main, modifying your sail cover and installing the system.
&gt; Even a major break on the parts cost isn't going to make a big difference
&gt; in
&gt; the total cost.
">

I assume Chuckles is talking about me, since he's obsessed with me,
following my every word from newsgroup to newsgroup.

You're right. The labor was the major part of the cost... I decided that
since they were much more experienced with the Dutchman, it made sense to
get them to do it. The only additional expense besides what they charged me
was paying someone else to go up the mast. That was the cost of a lunch. I
modified the sail cover myself.

I know Bart quite well, and he did make the offer. I never said publically

gave me a comprehensive price and the parts and installation.

&gt; Absolutely. Even stopped in to talk to Martin Van Breen, the guy who
