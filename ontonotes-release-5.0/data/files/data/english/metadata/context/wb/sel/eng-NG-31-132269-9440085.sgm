1) Who is the creator?

(40:64) Allah, it is he Who has made for you the earth as a dwelling place
and the sky as a canopy. and has given you shape and made your shapes good
(looking) and has provided you with good things. That is Allah, your Lord:
so Blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that
exists).

(39:6) He created you (all) from a single person (Adam) ; then made from him
his wife {Hawwa , (Eve)}. and He has sent down for you of cattle eight pairs
(of the sheep , two , male and female ; of the goats , two , male and female
of the oxen , two , male and female and of the camels, two, male and
female). He creates you in the wombs of your mothers: creation after
creation in there veils of darkness. Such is Allah your Lord His is the
Kingdom. La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He).
How then are you turned away?

(7:54) Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in
six days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in manner that
suits His Majesty). He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it
rapidly , and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His
Command. Surely, His is the Creation and Commandment. Blessed is Allah, the
Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)! (10:32) Such is
Allah, your Lord in truth. So after the truth, what else can there be, save
error. How then are you turned away?

Â 2) Who is Allah?

(59:23-24)

23:He is Allah beside Whom La Ilaha Illa Huwa (none has the right to be
worshipped but He), the King, the Holy, the one Free from all defects, the
Giver of security, the Watcher over His creatures, the All- Mighty, the
Compeller, the Supreme. Glory, be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they
associate as partners with Him .

24:He is Allah, the creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of
forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the
earth glorify Him. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise .

(20:14)

â€œVerily! I am Allah! La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be
worshipped but I), So worship Me, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as- Salat)
for My Remembrance.

(2:255)

Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He),
Al-Hayyul-Qayyuum (the Ever Living the One Who sustains and protects all
that exists). Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can
intercede with Him except with His Permission?

Â He Knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will
happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass any thing of
His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens
and the earth and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And
He is the Most High, the Most Great. (This Verse 2:225 is called
Ayat-ul-Kursi) .

(35:13)

He merges the night into the day (i.e. the decrease in the hours of the
night is added to the hours of the day), and He merges the day into the
night (i.e. the decrease in the hours of the day is added the hours of the
night). And has subjected the sun and the moon: each runs its course for a
term appointed. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the Kingdom , And those,
whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the thin
membrane over the date-stone).

(3:18)

Allah bears winess that La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be
worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give
this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in justice La ilaha illa
Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All- Mighty, the
All-Wise.

(3:51)

Truly! Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him (Alone). This is the
straight Path.

3) Did you think that Allah created you only for play and without any
purpose?

(3:115)

â€œDid you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and
that you would not be brought back to Us?â€�

4) For what did Allah create mankind?

(51:56)

And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should
worship Me (Alone).

5) What did Allah command us to do?

Â (4:58)

Verily! Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those to
whom they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with
justice. Verily, how excellent is the teaching with He (Allah) gives you!
Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer.

(6:151)

Say (O Muhammad (PBUH)):â€œCome, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited
you from: be Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to
your parents; Kill not your children because of poverty â€&quot; We provide
sustenance for you and for them; come not near to Al-Fawahish (shameful
sins, illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly; and
kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according
to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand.

6) From where shall we seek guidance?

(1:1 â€&quot; 6)

1: In the Name of Allah, the Most. Gracious, the Most Merciful.

2: All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alamin (mankind,
jinn and all that exists).

3: The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful .

4: The Only Owner (and the only Ruling judge) of the Day of Recompense
(i.ethe Day of Resurrection)

5: You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and
everything).

6: Guide us to the Straight Way.

7) Who shall we invoke in time of disaster?

(29:65)

And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allah, making their Faith pure
for Him Only: but when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a
share of their worship to others .

(10:12)

And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or
standing. But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he
had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him! Thus it is made
fair-seeming to the Musrifun that which they used to do.

8) What happened to the previous nations when they disobeyed Allah?

(29:40)

So We punished each (of them) for his sins; of them were some on whom We
sent Hasib (a violent wind with shower of stones) (as on the people of Lut
(Lot) , and of them were some who were overtaken by As-saihah (torment â€&quot;
awful cry. (as Thamud or Shuabs people), and of them were some whem We
caused the earth to swallow (as Qarun (Korah), and of them were some whom We
drowned (as the people of Nuh (Noah), or Firaun (Pharaoh) and his people).
It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.

9) Does Allah guard and save the Quran from corruption?

(15:9)

Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and
surely, We will guard it (from corruption).

10) Who should we worship?

(20:14)

â€œVerily! I am Allah La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped
but I), so worship Me, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-assalat) for My
Remembrance.

11) What is the religion of Allah?

(3:19)

Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam. Those who were given the Scripture
(Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after
knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat (proofs,
evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, then surely, Allah is
Swift in calling to account.

12) What is the religion accepted by Allah?

(3:85)

And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of
him and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.

13) Where does the Quran come from?

(42:3)

Likewise Allah, the All-Mighty the All-Wise sends Revelation to you (O
Muhammad (PBUH) ) as (He sent Revelation to) those before you.

(6:114)

(Say (O Muhammad (PBUH)) â€œShall I seek a judge other than Allah while it
is He Who has sent down unto you the book (the Quran), explained in
detail.â€� Those unto whom We gave the Scripture (the Taurat (Torah) and the
Injeel (Gospel) know that it is revealed from your Lord in truth. So be not
you of those who doubt.

14) Why did Allah send messengers?

(4:64)

We sent no Messenger, but to be obeyed by Allahâ€™s Leave.

15) Do we have to believe in all the messengers?

(2:285)

The Messenger (Muhammad (PBUH) _) believes in what has been sent down to him
from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His
angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), â€œWe make no distinction
between one another of His Messengersâ€� â€&quot; and they say, â€œWe hear and we
obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of
all).â€�

16) What happened to the previous scriptures?

(4:46)

Among those who are jews, there are some who displace words from (their)
right places and say: â€œWe hear your word (O Muhammad (PBUH)) and
disobey,â€� and â€œHear and let you (O Muhammad (PBUH) _) â€œhear nothing.â€�
And Raina with a twist of there tongues and as a mockery of the religion
(Islam) And if only they had said: â€œWe hear and obeyâ€�, And â€œDo make us
understand,â€� it would have been better for them, and more proper; but
Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few.

(5:13)

So because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them and made their
hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have
abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. And you will not
cease to discover deceit in them, except a few of them. But forgive them and
overlook (their misdeeds).

Verily, Allah loves Al-Muhsinun (good-doers).

17) Who is the last messenger?

(3:144)

Muhammad (PBUH) is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers
have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn
back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels,
not the least harm will he do to Allah; and Allah will give reward to those
who are grateful.

18) To whom did Allah send the last messenger Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?

(34:28)

And We have not sent you (O Muhammad (PBUH)) except as a giver of glad
tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not.

19) What did Allah prepare for those among the Jews and Christians who
believe?

(57:28)

O you who believe (in Musa (moses) (i.e. Jews) and Isa (Jesus) (i.e.
Christians)! Fear Allah, and believe in His Messenger (Muhammad (PBUH) _),
He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light
by which you shall walk (straight). And He will forgive you. And Allah is
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

20) What is the likeness of lsa (Jesus) before Allah?

(3:59)

Verily, the likeness of Isa (Jesus) bofore Allah is the likeness of Adam. He
created him from dust, then (He) said to him: â€œBeâ€� â€&quot; and he was.

21) What did Allah say about Mary?

(3:42 â€&quot; 47)

42:And (remember) when the angels said: â€œ(O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allah
has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you
above the women of the Alamin (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime).â€�

43:O Mary! â€œSubmit yourself with obedience to your Lord (Allah), by
worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and Irkai (bow down)
along with ArRakiun (those who bow down).â€�

44:This is apart of the news of the Ghaib (unseen, i.e. the news of the past
national of which you have no knowledge) which We reveal to you (O Muhammad
(PBUH) ) You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to
which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam (Mary); nor were you
with them when they disputed.

45:(Remember) when the angels said: â€œO Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allah gives
you the glad tidings of a Word (â€œBeâ€�- and he was! I.e. Isa (Jesus) the
son of Maryam (Mary), from Him, his name will be the Messiah Isa (Jesus),
the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter,
and will be one of those who are near to Allah.â€�

46:â€œHe will speak to the people in the cradle and in manhood and he one of
the righteous.â€�

47:She said: â€œO my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched
me.â€� He said: â€œSo (it will be) for Allah creates what He wills.

When He has decreed something, He says to it only: â€œBe!â€� â€&quot; and it is.

22) Was Jesus crucified and died on the cross?

(4:157â€&quot;158)

157:And because of their saying (in boast), â€œWe killed Messiah Isa
(Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allah,â€� â€&quot; But they
killed him not, nor crucified him, but they resemblance of Isa (Jesus) was
put over another man (and they Killed that man), and those who differ
therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow
nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not (i.e. Isa (Jesus),
son of Maryam (Mary) (PBUT)).

158:But Allah raised him (Isa (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto
Himself (and he (PBUH) is in the heavens). And Allah is Ever All- Powerful
All-Wise.

23) Was Jesus the son of God ( Allah )?

(112:1 â€&quot; 4):

1:Say (O Muhammad (PBUH)): â€œHe is Allah, (the) One.

2:(Allah the self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither
eats nor drinks).

3:He begets not, nor was He begotten.

4:And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.

24) How could you be secure?

(6:82)

It is those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah and worship none but Him
Alone) and confuse not their belief with Zulm (wrong i.e. by worshipping
others beside Allah), for them (only) there is security and they are the
guided.

25) What is the life of this world?

(57:20)

Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual
boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children. (It is)
as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the growth is pleasing to
the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it
becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment (for the
disbelievers â€&quot; evil-doers), and (there is) Forgiveness from Allah and
(His) Good Pleasure (for the believers â€&quot; good-doers). And the life of this
world is only a deceiving enjoyment.

26) Whatever of blessings and good things you have , is it from Allah?

(16:53)

And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from Allah.

Then, when harm touches you, unto Him you cry aloud for help.

27) How could you guarantee the blessings of Allah?

(14:7)

And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: â€œIf give thanks (by accepting
Faith and worshipping none but Allah), I will give you more (of My
Blessings); but if you are thankless (i.e. disbelievers), verily My
punishment is indeed sever.â€�

28) How could you save yourself from a painful torment?

(61:10 â€&quot; 11)

10:O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a
painful torment?

11:That you believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (PBUH) _ ).

29) Whosoever puts his trust in Allah , what will happen to him?

(65:3)

And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever
puts his trust in Allah then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will
accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.

30) What is the destination of the disbelievers?

(57:15)

So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you (hypocrites), nor of those who
disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allah â€&quot; Islamic Monotheism).

Your abode is the Fire. That is your maula (friend â€&quot; proper place), and
worst indeed is that destination.

31) What is the destination of the believers?

(4:57)

But those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah â€&quot; Islamic Monotheism) and
do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens under which rivers
flow (Paradise), abiding therein forever. Therein they shall have Azwajun
Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives), and We shall admit them to shades
wide and ever deepening (Paradise).

32) How could you be happy?

(16:97)

Whoever works righteousness- whether male or female â€&quot; While he (or she) is
a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good
life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We
shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they
used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).
