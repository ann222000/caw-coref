Part 4

&quot;Ow,&quot; he said pointedly, and pulled her back for a more comprehensive effort.

&quot;Wash.&quot; Mal's voice parted them again, and Inara spun, her chest feeling tight
at the affirmation he was still alive. &quot;Need you up on the bridge getting us
all far away from this rock. Time for kissing later. Take us up out of the
world.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; He rolled his eyes, then caught Zoe's. The contact stretched like
elastic between them as he headed up the steps away from her.

&quot;We ain't clear yet,&quot; Mal said, to nobody and everybody, as Wash disappeared.
&quot;Not by a long way.&quot; He was hanging heavily off Jayne's arm, worrying traces of
dried blood on his face. &quot;The door, Jayne.&quot;

Jayne dutifully peeled the captain off his shoulder and sort of draped him
against the wall while he went to do as ordered. Mal clutched at the wall a
little frantically for a moment before seeming to steady, by which time Inara
was already at his side with a supporting arm to offer. &quot;What happened to
you?&quot;

&quot;Some kind of new Alliance toy. Balance is still a bit - &quot; He almost toppled
over, trying to turn to address her, and she ended up staggering with most of
his weight. She wrapped her arms around his chest and tried to right him again.
&quot;Like I said.&quot; He was half laughing, albeit a wheezing laugh. &quot;I'm all right.&quot;
His arm crept around her waist, strictly of necessity, the other rising to
seize the fingers that reached for his face. She couldn't help but notice the
tremor in his limbs.

She rolled her eyes. &quot;Sometimes I think you do this on purpose,&quot; she said, and
with some difficulty because Mal was *heavy*, as she already knew from a
certain swordfight. &quot;So... what happened to your promise you wouldn't be doing
this, this trip?&quot;

He tried to shrug and it proved ill-advised. &quot;It was out of my hands, and...
you can't be blaming me for this one?&quot;

Jayne slammed the doors shut behind them and buzzed up to Wash that they were
all locked up and ready to scoot, sooner the better. He almost hadn't even cut
communication before *Serenity* gave that familiar shudder that meant her
engine had started up. Then Inara had to fight to keep herself and her wayward
captain upright against the sensation of take-off in addition to all the
rest.

&quot;I'll consider special dispensation this one time,&quot; she said. &quot;But someone will
have to do me the kindness of telling me exactly what's been going on
first.&quot;

&quot;If you can be getting me up to the kitchen and a decently fierce mug of
coffee,&quot; Mal said, with tired good nature, &quot;I might even have to start thinking
about proposing.&quot;

Inara winced, and avoided looking him in the eye as she helped him on his way.

***

&quot;Never goes smooth,&quot; Mal said to himself. He slumped at the kitchen table, a
hand-held cortex link and an empty mug in front of him. Seeing how the
sensation of vertigo wasn't showing signs of going away any time soon, he had
both elbows planted firm on the table top out of a general distrust of his own
balance - and the world at large, that seemed dead set against the idea of
staying still. He had a headache and a worsening temper not helped by his
vision keeping blurring.

A tentative touch on his arm drew his attention from scouring the cortex.

&quot;Anything?&quot; Kaylee asked.

&quot;Only Simon and River's old warrants.&quot;

She tapped his arm again as he bowed his head back down. &quot;Could take hours,&quot;
she offered. &quot;Days, maybe. You know that. Won't do any good you keepin' starin'
away at that thing, cap'n.&quot;

He pushed it away and sighed; broke Kaylee's grip only to wrap her fingers
around his with slow, deliberate motions that didn't upset his head, and held
her hand over the table. &quot;I know... you feeling any better yet, *mei mei*?&quot;

&quot;A bit. How 'bout you?&quot; She seemed faintly embarrassed to be asked.

&quot;Just tired and dizzy is all. The no-sleep issue probably not helping matters.&quot;
He squeezed her hand. &quot;I'm sorry, Kaylee. Wouldn't have done it if we hadn't
sore needed you up and about.&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; she told him a little woozily. &quot;I'm just... I feel so bad I got drunk
like that. Nothing like bein' real useless when you all need - &quot;

Her bitterness surprised him, and he cut her off quick. &quot;You weren't useless,
girl. Where would we have been without you and your planning? River and Wash
would still be in there and us all with a ticket to an Alliance jail. I reckon
you and Simon might just be a right match after all, criminal masterminds
both.&quot; He squeezed her fingers again and smiled.

&quot;Thanks, cap'n.&quot; She relaxed forward, smiling, setting her head to the table
and splaying her hair over their joined hands, and rolled her head slowly to
the side to look up at him. &quot;That's real sweet of you.&quot;

&quot;Nothing but the truth. 'Sides which,&quot; he added, &quot;not one of us was expectin'
our night of living the finer life would end in gorram firefights and close as
damn it all-out warfare... though, thinking on it, I have no idea why. Runs
smooth as clockwork, this tweaked luck of mine.&quot;

Kaylee laughed softly. Her fingers moved lazily over his. Her hair tickled as
she moved. &quot;Your hands're shakin',&quot; she murmured.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; He returned his attention to the cortex link, brushing strands of
Kaylee's hair out of the way. After a few minutes, he felt her grip relax, and
heard the rhythm of her breathing change.

It wasn't much later when he heard footsteps and looked up to see Inara
standing in the doorway. Her eyes fell on Kaylee and her smile softened. &quot;The
snoring wounded. I wondered what you'd be up to.&quot;

&quot;Being 'up to' anything mostly involves falling right down again at the
moment.&quot; Mal smiled back, then as he saw her expression change added, &quot;It's
improved some, don't worry. Reckon I'll be fine after I get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;Which you probably should be doing,&quot; Inara remarked.

He pushed the cortex link away again, this time with purpose, switching it off.
&quot;Still not sure I'm up to standing and carrying Kaylee to her quarters,
though,&quot; he continued. &quot;I don't suppose you could - &quot;

&quot;When I mention 'Companion training', that didn't generally include weights,&quot;
Inara prodded gently.

&quot; - see if you can't rustle up Jayne,&quot; Mal finished.

She laughed, and her hand trailed over his shoulder in a vague pat that was in
danger of being something else as she drifted past and left the kitchen again,
a soft, &quot;I'll have a look,&quot; floating in her wake.

He leaned back in the chair - but resumed his former position post-haste
because despite what he'd told Inara, the world still felt none too secure. As
days went, he reflected, he'd had better. Couldn't even say they were still
free and flying - everyone might have gotten away intact, but that, it could be
a while before they knew with any certainty.

Zoe had taken Wash off to their quarters soon as they broke atmo and he'd set
course. Simon and River had disappeared somewhere soon as they'd come on board,
and about that, he should probably worry - 'specially as he wasn't too sure
where Jayne had gotten himself to either; he could faintly hear Inara calling
his name.

It was Book she returned with, though, a short time later. The preacher
gathered Kaylee up with some effort, albeit respectably little for his age. He
shot a tight smile back at Mal, a look that lingered an odd length of time for
a man who wasn't any spring chicken hauling a girl who wasn't any lightweight,
and then made his way with difficulty - not up toward the crew quarters with
their troublesome ladders, but down the ship to the guest rooms.

&quot;I better go with them and get her settled down,&quot; Inara said, and followed.
After a while, he heard their voices faintly in discussion, too faint for him
to make the words out. But he had a notion from something in Inara's tone that
they were talking about him. Shortly after, the voices died and slow, measured
footsteps returned to the kitchen. Book entered, walked to the chair at the
foot of the table, and seated himself directly opposite Mal.

&quot;Something wrong, preacher?&quot; he asked after a moment. &quot;There some reason you're
sat there studying me like I should be in a sideshow?&quot;

Book folded his arms on the table before him, interlacing his fingers. &quot;I'm
just wondering if you shouldn't see the doctor. Have him check you out. It
hasn't escaped my notice you still seem to be having some trouble.&quot;

&quot;It's a bit of dizziness. It'll wear off. Already has been.&quot; Mal sighed. Last
thing he was feeling like was subjecting himself to Simon's concerned testing
and prodding. &quot;...But you're right, preacher. Weapon none of us recognise and
all, it's probably for the best.&quot; He grimaced as he moved in his seat and the
world reeled, again, and he looked up archly at Book. &quot;Mighty good of you
volunteerin' to lend a hand.&quot;

***

Through the open door of her room, River could be seen sitting cross-legged on
the bed. Her back was very straight, and she turned Badger's hat carefully
between her hands. There was something dark lying across the bedclothes in
front of her.

Mal had gone past, leaning heavily on the preacher, before the picture in its
entirety quite registered. He faltered, and he and Book backpedalled to stand
and stare in through the open door.

&quot;I'm not seeing this,&quot; Mal said. &quot;Tell me, shepherd - you reckon hallucinations
would be a symptom of this thing I got zapped with?&quot;

&quot;If they are,&quot; Book said slowly. &quot;I think I must have gotten a dose of it, too.&quot;

River was sitting on the bed with Badger - fully clothed and thoroughly
unconscious, thank God - sprawled on top of the sheets.

&quot;River,&quot; Mal said firmly, catching her attention. The hat stopped turning. Dark
eyes silently ate into him. &quot;You care to explain how come Badger's in your bed
and on my ship?&quot;

Simon and Jayne, a little way further along the corridor, broke off an argument
when they heard the sharp question, finally noticing he was standing there, and
what he was standing seeing. He turned from River's uncooperative silence to
them, and Book struggled a moment to keep him upright as balance took a
holiday. &quot;Why do we have Badger?&quot; he persevered. &quot;Jayne? You feel like shedding
some light on this?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Jayne started, then broke off to get in Simon's face and hiss, &quot;Told
you.&quot; He looked back at Mal, flustered. &quot;Weren't me, Mal. Hell, I'd be glad to
see the back of the little cuss. Moonbeam bagged him all her own self, I swear.
Got this one to help her drag him aboard.&quot; He jerked his thumb toward Simon,
then leered with ugly mirth, like he just really couldn't help himself. &quot;Reckon
she's plannin' to keep him like some sort of pet. Took a right shine to him,
seems.&quot;

&quot;My sister has not - &quot; Simon began angrily, rising to defend River's honour.

Mal halted him with a raised hand. &quot;While I get the point, even considerin' the
delivery, that bein' a mind-reading genius with a couple of loose screws in the
brain pan don't make her dead below the waist... *Badger*?&quot; He cast the two a
pained look. &quot;Girl, are you off your nut? Well, I mean...&quot; He floundered.

River rolled her eyes and lifted them, and started to count the stains or the
ceiling or some such, but chose to shed no more light on the subject.

&quot;Either way,&quot; Mal said, collecting his thoughts with some difficulty. &quot;That is
not the issue. The issue would be that Badger there is unlikely to be too happy
when he eventually wakes up. The issue would also be that I do not go 'round
abducting folk I need to do business with - or at all - &quot;

&quot;He knows she's worth money,&quot; Simon pointed out nervously.

Mal stopped. He opened his mouth, and then paused, realising he really didn't
have the energy or patience left for this, not to mention that it might well
have actually been the best option in the circumstances. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said,
swallowing the protest. &quot;Just keep him out of my way and keep him out of
trouble when he wakes up, all right? And her, too. I got too many other things
on my mind to be dealing with right now.&quot;

He took a breath. &quot;Simon. You've doctorin' to do. Preacher's got some concerns
'bout this Alliance thing I got zapped with.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Yes, I'm... I'm very sorry, captain. I should have - &quot;

&quot;You had to deal with your sister's yen to add kidnapping to her genius
portfolio. I understand... Jayne?&quot;

&quot;What, Mal?&quot; The merc still looked guilty. But then he usually was, of
something.

Mal pointed. &quot;Chaperone them. Doctor's got work to do.&quot; He killed Simon's
protest with a glower.

Jayne's face fell, and he looked blankly through the doorway at River, who gave
him one of those sickly sweet smiles that usually spelled trouble for the
recipient.

&quot;Aww... gorram it, Mal! I tol' you, I ain't done nothing!&quot;
