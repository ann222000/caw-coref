DAY TWENTY Dear Diary: This morning the Didi-Sprite announced:
~~~~~~~~~~ &quot;Well, Dusty, Summer is just about at an end. And,
you know what else? This has been the very last Summer of the
20th Century.&quot; 'So what?!' I mew. 'Where's my brekky? That's
all I want to know.'

Maybe I should have paid more attention to her sprite'ship. That's
Squeaky's opinion, anyway: &quot;When humanoids start thinking 'the
last of ... ' ... head for the hills.&quot; he said. I did have the
sense to ask 'Why?' but his answer wasn't in the least bit informative.
&quot;Don't know. It just seems that 'the last' of something sparks a
lot of activity.&quot; He wasn't wrong about that.

Oh. I did get my brekky eventually. It was something new. Didi
called it &quot;Oatmeal with a dollop of cream.&quot; I call it grey glop.
But it was surprisingly good. &quot;Our friend, Nick Chopper, The Tinman,
recommends it highly; his cat called 'Sprite' loves it. So, I thought
you might, too.&quot; she smiles affectionately at me.

'As long as it isn't the *last* of my brekkies.'

It has become our habit, Didi's and mine, to adjourn to the 'Office'
after breakfast. I sit on the window seat and wash up whilst Didi
leafs through a book or two and then sits down at her keyboard and
stares at her blue screen. We both feel rather virtuous about this
routine. Once I have completed my 'toilet' I find a nice comfy spot
for forty winks. Usually curled up in a corner of the sofa.

&quot;Dusty?&quot; queries my companion, &quot;We should mark this last Summer in
some way. Do you have any ideas?&quot;

'Sure, I'll just drift off and have a dream or two about it.' I snuggle
more securely into my corner.

&quot;I know! A scrapbook! We'll put together a scrapbook of memories
and things which reek of the 20th Century.&quot; Didi goes to some shelves
and begins taking down books. &quot;Hmmmmmm ... which one ... which one.&quot;
She brings an armload over to the sofa, dumps the pile down next to
me: &quot;Yeowch!&quot; That one got my tail! Then she plunks herself down at
the other end. &quot;I wonder how come most of my favorite books were
published in the first half of this century or in the last century!
&quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; by Thomas Hardy. That's a very oldie
but goodie and not of this century! &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; by
L.M. Montgomery: This century ... but in the first half. Hmmmmm ...&quot;
Didi leafs through tome after tome. &quot;Oh! We need photos! I know
... we'll include some of your 'First Days' pics.&quot; And, up she
hops again. This time she returns with a cardboard box full of
snapshots. &quot;Oh, look, Dusty! There you are! Peeking out at me
from under the blanket in your basket! Oh ... aren't you adorable!&quot;

Well, by this time, I have faced the fact that my morning nap just
isn't going to happen, so I up stakes and head off towards the
Sitting Room in a huff ... some days are like that, I guess.
