The roads here got dry enough yesterday to take the 'Vette out of the
garage.  I hadn't driven it in about 2 months.  It started right up, but as
I let the clutch out, it didn't want to move.  I thought the emergency brake
might have been set, but I engaged it and disengaged it, and still the car
didn't want to go forward.  I goosed the accelerator just a little bit more,
heard a pop (I believe from the rear) and away we went.  I drove it awhile
and once the car warmed up a little the transmission shifted smoothly, and I
had no further problem.  I took the car home and let it sit overnight in our
semi-heated garage, and there were no fluids underneath this morning.  The
problem did not recur today.

Any ideas about what was locked up?  Is this routine for cars that sit for a
couple months?  Last winter, my first as the owner, we never had such
consistently crappy weather, and I took the car out for a run at least every
other weekend.

Stuck brake pads on the rotors.  A little punch on the gas and it works
fine.

Hey Cards, probably just the pads &amp; rotors.
Especially if it was fine after the drive.

Thanks to John ("We only want to use the room for a couple of hours...")
Smith, and Ric.  That must have been it.

John - sorry if that is your real name.  ;-)

How cold was it?  Possible tires were frozen to the ground.

I am guessing that the e-brake was stuck and/or the brake pads
froze/rusted to the rotors (or drums, depending on what year we're
talking about)
