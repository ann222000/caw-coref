'They said I'd taken one lakh per goal . . . people used to introduce
me as Mr Negi of those seven goals'

Mir Ranjan Negi, Former Hockey Goalkeeper, India

Posted online: Monday, September 17, 2007 at 0000 hrs IST

. My guest this week is the original Kabir Khan (of Chak De India), Mir
Ranjan Negi, who didn't quite fail to score the goal, but paid the price
for consuming too many. But right now he is enjoying the fact that India
scored just that many goals --- seven --- in the recent Asian
Championships final against South Korea.

It's something like that now.

. So the joy is back. After 25 long years. Take us back to 1982. What
happened? I know everybody talks about the film Chak De India. Take us
back to that day at the Asiad finals, when you were the goalkeeper. You
were facing one of Pakistan's finest-ever forward lines. In fact one of
the finest-ever forward lines anywhere. Hassan Sardar, Kalimullah . . .
they were the best.

It was the first time colour TV arrived. There was multi-camera shooting
of the match. When the match started, there was a lot of pressure. The
then prime minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi was there, Rajiv Gandhi, the then
president Giani Zail Singh, all the dignitaries. Buta Singh used to
visit the Games village every day, tell us so many things . . . that Mrs
Gandhi was looking forward to a hockey victory.

. The other seven gold medals we won did not matter.

Slowly, the pressure built up. People used to come to us with prasad
every day. There was a lot of pressure from all sides. To make matters
worse, even the coaches would tell us, 'You have to die for your
country.' My roommate was Mohammad Shahid. He couldn't sleep for two
days because of the pressure.

. And Mohammad Shahid was one of the finest forwards ever.

We scored the first goal. It was a penalty stroke by Zafar Iqbal. And
then the whole team collapsed. One after another seven goals were
scored. Overnight everything was lost.

. Zafar Iqbal actually figures in Chak De India. People only saw the
image of you at the goalpost, helpless as seven goals were scored.

After the game, when I saw the footage, I saw the camera going from one
direction to the other and maybe there was some editing problem but it
showed me in very bad light . . . as if I had left the goalpost and run
away.

. The impression was that you were charging too early.

No, they didn't show me at the goalpost at all. People thought maybe I
got scared and left my post. The next day there was talk that I had
taken money from Pakistan, that I'd been seen going to the Pakistan High
Commission, that somebody saw me coming down the steps of the Pakistan
High Commission. So many things were said about me. A Hindi poet wrote a
satire about me, there were cartoons about me.

. (Pointing to a newspaper clipping in Negi's file) What does this say?

It says 'Bharatiya hockey bik gaya. (Indian hockey has sold out).'

. Suggesting that you had sold out.

The Hindi poet Om Prakash Aaditya wrote this poem about me. (Points to a
caricature with the poem, showing a bald Negi) At that time I wasn't bald.

. It says, 'Dharti gol, ambar gol, suraj chand sitare gol, goal hua toh
hua, main bhi gol' It goes on to suggest that you had compromised.

I was a victim of this sort of yellow journalism. I felt as if someone
very close to me in my family had died. There was absolute silence. I
think for two days we did not have any food. We were very scared to come
out of the National Stadium.

. You did face shouts of, 'Gaddar!'

Yes, yes. Everywhere I went. I faced whatever is shown happening to
Kabir Khan (in the film).

. You faced more in life.

It was more horrifying than what is shown in the film.

. Give us some examples of what happened.

Two days we did not have food. Then we went to a restaurant near Pandara
Road. I was accompanied by some team-mates. Suddenly we were gheraoed by
some 50 people who were having a party. They shouted at us, shouted
slogans and literally chased us away from the place. We had to forgo our
food and go back. My uncle booked a first class ticket for me so that I
wouldn't be troubled. But after I got in, within no time there were
50-100 people outside the compartment shouting slogans. I came to my
house in Indore and found all the window panes broken.

. What were they saying?

Maro, paisa khaya hai. Things like that.

. But the theory was: 'Paisa khaya.'

Yes, that I'd been bribed.

. I think there was a price fixed --- one lakh per goal or something?

Yes, one lakh rupees for each goal. Not actually true, but they said
things like that. And the media added a lot of fuel to the fire. They
said a CBI inquiry was on against me. Even when I was talking to friends
in the customs department, where I worked, they would say I was being
chased everywhere by the CBI. They would say, 'Hamarey upar bhi aa
jayega (We will be targeted too).' My life became hell. I even thought
of committing suicide. Then my family decided to get me married in 1983.
But people's anger hadn't diminished. They put out the lights at my
marriage reception. Someone took out the main fuse, they removed the
main switch. And it was friends with scooters and motorcycles who
provided light for the ceremony by turning on the headlights. And this
is a fact. It can be confirmed.

. One year after the Asiad final.

Wherever I went, people would knowingly or unknowingly introduce me as,
'Mr Negi, man of seven goals.' That was a blot on my life and mind. It
was very sad.

. Frankly, on Astroturf seven goals can be scored once the defence
cracks up, because it is such a fast surface. After that particular
game, we've scored seven now, we have conceded six or seven goals many
times against Australia, Germany, Spain.

Actually, India was playing Pakistan on home soil in Delhi and people
had paid up to Rs 1,000 for a hundred-rupee ticket. I don't blame the
people.

. How did your association treat you?

The players were always with me; they knew I was not at fault. About the
officials, I don't want to say anything.

. You became the fall guy who could be blamed for everything. Frankly, a
goalkeeper comes into play only after the defence has failed. For all
those seven goals, somebody got past our entire defence. Our defence
crumbled that day.

There was some problem in the defence. In the morning they announced one
team, and in the afternoon a different team played. A very good friend,
Rajinder Singh, was a full-back. Unfortunately, he had a very bad knee
that day and couldn't play well. There were a lot of problems. But the
whole team played badly. Just eight days later, however, we went and
beat Pakistan.

. So you could have done better if you'd all been relaxed rather than
charged up like that.

Of course.

. I see that you don't hold very much against your defenders who let you
down that day. Rajinder Singh figures in Chak De India.

No. Rajinder is a very good friend of mine. It happens. It's not his
mistake. It's the mistake of the team management. They played him
despite his injury. Everybody knew it. How could they have overlooked
such a big mistake.

. He has a cameo in Chak Dey India, isn't it?

Yes, he's clapping when his team wins against the women's hockey team.

. He's the coach of the Indian men's team that beats the women's team.

He's a very nice man. He was top scorer in the World Cup held in Mumbai.
He's a great full-back. But such things have happened in the past.

. He's also a penalty corner specialist. Many squad mates, many
full-backs are in the film, isn't it?

I included them because I wanted people to be able to identify our great
players.

. Zafar Iqbal is there.

Zafar Iqbal is there. M.K. Kaushik is there as Pakistani coach. We have
these players who play for ONGC. They are all real hockey players.

. Zafar Iqbal was your captain, who scored the first goal in that Asiad
final against Pakistan.

Yes. In the film he's the manager of my team.

. Many thought he made a mistake by scoring the first goal and provoking
the Pakistanis. Tell us briefly about each of the goals.

I remember one in which the ball was scooped from the left and was
bouncing in front of me and Hassan Sardar took it over my head. Somehow,
the umpire allowed it. Now, I could have hit him on the face without
making it too obvious.

. You could have pretended it was an accident?

He'd have gone out. And my life would have been very different. But then
there's this thing called sportsmanship. Even today I keep thinking
whether I should have hit him or not.

. The game was more physical then.

Yes. I could have hit him easily and his going out would have helped the
team in a big way. We could have won the match. I still think whether I
should have given it to him.

. Reset his face a bit. Describe the goal that bothers you the most.

In most of the goals, the Pakistani forwards used to come easily towards
the goal. I was alone and had no option but to charge. And I was good at
charging. But on that day, because of the pressure, I wasn't moving
properly. I wasn't able to do things that I could have done easily.
Usually, what I do is leave one post open for the forward (to try to
score) and at the last moment I block it.

. He thinks it's empty and he'll go for it but you know you'll cover it.
It's a deception.

Yes, but things were not working. I should have been replaced at
half-time because I was not playing well. You can make out from a
player's movement he's not doing his best.

. So you'd sort of lost nerve.

Naturally, after three-four goals. I don't know why the coaches didn't
replace me.

. Did you ask the coach to change you.

No. But I still think if he had changed me, I'd have played for the
country for another four-five years easily.

. So basically you became the fall guy. You were dropped after that
match and never picked again.

Everybody went to Australia. They won there and proved themselves. But
it took me 16 years to prove myself.

. And how did you prove yourself 16 years later?

I was always involved in hockey.

. You didn't give up.

I feel the ground is a big stress-buster. You play golf, you play
hockey, anything on the ground, and when you come to the ground you
forget everything else. You just see the ball. My friends, Joachim
Carvalho, Marvin Fernandes, they all pulled me back to the ground. 'You
must play, you must coach,' they said. I continued playing for Bombay,
and was playing well. Then I started coaching and continued to do so.

. Did you start coaching the women?

That was after the Asiad. In 1998, for the first time, I was called to
coach the men's hockey team and my wife was against it. She said it had
taken her 16 years to forget whatever we had undergone. She was a little
shaken. Suppose something happens again, the whole world will not spare
us and they'll think this man has really taken money. Anyway I went
ahead and I won a gold medal for the country after 32 long years. Then
in 2003 and 2004 I was with the women's team and whatever tournament
they played, we won the gold medal. It was a great feeling.

. Hockey is a sport that generates so much passion. What did Shahid Ali
(former Pakistani captain) speak to you about?

Shahid Ali was sorry about my son. I'd lost my 19-year-old son.

. That was the second tragedy after that Asiad final.

It was the worst thing that could have happened.

. What exactly happened?

My son was doing the final year in hotel management at the Taj. These
children have a habit of keeping their helmet hanging on the handlebars
(rather than wearing it). He was riding a bike, hit a boulder and fell
down. There was no one around for 15 minutes. He died later. Thirteen
days after that, Yashraj films approached me for making a movie on
hockey. I said it wasn't possible for me to help them in any way. I said
I'd introduce them to other players and they could help.

. Your squad mates.

Yes. I said I couldn't leave my wife. But they wanted me. One day I went
there and met Jaideep Sahni (the scriptwriter of Chak De India).

. So you agreed to work in the film. Good things and bad things happen.
Not just the success of the film, you must also feel better that now
there's suddenly so much interest in hockey.

Yes, I'm absolutely delighted.

. It's nice to see so many girls turning up for practice here. And I can
see they are from different parts of India. Which team is this?

The Central Railway team.

. Thank you very much, Mr Negi.

I have a long way to go still and I'm laying a foundation for the game.
I want to promote hockey in a big way.

. It's been so inspirational to have you on Walk the Talk. I hope people
are listening and I hope they learn from you. It's a tough task to take
setbacks in your stride and carry on with a smile. Thank you very much.

Gender bender

Pamela Philipose

Posted online: Monday, September 17, 2007 at 0000 hrs IST

Some days ago, the Bombay High Court spoke up for the right to life of
the female foetus. &quot;Sex selection is not only against the spirit of the
Indian Constitution, it also insults and humiliates womanhood.&quot; The
judgment was in response to the argument, put forward by a Mumbai-based
couple, that the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Technique
(Prohibition of Sex Selection) (PCPNDT) Act, 2003, was not
constitutionally valid. Not only did it contradict the provisions of the
Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP), 1971, it infringed upon
their right to &quot;balance their family&quot; and have a son, in addition to the
two daughters they already had.

For those who are greatly concerned about India's skewed sex ratios and
have followed the vexed debate on it that has been on for three decades
in India, the case carries distinct intimations of future dilemmas. For
one, it pits a woman's right to abortion --- although this is not
directly acknowledged in the MTP Act --- against the right of a female
foetus to life. It also argued that those who can afford the costs
should be allowed to choose the sex of their child. This particular
couple stated that they did not plan to &quot;destroy&quot; daughters like those
in 'less advanced societies&quot;, but to &quot;balance&quot; their family by using
pre-selection technology to &quot;select&quot; a male embryo. Riding on these
arguments are also the interests of extremely powerful medical
professionals, doctors and technicians, who find the PCPNDT Act an
anathema.

There are two broad critiques of this law. One, that it sets out to
'control' people, provides the state with the mandate to interfere in
what is essentially a private matter and impose a certain morality on
individuals. It also makes individuals responsible for a social good
like a more equal sex ratio. Two, there is also the argument, first
posited by economist Dharma Kumar in her essay, 'Male Utopias or
Nightmares?' (EPW, 1983), that the law of supply and demand can sort out
the problem, so why resort to bans. If the supply of women gets reduced
because of sex selection, they will only become more valuable.

To the first argument, one can only say that society has often had to
choose between competing rights and social goods --- in this case the
right/need of an individual to choose the sex of his or her child is
pitted against society's right/need to have more equal sex ratios ---
while legislating on various issues. Consequently, in the light of
certain socially desirable goals, the state would have to favour one
right/ good over another. Almost every law or regulation is evolved
after making such determinations. To take a facile example, the right of
a motorist to arrive at a destination as quickly as possible has to
contend with traffic signals which place restrictions on the movement of
all commuters for public safety. As for Dharma Kumar's argument, the
'market' for daughters has not got any more bullish despite the millions
of missing daughters. Supply-and-demand laws do not work in complex
social scenarios. In any case, as Satish Balram Agnihotri has argued,
brides and grooms are not undifferentiated products in an unsegmented
market. Brides can be imported, as indeed they are, often leading to
extremely unhappy and unequal circumstances.

However, having said this, it also needs to be acknowledged that the
PCPNDT Act has not met with significant success, a fact graphically
illustrated by the data provided by the minister of state for health, P.
Lakshmi, in Parliament last month. While acknowledging that the sex
ratio in the age group 0-6 in the 2001 census was 927 per 1000 boys, as
compared to the 1991 figure of 945 girls, she went on to state that 402
cases had been filed under the PCPNDT Act. Of these, 140 were for
non-registration of ultrasound clinics, 135 for non-maintenance of
records, 61, for communication of sex of the foetus, 36 for advertising
such services, and 30 for violations of the act. The minister did not
specify the rate of conviction, but it is so low as to be almost
insignificant. Dr Baljit Singh Dahiya, a former director-general of
health services in Haryana, did succeed in getting a doctor and his
assistant jailed under the PCPNDT Act, but even he acknowledges that
lack of proper monitoring and implementation are major loopholes in the
act and believes that profiling pregnancies and births at the local
level is the only way to fight female foeticide.

There can be no denying the link between proliferating ultra-sound
facilities and declining sex ratios. Pune's Gokhale Institute of
Politics and Economics mapped the correlation and found that the average
sex ratio for districts in Maharashtra with more than 100 sonography
centres was 901, while those with fewer centres had a ratio of 937.
Thanks to the great persistence and efforts of anti-sexing activists,
detailed regulations governing the use of sex determination technology
are now there on paper. Clinics are required to maintain records, and an
'appropriate authority' is required to inspect them regularly. The idea
is to make a low-risk, high-profit venture into a high-risk, low -profit
one.

But legal instruments are inherently limited. They do not by themselves
immediately effect changes in attitudes and beliefs, neither do they
address the deeply felt need for male children within Indian society.
Additionally, laws lag behind rapid advances in medical technology.
Today, 'emergency contraceptive pills' are being advertised on
television. Tomorrow, there could be a product that allows a woman to
learn the sex of the foetus through a simple urine test, who knows?
Where does that leave the present monitoring and regulatory regime?

This suggests that there is no escape from the long, hard grind of
making women more equal within Indian society. Coercion, by its very
nature, is limited and will be increasingly less effective as medical
technologies evolve. The coercive, therefore, needs to get translated
into the consensual. In fact, even in places where declining sex ratios
have been checked today, as in some pockets of Haryana and Punjab, the
legal recourse was just one of many social initiatives that focused on
raising the profile of daughters. We still need the regulatory systems
without doubt, given the scale of the problem, but just one film like
Chak de India, which destroyed in the course of three hours the
perception that &quot;londiyan belan ghumati hain&quot; (girls are meant to wield
rolling pins), can potentially do more for the country's sex ratio than
interminable meetings of 'appropriate authorities'.

4 % &amp; 4 questions

Posted online: Monday, September 17, 2007 at 0000 hrs IST

For the week ending 1 September, inflation rate is 3.52 per cent. RBI's
target is 5 per cent this fiscal year. So with three successive weeks of
inflation below 4 per cent, RBI and the government will be in
self-congratulatory mode. The government more so since early elections
are a possibility. But four questions arise. First, even under the
umbrella of the wholesale price index, this is not annualised inflation,
but inflation of the point-to-point variety and is thus subject to the
base effect of what the index was one year ago. Second, RBI claims
reduced inflation rates represent success of monetary policy. To the
extent expectations are involved, this has a very small grain of truth.
But, as has repeatedly been argued in these columns, monetary policy was
an inappropriate instrument and reduced inflation rates have little to
do with hardening interest rates. Incidentally, this secular hardening
coincides with the advent of the UPA government. However, with elections
looming, any further hardening seems unlikely, though rates won't
possibly decline.

Third, fighting the devil has pushed government into the deep sea. The
six core infrastructure sectors (cement, steel, coal, power, crude oil,
petroleum refining) constitute more than 25 per cent of industrial
output and April-July figures show a dip in their growth to 6.1 per cent
from 8.7 per cent last year. This is reinforced by industrial production
data, which shows a slowdown (for the same period) from 11.1 per cent to
9.6 per cent. One should also flag consumer goods, which show higher
declines and are often an indicator of a general sense of well-being.
Spliced with the slowdown in export growth, a GDP growth slowdown in
2007-08 is inevitable, notwithstanding good performance in Q1.
Economists will rightly argue this is an inevitable outcome of higher
interest rates and this should have anticipated before opting for
knee-jerk reactions to a transient inflation problem. Interest rate
hikes have hurt the small-scale more, since they have access to neither
the global capital nor the equity route.

Fourth, there is an additional problem with higher crude oil prices, the
Indian basket having touched $75.30 a barrel. Political compulsions and
inflation fears prevent increase in domestic oil prices. This is a
problem that's being transferred to the next government.

Mobbed

Posted online: Monday, September 17, 2007 at 0000 hrs IST

The images out of Bihar of late are not pretty, and the tale they tell,
even less so. Nitish Kumar's Bihar seems to be the grip of a surge of
barbarism, with mobs dispensing rough justice at will to petty thieves
and offenders. Such behaviour should rightly figure only in the annals
of the dark ages. In today's India, they are an affront to every
constitutional canon and a pointer to a disturbing breakdown of the
criminal justice system. They cannot portent well for the Indian system.

Explanations there are aplenty for why such violence persists. People in
a mob behave in a manner that is distinct from how they would conduct
themselves as individuals. Rational judgment and a sense of right and
wrong are invariably discarded in the animal passions of the moment, and
the fact that personal culpability is never acknowledged, far less
punished, is a contributory factor. We also know that such attacks
reflect widespread popular frustration, not just with institutions like
the police, administration and judiciary, but with the lack of options
and opportunities for personal growth.

It needed four major episodes of horrific mob violence in two weeks -
the latest being last Thursday's lynching of 10 thieves in Vaishali ---
to get Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to even acknowledge the problem
and admit to administrative and policing lapses. Collective punishment
is never effective. He needs to convey to every face in the mob; to
every police constable/officer and bureaucrat, that justice can be
dispensed only by the state and those who contravene this will face
severe and certain punishment. So tepid has been the response from the
Bihar government so far, that it appears that it is almost half-prepared
to allow knots of brutes to dispense justice since its own ability to do
is so heavily compromised. This way lies anarchy. The CM's predecessor,
Lalu Prasad Yadav, was accused of having presided over a 'jungle raj'.
If he doesn't take care, the epithet may well travel to Nitish Kumar's
Bihar.

Doing sums in the Land of Gods

Anand P. Gupta

Posted online: Monday, September 17, 2007 at 0000 hrs IST

In his budget speech in July, Uttarakhand Chief Minister B.C. Khanduri,
who also holds the state's finance portfolio, stressed the urgency of
preventing the Uttarakhand government from falling into a debt trap. One
may argue that all that it needs to do to achieve this outcome is to
substantially raise the tax-State Domestic Product (SDP) ratio through
the collection of tax arrears and mobilise additional revenue by
widening its tax base, among other measures.

The truth is that this solution to the problem is only partly correct.
Yes, a higher tax-SDP ratio is necessary but, given the situation of
Uttarakhand's public finance, this alone will not be sufficient.
Uttarakhand, sometimes referred to as the 'Land of the Gods' also needs
to save money through minimisation, if not elimination, of distortions
in the allocation of its expenditures as also through minimisation, if
not elimination, of leakages in its expenditures. A rupee saved through
reduction in these distortions and leakages is at least as good as
raising an additional rupee through taxation. This clearly suggests that
the state urgently needs to reform the management of its expenditures.

One could go a step further and assert that even if Uttarakhand's debt
is not excessive, it will still be advisable for it to launch a major
programme designed to reform the management of its expenditures. It may
grow at an impressive rate and have a relatively high tax-SDP ratio, but
if the resulting tax revenues are not properly allocated and efficiently
used, the state may not have the capacity to develop.

We need to remember that outlays do not necessarily mean outcomes. The
people of Uttarakhand are concerned with outcomes. The government can
play an extremely important role in ensuring the delivery of these
outcomes. But in order for this to happen, the government will need to
do three things. One, examine the available evidence on the intended
outcomes of each of its major programmes, identify the gaps if any, and
take cost-effective measures to fill them. Two, raise a fire alarm for
any failure in achieving the intended outcomes. Three, investigate what
caused the failure and develop a strategic action plan. Four, monitor
the action plan's implementation and subject it to an independent,
rigorous evaluation.

Consider, for example, the outcome of substantially reducing infant
mortality in Uttarakhand which, according to the latest (2005) data,
stood at 42/1000 live births. There are substantial urban-rural
differences: while the figure for urban Uttarakhand is 17/1000 live
births, that for rural Uttarakhand is as high as 50/1000 live births.
Given this, one may argue that the government's health department must
agitate to ensure full coverage of programmes for infant mortality
reduction across rural Uttarakhand. But this alone is not enough. The
department will have to carefully track the relevant expenditures in
selected rural areas, including those that have the highest infant
mortality levels.

Responses to these questions will allow the state's health department to
understand the infant mortality situation at the micro level. The
department will then know why an outlay in a district may produce the
intended outcome, but an equal outlay in another district may fail to
produce the intended outcome.

What is more, armed with the responses to the above questions, the
department will also be in a position to develop a strategic action
plan, which includes the requisite incentive-creating,
institutional-strengthening and capacity-building measures to
efficiently convert the outlays into intended outcomes. The action plan
may differ from one district in Uttarakhand to another.

In short, reforming the management of government expenditure boils down
to three policy approaches. One, minimisation, if not elimination, of
distortions in the allocation of resources. For example, if reduction of
infant mortality is one of the intended outcomes, focus on those
districts in which the infant mortality rate is relatively high, using
district-wise data. Two, identify an appropriate package of inputs.
Given that the infant mortality situation may differ from one district
to another, the package of inputs may also differ from district to
district. Three, minimise, if not eliminate, leakages in the use of inputs.

It is only through such holistic approaches can the state be put on
track, both in terms of its economy and social welfare.

Unfair and Lovely

Amrita Tripathi

Posted online: Monday, September 17, 2007 at 0000 hrs IST

Mainstream companies make big bucks by peddling the beauty myth and now
it's India that's buying into it wholesale. From miracle creams that
have husbands dancing circles around you... to supposedly tested
products from supposed scientific labs that can show you the craters on
your face which your mirror has been hiding from you.

Never mind that the rest of us sadly lack X-ray vision that would show
up microscopic details. Those horrendously enlarged pores of yours may
not even be visible to other people --- but, then again, why shouldn't
you shell out hundreds of rupees to tackle flaws, no matter how
invisible? A small price to pay to further clog up your pores and
presumably curtail your husband's mid-life crisis and roving eye, in the
bargain.

Never mind if it's not in him to whip up a chef's hat and make you a
romantic dinner a deux, magic cream or no magic cream. Never mind that
with the metrosexual wave, it's the husbands and boyfriends who are the
Great Untapped, for whom there are not just shaving creams and
deodorants to drive women wild, but even creams for dark circles under
the eyes.

Never mind that you can't stop the ravages of time, that no matter what
you do, whether it's retinol-laced cream or a jab of botox every so
often, there's no cure for growing older.

Never mind that by getting you to bleach your face over and over again,
the same companies get you to destroy your own skin. It's a
multi-billion dollar trial and you're the guinea pig. And, in any case,
no price is too high for the 'wheatish complexion' that matrimonials
celebrate.

It's an open market after all, and you're told you need that edge. Women
(and increasingly men) are just a few barcodes short of being sold with
a 'best before' tag.

Your cosmetic product of choice could be 'Fair and Lovely' here in India
or 'Dark and Lovely' seven seas away, but tragically 'lovely' doesn't
come in a jar, tube or bottle. A pity really, because we've just about
managed to convince ourselves that beauty is almost a virtue --- that
it's not just skin-deep but in the eye of the beholder.

The fact is, no matter what the companies may say, your beauty is skin-deep.

Bridging God and religion

Mrugank Inamdar

Posted online: Monday, September 17, 2007 at 0000 hrs IST

I am not religious; I abhor the fake halo religious people assume. The
underlying assumption of the majority of religious people is that their
religion is in some way superior to others'. I also notice all religions
harp on love and restraint while glossing over their own violent
histories. It is important we analyse rationally all our differences and
also the actual veracity of the claims religions make. On these points,
I am in complete agreement with Saubhik Chakrabarti, in his article,
'God and us' (IE, September 14), and congratulate him on his clarity.

However, he does not distinguish between people who believe in God and
those who believe in religion. Religious people would be the ones who
subscribe to one of the many available forms of worship --- the
fire-worship of the Zoroastrian, Christ worship of the Christian or the
atheism of the Zen-Buddhist. Religion would also include belief in the
dogma of that particular religion. You could believe, like Mel Gibson,
that your wife would not be welcome in heaven because she isn't
Catholic. You could also believe that blasphemy needs to be punished
with death and a fatwa needs to be imposed on those who joke about
matters of faith. I may also point out that atheism is as much of a
religion as any other, with its own form of dogma.

How can these people be herded together with the ones who only profess a
belief in God, but no religious affiliation? How can one equate the
pantheism of Spinoza (intellectual love of God) with the fanaticism of
the religious? Belief in God or even agnosticism seems a perfectly
rational position. And, after all, saying there is a God is as
definitive a statement as saying that there isn't. If the presence of
God provides human beings with an impartial judge for their actions and
keeps them from harming each other, then that itself is a compelling
argument for continuing to believe in Him.

Now to come to Chakrabarti's point on the need for scientific proof and
a rational, unemotional approach to religion and religious symbols (like
Adam's bridge). On the face of it, I couldn't agree more. Even for the
religious, the thing of importance is that a man as perfect as Ram
existed. Of what use is his bridge today? Even Ram, the man who inspired
the myth, would appreciate the practical benefits of his bridge's
destruction. But then the matter gets tricky. When a man-made object was
destroyed --- like the Bamiyan Buddhas --- the world opposed the
destruction of heritage monuments. But what about monuments that are not
man-made but inspire people of faith?

I have sympathy for the project, but it did seem stupid that the
government had pushed itself into a corner, where it could have ended up
hurting some and providing ammunition to those who like to stoke
national hysteria.
