A classic example of how stupid the american people are:

Fred Thompson is running for president because he drives
a red pick up truck and is a man of the people.   He drives a
limo to within two blocks of capital, then drives the red
pickup truck the remaining two blocks.

And this is the type of elected official the sheople in the US of
A will vote for.

It's official, the american experiment in democracy has failed.
And we're trying to tell other countries to adopt democracy?

And John Edwards is a man of the people because he wears jeans and
rolls his sleeves up. He speaks of two Americas while he lives in a
10,000 square foot home with indoor pools and basketball courts and
drives two read two SUV's and typically flies private jets while
encouraging America to give up the gaudy SUV's in favor of better
mileage/greener cars. Thompson is also a scumbag attorney who has had
shady clients as has Edwards. They sold their souls for the almighty $$
$ and hope the general public wont know what they've done during their
legal career. Neither deserves your trust or vote but as a partisan
you'll only tell us of one.

Firstly, the US is a Constitutional Republic.

Secondly, the 24 hour media machine is run by the same special
interests that corrupt our country and politics. They can't run the
news without income from the large corporations that promote
candidates.

Thirdly, the &quot;public image&quot; of Thompson that you detest is provided by
the same media.

Fourthly, of all the &quot;mainstream&quot; candidates, I would put Rudy
Guilliani, Dennis Kuchinich (hey he is a nut promoting reparations for
Black people but at least he says what he thinks), Joe Biden and Fred
Thompson as the most honest candidates. I believe that they believe in
public service for the betterment of all Americans.

Fifthly, most Americans are not active in the political process as
they should be.

Sixthly, the media will control the ignorant people and nominate
Clinton and Guilliani.

Seventhly, is seventhly really a word?????

Eighthly, now I definitely know eighthly is not a word!!!

Ninethly (definitely a word) unless you invest the time in the
political process and make intelligent decisions based upon that then
you have no right to bitch about who gets elected.

We have not lived in a democracy for many years. While some places in the
world have gone awry by their inability to separate church and state. Ours
has become increasingly unable to separate corporate from state -- thus
creating a hybrid in which Capitalist ideology permeates how the country is
governed.

We try to export Democracy as if holding elections was all there was to it.
But those countries look at the US and see: consolidation of power, greed,
exploitation of the poor and weak -- and emulate it.  And we shake our heads
and say &quot;they just don't get it.&quot; But they do.  We export capitalist
ideology very well.

First off if you are looking for someone to blindly apologize for GWB
you've got the wrong guy. I do not particularly like him as a
President however I do not think he is dishonest and will not
criticize the war effort while it is still ongoing. It's ethically
bankrupt to call Bush a liar and give Democrats who said the EXACT
same thing for years (see other post for a real nice list of QUOTES),
including Bill and Hillary Clinton a free pass. It shows you to be a
partisan two bit hack, but then I guess you never claimed not to be
did you? As for the RNC talking points hmmm I'll have to see if I get
their check in the mail because I don't recall doing so... and I can
provide you quite a nice number of issues I disagree with them
wholeheartedly on. Unlike people who blindly, and unpatriotically I'll
add, call their President a liar and all sorts of other foolish things
because some jackass like Sean Penn or Kanye West say so, I actually
formulate an opinion based on my own without the help of a political
party, celebrity or candidate. So when I tell you the war in Iraq
begun under GWB... and certainly had some in the administration  too
eager to be involved, it is very clear to me that the peace lovers now
had plenty of time with unabated authority to deal peacefully with
Saddam Hussein, but they also chose not too. There was a 15 year
workup thru 3 different administations to this war. Not one of them
did anything to diffuse the situation and I'll make an argument the
guy who swung a few months ago did nothing to diffuse it either. Now
as for the assets of GWB what in the name of Jesus Christ does that
have to do with anything? So he's wealthy.... so is John Edwards, The
Clintons, and most every national politican. Ok people made money on
the war....tasteless okay we mght agree. I'll simply ask you to name a
war in which the warmaking industry has not reaped large profits. Do
no Democrats own any Haliburton? Raytheon a solely Republican owned
stock? Al friggen Gore at one time owned as much petroleoum based
stock in Occidental Petroleoum as GWB did, so???? All this means what?
Bush lied people died??? Go talk your foolishness to your socialist
leaning buddies.

No need for name calling now.

The United States of America is the oldest constitutional republic in
the world. According to James Woodburn, in The American Republic and
Its Government, &quot;the constitutional republic with its limitations on
popular government is clearly involved in the Constitution, as seen in
the election of the President, the election of the Senate and the
appointment of the Supreme Court.&quot; That is, the ability of the people
to choose officials in government is checked by not allowing them to
elect Supreme Court justices.

Woodburn says that in a republic, as distinguished from a democracy,
the people are not only checked in choosing officials but also in
making laws.[4] A Bill of Rights exists in the U.S. Constitution which
protects certain individual rights. The individual rights enumerated
in the Bill of Rights cannot be voted away by the majority of citizens
if they wished to oppress a minority who does not agree with the
restrictions on liberty that they wish to impose. To eliminate these
rights would require government officials overcoming constitutional
checks as well as a two-thirds majority vote of Congress and
ratification by three-fourths of the States in order to amend the
Constitution.

">

Have You Been Deceived?

Q. When the Founding Fathers established our government, they gave us:
(a) a democracy, or (b) a republic?

You have been deceived!

America is a republic - not a democracy!

Not only did our Founding Fathers establish a republic, they greatly feared
democracy. James Madison, known as the father of the U.S. Constitution,
wrote in &quot;Essay #10&quot; of The Federalist Papers: &quot;... democracies have ever
been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found
incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in
general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their
deaths.&quot;

Although such an attitude will surprise most Americans, it is accurate.

The United States Constitution does not contain the word democracy. It
does &quot;guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of
government....&quot; Also, when we recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag,
we say, &quot;to the Republic for which it stands,&quot; and not &quot;to the Democracy.&quot;

The difference between a republic and a democracy was once widely understood
in America. The U.S. War Department (superseded by the Department of
Defense) taught that difference in a training manual (No. 2000-25)
published on November 30, 1928. This official U.S. government document,
used at the time for the training of American military personnel, said of
democracy:

A government of the masses.

Authority derived through mass meeting or any other form of 'direct'
expression.

Results in mobocracy.

Attitude toward property is communistic - negating property rights.

Attitude toward law is that the will of the majority shall regulate,
whether it be based upon deliberation

or governed by passion, prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or
regard to consequences.

Results in demogogism, license, agitation, discontent, anarchy.&quot;

It went on to state: &quot;Our Constitutional fathers, familiar with the strength
and weakness of both autocracy and democracy, with fixed principles
definitely in mind, defined a representative republican form of government.
They 'made a very marked distinction between a republic and a democracy and
said repeatedly and emphatically that they had founded a republic.' &quot;

Don't be deceived. America is a republic - not a democracy!
