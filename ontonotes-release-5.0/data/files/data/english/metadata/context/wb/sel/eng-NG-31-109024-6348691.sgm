The brilliant internet classics site, Livius.Org has this excellent
piece relating to "300" and "Persian Fire" by Tom Holland.  (I'd also
recommend reading Gore Vidal's book "Creation" on this topic.)

The battle of Thermopylae and the war between Greece and Persia have
an almost mythological status in western civilization. However, there
are some nasty aspects to this popularity. A discussion of
Frank Miller, 300 (1998; comic book)
Zack Snyder, 300 (2006; movie)
Tom Holland, Persian Fire (2005; history book)
Conclusion: The works discussed have shown that the study of ancient
history in the twenty-first century has two serious defects:
historians are still suffering from their nineteenth-century
blindness
towards the Near East, and know less about theory and method than
they
used to do in the early 1900's.

Fighting for freedom
".... Miller runs into trouble when he offers an interpretation of
the
story. The Spartans, he says, sacrificed themselves for the freedom
of
Greece. And not only for Greek liberty: the Spartans were "the
world's
one hope for reason and justice", and the Persians were living "in a
sea of mysticism and tyranny". Although Thermopylae was a defeat, it
showed the world what free men are capable of, inspired the other
Greeks, and therefore saved Greek culture and all of western
civilization.

Miller's reading of Thermopylae and the Greco-Persian wars is not
unique. It can also be found in Persian Fire, a book by the British
historian Tom Holland, published in 2006. It is a good read, if you
can ignore exuberant lines like "As the storm clouds of seeming
Persian invincibility loomed ever darker over Ionia, so strange
shadows from the past returned to haunt Athens, too". In his
introduction, Holland states that democracy, rationalism, and the
philosophy of Plato would not have existed if the Persians had not
been expelled from Europe. The book is completely different from
Miller's comic book, but in one respect they are similar: Herodotus'
story about self-sacrifice has become the foundation myth of western
civilization."

Well in this case the film would seem to be historically accurate and in
accordance with Herodotus, Isocrates and Diodorus on the subject.

Odd. I thought the Spartans ran what amounted to an early version of a Nazi
police state based on slavery and the inequality of man. To the best of my
knowledge they had a king at the time and didn't give a rat's er tail about
democracy or anybody's freedom other than their own.

Some of the best fighting men around at the time though and willing to fight
and die for their nation and their right to live the way they wanted even if
that would make most moderns puke.

You have a nice day.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; historians are still suffering from their nineteenth-century
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; blindness
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; towards the Near East, and know less about theory and method than
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; used to do in the early 1900's.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Fighting for freedom
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;.... Miller runs into trouble when he offers an interpretation of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; story. The Spartans, he says, sacrificed themselves for the freedom
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Greece. And not only for Greek liberty: the Spartans were &quot;the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; world's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one hope for reason and justice&quot;, and the Persians were living &quot;in a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sea of mysticism and tyranny&quot;. Although Thermopylae was a defeat, it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; showed the world what free men are capable of, inspired the other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Greeks, and therefore saved Greek culture and all of western
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; civilization.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Well in this case the film would seem to be historically accurate and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; accordance with Herodotus, Isocrates and Diodorus on the subject.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Miller's reading of Thermopylae and the Greco-Persian wars is not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unique. It can also be found in Persian Fire, a book by the British
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; historian Tom Holland, published in 2006. It is a good read, if you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can ignore exuberant lines like &quot;As the storm clouds of seeming
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Persian invincibility loomed ever darker over Ionia, so strange
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shadows from the past returned to haunt Athens, too&quot;. In his
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; introduction, Holland states that democracy, rationalism, and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; philosophy of Plato would not have existed if the Persians had not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; been expelled from Europe. The book is completely different from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Miller's comic book, but in one respect they are similar: Herodotus'
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; story about self-sacrifice has become the foundation myth of western
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; civilization.&quot;

They were completely, totally and utterly free. They didn't serve anyone
unless it was their own choice and they were paid for it. They controlled
their own land, chose who they wanted to mate with and did not have to pay
any tribute to anyone out of what they produced.

&gt; Odd. I thought the Spartans ran what amounted to an early version of a
&gt; Nazi police state based on slavery and the inequality of man. To the best
&gt; of my knowledge they had a king at the time and didn't give a rat's er
&gt; tail about democracy or anybody's freedom other than their own.

&gt; Some of the best fighting men around at the time though and willing to
&gt; fight and die for their nation and their right to live the way they wanted
&gt; even if that would make most moderns puke.
">

You are talking complete and utter crap.

First of all they were free, secondly they and their king shared the same
line of decent from Herakles and he ate with them in the same dining halls
and lived in the same kind of ordinary house that they lived in and thirdly
you have no idea what a police state is. Everyone in Sparta lived communally
and there were no informants informing on their neighbours like there were
in Athens during the Peloponnesian War. The system they had was the same as
the Feudal system in English in the middle ages where the Spartans were the
equivalent to the Normans and the Helots were equivalent to the Saxons who
were each allowed their own land and had to give up a percentage of their
produce to the state, only the Helots were not expected to fight.

The very fact that the Helots were never expected to fight
demonstrates a crucial difference with English feudalism.
This was based on obligation to the land-holding knights, up to and
including military service.
Being a nation-state, it was also a far more complex social formation,
with a monarchy, church and barons controlling various levels of
freemen, cottars and villeins.

Sparta was more like a tribal society with a military ruling caste,
the Spartiates, who never worked the land or engaged in trade.
These never numbered more than 10,000 and probably declined to 1200 by
340 B.C.
The subjugated Lacedaemonians were composed of Perioeci, who were
tradesmen and the mass of the Helot peasantry beneath them.
The Spartiates lived in mortal fear of a Helot revolt and their
defection to other city states, hence the Krypteia, which meant living
in a "police state" for the Helots.

This military caste is is portrayed in the film 300 as the defender of
Athenian democracy.
Actually, they always intervened on the side of Oligarchy against
Democracy in the Peloponesian Wars.
Spartan equality was the democracy of the "barracks"  Any differences
within the polis had to be supressed.
It was a traditionalist, ossified militaristic society, culturally far
behind Athens.
Things only changed after Sparta lost Messenia and was deprived of its
helots.

Spartans were unfree.

At the end? It was all that there was left of the Spartans (surely they lost
some numbers of men during the two days of combat), plus the rest of the
Lacaedamonians, including the Helots, who were liberated, plus the
Thespians.

So no, they did not fight alone even till the end. The liberation of the
Helots at the beginning of the final day, that is what gives the fighting
Spartans a different meaning towards a "freedom for all", thus not a
"totalitarian military nazi-state".

The Spartan city-state had a duarchy, the Ephori and the Gerousia, so it was
more or
less a mixture of all current political systems of government at the time.

The suppression of the Helots gave more freedom and power to the Spartiates
to do as they pleased, thus creating their unique state of government.

It certainly is not brilliant. Look below:

NO, Jona, Fyrom area was never Macedonia anything, and your attempts
to undermine the Greekness of the Macedonians is very foolish.

The real Macedonia, and I can provide the actual descriptive

Macedonians:

And I suggest you read the following more carefully.

Curtius 6.9.35
"Praeter Macedones plerique adsunt, quos facilius quae dicam percepturos
arbitror, si eadem lingua fuero usus qua tu egisti; non ob aliud, credo,
quam ut oratio tua intelligi posset a pluribus".

And the translation

"Besides the Macedonians there are many present who, I think, will
more easily understand what I shall say if I use the same language which
you have employed, for no other reason, I suppose, than in order that you
speech might be understood by the greater number."

The crucial words are "more easily".

That speech clearly shows that Macedonian was actually understandable
by other Greeks but "not so easily". Now, just how would anyone try to
explain that all the Greek warriors could understand with some difficuly
the Macedonian language if it was not a dialect of Greek.

Also, as an aside, that the sentence also means that ALL the
Macedonians understood the common Greek of their time at that
early time period as considered against later Hellenistic times so
_their_ language had to be a dialect of Greek.

In other words, Jona, your site and you ? lacks integrity.

Why exactly the Ephors would need to unleash the Krypteia on the

questions about its nature, though.
The Spartiate were certainly free to kill Helots with impunity.

The disagreement revolves around your definition of Spartan, which is
an elitist one.
Since I define Spartan to mean the inhabitants of Laconia, there's no
possibility of agreement.

Well they are not.

[Stra. 8.5.4] According to Ephorus: Eurysthenes and Procles, the
Heracleidae, took possession of Laconia, divided the country into six parts,
and founded cities; now one of the divisions, Amyclae, they selected and
gave to the man who had betrayed Laconia to them and who had persuaded the
ruler who was in possession of it to accept their terms and emigrate with
the Achaeans to Ionia; Sparta they designated as a royal residence for
themselves; to the other divisions they sent kings, and because of the
sparsity of the population gave them permission to receive as fellow
inhabitants any strangers who wished the privilege; and they used Las as a
naval station because of its good harbor, and Aegys as a base of operations
against their enemies (for its territory bordered on those of the
surrounding peoples) and Pharis as a treasury, because it afforded security
against outsiders; . . . but though the neighboring peoples, one and all,
were subject to the Spartiatae, still they had equal rights, sharing both in
the rights of citizenship and in the offices of state, and they were called
Helots;

Actually they were not called Helots but Perioeci. The Helots were Achaeans
and their name was applied to all slaves after the First Messenian War.

[Paus. 3.2.3] This Labotas Herodotus, in his history of Croesus, says was in
his childhood the ward of Lycurgus the lawgiver, but he calls him Leobotes
and not Labotas. It was then that the Lacedaemonians first resolved to make
war upon the Argives, bringing as charges against them that they were
annexing the Cynurian territory which they themselves had captured, and were
causing revolts among their subjects the Perioeci (Dwellers around ). On
this occasion neither of the belligerents, according to the account,
achieved anything worthy of mention.

[Plutarch, Lycurgus] Sous (1062-1028 BC) certainly was the most renowned of
all Lycurgus ancestors, under whose conduct the Spartans made slaves of the
Helots, and added to their dominions, by conquest, a good part of Arcadia.

[Strabo. 8.5.4] ... but Agis (1061-1030 BC), the son of Eurysthenes,
deprived [the neighboring peoples] of the equality of rights and ordered
them to pay tribute to Sparta; now all obeyed except the Heleians, the
occupants of Helus, who, because they revolted, were forcibly reduced in a
war, and were condemned to slavery, with the express reservation that no
slaveholder should be permitted either to set them free or to sell them
outside the borders of the country; and this war was called the War against
the Helots. One may almost say that it was Agis and his associates who
introduced the whole system of Helot-slavery that persisted until the
supremacy of the Romans; for the Lacedaemonians held the Helots as state
slaves in a way, having assigned to them certain settlements to live in and
special services to perform.

[Paus. 3.2.7] After the death of Teleclus, Alcamenes (785-747 BC) his son
succeeded to the throne, and the Lacedaemonians sent to Crete Charmidas the
son of Euthys, who was a distinguished Spartan, to put down the civil strife
among the Cretans, to persuade them to abandon the weak, inland towns, and
to help them to people instead those that were conveniently situated for the
coasting voyage.

[Pausanius. 3.2.7] [The Spartans] also laid waste Helos, an Achaean town on
the coast, and won a battle against the Argives who came to give aid to the
Helots.

[Strabo. 6.3.2] In speaking of the founding of Taras, Antiochus says: After
the Messenian war (748-738 BC) broke out, those of the Lacedaemonians who
did not take part in the expedition were adjudged slaves and were named
Helots, and all children who were born in the time of the expedition were
called Partheniae and judicially deprived of the rights of citizenship, but
they would not tolerate this, and since they were numerous formed a plot
against the free citizens; and when the latter learned of the plot they sent
secretly certain men who, through a pretence of friendship, were to report
what manner of plot it was; among these was Phalanthus, who was reputed to
be their champion, but he was not pleased, in general, with those who had
been named to take part in the council. It was agreed, however, that the
attack should be made at the Hyacinthian festival in the Amyclaeum when the
games were being celebrated, at the moment when Phalanthus should put on his
leather cap (the free citizens were recognizable by their hair ); but when
Phalanthus and his men had secretly reported the agreement, and when the
games were in progress, the herald came forward and forbade Phalanthus to
put on a leather cap; and when the plotters perceived that the plot had been
revealed, some of them began to run away and others to beg for mercy; but
they were bidden to be of good cheer and were given over to custody;
Phalanthus, however, was sent to the temple of the god to consult with
reference to founding a colony; and the god responded, "I give to thee
Satyrium, both to take up thine abode in the rich land of Taras and to
become a bane to the Iapygians." Accordingly, the Partheniae went thither
with Phalanthus, and they were welcomed by both the barbarians and the
Cretans who had previously taken possession of the place. These latter, it
is said, are the people who sailed with Minos to Sicily, and, after his
death, which occurred at the home of Cocalus in Camici, set sail from
Sicily; but on the voyage back they were driven out of their course to
Taras, although later some of them went afoot around the Adrias as far as
Macedonia and were called Bottiaeans. But all the people as far as Daunia,
it is said, were called Iapyges, after Iapyx, who is said to have been the
son of Daedalus by a Cretan woman and to have been the leader of the
Cretans. The city of Taras, however, was named after some hero.

I have no intention of getting into the Macedonian issue, but will say
that I think Lendering's site offers a very useful resource of
evidence.
He very rarely strays from making statements which can't be supported
from classic sources or archaeology.
It's particularly noteable for including material on non Greco-Roman
societies and giving them more serious consideration than classicists
usually afford them.
What's good about his article on "300" is that he exposes the misuse
of the Thermopylae story for modern political purposes.

I'll get back to Agamennon's challenge later, I'm doing a bit of
research on that....

My research confirms that my original points were correct.

The precise relationship between the Spartiates, Perioeci and Helots
in the early years of the Dorian settlement of Greece are unclear.
Later Historians such as Pausanias and Strabo aren't reliable and
there is some conflict with archaeology in their descriptions.
Herodotus and Thucydides are better guides, but were affected by the
position they took in the struggles between the Greek City states and
between the Greeks and Persians.

Whatever it's origin, the Messenian identity was a shifting one,
promoted by Athens as a counterweight to the Spartan oligarchy.
However Athens was also fearful of inciting a more general rebellion
of the dispossessed peasantry and hence, it failed in the struggle
against the Oligarchic states.

Since your position is one of extremist Greek National Chauvinism and
you are incapable of doing much more than cutting and pasting, it's
unlikely you'll be able to follow any of the arguments.

Here's a reading list for those who can:

G.E.M de St Croix's book "The class struggle in the ancient Greek
world.
Friedrich Engels: "The Origin of the Family" pps 66-70
Thomas J.Figueira "The Evolution of the Mesenian Identity" in "Sparta
New Perpectives" ed. Hodkinson &amp; Powell

Women" ibid

300 is more or less historically accurate unlike Troy which was not and

Absolute nonsense, it was one of the foundations of European
civilisation.

Like any culture, Ancient Greece had both progressive and reactionary
elements.
What you consider to be "Greek culture", is the culture of the rulers
of certain city states.
Sparta didn't even have a written culture.
The popular culture of Ancient Greece, including the Mystery Cults, is
much less understood.

The progressive part of Ancient Greek Culture included its Science and
Democracy.
I have high regard for both.
You ought to also look at the issue of whether these might originated
in Egypt and Phoenicia, as was believed by the ancient historians, but
not by Plutarch.
(See Martin Bernal "Black Athena" Chapter 2)
Cultures don't exist in vaccuums and never have done.

Your problem is not lack of knowledge, it's your methodology.
All of the sources I have quoted are littered with quotations from
original sources and archaeological evidence.
It's not my job to regurgitate them to prove my point.  Go and read
them.

Given "300"'s incredible distortions, for instance it's ridiculous
portrayal of ancient Persia and total lack of objectivity on who
actually fought at Thermopylae, I can only presume that for you, facts
are less important than confirmation of your own national chauvinism.

Sparta didn't even have a written culture? What?! Do you know how stupid you
look when you say that?

Sparta had a written culture since its foundation in 1600 BC. Where do you
think the recorded history of all of its kings and their deeds came from if
it was not written down? How is it we know about the first and second
Messenian wars and the decent of the Herakilds and the campaigns of
Charillus and the life of Lycurgus and the Spatan poets Tyrtaeus and Alkman
and Epimenides. No written culture. Bollocks. You clearly don't know what
you are talking about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The popular culture of Ancient Greece, including the Mystery Cults, is
&gt; much less understood.

More nonsense. The Mystery cults are documented by Eusebius. They were based
on adaptations of Egyptian and Phoenician cults which were applied to
similar episodes and persons in Mycenaean history who unlawfully killed or
raped their brethren, and because they were sins they were called Mysia
hence the Mysteries or sins.

Rubbish. There was no such thing as democracy in Egypt or Phoenicia. They
were tyrannies. The first democracy was Athens which was ruled by the people
since the time that Thesus was expelled by them in 1210 BC (Jerome).

Greek science originated with the Dactyls of Idea in 1700 BC. Pliny gives a
full list of Greek inventions and when they were invented starting with the
invention of Astrology by Atlas who may have learned it from the Assyrians
or Egyptians but that is beside the point. The Greeks are documented to have
had it since 1700 BC and that's what matters. Chiron the son of Kronos and
Phyllira invented Medcine. Euryalus and Hyperbius invented the first clay
bricks and tiles. Corabus invented pottery, and so on.

Poppycock. Ancinet Persia was a tyranny and that is how it is accurately
portrayed in 300. The Persians destroyed everything in their wake and would
have slaughtered every last living person had they not been stopped and
driven out. They didn't invade Greece to bring culture and freedom to it.
They invaded it the wipe out every last man and colonise it with 3 million
barbarians.

&gt; it was not written down? How is it we know about the first and second
&gt; Messenian wars and the decent of the Herakilds and the campaigns of
&gt; Charillus and the life of Lycurgus and the Spatan poets Tyrtaeus and Alkman
&gt; and Epimenides. No written culture. Bollocks. You clearly don't know what
&gt; you are talking about.

&gt; &gt; The popular culture of Ancient Greece, including the Mystery Cults, is
&gt; &gt; much less understood.

&gt; More nonsense. The Mystery cults are documented by Eusebius. They were based
&gt; on adaptations of Egyptian and Phoenician cults which were applied to
&gt; similar episodes and persons in Mycenaean history who unlawfully killed or
&gt; raped their brethren, and because they were sins they were called Mysia
&gt; hence the Mysteries or sins.

&gt; &gt; The progressive part of Ancient Greek Culture included its Science and
&gt; &gt; Democracy.
&gt; &gt; I have high regard for both.
&gt; &gt; You ought to also look at the issue of whether these might originated
&gt; &gt; in Egypt and Phoenicia, as was believed by the ancient historians, but
&gt; &gt; not by Plutarch.

&gt; Rubbish. There was no such thing as democracy in Egypt or Phoenicia. They
&gt; were tyrannies. The first democracy was Athens which was ruled by the people
&gt; since the time that Thesus was expelled by them in 1210 BC (Jerome).

&gt; Greek science originated with the Dactyls of Idea in 1700 BC. Pliny gives a
&gt; full list of Greek inventions and when they were invented starting with the
&gt; invention of Astrology by Atlas who may have learned it from the Assyrians
&gt; or Egyptians but that is beside the point. The Greeks are documented to have
&gt; had it since 1700 BC and that's what matters. Chiron the son of Kronos and
&gt; Phyllira invented Medcine. Euryalus and Hyperbius invented the first clay
&gt; bricks and tiles. Corabus invented pottery, and so on.

&gt; &gt; (See Martin Bernal &quot;Black Athena&quot; Chapter 2)
&gt; &gt; Cultures don't exist in vaccuums and never have done.

&gt; Right that does it. You obviously are a historical revisionist as I
&gt; suspected if you are reading that discredited revisionist garbage and
&gt; recommending it to people. There is no reason to take anything you say
&gt; seriously anymore.

&gt; &gt; Your problem is not lack of knowledge, it's your methodology.
&gt; &gt; All of the sources I have quoted are littered with quotations from
&gt; &gt; original sources and archaeological evidence.

&gt; &quot;Black Athena&quot;. You must be joking.

&gt; &gt; It's not my job to regurgitate them to prove my point.  Go and read

&gt; &gt; Given &quot;300&quot;'s incredible distortions, for instance it's ridiculous
&gt; &gt; portrayal of ancient Persia and total lack of objectivity on who
&gt; &gt; actually fought at Thermopylae, I can only presume that for you, facts
&gt; &gt; are less important than confirmation of your own national chauvinism.

&gt; Poppycock. Ancinet Persia was a tyranny and that is how it is accurately
&gt; portrayed in 300. The Persians destroyed everything in their wake and would
&gt; have slaughtered every last living person had they not been stopped and
&gt; driven out. They didn't invade Greece to bring culture and freedom to it.
&gt; They invaded it the wipe out every last man and colonise it with 3 million

Democracy:-
I'll concede your point about Democracy, that was a hastily written
sentence.
Marx: " Plato's Republic, in so far as division of labour is treated
in it, as the formative principle of the state, is merely an Athenian
idealisation of the Egytpian Caste system"
Kapital, vol 1, Pt 4 (1983 p 299)
Science:-
e.g. Pythagoras
"Pythagoras's father was Mnesarchus while his mother was Pythais and
she was a native of Samos. Mnesarchus was a merchant who came from
Tyre
i.e. He was half *Phoenician*.  The Greeks called them Phoenicians,
they called themselves Kanaanim = Canaanites (mutually intelligible
dialect with Hebrew)
In about 535 BC Pythagoras went to *Egypt*. This happened a few years
after the tyrant Polycrates seized control of the city of Samos. There
is some evidence to suggest that Pythagoras and Polycrates were
friendly at first and it is claimed that Pythagoras went to Egypt with
a letter of introduction written by Polycrates. In fact Polycrates had
an alliance with Egypt and there were therefore strong links between
Samos and Egypt at this time. The accounts of Pythagoras's time in
Egypt suggest that he visited many of the temples and took part in
many discussions with the priests. According to Porphyry Pythagoras
was refused admission to all the temples except the one at Diospolis
where he was accepted into the priesthood after completing the rites
necessary for admission
In 525 BC Cambyses II, the king of Persia, invaded Egypt. Polycrates
abandoned his alliance with Egypt and sent 40 ships to join the
Persian fleet against the Egyptians. After Cambyses had won the Battle
of Pelusium in the Nile Delta and had captured Heliopolis and Memphis,
Egyptian resistance collapsed. Pythagoras was taken prisoner and taken
to Babylon. Iamblichus writes that Pythagoras
... was transported by the followers of Cambyses as a prisoner of war.
Whilst he was there he gladly associated with the Magoi ... and was
instructed in their sacred rites and learnt about a very mystical
worship of the gods. He also reached the acme of perfection in
arithmetic and music and the other mathematical sciences taught by the
*Babylonians*... "

Writing:-
Regarding the alphabet, none of the Greek historians I know of dispute
the view of Herodotus:
"The Phoenicians who came with Cadmus-amongst whom were the Gephyraei-
introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, a
number of accomplishments, of which the most important was writing, an
art till then, I think, unknown to the Greeks. At first they used the
same characters as all the other Phoenicians, but as time went on, and
they changed their language, they also changed the shape of their
letters. At that period most of the Greeks in the neighbourhood were
Ionians; they were taught these letters by the Phoenicians and adopted
them, with a few alterations, for their own use, continuing to refer
to them as the Phoenician characters-as was only right, as the
Phoenicians had introduced them."
Plutarch's " On the Malice of Herodotus" is only concerned with
attacking Herodotus on the question of the origins of Greek religious
beliefs and his "barbarophilia".
The Spartans' written culture:
There's no evidence of it before the late 6th C - (inscriptions), nor
real evidence that the poets you mention were committed to writing
until much later.   (Just as there were pre-Islamic Arab poets whose
verses were memorised and only written down when Arabic writing
developed)
It was stated by Classical Greek authors that the Spartan rulers
actively discouraged written records, although the ruling elite were
probably literate by 4th C
A modern view is in Ellen Millender "Spartan Literacy Revisited,"
Classical Antiquity 20 (2001), 121-64.
"According to several fourth-century Athenian sources, the Spartans
were a boorish and uneducated people, who were either hostile toward
the written word or simply illiterate. Building upon such Athenian
claims of Spartan illiteracy, modern scholars have repeatedly
portrayed Sparta as a backward state whose supposedly secretive and
reactionary oligarchic political system led to an extremely low level
of literacy on the part of the common Spartiate. This article
reassesses both ancient and modern constructions of Spartan illiteracy
and examines the ideological underpinnings of Athenian attacks on the
ostensibly unlettered Lacedaemonians.... "

Cross-Cultural influences on Greece:-
e.g.
"The Bacchae", Euripides c.406 B.C.

Dionysus:-
"I travelled first to the sun-smitten Persian plains
The walled cities of Bactria, the harsh Media country,
Wealthy Arabia, and the whole tract of the Asian coast
**Where mingled swarms of Greeks and Orientals live**
In vast magnificent cities; and before reaching this, the first city
of Hellas I have visited,
I had already performed my dances and set forth my ritual
To make my godhead manifest to mortal men"

Linking to the Mysteries.....

Dionysus was a non-Olympian god, only absorbed into Athenian practices
1,000 years after its first appearance in Cadmean Thebes, which
continued to have links with Egypt, where the name comes from!
Plutarch believed that: "Osiris is identical with Dionysus" and was
also linked to Demeter at Byblos.
It was regarded as a dangerous folk religion linked to wine drinking
and social unrest, hence controlled by the state in Athens.
The link with social unrest is also shown by the report that  the wife
of Spartacus, leader of the Italian Slave Revolt of 73BC, was an

&gt;&gt;&gt; The brilliant internet classics site, Livius.Org has this excellent
&gt;&gt;&gt; piece relating to &quot;300&quot; and &quot;Persian Fire&quot; by Tom Holland.  (I'd also
&gt;&gt;&gt; recommend reading Gore Vidal's book &quot;Creation&quot; on this topic.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; The battle of Thermopylae and the war between Greece and Persia have
&gt;&gt;&gt; an almost mythological status in western civilization. However, there
&gt;&gt;&gt; are some nasty aspects to this popularity. A discussion of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank Miller, 300 (1998; comic book)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Zack Snyder, 300 (2006; movie)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom Holland, Persian Fire (2005; history book)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Conclusion: The works discussed have shown that the study of ancient
&gt;&gt;&gt; history in the twenty-first century has two serious defects:
&gt;&gt;&gt; historians are still suffering from their nineteenth-century
&gt;&gt;&gt; blindness
&gt;&gt;&gt; towards the Near East, and know less about theory and method than
&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; used to do in the early 1900's.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fighting for freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;.... Miller runs into trouble when he offers an interpretation of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; story. The Spartans, he says, sacrificed themselves for the freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Greece. And not only for Greek liberty: the Spartans were &quot;the
&gt;&gt;&gt; world's
&gt;&gt;&gt; one hope for reason and justice&quot;, and the Persians were living &quot;in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; sea of mysticism and tyranny&quot;. Although Thermopylae was a defeat, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; showed the world what free men are capable of, inspired the other
&gt;&gt;&gt; Greeks, and therefore saved Greek culture and all of western
&gt;&gt;&gt; civilization.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Miller's reading of Thermopylae and the Greco-Persian wars is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; unique. It can also be found in Persian Fire, a book by the British
&gt;&gt;&gt; historian Tom Holland, published in 2006. It is a good read, if you
&gt;&gt;&gt; can ignore exuberant lines like &quot;As the storm clouds of seeming
&gt;&gt;&gt; Persian invincibility loomed ever darker over Ionia, so strange
&gt;&gt;&gt; shadows from the past returned to haunt Athens, too&quot;. In his
&gt;&gt;&gt; introduction, Holland states that democracy, rationalism, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; philosophy of Plato would not have existed if the Persians had not
&gt;&gt;&gt; been expelled from Europe. The book is completely different from
&gt;&gt;&gt; Miller's comic book, but in one respect they are similar: Herodotus'
&gt;&gt;&gt; story about self-sacrifice has become the foundation myth of western
&gt;&gt;&gt; civilization.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.livius.org/opinion/opinion0003.html

&gt;&gt; Odd. I thought the Spartans ran what amounted to an early version of a
&gt;&gt; Nazi police state based on slavery and the inequality of man. To the best
&gt;&gt; of my knowledge they had a king at the time and didn't give a rat's er
&gt;&gt; tail about democracy or anybody's freedom other than their own.

&gt;&gt; Some of the best fighting men around at the time though and willing to
&gt;&gt; fight and die for their nation and their right to live the way they
&gt;&gt; wanted even if that would make most moderns puke.

&gt; You are talking complete and utter crap.

&gt; First of all they were free, secondly they and their king shared the same
&gt; line of decent from Herakles and he ate with them in the same dining halls
&gt; and lived in the same kind of ordinary house that they lived in and
&gt; thirdly you have no idea what a police state is. Everyone in Sparta lived
&gt; communally and there were no informants informing on their neighbours like
&gt; there were in Athens during the Peloponnesian War. The system they had was
&gt; the same as the Feudal system in English in the middle ages where the
&gt; Spartans were the equivalent to the Normans and the Helots were equivalent
&gt; to the Saxons who were each allowed their own land and had to give up a
&gt; percentage of their produce to the state, only the Helots were not
&gt; expected to fight.
">

I did not suggest that the Spartans were not free. Any claim that I did is
based on your view of reality which is pretty warped.

That is as free as things get in Kingdom that is a military police state.
The Spartan men where the military running the police state so they were
most likely able to do about what the wanted as long as they didn't cross
the system.

If you are claiming the then King of Sparta ate with Heracles, which is what
you said, you must have started huffing and now have major brain damage. If
not what the bleep does he have to do with the case under discussion? About
as much as George Washington has to do with the current problems in the
middle east with the notable exception that we do know George Washington
actually lived. I'm not so sure about the son of Zeus. Are you claiming that
you believe in Zeus?

You expressed views of the status of the Helots is funny. The status of the
Saxons under the Normans sucked! None of them were allowed to have any
significant status or had any rights that they could count on being
respected. To say that the Helots were in similar sorry straits only
underlines my point in red.

True. I also watched some material on the tube last night and I'm not sure
that wicker shields like those used by the Persians are any sort of joke.
They showed one with a leather skin stopping an arrow fired from a very
powerful compound bow at point blank range. I believe it had a draw weight
of 175 pounds. I'd like to know more about the Persian arms and armor used
at this battle.

Not sure how the Greeks managed to do as well as they did in the early
fighting. All I can say is the Greeks must have been seriously lethal
fighters.

&gt;&gt; They did at the end.

&gt; At the end? It was all that there was left of the Spartans (surely they
&gt; lost some numbers of men during the two days of combat), plus the rest of
&gt; the Lacaedamonians, including the Helots, who were liberated, plus the
&gt; Thespians.

&gt; So no, they did not fight alone even till the end. The liberation of the
&gt; Helots at the beginning of the final day, that is what gives the fighting
&gt; Spartans a different meaning towards a &quot;freedom for all&quot;, thus not a
&gt; &quot;totalitarian military nazi-state&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The very fact that the Helots were never expected to fight
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; demonstrates a crucial difference with English feudalism.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; This was based on obligation to the land-holding knights, up to and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; including military service.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Being a nation-state, it was also a far more complex social formation,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; with a monarchy, church and barons controlling various levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; freemen, cottars and villeins.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Sparta was more like a tribal society with a military ruling caste,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the Spartiates, who never worked the land or engaged in trade.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; These never numbered more than 10,000 and probably declined to 1200 by
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 340 B.C.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The subjugated Lacedaemonians were composed of Perioeci, who were

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Lacedaemonians were neither Perioeci (neighbours) or Helots
&gt;&gt;&gt; (subjugated
&gt;&gt;&gt; peoples).

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; tradesmen and the mass of the Helot peasantry beneath them.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The Spartiates lived in mortal fear of a Helot revolt and their
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; defection to other city states, hence the Krypteia, which meant living
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; in a &quot;police state&quot; for the Helots.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Twaddle. You clearly do not know what a police state actual is. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; Krypteia
&gt;&gt;&gt; were sent out to killed Helots after war was declared on the by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ephors.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Since there is no reference to informants this is not a police state.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Athens
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the time of the Peloponnesian War was the police state.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; This military caste is is portrayed in the film 300 as the defender of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Athenian democracy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Actually, they always intervened on the side of Oligarchy against
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Democracy in the Peloponesian Wars.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Spartans intervened on the side of the people against the tyrants of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Athens.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Spartan equality was the democracy of the &quot;barracks&quot;  Any differences
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; within the polis had to be supressed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It was a traditionalist, ossified militaristic society, culturally far
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; behind Athens.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Things only changed after Sparta lost Messenia and was deprived of its
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; helots.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Spartans were unfree.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rubbish. The Spartans were completly free.

&gt;&gt; &quot;Police State&quot; was placed in speech marks because the term is clearly
&gt;&gt; an anachronism when discussing any Ancient Society.
&gt;&gt; It was introduced by you, not me.

&gt; NO IT WAS NOT.

&gt;&gt; Why exactly the Ephors would need to unleash the Krypteia on the
&gt;&gt; inhabitants of their own state on a regular basis raises some
&gt;&gt; questions about its nature, though.
&gt;&gt; The Spartiate were certainly free to kill Helots with impunity.

&gt;&gt; The disagreement revolves around your definition of Spartan, which is
&gt;&gt; an elitist one.
&gt;&gt; Since I define Spartan to mean the inhabitants of Laconia, there's no
&gt;&gt; possibility of agreement.

&gt; Well they are not.

&gt; [Stra. 8.5.4] According to Ephorus: Eurysthenes and Procles, the
&gt; Heracleidae, took possession of Laconia, divided the country into six
&gt; parts, and founded cities; now one of the divisions, Amyclae, they
&gt; selected and gave to the man who had betrayed Laconia to them and who had
&gt; persuaded the ruler who was in possession of it to accept their terms and
&gt; emigrate with the Achaeans to Ionia; Sparta they designated as a royal
&gt; residence for themselves; to the other divisions they sent kings, and
&gt; because of the sparsity of the population gave them permission to receive
&gt; as fellow inhabitants any strangers who wished the privilege; and they
&gt; used Las as a naval station because of its good harbor, and Aegys as a
&gt; base of operations against their enemies (for its territory bordered on
&gt; those of the surrounding peoples) and Pharis as a treasury, because it
&gt; afforded security against outsiders; . . . but though the neighboring
&gt; peoples, one and all, were subject to the Spartiatae, still they had equal
&gt; rights, sharing both in the rights of citizenship and in the offices of
&gt; state, and they were called Helots;

&gt; Actually they were not called Helots but Perioeci. The Helots were
&gt; Achaeans and their name was applied to all slaves after the First
&gt; Messenian War.

&gt; [Paus. 3.2.3] This Labotas Herodotus, in his history of Croesus, says was
&gt; in his childhood the ward of Lycurgus the lawgiver, but he calls him
&gt; Leobotes and not Labotas. It was then that the Lacedaemonians first
&gt; resolved to make war upon the Argives, bringing as charges against them
&gt; that they were annexing the Cynurian territory which they themselves had
&gt; captured, and were causing revolts among their subjects the Perioeci
&gt; (Dwellers around ). On this occasion neither of the belligerents,
&gt; according to the account, achieved anything worthy of mention.

&gt; [Plutarch, Lycurgus] Sous (1062-1028 BC) certainly was the most renowned
&gt; of all Lycurgus ancestors, under whose conduct the Spartans made slaves of
&gt; the Helots, and added to their dominions, by conquest, a good part of
&gt; Arcadia.

&gt; [Strabo. 8.5.4] ... but Agis (1061-1030 BC), the son of Eurysthenes,
&gt; deprived [the neighboring peoples] of the equality of rights and ordered
&gt; them to pay tribute to Sparta; now all obeyed except the Heleians, the
&gt; occupants of Helus, who, because they revolted, were forcibly reduced in a
&gt; war, and were condemned to slavery, with the express reservation that no
&gt; slaveholder should be permitted either to set them free or to sell them
&gt; outside the borders of the country; and this war was called the War
&gt; against the Helots. One may almost say that it was Agis and his associates
&gt; who introduced the whole system of Helot-slavery that persisted until the
&gt; supremacy of the Romans; for the Lacedaemonians held the Helots as state
&gt; slaves in a way, having assigned to them certain settlements to live in
&gt; and special services to perform.

&gt; [Paus. 3.2.7] After the death of Teleclus, Alcamenes (785-747 BC) his son
&gt; succeeded to the throne, and the Lacedaemonians sent to Crete Charmidas
&gt; the son of Euthys, who was a distinguished Spartan, to put down the civil
&gt; strife among the Cretans, to persuade them to abandon the weak, inland
&gt; towns, and to help them to people instead those that were conveniently
&gt; situated for the coasting voyage.

&gt; [Pausanius. 3.2.7] [The Spartans] also laid waste Helos, an Achaean town
&gt; on the coast, and won a battle against the Argives who came to give aid to
&gt; the Helots.

&gt; [Strabo. 6.3.2] In speaking of the founding of Taras, Antiochus says:
&gt; After the Messenian war (748-738 BC) broke out, those of the
&gt; Lacedaemonians who did not take part in the expedition were adjudged
&gt; slaves and were named Helots, and all children who were born in the time
&gt; of the expedition were called Partheniae and judicially deprived of the
&gt; rights of citizenship, but they would not tolerate this, and since they
&gt; were numerous formed a plot against the free citizens; and when the latter
&gt; learned of the plot they sent secretly certain men who, through a pretence
&gt; of friendship, were to report what manner of plot it was; among these was
&gt; Phalanthus, who was reputed to be their champion, but he was not pleased,
&gt; in general, with those who had been named to take part in the council. It
&gt; was agreed, however, that the attack should be made at the Hyacinthian
&gt; festival in the Amyclaeum when the games were being celebrated, at the
&gt; moment when Phalanthus should put on his leather cap (the free citizens
&gt; were recognizable by their hair ); but when Phalanthus and his men had
&gt; secretly reported the agreement, and when the games were in progress, the
&gt; herald came forward and forbade Phalanthus to put on a leather cap; and
&gt; when the plotters perceived that the plot had been revealed, some of them
&gt; began to run away and others to beg for mercy; but they were bidden to be
&gt; of good cheer and were given over to custody; Phalanthus, however, was
&gt; sent to the temple of the god to consult with reference to founding a
&gt; colony; and the god responded, &quot;I give to thee Satyrium, both to take up
&gt; thine abode in the rich land of Taras and to become a bane to the
&gt; Iapygians.&quot; Accordingly, the Partheniae went thither with Phalanthus, and
&gt; they were welcomed by both the barbarians and the Cretans who had
&gt; previously taken possession of the place. These latter, it is said, are
&gt; the people who sailed with Minos to Sicily, and, after his death, which
&gt; occurred at the home of Cocalus in Camici, set sail from Sicily; but on
&gt; the voyage back they were driven out of their course to Taras, although
&gt; later some of them went afoot around the Adrias as far as Macedonia and
&gt; were called Bottiaeans. But all the people as far as Daunia, it is said,
&gt; were called Iapyges, after Iapyx, who is said to have been the son of
&gt; Daedalus by a Cretan woman and to have been the leader of the Cretans. The
&gt; city of Taras, however, was named after some hero.

&gt;&gt; Anyone who's interested should read G.E.M de St Croix's book &quot;The
&gt;&gt; class struggle in the ancient Greek world&quot;.

&gt; Anyone who is interested should not read G.E.M de St Croix's book &quot;The
&gt; class struggle in the ancient Greek world&quot;. They should be reading
&gt; Pausanius Description of Greece and Plutarch's biography of Lycurgus and
&gt; Herodotus and Apollodorus and Strabo.

In what way does reduced to a slave who can not be sold outside the country
not match up with a modern police state? These people had no rights that
were respected, not even the right to life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Herodotus
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Apollodorus and Strabo

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I would never tell anyone NOT to read someone.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; By all means read the classical historians too, although they often
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had their own political agendas.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Prove it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; My research confirms that my original points were correct.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The precise relationship between the Spartiates, Perioeci and Helots
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; in the early years of the Dorian settlement of Greece are unclear.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. It is perfectly clear.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Later Historians such as Pausanias and Strabo aren't reliable and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; there is some conflict with archaeology in their descriptions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. How do you know they are not reliable. Have you got a
&gt;&gt;&gt; time
&gt;&gt;&gt; machine?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not even using the accepted chronology of the period but are
&gt;&gt;&gt; using
&gt;&gt;&gt; one that was made up by Isaac Newton which is TOTALLY WRONG. When you
&gt;&gt;&gt; use
&gt;&gt;&gt; the correct chronology as given by Jerome, Eusebius and Diodorus the
&gt;&gt;&gt; archaeology fits in precisely with the historical records.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Herodotus and Thucydides are better guides, but were affected by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; position they took in the struggles between the Greek City states and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; between the Greeks and Persians.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rubbish. They are not affected by anything. Both state catatonically
&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; they are neutral.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Whatever it's origin, the Messenian identity was a shifting one,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; promoted by Athens as a counterweight to the Spartan oligarchy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. The first and second Messenian wars had nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt; whatsoever
&gt;&gt;&gt; to do with Athens. They were the result of the Messenians killing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Spartan king Telecles after he was planning to kill the Messenians king
&gt;&gt;&gt; Phintas and involved the Argives and Arcadians who had their own
&gt;&gt;&gt; disputes
&gt;&gt;&gt; with Sparta. The iron age Messenian kingdom was set up by Cresphontes
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; brother of Temenus the first Heraklid king of Argos and the uncle of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Euresthenes and Precles the kings of Sparta, as an independent kingdom.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It
&gt;&gt;&gt; was conquered by the Spartans in 738 BC.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However Athens was also fearful of inciting a more general rebellion
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; of the dispossessed peasantry and hence, it failed in the struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; against the Oligarchic states.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Since your position is one of extremist Greek National Chauvinism and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; you are incapable of doing much more than cutting and pasting, it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; unlikely you'll be able to follow any of the arguments.

&gt;&gt;&gt; More like your position lacks any historical cites and relies on
&gt;&gt;&gt; worthless
&gt;&gt;&gt; popular revisionist opinions of pseudo-historians that have no concept
&gt;&gt;&gt; whatsoever of the chronology of the period therefore you are incapable
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; presenting any argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Here's a reading list for those who can:

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; G.E.M de St Croix's book &quot;The class struggle in the ancient Greek
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; world.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not actual history but popular sociology. In other words revisionism.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Friedrich Engels: &quot;The Origin of the Family&quot; pps 66-70

&gt;&gt;&gt; More popular sociology.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thomas J.Figueira &quot;The Evolution of the Mesenian Identity&quot; in &quot;Sparta

&gt;&gt;&gt; Popular sociology again followed by more popular sociology.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; New Perpectives&quot; ed. Hodkinson &amp; Powell
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ellen Millender &quot;Athenian Ideology and the Empowerment of Spartan
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Women&quot; ibid

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not one of this is a primary or even a secondary or tertiary historical
&gt;&gt;&gt; source. Quote directly from historical texts not from peoples personal
&gt;&gt;&gt; opinions which are based on unfounded archaeological speculations and
&gt;&gt;&gt; misguided socio-political revisionism.- Hide quoted text -

&gt;&gt;&gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt;&gt; It's really pointless to continue this because you don't understand
&gt;&gt; the arguments at all.

&gt; No. That is your problem. How about you make a claim about the Spartans
&gt; and then refer to a specific historical cite from an ancient historical
&gt; text which back up that claim like I have done, and then you might have
&gt; some credibility here.

&gt;&gt; All you do is fall back on the literal truth of your Ancient Greek
&gt;&gt; sources, because you think anything Greek, whether it's religion,
&gt;&gt; history, chronology - must be right.

&gt; And all that you fall back on is unsubstantiated revisionism because you
&gt; can't bring yourself to accept that ancient Greek society was more
&gt; advanced than yours until the enlightenment.

Actually I don't think he cares. He might even agree that the Greeks were
more advanced or at least some may have been. The problem is you can post
something and if it doesn't support your bias you act like you never even
read it. You also aren't interested in anything that might upset your
religion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 300 is more or less historically accurate unlike Troy which was not and
&gt; Alexander which rewrote the entire Indian campaign, but you can't stand

&gt;&gt; That's a form of dogma for people who want absolute certainty.

It is strange that you end up calling everybody you converse with one of
those. I'm not going to say takes one to know one because I think he's able
to carry on a rational discussion about Greeks and to you Greek history and
myth are some sort of holy religion with sacred texts and profane texts
being any who disagree though many time you quote authors who in fact
bluntly refute your claims.

The Helots aren't living in a condition equal to police state you say then
post authors who call them slaves who can't be sold outside the state and
that they were spied on and treated most ruthlessly. Blah!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The brilliant internet classics site, Livius.Org has this excellent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; piece relating to &quot;300&quot; and &quot;Persian Fire&quot; by Tom Holland.  (I'd also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recommend reading Gore Vidal's book &quot;Creation&quot; on this topic.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The battle of Thermopylae and the war between Greece and Persia have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an almost mythological status in western civilization. However, there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are some nasty aspects to this popularity. A discussion of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank Miller, 300 (1998; comic book)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Zack Snyder, 300 (2006; movie)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom Holland, Persian Fire (2005; history book)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Conclusion: The works discussed have shown that the study of ancient
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; history in the twenty-first century has two serious defects:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; historians are still suffering from their nineteenth-century
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blindness
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; towards the Near East, and know less about theory and method than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used to do in the early 1900's.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fighting for freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;.... Miller runs into trouble when he offers an interpretation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; story. The Spartans, he says, sacrificed themselves for the freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greece. And not only for Greek liberty: the Spartans were &quot;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one hope for reason and justice&quot;, and the Persians were living &quot;in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sea of mysticism and tyranny&quot;. Although Thermopylae was a defeat, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; showed the world what free men are capable of, inspired the other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greeks, and therefore saved Greek culture and all of western
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; civilization.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Miller's reading of Thermopylae and the Greco-Persian wars is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unique. It can also be found in Persian Fire, a book by the British
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; historian Tom Holland, published in 2006. It is a good read, if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can ignore exuberant lines like &quot;As the storm clouds of seeming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Persian invincibility loomed ever darker over Ionia, so strange
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shadows from the past returned to haunt Athens, too&quot;. In his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduction, Holland states that democracy, rationalism, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; philosophy of Plato would not have existed if the Persians had not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been expelled from Europe. The book is completely different from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Miller's comic book, but in one respect they are similar: Herodotus'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; story about self-sacrifice has become the foundation myth of western
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; civilization.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.livius.org/opinion/opinion0003.html

&gt;&gt;&gt; Odd. I thought the Spartans ran what amounted to an early version of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nazi police state based on slavery and the inequality of man. To the
&gt;&gt;&gt; best of my knowledge they had a king at the time and didn't give a rat's
&gt;&gt;&gt; er tail about democracy or anybody's freedom other than their own.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of the best fighting men around at the time though and willing to
&gt;&gt;&gt; fight and die for their nation and their right to live the way they
&gt;&gt;&gt; wanted even if that would make most moderns puke.

&gt;&gt; You are talking complete and utter crap.

&gt;&gt; First of all they were free, secondly they and their king shared the same
&gt;&gt; line of decent from Herakles and he ate with them in the same dining
&gt;&gt; halls and lived in the same kind of ordinary house that they lived in and
&gt;&gt; thirdly you have no idea what a police state is. Everyone in Sparta lived
&gt;&gt; communally and there were no informants informing on their neighbours
&gt;&gt; like there were in Athens during the Peloponnesian War. The system they
&gt;&gt; had was the same as the Feudal system in English in the middle ages where
&gt;&gt; the Spartans were the equivalent to the Normans and the Helots were
&gt;&gt; equivalent to the Saxons who were each allowed their own land and had to
&gt;&gt; give up a percentage of their produce to the state, only the Helots were
&gt;&gt; not expected to fight.

&gt; I did not suggest that the Spartans were not free. Any claim that I did is
&gt; based on your view of reality which is pretty warped.

&gt; That is as free as things get in Kingdom that is a military police state.
">

Rubbish. Sparta was not a police state. It was Athens that was a police
state at the time of the Peloponnesian War, specifically the time of the 30
Tyrants and the about half a decade after them. You obviously do not know
what a police state is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Spartan men where the military running the police state so they were

Rubbish. Sparta was run alone feudal lines not police state lines. There
were no spies and informants and indictments and show trials and ostracisms
like there were in Athens.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you are claiming the then King of Sparta ate with Heracles, which is

No you fool. The kings of Sparta ate at the same table as the ordinary
Spartans.

&gt; claiming that you believe in Zeus?

&gt; You expressed views of the status of the Helots is funny. The status of
&gt; the Saxons under the Normans sucked! None of them were allowed to have any
&gt; significant status or had any rights that they could count on being
&gt; respected. To say that the Helots were in similar sorry straits only
&gt; underlines my point in red.

Your point is meaningless since you have no idea what a police state
actually is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The very fact that the Helots were never expected to fight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; demonstrates a crucial difference with English feudalism.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; This was based on obligation to the land-holding knights, up to and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; including military service.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Being a nation-state, it was also a far more complex social
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; formation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; with a monarchy, church and barons controlling various levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; freemen, cottars and villeins.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Sparta was more like a tribal society with a military ruling caste,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the Spartiates, who never worked the land or engaged in trade.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; These never numbered more than 10,000 and probably declined to 1200
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 340 B.C.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The subjugated Lacedaemonians were composed of Perioeci, who were

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Lacedaemonians were neither Perioeci (neighbours) or Helots
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (subjugated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peoples).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; tradesmen and the mass of the Helot peasantry beneath them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The Spartiates lived in mortal fear of a Helot revolt and their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; defection to other city states, hence the Krypteia, which meant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; living
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; in a &quot;police state&quot; for the Helots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Twaddle. You clearly do not know what a police state actual is. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Krypteia
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were sent out to killed Helots after war was declared on the by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ephors.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since there is no reference to informants this is not a police state.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Athens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the time of the Peloponnesian War was the police state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; This military caste is is portrayed in the film 300 as the defender
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Athenian democracy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Actually, they always intervened on the side of Oligarchy against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Democracy in the Peloponesian Wars.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Spartans intervened on the side of the people against the tyrants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Athens.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Spartan equality was the democracy of the &quot;barracks&quot;  Any differences
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; within the polis had to be supressed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It was a traditionalist, ossified militaristic society, culturally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; behind Athens.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Things only changed after Sparta lost Messenia and was deprived of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; helots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Spartans were unfree.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rubbish. The Spartans were completly free.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Police State&quot; was placed in speech marks because the term is clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt; an anachronism when discussing any Ancient Society.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It was introduced by you, not me.

&gt;&gt; NO IT WAS NOT.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why exactly the Ephors would need to unleash the Krypteia on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; inhabitants of their own state on a regular basis raises some
&gt;&gt;&gt; questions about its nature, though.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The Spartiate were certainly free to kill Helots with impunity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The disagreement revolves around your definition of Spartan, which is
&gt;&gt;&gt; an elitist one.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Since I define Spartan to mean the inhabitants of Laconia, there's no
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility of agreement.

&gt;&gt; Well they are not.

&gt;&gt; [Stra. 8.5.4] According to Ephorus: Eurysthenes and Procles, the
&gt;&gt; Heracleidae, took possession of Laconia, divided the country into six
&gt;&gt; parts, and founded cities; now one of the divisions, Amyclae, they
&gt;&gt; selected and gave to the man who had betrayed Laconia to them and who had
&gt;&gt; persuaded the ruler who was in possession of it to accept their terms and
&gt;&gt; emigrate with the Achaeans to Ionia; Sparta they designated as a royal
&gt;&gt; residence for themselves; to the other divisions they sent kings, and
&gt;&gt; because of the sparsity of the population gave them permission to receive
&gt;&gt; as fellow inhabitants any strangers who wished the privilege; and they
&gt;&gt; used Las as a naval station because of its good harbor, and Aegys as a
&gt;&gt; base of operations against their enemies (for its territory bordered on
&gt;&gt; those of the surrounding peoples) and Pharis as a treasury, because it
&gt;&gt; afforded security against outsiders; . . . but though the neighboring
&gt;&gt; peoples, one and all, were subject to the Spartiatae, still they had
&gt;&gt; equal rights, sharing both in the rights of citizenship and in the
&gt;&gt; offices of state, and they were called Helots;

&gt;&gt; Actually they were not called Helots but Perioeci. The Helots were
&gt;&gt; Achaeans and their name was applied to all slaves after the First
&gt;&gt; Messenian War.

&gt;&gt; [Paus. 3.2.3] This Labotas Herodotus, in his history of Croesus, says was
&gt;&gt; in his childhood the ward of Lycurgus the lawgiver, but he calls him
&gt;&gt; Leobotes and not Labotas. It was then that the Lacedaemonians first
&gt;&gt; resolved to make war upon the Argives, bringing as charges against them
&gt;&gt; that they were annexing the Cynurian territory which they themselves had
&gt;&gt; captured, and were causing revolts among their subjects the Perioeci
&gt;&gt; (Dwellers around ). On this occasion neither of the belligerents,
&gt;&gt; according to the account, achieved anything worthy of mention.

&gt;&gt; [Plutarch, Lycurgus] Sous (1062-1028 BC) certainly was the most renowned
&gt;&gt; of all Lycurgus ancestors, under whose conduct the Spartans made slaves
&gt;&gt; of the Helots, and added to their dominions, by conquest, a good part of
&gt;&gt; Arcadia.

&gt;&gt; [Strabo. 8.5.4] ... but Agis (1061-1030 BC), the son of Eurysthenes,
&gt;&gt; deprived [the neighboring peoples] of the equality of rights and ordered
&gt;&gt; them to pay tribute to Sparta; now all obeyed except the Heleians, the
&gt;&gt; occupants of Helus, who, because they revolted, were forcibly reduced in
&gt;&gt; a war, and were condemned to slavery, with the express reservation that
&gt;&gt; no slaveholder should be permitted either to set them free or to sell
&gt;&gt; them outside the borders of the country; and this war was called the War
&gt;&gt; against the Helots. One may almost say that it was Agis and his
&gt;&gt; associates who introduced the whole system of Helot-slavery that
&gt;&gt; persisted until the supremacy of the Romans; for the Lacedaemonians held
&gt;&gt; the Helots as state slaves in a way, having assigned to them certain
&gt;&gt; settlements to live in and special services to perform.

&gt;&gt; [Paus. 3.2.7] After the death of Teleclus, Alcamenes (785-747 BC) his son
&gt;&gt; succeeded to the throne, and the Lacedaemonians sent to Crete Charmidas
&gt;&gt; the son of Euthys, who was a distinguished Spartan, to put down the civil
&gt;&gt; strife among the Cretans, to persuade them to abandon the weak, inland
&gt;&gt; towns, and to help them to people instead those that were conveniently
&gt;&gt; situated for the coasting voyage.

&gt;&gt; [Pausanius. 3.2.7] [The Spartans] also laid waste Helos, an Achaean town
&gt;&gt; on the coast, and won a battle against the Argives who came to give aid
&gt;&gt; to the Helots.

&gt;&gt; [Strabo. 6.3.2] In speaking of the founding of Taras, Antiochus says:
&gt;&gt; After the Messenian war (748-738 BC) broke out, those of the
&gt;&gt; Lacedaemonians who did not take part in the expedition were adjudged
&gt;&gt; slaves and were named Helots, and all children who were born in the time
&gt;&gt; of the expedition were called Partheniae and judicially deprived of the
&gt;&gt; rights of citizenship, but they would not tolerate this, and since they
&gt;&gt; were numerous formed a plot against the free citizens; and when the
&gt;&gt; latter learned of the plot they sent secretly certain men who, through a
&gt;&gt; pretence of friendship, were to report what manner of plot it was; among
&gt;&gt; these was Phalanthus, who was reputed to be their champion, but he was
&gt;&gt; not pleased, in general, with those who had been named to take part in
&gt;&gt; the council. It was agreed, however, that the attack should be made at
&gt;&gt; the Hyacinthian festival in the Amyclaeum when the games were being
&gt;&gt; celebrated, at the moment when Phalanthus should put on his leather cap
&gt;&gt; (the free citizens were recognizable by their hair ); but when Phalanthus
&gt;&gt; and his men had secretly reported the agreement, and when the games were
&gt;&gt; in progress, the herald came forward and forbade Phalanthus to put on a
&gt;&gt; leather cap; and when the plotters perceived that the plot had been
&gt;&gt; revealed, some of them began to run away and others to beg for mercy; but
&gt;&gt; they were bidden to be of good cheer and were given over to custody;
&gt;&gt; Phalanthus, however, was sent to the temple of the god to consult with
&gt;&gt; reference to founding a colony; and the god responded, &quot;I give to thee
&gt;&gt; Satyrium, both to take up thine abode in the rich land of Taras and to
&gt;&gt; become a bane to the Iapygians.&quot; Accordingly, the Partheniae went thither
&gt;&gt; with Phalanthus, and they were welcomed by both the barbarians and the
&gt;&gt; Cretans who had previously taken possession of the place. These latter,
&gt;&gt; it is said, are the people who sailed with Minos to Sicily, and, after
&gt;&gt; his death, which occurred at the home of Cocalus in Camici, set sail from
&gt;&gt; Sicily; but on the voyage back they were driven out of their course to
&gt;&gt; Taras, although later some of them went afoot around the Adrias as far as
&gt;&gt; Macedonia and were called Bottiaeans. But all the people as far as
&gt;&gt; Daunia, it is said, were called Iapyges, after Iapyx, who is said to have
&gt;&gt; been the son of Daedalus by a Cretan woman and to have been the leader of
&gt;&gt; the Cretans. The city of Taras, however, was named after some hero.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone who's interested should read G.E.M de St Croix's book &quot;The
&gt;&gt;&gt; class struggle in the ancient Greek world&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Anyone who is interested should not read G.E.M de St Croix's book &quot;The

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Apollodorus and Strabo

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I would never tell anyone NOT to read someone.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; By all means read the classical historians too, although they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; often
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had their own political agendas.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Prove it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; My research confirms that my original points were correct.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The precise relationship between the Spartiates, Perioeci and Helots
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; in the early years of the Dorian settlement of Greece are unclear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. It is perfectly clear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Later Historians such as Pausanias and Strabo aren't reliable and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; there is some conflict with archaeology in their descriptions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. How do you know they are not reliable. Have you got a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; machine?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not even using the accepted chronology of the period but are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one that was made up by Isaac Newton which is TOTALLY WRONG. When you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the correct chronology as given by Jerome, Eusebius and Diodorus the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; archaeology fits in precisely with the historical records.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Herodotus and Thucydides are better guides, but were affected by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; position they took in the struggles between the Greek City states and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; between the Greeks and Persians.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rubbish. They are not affected by anything. Both state catatonically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are neutral.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Whatever it's origin, the Messenian identity was a shifting one,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; promoted by Athens as a counterweight to the Spartan oligarchy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. The first and second Messenian wars had nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatsoever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do with Athens. They were the result of the Messenians killing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Spartan king Telecles after he was planning to kill the Messenians king
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phintas and involved the Argives and Arcadians who had their own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disputes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with Sparta. The iron age Messenian kingdom was set up by Cresphontes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brother of Temenus the first Heraklid king of Argos and the uncle of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Euresthenes and Precles the kings of Sparta, as an independent kingdom.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was conquered by the Spartans in 738 BC.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However Athens was also fearful of inciting a more general rebellion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; of the dispossessed peasantry and hence, it failed in the struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; against the Oligarchic states.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Since your position is one of extremist Greek National Chauvinism and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; you are incapable of doing much more than cutting and pasting, it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; unlikely you'll be able to follow any of the arguments.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More like your position lacks any historical cites and relies on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worthless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; popular revisionist opinions of pseudo-historians that have no concept
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatsoever of the chronology of the period therefore you are incapable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presenting any argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Here's a reading list for those who can:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; G.E.M de St Croix's book &quot;The class struggle in the ancient Greek
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; world.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not actual history but popular sociology. In other words revisionism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Friedrich Engels: &quot;The Origin of the Family&quot; pps 66-70

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More popular sociology.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thomas J.Figueira &quot;The Evolution of the Mesenian Identity&quot; in &quot;Sparta

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Popular sociology again followed by more popular sociology.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ellen Millender &quot;Athenian Ideology and the Empowerment of Spartan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Women&quot; ibid

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not one of this is a primary or even a secondary or tertiary historical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; source. Quote directly from historical texts not from peoples personal

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's really pointless to continue this because you don't understand
&gt;&gt;&gt; the arguments at all.

&gt;&gt; No. That is your problem. How about you make a claim about the Spartans
&gt;&gt; and then refer to a specific historical cite from an ancient historical
&gt;&gt; text which back up that claim like I have done, and then you might have
&gt;&gt; some credibility here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; All you do is fall back on the literal truth of your Ancient Greek
&gt;&gt;&gt; sources, because you think anything Greek, whether it's religion,
&gt;&gt;&gt; history, chronology - must be right.

&gt;&gt; And all that you fall back on is unsubstantiated revisionism because you
&gt;&gt; can't bring yourself to accept that ancient Greek society was more
&gt;&gt; advanced than yours until the enlightenment.

&gt; Actually I don't think he cares. He might even agree that the Greeks were
&gt; more advanced or at least some may have been. The problem is you can post
&gt; something and if it doesn't support your bias you act like you never even
&gt; read it. You also aren't interested in anything that might upset your
&gt; religion.

Everything I have posted supports my argument and demolishes your
revisionism.

&gt;&gt; 300 is more or less historically accurate unlike Troy which was not and
&gt;&gt; Alexander which rewrote the entire Indian campaign, but you can't stand
&gt;&gt; that because you can't stand the Greeks holding the high moral ground and
&gt;&gt; what they did being the foundation of European and western civilisation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a form of dogma for people who want absolute certainty.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather like Alexander, you're forever blowing bubbles.

&gt;&gt; You are a fool.

&gt; It is strange that you end up calling everybody you converse with one of
&gt; those. I'm not going to say takes one to know one because I think he's
&gt; able to carry on a rational discussion about Greeks and to you Greek
&gt; history and myth are some sort of holy religion with sacred texts and
&gt; profane texts being any who disagree though many time you quote authors
&gt; who in fact bluntly refute your claims.

&gt; The Helots aren't living in a condition equal to police state you say then
&gt; post authors who call them slaves who can't be sold outside the state and
&gt; that they were spied on and treated most ruthlessly. Blah!
">

The fact that the Helots were not allowed to be sold outside the borders of
their country is a PROHIBITION of slavery. You clearly have no idea what
slavery is just like you have no idea what a police state is. To the ancient
Greeks a Doulos (which is wrongly translated as slave) was a bonded worker
or a paid worker. A bonded worker is what everyone was in the Feudal systems
of the middle ages that served a Norman master. In Sparta the Helots were
allowed to live on their own land on condition that they provide the
Spartans with a share of their produces. They were not slaves by any modern
definition of the word. They were feudal labourers.

The modern definition of a slave on the other hand is something completely
different, being a captive prisoner who was sold to be transported outside
of their own country in order to work on land he had no interest in.
