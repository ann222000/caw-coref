I just had a couple questions about the origin of the beak. I know
that archaeopteryx is commonly cited as a dinosaur/bird transitional
because it has traits that are otherwise unique to birds and theropod
dinosaurs. Is archaeopteryx a theropod? The main reason I ask is that
I just learned about therizinosaurus and beipiaosaurus, two theropod
dinosaurs that had beaks and feathers. How closely do the beaks
resemble bird beaks? Is it close enough to rule out convergent
evolution? If so, does that rule archaeopteryx out as a direct
ancestor to modern birds? The reason I ask the latter question is
that, as far as I can tell, archaeopteryx was not a theropod. So, it
can't be ancestral to the aforementioned beaked theropods because it
doesn't make sense for theropods (like oh, say, velociraptors) to
evolve into something other than theropods (archaeopteryx), and then
back into theropods (therizinosaurus), so archaeopteryx would have to
be a side branch.

For my second question, I was wondering if anyone could shed some
light on the anatomy of a beak, and how it might evolve from a normal
snout. I'm not asking for individual mutations, of course. It's just
that, when I look at the evolution of forelimbs, it seems pretty
straightforward. Bones changed in shape, duplicated perhaps, and
joints got more flexible and dexterous. Just duplications and
modifications of things that are already there. I always picture beaks
as being these hallow bone-like structures with nasal passages, and
all I can really say about it is &quot;Look, there, that snout got hard and
boney.&quot;

A cladist would say &quot;yes&quot;, but then a cladist would say that *all*
birds are theropods.

Beaks seem to have arisen several times in dinosaurs. For instance,
Triceratops had a beak.

Beaks are just a covering of keratin over existing bone. See

Yes, but so are all birds. That may not be the question you really
wanted to ask.

We can't tell. The beaks themselves are not preserved, only the bones
underneath.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

We can fairly well tell that they are convergent, actually, based on the
distribution of other characters.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No. Archaeopteryx probably had a beak too, for one thing. An animal can
have teeth and a beak at the same time, expecially if it's just the
front teeth that are missing. But Archaeopteryx is probably not a direct
ancestor of modern birds.

Again, all the animals you mention here, including living birds, are
theropods. Nothing with a theropod ancestor can ever be a non-theropod.
That's the way cladistic classification works: once a fish, always a fish.

Not bony -- keratinous. The stuff that beaks are made of is the same
stuff that fingernails are made of. Or scales. Or the top layer of your
skin. All that's required is that the skin around the mouth become more
heavilly keratinized, i.e. have more keratin deposited in its upper layers.

I must admit that I find that doubtful. None of the specimens have
been found with one, yet virtually all of them have been found with
some traces of feathers, which are made of the same material. Also, at
least one has been found with its horny claws intact.

On the other hand, if I recall correctly, Wellnhofer believes that
Archaeopteryx had a beak too, so you're in good company.

There are reasons for suspecting so. And taphonomy is full of odd
effects. Though I haven't made an exhaustive search, I'm not aware of
any preserved horny beaks in any species, including those in which they
must have been present, and including those with preserved feathers.
What do you know about this? I see by a google search that there are a
couple of Confuciusornis (out of hundreds known) with some preservation.
I have to presume from this that feather preservation is more likely
than beak preservation.

Its been probbaly about 8 years since I posted to Usenet - and I've
decided I hate Google Groups so far... I should just go back to paying
for a subscription.  Thought I'd toss in a thought here.

There are plenty of instances of duplication of bones, for a variety
of reasons.  I can speak most for human development (I'm a
pediatrician) and it's been a while since my evolution classes, but a
couple of examples would be the spine, ribs and fingers all developed
as duplications or divisions of already present structures.
Occasionally we see it still today, albiet nearly all disadvantageous
or null - the extra digit or rib (spinal anomalies less frequent).  I
have one patient who has no thumb on one side, and two &quot;thumbs&quot; on the
other! (I have tons with extra digits but he is unique.)  Maybe one
day we will even him out, but for now he doesnt seem to mind.

Apparently Jixiangornis, Shenzhouraptor, and Hongshanornis have all
been found with beaks, and while scanning through my notes I also see
that an example of Ichthyornis *might* have been found with one. In
addition, I came across this:

The side of the rostrum [of _Changchengornis_], at least on its
rostralmost portion (the only one preserving the lateral
surface), is intensely perforated by longitudinal to suboval
nutrient foramina. As in _Confuciusornis sanctus_, the presence
of a rhamphotheca is suggested by such an intense perforation.

Museum of Natural History 242:50.

I don't know if the absence of such foramina would indicate the
absence of a beak or not.

Maybe indicates the abscence of air passeges (nostrils)?  Kids can

No, the holes in question are for blood vessels supplying the cells that
grow the beak (rhamphotheca).
