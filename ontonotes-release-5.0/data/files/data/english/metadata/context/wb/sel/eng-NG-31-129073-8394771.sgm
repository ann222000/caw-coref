Hi

Seems like I am getting attacked from these ip's
59.124.57.147
61.180.85.226
155.230.106.163
202.107.245.4
202.188.161.66
210.164.31.91
212.210.63.18
219.149.182.145
219.94.132.52

any one else seeing any new activity ?  I currently have rate limiting on ssh
attempts so not to bothered (it also key only)

I just moved my ssh port to a non-standard one to never see or hear of such
attacks ever.

Our server at home regularly gets hammered, with my twice-daily logcheck
digest informing me of several unique IPs that have failed logins.

A few days ago, I myself noticed an increase of the activity, so I
installed DenyHosts[1], a Python daemon that monitors the auth.log for
such failed logins via SSH, and automatically adds the IPs to
/etc/hosts.deny. Might be worth trying out.

But then again, if you have key-only authentication, it's probably not
worth it for you.

used to have my own script that looked through log and placed a iptables DROP
command for that ip address, ran on an hourly cron, but I moved my firewall to
openwrt and there isn't really anything on the firewall box.  plus I did not
have all the tool there to manage file process.

Yeah also have iptables recent and limit to 4 per hour.  Just interesting to
see a lot more attacks

I prefer to use something like denyhosts to simply block the offending ip's
as moving the port seems somewhat to be security through obscurity.
But this kind of activity isn't new, by any means. a few months ago when I
setup a SSH server open to the world and watched the logs I had a rush of
them get blocked in the first few days, then it quietened down. All of them
where other compromised windows/linux boxes.

Yes it is. But it keeps your logs much cleaner (so any attempt to hack is
noticed much more easily, not that I've seen any since I moved the port) and
doesn't prevent you from using denyhosts still.

I agree that moving the port is security through obscurity, but obscurity
can compliment good security practises.

For example, a private (login) webpage that doesn't have any referring
links and the url is obscure, is inherently more secure then the (login)
being linked from the homepage.

With that said, you would be foolish to ONLY deploy security through
obscurity.

But lets not beat a dead horse ;)

Regards,

Scott
