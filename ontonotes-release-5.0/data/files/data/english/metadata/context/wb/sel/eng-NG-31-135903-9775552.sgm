I seem to have lost the coloring distinction between title and titlebar
regardless of setting in IB in version 3.0; yuck, or maybe there's some
other way to have the color distinction as in 2.x?

Xcode also shows unified coloring but not my news client Thunderbird, so
I guess it's some setting / preference I have?

Unified toolbar appearance is standard on Leopard for all apps.

Unified toolbars are always on in Leopard.

Thunderbird draws its own toolbar, rather than using the OS's.

That's what I was afraid of. So is it a bug then to continue to have the
option present in IB?

Sad that you can't override this, or can you, short or reinventing the
wheel (which appears to be the drift in Thunderbird)?

No; if you are building an app that runs on older systems, then the checkbox is
still relevant.

time, we make ourselves a conscience
founded on the propriety of the feelings which we see there, by which the
fear of pure souls is removed, since they imagine that it cannot hurt their
purity to love with a love which seems to them so reasonable.

So we depart from the theatre with our heart so filled with all the beauty
and tenderness of love, the soul and the mind so persuaded of its innocence,
that we are quite ready to receive its first impressions, or rather to seek
an opportunity of awakening them in the heart of another, in order that we
may receive the same pleasures and the same sacrifices which we have seen so
well represented in the theatre.

12. Scaramouch, who only thinks of one thing.

The doctor, who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has said
everything, so full is he of the desire of talking.

13. One likes to see the error, the passion of Cleobuline, because she is
unconscious of it. She would be displeasing, if she were not deceived.

14. When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within
oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although one
did not know it. Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel it, for
he has not shown us his own riches, but ours. And thus this benefit renders
him pleasing to us, besides that such community of intellect as we have with
him necessarily inclines the heart to love.

15. Eloquence, which persuades by sweetness, not by authority; as a tyrant,
not as a king.

16. Eloquence is an art of saying things in such a way (1) that those to
whom we speak may listen to them without pain and with pleasure; (2) that
they feel themselves interested, so that self-love leads them more willingly
to reflection upon it.

It consists, then, in a correspondence which we seek to establish between
the head and the heart of those to whom we speak, on the one hand, and, on

it seemed as though her life was going, and that she saw it was
easy with God to take away her life by discoveries of Himself. Soon
after this she went to a private religious meeting, and her mind was
full of a sense and view of the glory of God all the time. When the
exercise was ended, some asked her concerning what she had experienced,
and she began to give an account, but as she was relating it, it revived
such a sense of the same things, that her strength failed, and they were
obliged to take her and lay her upon the bed. Afterwards she was greatly
affected, and rejoiced with these words, Worthy is the Lamb that was
slain! She had several days together a sweet sense of the excellency and
loveliness of Christ in His meekness, which disposed her continually to
be repeating over these words, which were sweet to her, meek and lowly
in heart, meek and lowly in heart. She once expressed herself to one of
her sisters to this purpose, that she had continued whole days and whole
nights, in a constant ravishing view of the glory of God and Christ,
having enjoyed as much as her life could bear. Once, as her brother was
speaking of the dying love of Christ, she told him, she had such a sense
of it, that the mere mentioning of it was ready to overcome her.

Once, when she came to me, she said,-that at such and such a time, she
thought she saw as much of God, and had as much joy and pleasure, as was
possible in this life; and that yet, afterwards, God discovered Himself
far more abundantly. She saw the same things as before, yet more
clearly, and in a far more excellent and delightful manner; and was
filled with a more exceeding sweetness. She likewise gave me such an
account of the sense she once had, from day to day, of the glory of
Christ, and of God, in His various attributes, that it seemed to me she
dwelt for days together in a kind of beatific vision of God; and seemed
to have, as I thought, as immediate an intercourse with
