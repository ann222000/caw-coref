Debunked by Proof: Einstein's Relativity Theory Is Wrong! - PROOF #1

Einstein's Relativity Theory (RT) states that nothing can move
faster than the speed of light (ie. c = 299,792,458 m/s^2).
Everything in RT is limited to this upper speed limit, and termed
as &quot;relativistic addition&quot; etc. The Lorentz-Factor (also called gamma)
does that limiting to c. For example when adding velocities together
the sum never can become &gt;= c.
RT relies solely on this fact and is highly dependent on this.

Below I will prove that this speed limit of RT cannot hold
for every object. It might be true for light (photons) itself,
and some other atomic particles, but this upper speed limit
cannot be valid for everything in the universe, especially not
for macroscopic objects like spaceships or celestial bodies like comets.

Here is an experiment that proves Einstein's Relavity Theory wrong:

We are performing a Free Fall Experiment above a star
that has a mass of about 130 times the mass of our Sun
and a radius of about 150 times the radius of our Sun
(see for example the data of the star system &quot;LBV 1806-20&quot;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBV_1806-20 for more info).

For comparison here are also the data of our Sun
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun ):
Msun = 1.9891E30 kg
Rsun = 6.955E8 m

And here's a hypothetical but a realistic (cf. above) normal star
for our experiment. We define that it has no atmosphere and
that the space around it  is the usual normal vacuum space,
and that there is no other gravitational fields nearby:
M = 258E30 kg     (about 130 Sun masses)
R = 104E9 m     (about 150 Sun radii)

We want to release a test-object to fall on to the surface of this star,
solely by using the gravitational attraction of the star. Ie. the test-object
has neither an own engine nor an initial speed; it will be released from rest.
The test-object is a symmetric and homogenous sphere of steel
or a similar material with some neglectable dimensions:
let's say it has a mass of just 1 kg and a radius of 5 cm.

Some calculations (consult your Classical Mechanics book):
G = 6.67428E-11     (Newton's Gravitational Constant)
c = 299,792,458 m/s     (Speed of light)
g = G*M / R^2 = 1.592052737 m/s^2  (gravitational accelleration at the surface)

We will release the test-object at this distance from the surface of the star:
h = 113E15 m

It will free-fall in less than 11.94 years to the surface:
t = sqrt(2*h / g) = 377E6 seconds, ie. in less than 11.94 earth years
(actually it will take even less time if RT's own &quot;time dilation&quot; is correct :-)

Now comes the surprise: the final velocity of the object will be
v = sqrt(2*g*h) = 599E6 m/s
And guess what this is: this is about twice the speed of light!!!  :-)))

So, Einstein's Relativity Theory is debunked by this proof.  Q.E.D.!

You assumed that Newtonian gravitation (NG) holds EXACTLY in a situation
for which it has never been tested. Not even close. Moreover, our best
theory of gravity, General Relativity, predicts that NG does not come
close to being valid in the situation you describe.

Your &quot;proof&quot; is no such thing, and is worthless.

WHY NOT TAKE THE EASY ROUTE ?

First of all, this &quot; Nothing &quot;, has no mass.

Therefore, theoretically there is no mass to inhibit an increase in
velocity to such a measure.

And so it does appear as though &quot; Nothing &quot; can move faster than the
speed of light (ie. c = 299,792,458 m/s^2).

Just show us what your wrongly called &quot;modern physics&quot; calculates!
Come on! Can it solve this simple problem or can it not?
According to RT how long will it take until the test-body hits

Both cannot be true, one is lying. And it is definitely RT that is wrong!
The situation is glass-clear. Fact is: here you cannot artifically limit
the speed of the free-falling test-body, because otherwise

: Debunked by Proof: Einstein's Relativity Theory Is Wrong! - PROOF #1
:
: Einstein's Relativity Theory (RT) states that nothing can move
: faster than the speed of light (ie. c = 299,792,458 m/s^2).

No, no, no... c = 2AB/(t'A-tA)
http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/figures/img7.gif

How far is from A to A and how long does it take to get there?

Before you can get from A to A, first you must get halfway, which is B.
See Xeno's paradox.

&quot;we establish BY DEFINITION that the time required by light to travel from A
to B equals the time it requires to travel from B to A.&quot;

That means it is because Einstein says so, not that it IS.

Now the time it takes to get from A to B (say 2 seconds) is half the time it
takes to get from A to A (3 seconds), and half of (1+2) is 1, the other half
is 2.
http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/figures/img22.gif

But we MUST forget the other half and only use the first half so that we can
derive
the cuckoo malformations aka the &quot;Lorentz Transformations&quot;.

These should not be confused with the famous Andersen Transformations:

&quot;That is, we can reverse the directions of the frames
which is the same as interchanging the frames,
which - as I have told you a LOT of times,
OBVIOUSLY will lead to the transform:
t = (tau-xi*v/c^2)/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)
x = (xi - v*tau)/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)
or:
tau = (t+xv/c^2)/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)
xi = (x + vt)/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)&quot; -Paul B. Andersen

whereby the faster you go, the longer it takes to get there, v being added
to t.

: &gt; Everything in RT is limited to this upper speed limit, and termed
: &gt; as &quot;relativistic addition&quot; etc. The Lorentz-Factor (also called gamma)
: &gt; does that limiting to c. For example when adding velocities together
: &gt; the sum never can become &gt;= c.
: &gt; RT relies solely on this fact and is highly dependent on this.
: &gt;
: &gt; Below I will prove that this speed limit of RT cannot hold

: &gt; and some other atomic particles, but this upper speed limit
: &gt; cannot be valid for everything in the universe, especially not
: &gt; for macroscopic objects like spaceships or celestial bodies like comets.
: &gt;
: &gt; Here is an experiment that proves Einstein's Relavity Theory wrong:
: &gt;
: &gt; We are performing a Free Fall Experiment above a star
: &gt; that has a mass of about 130 times the mass of our Sun
: &gt; and a radius of about 150 times the radius of our Sun
: &gt; (see for example the data of the star system &quot;LBV
1806-20&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBV_1806-20for more info).
: &gt;
: &gt; For comparison here are also the data of our Sun
: &gt; ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun):
: &gt;  Msun = 1.9891E30 kg
: &gt;  Rsun = 6.955E8 m
: &gt;
: &gt; And here's a hypothetical but a realistic (cf. above) normal star
: &gt; for our experiment. We define that it has no atmosphere and
: &gt; that the space around it  is the usual normal vacuum space,
: &gt; and that there is no other gravitational fields nearby:
: &gt;  M = 258E30 kg     (about 130 Sun masses)
: &gt;  R = 104E9 m     (about 150 Sun radii)
: &gt;
: &gt; We want to release a test-object to fall on to the surface of this star,
: &gt; solely by using the gravitational attraction of the star. Ie. the
test-object
: &gt; has neither an own engine nor an initial speed; it will be released from
rest.
: &gt; The test-object is a symmetric and homogenous sphere of steel
: &gt; or a similar material with some neglectable dimensions:
: &gt; let's say it has a mass of just 1 kg and a radius of 5 cm.
: &gt;
: &gt; Some calculations (consult your Classical Mechanics book):
: &gt;  G = 6.67428E-11     (Newton's Gravitational Constant)
: &gt;  c = 299,792,458 m/s     (Speed of light)
: &gt;  g = G*M / R^2 = 1.592052737 m/s^2  (gravitational accelleration at the
surface)
: &gt;
: &gt; We will release the test-object at this distance from the surface of the
star:
: &gt;  h = 113E15 m
: &gt;
: &gt; It will free-fall in less than 11.94 years to the surface:
: &gt;  t = sqrt(2*h / g) = 377E6 seconds, ie. in less than 11.94 earth years
: &gt; (actually it will take even less time if RT's own &quot;time dilation&quot; is
correct :-)
: &gt;
: &gt; Now comes the surprise: the final velocity of the object will be
: &gt;  v = sqrt(2*g*h) = 599E6 m/s
: &gt; And guess what this is: this is about twice the speed of light!!!  :-)))
: &gt;
: &gt; So, Einstein's Relativity Theory is debunked by this proof.  Q.E.D.!
: &gt;
: &gt; R.I.P. RT, SR, GR, A.E.
:
: Yes, you have conclusively proven that you are a troll, and an
: ignorant one at that.

Yes, you have conclusively proven that you are a fuckhead, and a
particularly stooopid one at that, you nym-shifting cunt.

People, people, people, you have qbit all wrong.  You trade his wacky
science with science, he and Androcles reply with potty mouths, and the
whole thing escalates into a mindless insult-fest!

First, you must learn to appreciate qbit's poetry!  Note the ponderous
manner in which he writes the speed of light to the nearest meter per
second (and pedantically corrects himself when he uses the wrong units).
And how in his thought experiment, when he needs to pose an example of
a large massive body, that he feels the need to cite an actual example
(complete with wikipedia citation!), and then at length compares its
vital statistics with that of our own sun.

I'm sorry, but his writing should be compared with Shakespeare, not
Newton.  The scientific content is so obviously flawed that the only way
he can bate anyone into a discussion is by his ponderous, yet eerily
beautiful style.  You guys think you are so clever in understanding the
flaws in his science, when in reality he has you guys wrapped around his
little finger, arguing with his inanities, and giving him the attention
he so clearly desires.

Please, people, if or when you respond to his posts, try to come up with
imaginative and well crafted insults.  Combat him not with science, but
with poetry.  Really, &quot;stoopid&quot; and &quot;troll&quot; just don't cut it any more -
we have heard these phrases too many times.  And please try to avoid the
potty mouths - it doesn't impress anyone.

Qbit is clearly seeking attention.  Think hard about his psychology.
Try to find his buttons and punch them hard.  See if you can make him
squirm so hard that he puts you into his killfile.  And above all, when
responding to these trolls, enjoy yourself!  If you start to loose sleep
over it, you need to do something else for a while.

Best regards,

Stephen

I'm saying to you that it is just politics and religion
what's going on for more than 100 years with RT.

Classical Mechanics can do it even better than RT and much much easier!
The shortcomings of CM are minimal. For example in CM
one easily can add a &quot;relativistic addition&quot; formula for particles
having a defined maxspeed like Photons (I personally strongly
doubt the correctness of the formula used in RT which for
example for 0.5c+0.5c gives 0.8c; this can't be true).

The goal must of course be the correct mathematical methods,

Possibly that may happen in the future, when something that makes all the

&gt; Einstein's Relativity Theory (RT) states that nothing can move

&gt; Everything in RT is limited to this upper speed limit, and termed
&gt; as &quot;relativistic addition&quot; etc. The Lorentz-Factor (also called gamma)
&gt; does that limiting to c. For example when adding velocities together
&gt; the sum never can become &gt;= c.
&gt; RT relies solely on this fact and is highly dependent on this.

&gt; Below I will prove that this speed limit of RT cannot hold
&gt; for every object. It might be true for light (photons) itself,
&gt; and some other atomic particles, but this upper speed limit
&gt; cannot be valid for everything in the universe, especially not
&gt; for macroscopic objects like spaceships or celestial bodies like comets.

&gt; Here is an experiment that proves Einstein's Relavity Theory wrong:

&gt; We are performing a Free Fall Experiment above a star
&gt; that has a mass of about 130 times the mass of our Sun
&gt; and a radius of about 150 times the radius of our Sun
&gt; (see for example the data of the star system &quot;LBV 1806-20&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBV_1806-20for more info).

&gt; For comparison here are also the data of our Sun
&gt; ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun):
&gt;  Msun = 1.9891E30 kg
&gt;  Rsun = 6.955E8 m

&gt; And here's a hypothetical but a realistic (cf. above) normal star
&gt; for our experiment. We define that it has no atmosphere and
&gt; that the space around it  is the usual normal vacuum space,
&gt; and that there is no other gravitational fields nearby:
&gt;  M = 258E30 kg     (about 130 Sun masses)
&gt;  R = 104E9 m     (about 150 Sun radii)

&gt; We want to release a test-object to fall on to the surface of this star,
&gt; solely by using the gravitational attraction of the star. Ie. the test-object
&gt; has neither an own engine nor an initial speed; it will be released from rest.
&gt; The test-object is a symmetric and homogenous sphere of steel
&gt; or a similar material with some neglectable dimensions:
&gt; let's say it has a mass of just 1 kg and a radius of 5 cm.

&gt; Some calculations (consult your Classical Mechanics book):
&gt;  G = 6.67428E-11     (Newton's Gravitational Constant)
&gt;  c = 299,792,458 m/s     (Speed of light)
&gt;  g = G*M / R^2 = 1.592052737 m/s^2  (gravitational accelleration at the surface)

&gt; We will release the test-object at this distance from the surface of the star:
&gt;  h = 113E15 m

&gt; It will free-fall in less than 11.94 years to the surface:
&gt;  t = sqrt(2*h / g) = 377E6 seconds, ie. in less than 11.94 earth years
&gt; (actually it will take even less time if RT's own &quot;time dilation&quot; is correct :-)

&gt; Now comes the surprise: the final velocity of the object will be
&gt;  v = sqrt(2*g*h) = 599E6 m/s
&gt; And guess what this is: this is about twice the speed of light!!!  :-)))
">

qbit, you have made a simple mistake here by assuming constant g for
the given value of h. You should have integrated the variable
acceleration to compute the impact velocity v.

The maximum impact velocity (same as escape velocity) of a free
falling body under gravitational acceleration is given by
v= sqrt(2*G*M/R)
which in the case of your example comes to about 5.75E+5 m/s.

However to present your point of view, you could take the example of a
Black Hole and show that the impact or approach velocity of a free
falling body under gravitational acceleration of the BH will exceed c.

And: another IMPORTANT FACT (which the RT lobbyists apparently

This is the gravitational acceleration on the 'surface' of this black hole:

And that is 98921693429451.9 times c  !!! :-)
(and, I have spent not a single taxpayer cent to discover this fact! :-)

These numbers prove that RT definitely cannot be correct!

BTW, one really wonders why the RT liars are hiding these facts,
not mentioning them, although it is mainly themself who do

Just calculate it. Supermassive black holes have the strongest gravitational attraction:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole

Another fact about the origin of Black Holes:

&quot;Newton's law of gravitation (1687) layed the groundwork for the
astronomical ideas for centuries to come [1]. First Michell (1783),
then Laplace (1796) predicted the possibility of existence of stars
with a strong enough gravitational field that could retard light and
that is why such stars become invisible [2]. Later, they were called the black holes.
Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts the existence of black holes as well [3].
In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild, the German Astronomer and physicist,
offered a formula (1) for the calculation of the gravitational radius of a black hole,
which originates from classical mechanics [3]. Since then this formula
has been used in the astronomic calculations, and the gravitational radius
is called Schwarzschild's radius [...]&quot;

RT is not the nature. The limit in RT can not hold for everything in the universe.
It might work for light and some similar particles, but not for many other things.
Especially not for massive objects. Nature, ie. the universe, places other limits

maximum possible speed in our universe (see the thread &quot;Axioms of Time, Space,

(Sorry - can't resist replying again.)

This is funny, since in a previous thread you made a special point of
correcting yourself when you first quoted the speed of light in m/s^2!!!

Also, the 15 digits of precision cited in the multiplicative factor is a
bit over the top, isn't it?  Especially when you completely left of the
units of s^-1.

Finally, do you have any data to back up your claims of &quot;endless
research funds?&quot;  I have to say that my impression is that these days,
the relativity and QM boys DON'T get the big bucks.  Instead the big
money goes into life sciences.

# In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild obtained an exact solution to Einstein's
# field equations for the gravitational field outside a non-rotating,
# spherically symmetric body.
#
# But this radius had already been derived by John Michell in 1783
# in the context of Newtonian gravity and the corpuscular  theory of light.
# Michel derived the critical radius by setting the gravitational
# escape velocity v equal to the speed of light c in the Newtonian formula
# v^2 / 2 = G M / r  for the escape velocity v from the surface of a star
# of mass M and radius r.
#
# So, the concept of Black Holes and the Gravitational Radius
# ('Schwarzschild radius') goes back to Michell and the year 1783.

# Einstein himself says that speed of light is variable:
# it depends on the intensity of the gravity field.
#
# http://www.speed-light.info/speed_of_light_12000.htm#_variable_speed_...
# &lt;CITE&gt;
# Recalling the very famous second postulate of Special Relativity declared
# by Einstein (1905): &quot;The velocity c of light in vacuum is the same in all inertial
# frames of reference in all directions and depend neither on the velocity
# of the source nor on the velocity of the observer&quot;.
#
# Einstein's theory of special relativity says that the speed of light in
# vacuum is always the same (at 299,792.458 km/s) but this is true only
# for systems that are inertial, which means not accelerating.
#
# From Newton's second law: if forces exist  implies acceleration exists;
# this means that special relativity is valid only when no forces are acting;
# thus it cannot be used when there is a gravitational force present.
# Albert Einstein himself emphasized this in his paper written in 1917:
# &quot;The results of the special relativity hold only so long as we are able
# to disregard the influence of gravitational fields on the phenomena&quot;.
# Therefore for the results of special relativity to hold the systems should
# not be accelerating (no gravitational forces).
#
# In 1915 (10 years after special relativity) Einstein developed another
# theory called General Relativity that deals with gravitational fields and
# according to this latest theory the velocity of light appears to vary with
# the intensity of the gravitational field. For example, an observer outside
# gravitational fields measures the speed of light locally (in his location)
# at 299792.458 km/s but when he looks towards a black hole he sees
# the speed of light there to be as slow as a few meters/sec.
#
# At the same time an observer freefalling into that black hole (zero-g)
# measures the speed of light locally (in his location) at 299792.458 km/s;
# when he looks towards the black hole he sees the speed of light there
# much slower; when he looks away from the black hole he sees the
# speed of light there much faster. If he tries to resist his freefall into
# that black hole (by firing his rockets for example) he will not measure
# the speed of light locally anymore at 299792.458 km/s; instead
# the stronger the g-force that he feels the faster light appears to him.
# Again when he looks towards the black hole he sees the speed of light
# there much slower; when he looks away from the black hole he sees
# the speed of light there much faster. In any case, freefalling or not,
# he will never see the speed of light outside gravitational fields at 299792.458 km/s.
# Finally, there is no difference between the effects of g-forces
# experienced from these rockets and the effects of g-forces experienced
# when standing on planets, stars... hence an observer standing
# on a black hole measures the speed of light locally (in his location)
# much faster than 299792.458 km/s; when he looks towards
# outside gravitational fields he sees the speed of light there a zillion km/s.
#
# To see the steps how Einstein theorized that the speed of light in a
# gravitational field is actually not a constant, but rather a variable
# depending upon the reference frame of the observer:
# 'On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light',
# Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. Einstein wrote this paper in 1911 in German
# ( http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1911_35_898-... ).
# It predated the full formal development of general relativity by about four years.
# You can find an English translation of this paper in the Dover book
# 'The Principle of Relativity' beginning on page 99; you will find in
# section 3 of that paper Einstein's derivation of the variable speed of light
# in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result is:
#   c' = c * (1 + phi / c^2)
# Where phi is the gravitational potential relative to the point where
# the speed of light c is measured. Simply put:
# Light appears to travel slower  in stronger gravitational fields (near bigger mass).
# [...]
# In conclusion, the velocity of light in a gravitational field is not a constant,
# but rather a variable depending upon the reference frame of the observer;
# what one observer sees as true another observer sees as false.
# The only observers that can actually agree that the speed of light
# outside gravitational fields is 299792.458 km/s are those who are
# themselves outside gravitational fields.
# &lt;/CITE&gt;
#
# For me this interpretation of the speed of the light makes very much sense.
# In gravity fields, ie. in accellerated frames, light and time slows down,
# oscillators oscillate slower, organisms age slower, much like the experienced
# time dilation on earth compared to outer space. The stronger the intensity
# of the gravity field the more these effects are. The original state, ie. the highest value,
# is where g=0, ie. in free space.
# For us on earth time goes slower, so is also the speed of ligh; it is slower
# than in free space. Also the bending (shifting) of rays of star lights by the sun
# is explained by this simple fact, ie. gravity causes everything to slow down.
#
# BTW, this is the first time I agree with Einstein!  :-)))

&gt; &gt; &gt; Debunked by Proof: Einstein's Relativity Theory Is Wrong! - PROOF #1

&gt; &gt; &gt; Einstein's Relativity Theory (RT) states that nothing can move

&gt; &gt; &gt; Everything in RT is limited to this upper speed limit, and termed

&gt; &gt; &gt; RT relies solely on this fact and is highly dependent on this.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Below I will prove that this speed limit of RT cannot hold
&gt; &gt; &gt; for every object. It might be true for light (photons) itself,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and some other atomic particles, but this upper speed limit
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot be valid for everything in the universe, especially not
&gt; &gt; &gt; for macroscopic objects like spaceships or celestial bodies like comets.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is an experiment that proves Einstein's Relavity Theory wrong:

&gt; &gt; &gt; We are performing a Free Fall Experiment above a star
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now comes the surprise: the final velocity of the object will be
&gt; &gt; &gt;  v = sqrt(2*g*h) = 599E6 m/s
&gt; &gt; &gt; And guess what this is: this is about twice the speed of light!!!  :-)))

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, Einstein's Relativity Theory is debunked by this proof.  Q.E.D.!

&gt; What I tried to demonstrate in this example is essentially the

Yes, this is well known.

But why should it be a surprise that if you abandon the postulates
of relativity, you get results different from what relativity
predicts?
That's what makes two theories different, that they predict different
results.

So you have a theory which predicts that velocities can be &gt;c,
and you have another theory which says they can't. Now the
thing to do is to test the two theories against observation. And
a century of observation has shown us that when Newton and
Einstein disagree on the predictions, Einstein gets it right.

Yes, Einstein theorized this in 1911. And decided by 1915 that
it was wrong, so it doesn't appear in the general theory of
relativity.

It is the 1915 theory which agrees with experiment.

&gt; &gt; # It predated the full formal development of general relativity by about four years.
&gt; &gt; # You can find an English translation of this paper in the Dover book
&gt; &gt; # 'The Principle of Relativity' beginning on page 99; you will find in
&gt; &gt; # section 3 of that paper Einstein's derivation of the variable speed of light
&gt; &gt; # in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result is:
&gt; &gt; #   c' = c * (1 + phi / c^2)

&gt; Yes, Einstein theorized this in 1911. And decided by 1915 that
&gt; it was wrong, so it doesn't appear in the general theory of relativity.

Yes, the above formula of Einstein from the year 1911 is indeed wrong.
What is the correct formula used in GR ?

&gt; Debunked by Proof: Einstein's Relativity Theory Is Wrong! - PROOF #1

&gt; Einstein's Relativity Theory (RT) states that nothing can move
&gt; faster than the speed of light (ie. c = 299,792,458 m/s^2).
&gt; Everything in RT is limited to this upper speed limit, and termed
&gt; as &quot;relativistic addition&quot; etc. The Lorentz-Factor (also called gamma)
&gt; does that limiting to c. For example when adding velocities together
&gt; the sum never can become &gt;= c.
&gt; RT relies solely on this fact and is highly dependent on this.

&gt; Below I will prove that this speed limit of RT cannot hold
&gt; for every object. It might be true for light (photons) itself,
&gt; and some other atomic particles, but this upper speed limit
&gt; cannot be valid for everything in the universe, especially not
&gt; for macroscopic objects like spaceships or celestial bodies like comets.

&gt; Here is an experiment that proves Einstein's Relavity Theory wrong:

&gt; We are performing a Free Fall Experiment above a star
&gt; that has a mass of about 130 times the mass of our Sun
&gt; and a radius of about 150 times the radius of our Sun
&gt; (see for example the data of the star system &quot;LBV 1806-20&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBV_1806-20for more info).

&gt; For comparison here are also the data of our Sun
&gt; ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun):
&gt;  Msun = 1.9891E30 kg
&gt;  Rsun = 6.955E8 m

&gt; And here's a hypothetical but a realistic (cf. above) normal star
&gt; for our experiment. We define that it has no atmosphere and
&gt; that the space around it  is the usual normal vacuum space,
&gt; and that there is no other gravitational fields nearby:
&gt;  M = 258E30 kg     (about 130 Sun masses)
&gt;  R = 104E9 m     (about 150 Sun radii)

&gt; We want to release a test-object to fall on to the surface of this star,
&gt; solely by using the gravitational attraction of the star. Ie. the test-object
&gt; has neither an own engine nor an initial speed; it will be released from rest.
&gt; The test-object is a symmetric and homogenous sphere of steel
&gt; or a similar material with some neglectable dimensions:
&gt; let's say it has a mass of just 1 kg and a radius of 5 cm.
">

Long before reaching c, any &quot;test object&quot; would long since have been
destroyed by tidal forces. Even if Newtonian mechanics WERE corrrect
(which it isn't), no such test could ever be conducted as you
describe.

And what speed will the &quot;destroyed&quot; object (or its remnants) have finally
achieved when it (they?) finally hits the surface?
Or are you saying it won't reach the surface? :-)
But, where else can it go? :-)

&gt;: &gt;&gt; Funny .. I thought we realised many many years ago that it does NOT

&gt;: &gt;&gt; after Newton principles.  They just didn't properly explain what we

&gt;: &gt;&gt; find experimentally.
&gt;: &gt;
&gt;: &gt;RT people said so. Lying is their marketing trick.
&gt;: &gt;What else can one expect from this criminal cult!
&gt;:
&gt;: &quot;Criminal cult&quot;?

&gt;Yes. Arsehole trolls like you are fuckin' criminal.

&gt;: Okay, I was under the mistaken impression that you

&gt;Go on, hide your head up your arse, imbecile.
