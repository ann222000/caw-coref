Within the metaphor of NLP, it is assumed that people have a prime
represetational system.

That of Visual
Auditory
Kinasthetic
Olfactory
Gustaory

There is one system that people have usually developed above and beyond the
others and have more accuity and flexability within.

I'me just wondering if anyone else would care to share any experiences,
either personal or with clients, of "prime"representational system shifting
through out the day.

Personally round dawn or so I have a definate tendancy to run
kinasthetically untill I've been awake for half an hour or so, I'll run a
lot more visually when I'me being outward going, AD when I'me worried by
something etc etc etc.

how could we develop this metaphor further to make it fit this experience
better?

This notion arise from the idea tha we have 'five senses'
It's actually far more complex than that - for instance
is the capabilty to detect temperature the same as that for
detecting surface texture, the audio abilty to detect object proximity
(volume, direction, reflection) one thing or several?
Do we sense balance with our ears or body musculature? etc.etc.

5 senses is a good, rough approximation for simple NLP
work - indeed four is quite adequate in most cases
(the 4tuple), see 'Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of
Milton H Erickson MD _VOLUME TWO_' but get
much deeper than that and you need to be very careful in
assessing how we actually sense things in fact (and how those
sensations cross associate like lightning with each other and
with the recall of stored (memory) sensation.

As well as a relatively slow Ad memory (the response of internal
dialogue to a given stimulus) human beings have a very fast (usually
Va) memory - which one can observe working by paying attention
(either as it happpens or in retrospect) - we have an even
faster (ultra-fast) 'silent being' that actually runs the shop
on a moment to moment basis and that works in terms of
our near instantaneous re-energisation and cross association of
past, 'predominant' memory (old sensory) experiences. (this is the thing
that
Libet missed in his experiments: the people AGREED BEFOREHAND
that they would participate in 'raising a finger' at random. The notion
that they actually lifted the finger 'before they ""thought"" about it'
(by about 200ms) misses th epoint that decisons are not made
at the 'thinking' level.

Had they had a better (aware) grade of subjects (eg highly alert
buddhist monks or such) then no divison between doing and
thinking would have occured.

Nice distinctions there, the prime rep system metaphor can seem to imply
that only one system is being used at a time rather than the reality that
everything except Ad is running all the time. It takes a fairly profound
experience to limit attention to only one representational system.

OK I will try one more time.  How is this information useful?

I will give my opinion since it appears you are ducking the question.

People switch representational system's moment to moment.  It's not that
anyone has a prime representational system.  I've been doing this stuff for
years and have not found any evidence whatsoever that anyone person has a
prime representational system.

If the cell phone rings and you hear it in the other room your prime
representational system for that moment is auditory.  As you walk through
the house using your ears to locate the phone you may bump into something
that barely feel it because your focus is primarily auditory.  When you get
close to the phone your primary representational system switches to visual
issue scan the room trying to determine the location.

From moment to moment the representational systems switch.

The model of representational systems has just not shown itself to be very
useful.  The reason is this.  The model of representational systems does not
take into account emotion.

So I will ask again how this is useful information.  What does finding the
prime representational system FOR you.

I think you are talking about senses here, not representations.

When looking for the phone you are using your visual senses (eye's
etc.).  When you think about your phone you may represent it as an
image or sound etc. Of, course you may be thinking about it whilst
looking for it, so's you know you've found it.

I have found that primary rep systems are not as clear cut as NLP
practitioners/trainers would have you believe, however, most people I
meet have a preference/primary modality.  I know this cos I calibrate
to it.

I can give an example

My partner is very visual (using the NLP terminology) and relies heavily
on visual feedback from people when speaking with them - she dislikes
using the phone as that feedback is missing.

I am very auditory - I'm happy speaking on the telephone but find the
heavy visual bias in NLP to be frustrating as, whilst I can picture
things as they are, I cannot yet construct pictures in my head; so
playing with visual submodalities ('make the picture bigger, brighter
etc) is impossible for me, as is the instruction to 'take the movie and
run it backwards'. I'm glad I have no phobias as the NLP phobia cure
would be useless to me.

There are of course many ways to sort phobias using NLP without using
the classic fast phobia cure. Last year I was a guest on 26 weekly BBC
radio shows and cured a phobia each week live on air.

I didn't once use the "fast phobia cure" but other approaches using
the NLP tool kit...
The average time to fully sort the phobia was between 15 and 60
minutes.

Yeah, that's been my experience as well, NLP has some intresting metaphors
to guide people where to look, but as most training courses point out very
early in the pice the map is not the territory. Simplification of a system
can make it easier to persuade others of it's utility and give enough
certainity to explore the concept, and I suppose 15 days is not a long time
to touch on all the concepts in a praticioner course. Eating a simplified
diagram of an apple could leave people thinking that apples are not sweet or
juicy.

I've got a suggestion there, that I read in "the phone book" it involves
visually halucinating the person you are going to speak to on the phone in
front of you, not sure how much good it could do for your partner in terms
of having at least basic visual framing to respond to but it works for me.

Dear Duck:

Question to you is this, do you calibrate to it using the language, I
see what your saying? or do you presuppose it, then they folllow your
lead?

I see what your saying is just them acknowledging what you just said,
think about that for a  minute.
There are so many ways for them to do that, what if they said I
understand, which rep system is that?
Or just nod their heads or the one I am famous for, I know what your
saying. Does that mean I know what they
are saying, no it is just an expression I use to acknowledge what they
just said.

While it may be true an artist may favor visual or anything else when
painting or doing what ever and the musican uses auditory, it's
because they have too while performing that task. But the average Joe,
jumps from one modality to another second by second, context to
context.

Or maybe your partner just believes that eye to eye is just so much
more rewarding than talking on the phone or she may have a phone
phobia, you on the other hand may just not like talking eye to eye
with other people, belief comes to mind, but talking on the phone is
not as threatening and your comfortable with that.

The reason you can't visualize yet is because you haven't been taught
how. I used to not be able to visualize, but can do so now with the
greatest of easy, does that mean I am visual now? No, it just means I
can use it better.

Interestingly, and not trying to be contrary just for the sake of it,
most musicians I know (and I know a lot) represent music visually.
Obviously there is much use of auditory, but when talking about music,
or describing songs, or solos, or what they are thinking when playing,
more often than not the say something like "I see the song in my head
like a movie" or "I see colours that represent the moods or elements
of the song", I think this goes by the name synesthesia (spelling may
be wrong).

I think there is a misconception that good visual artists (e.g.
painters) make primary use of visual representations (most I know use
feelings to guide them), and good audio artists (musicians etc.) use
auditory.

Average Joe, and all his clones, do indeed flit from modality to
modality, but my experience tells me that most make more frequent use
of a particular modality.  I do not assume this is the case, I always
calibrate.

&gt; &gt; etc.).  When you think about your phone you may represent it as an
&gt; &gt; image or sound etc. Of, course you may be thinking about it whilst
&gt; &gt; looking for it, so's you know you've found it.

&gt; &gt; I have found that primary rep systems are not as clear cut as NLP
&gt; &gt; practitioners/trainers would have you believe, however, most people I
&gt; &gt; meet have a preference/primary modality.  I know this cos I calibrate
&gt; &gt; to it.

Those are certainly possibilities, although they don't apply in our case

I like talking face to face. I also have no problem talking on the phone.

Ok, first thing I have to ask is the same question Tom asked, how
useful it this?
Second quesion I have to ask is this has there been any studieds done
to verify your opinion?

The third thing is this, when you take a visual, and move it away or
make it bigger,  you get the FEELING, of what ever it was as
dissipating. The reason for that is your disassociating from it and of
course it would seem as if your doing something but it always comes
back when you leave it be.

The problem with all this is that your working in the area of the
brain called the creative/adaptive, change doesn't occur in this part
of the brain, the part where it occurs in is the reactive and limbic
system.

Let's take any phobia as an example, in the creative/adpative area you
have an image of that phobia, let's use spiders as an example, you see
spider, signal is sent to limbic system, limbic system produces fight
( stomp on the spider ) or flight ( run like hell ) response to the
reactive part of the brain and then YOU MUST REACT.  Now the
interesting part is this, which I just recently read in the American
scientific mind magazine, under the article the criminal mind pg 20.
There are more path ways going down into the limbic system, then
coming out, which explains a lot, and why  when you see spider, you
react in a certain way.

The way out of the phobia is to add more pathways coming out of the
limbic/reactive system ( resources ) and link it to the phobia.  This
is why the 3D Mind is so effective, it deals directly with the
emotions causing the reaction of the problem.

The brain is very literal, it doesn't know the difference between what
you see and what you imagine, pet scans have verified this.

The reason the swish doesn't work all the time is really simple,
because your actually not giving the brain any instructions, if you
have someone swish and instruct them that this will cause change,
( layering in presuppostions ) ( and they believe it, placebo effect )
then now the brain has instructions and the swish will work. It is the
same with all of nlp and most disciplines out there.

If I told you that by me smacking you up side the head with a 2x4 will
cause change because it will jar the brain into action, and you
believe me, then it will happen. Beliefs are the most powerful thing
we own, they can make us happy, sad, depressed, rich, poor and any
thing else you can think of.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Within the metaphor of NLP, it is assumed that people have a prime
&gt;&gt;&gt; represetational system.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That of Visual
&gt;&gt;&gt;            Auditory
&gt;&gt;&gt;            Kinasthetic
&gt;&gt;&gt;            Olfactory
&gt;&gt;&gt;            Gustaory

&gt;&gt; This notion arise from the idea tha we have 'five senses'
&gt;&gt; It's actually far more complex than that - for instance
&gt;&gt; is the capabilty to detect temperature the same as that for
&gt;&gt; detecting surface texture, the audio abilty to detect object proximity
&gt;&gt; (volume, direction, reflection) one thing or several?
&gt;&gt; Do we sense balance with our ears or body musculature? etc.etc.

&gt; Nice distinctions there, the prime rep system metaphor can seem to imply
&gt; that only one system is being used at a time rather than the reality that
&gt; everything except Ad is running all the time. It takes a fairly profound
&gt; experience to limit attention to only one representational system.

&gt;&gt; As well as a relatively slow Ad memory (the response of internal
&gt;&gt; dialogue to a given stimulus) human beings have a very fast (usually
&gt;&gt; Va) memory - which one can observe working by paying attention
&gt;&gt; (either as it happpens or in retrospect) - we have an even
&gt;&gt; faster (ultra-fast) 'silent being' that actually runs the shop
&gt;&gt; on a moment to moment basis and that works in terms of
&gt;&gt; our near instantaneous re-energisation and cross association of
&gt;&gt; past, 'predominant' memory (old sensory) experiences.

&gt; That'ld be the Sensory memory of the academic 3 modes of memory model?
&gt; iconic memory for visual stimuli, echoic memory for aural stimuli and
&gt; haptic memory for touch.
&gt; http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs6751_97_winter/Topics/human-cap/me...
">

Yes and no.
The more I observe all this (and what I do is use the behaviours of my own
being as a laboratory), the more I am moving away from standard 'black box'
models of 'brains'.

My current musing lies around the (probable) resonant
nature of sense/memory/awareness in that for us to actually
be 'aware' of something (as a differentiable 'something' - and
this could be an object, process or quality), we first have to
re cognize it.

Look at that word: here a potted etymology:
"resume possession of land," from M.Fr. reconiss-, stem of
reconoistre "to know again, identify, recognize," from O.Fr.,
from L. recognoscere "acknowledge, recall to mind, know
again, examine, certify," from re- "again" + cognoscere "know"
(from co- "with" + gnoscere "become acquainted;" see notice).
Meaning "perceive something or someone as already known"
first recorded 1533.
(and can I say that surprised me when I first encountered it - I
expected a double stem of 're' as in do again/repeat and some
form of/derivative of 'cogito' (think))

So, forgetting models for a minute, just still yourdself take a
look at some (object) located (say) adjacent to your right hand
right now and try to observe what happens in the instant BEFORE the
(conditioned) associative language/naming response kicks in.

For you to re cognize that thing as 'thing' (ie for it not to be just
a blurred, formless mush) some very rapid process of comparison
of a STORED IMAGE (=memory) of the visual properties of that thing
with the thing sensed must take place and it (oservably and logically)
takes place before any naming. [This general process takes place in
all of our 'sensory modalities' - which we shall assum eto be  for
purposes of discussion at the moment].

So how can that be? We have awareness of what an (any known)
thng 'is' without 'naming' (indeed, if te thing happens to be an
oxyacetylene flame that we lean on, we find ourselves popelled ten
feet away immediately).

How can I look down to my right now and 'know' (wthot naming)
calculator, rubber band, pen, paper, piece of wood merely by
setting eyes on them?
Seems to me that the same neural processes we actually use to 'see'
(or here or feel, etc) are actually filtering the experience through a
series of filters that are actualy BUILT INTO THOSE NEURAL
PROCESSES and without them operating - immediately, in parallel
processing with the sense experience(s) we could not re cognize anything
which we had not previously stored as a memory template according
to that object and previous sensory experience of it.
Furthermore, as well as being vast in numerical organisation and
parallel in operation, these filters must be discrete - otherwise we would
look at (xsay) a cup and see all manner of diferent images...

I'm working along the lines of (internal) neuro-pattern resonance with
(external/incoming) parallel (single or mutiple) sense data. Imagine
'memory bank' made up of a vast set of interconnected tuning forks.
As the external conditions change (in this model aural conditons), then
varios patterns of oscillation will become excited/dormant in the fork
matrix - but only if the forks have been 'tuned up' (= conditioned or
trained) previously.
This model simultaneously explains the sensory process itself and the
manner in which cognition and memory might operate

{The 'silent awareness' thing also disputes Freud's assertion
that consciousness depends upon language... It might do for
90% of present human awareness, but it's certainly not an absolute}

I am not convinced of this, and the terms creative and reactive are
tenuous.  More and more research is showing that we use much of our
brain much of the time and that the brain is adaptive, in that if the
regions it commonly uses for a given purpose are in some way
incapacitated, the brain will use other regions.  The whole left brain

Visualization is a skill not a representational system.  I have found that
many people do not have the ability to visualize in a constructive manner.
I have also found that the brain is very lazy.  When asked the color of
someone's car they do not get a picture of the car.  They get instantaneous
flash of a piece of the car hotels in the information they need and then the
visualization goes away.  There is no way to hear the color of their car.
In that instantaneous moment you're very auditory client has to become
visual.

Teehee - I wonder if I could get away with that as an excuse.....

On a serious note, I think there is some use in representational
systems, in understanding differences; I am yet to be convinced that
they have a clinical use - I can't think of a situation where I would be
swayed in my approach by knowledge of someone's 'prime' representational
