Jerry Lewis Drops F-Bomb During Telethon
Posted Sep 4th 2007 8:51AM by TMZ Staff

A woozy Jerry Lewis went all Isaiah Washington on his telethon last night,
calling someone -- or something -- an &quot;illiterate faggot.&quot;

In the midst of a typically Lewis-ian rant in the 18th hour of his Labor Day
telethon, France's favorite comedian swayed, trying to dodge the cameraman,
then introduced a &quot;family member&quot; as &quot;the illiterate faggot,&quot; then
remembered, seemingly, that he was on live TV ... stopped himself and tried
to move on.

The MDA telethon raised a record $63 million for muscular dystrophy over the
three-day weekend.

A rep for Lewis had no comment on the incident.

Oh shit, sorry I missed that.  I did see him pay a tribute to &quot;my

running the scroll of their credits too fast.  Those final hours rule.

I used to love it when Jerry would bring out one of his &quot;kids&quot; and then get
very maudlin, usually while singing to them.

Jerry perfectly, even bringing out Jimmy, the Solid Gold poster child
dressed as a gold brick.

I always wondered what caused this guy to abandon such a spectacular
career in favor of just a single annual performance.  I think this was a
train wreck in '66, when he walked away from being one of the most
famous and most beloved men in America, and disappeared into near total
obscurity.

He also looks *really* old, and I think that the lack of sleep may have
made him disoriented.  As he was closing, he didn't look so good at all.
I fear he may collapse onstage, in a coming year.  He should break the
performance into three consecutive days of six hours each, so he doesn't
hurt himself.

ended and he resorted to it as a means of keeping himself in the

Not really.   Those coin jars on C-store counters, kids working hard
all year washing cars and baking cookies, and other efforts by
innumerable people across the country, are what raise the money.

It's then collected (sometimes by businesses who get a tax write-off!)
and then &quot;presented&quot; to Lewis, during the longest 3 days of the year.

Can't he just go away?   None of the French people I know, think
he's funny.

I agree-he did look great. Early on in the Telethon, he said he'd lost
100 pounds on NutriSystem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jerry Lewis Drops F-Bomb During Telethon
&gt;&gt;&gt; Posted Sep 4th 2007 8:51AM by TMZ Staff

&gt;&gt;&gt; A woozy Jerry Lewis went all Isaiah Washington on his telethon last night,
&gt;&gt;&gt; calling someone -- or something -- an &quot;illiterate faggot.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the midst of a typically Lewis-ian rant in the 18th hour of his Labor
&gt;&gt;&gt; Day
&gt;&gt;&gt; telethon, France's favorite comedian swayed, trying to dodge the cameraman,
&gt;&gt;&gt; then introduced a &quot;family member&quot; as &quot;the illiterate faggot,&quot; then
&gt;&gt;&gt; remembered, seemingly, that he was on live TV ... stopped himself and tried
&gt;&gt;&gt; to move on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The MDA telethon raised a record $63 million for muscular dystrophy over
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; three-day weekend.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A rep for Lewis had no comment on the incident.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Video: http://www.tmz.com/tmz_main_video?titleid=1173355070

&gt;&gt; Whoa. Does he always do that staggering-swaying thing?

I agree.  There are very few people in the world who have built up the credit
to get a pass for such a mistake and Jerry Lewis is one of them.  The guy's
done a lot of work and raised hundreds of millions of dollars for thousands
of very sick children.   Plus, Isaiah said it directly to a gay person in
anger, not a botched joke after 18 hours on stage raising money for sick
children.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh shit, sorry I missed that.  I did see him pay a tribute to &quot;my
&gt; &gt;&gt; crew&quot; and all their hard work but then yell at them that they were
&gt; &gt;&gt; running the scroll of their credits too fast.  Those final hours
&gt; &gt;&gt; rule.

&gt; &gt;&gt; mc

&gt; &gt; I used to love it when Jerry would bring out one of his &quot;kids&quot; and
&gt; &gt; then get very maudlin, usually while singing to them.

&gt; &gt; &quot;You'll  never  **sob** walk **sob** aaaaaaa-LONE!&quot;

&gt; &gt; If anyone remembers when SCTV did their Solid Gold Telethon, they
&gt; &gt; parodied Jerry perfectly, even bringing out Jimmy, the Solid Gold
&gt; &gt; poster child dressed as a gold brick.

&gt; Or Seinfeld when Kramer was mistaken for a &quot;handicapable&quot; person and &quot;The
&gt; Velvet Fog&quot; sang &quot;SMILE&quot; to him...- Hide quoted text -

One of my favorites.  Thanks for posting this.  When Elaine says the
velvet fog to Jerry and he asks what is the velvet fog.  That's gold.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jerry Lewis Drops F-Bomb During Telethon
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Posted Sep 4th 2007 8:51AM by TMZ Staff

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A woozy Jerry Lewis went all Isaiah Washington on his telethon
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; last night, calling someone -- or something -- an &quot;illiterate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; faggot.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the midst of a typically Lewis-ian rant in the 18th hour of his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Labor Day telethon, France's favorite comedian swayed, trying to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; dodge the cameraman, then introduced a &quot;family member&quot; as &quot;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; illiterate faggot,&quot; then remembered, seemingly, that he was on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; live TV ... stopped himself and tried to move on.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The MDA telethon raised a record $63 million for muscular
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; dystrophy over the three-day weekend.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A rep for Lewis had no comment on the incident.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I always wondered what caused this guy to abandon such a spectacular
career in favor of just a single annual performance. I think this was a
train wreck in '66, when he walked away from being one of the most
famous and most beloved men in America, and disappeared into near total
obscurity.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

He didn't ever abandon his career. He still made movies in the 70's and
80's. Remember &quot;King of Comedy&quot;? He had a couple of late night talk
shows. He was a frequent guest on late night talk shows like Carson and
guest hosted the Tonight Show many times. He constantly headlined in
Vegas. He had a recurring character on the 80's crime drama &quot;Wiseguy&quot;.
Had a long run starring on Broadway in the 90's in &quot;Damn Yankies&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jerry Lewis Drops F-Bomb During Telethon
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Posted Sep 4th 2007 8:51AM by TMZ Staff

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A woozy Jerry Lewis went all Isaiah Washington on his telethon
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; last night, calling someone -- or something -- an &quot;illiterate
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; faggot.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the midst of a typically Lewis-ian rant in the 18th hour of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his Labor Day telethon, France's favorite comedian swayed,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to dodge the cameraman, then introduced a &quot;family
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; member&quot; as &quot;the illiterate faggot,&quot; then remembered,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seemingly, that he was on live TV ... stopped himself and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tried to move on.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The MDA telethon raised a record $63 million for muscular
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; dystrophy over the three-day weekend.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A rep for Lewis had no comment on the incident.

If I *cared* about anything that came out of Agent &quot;Batshit F'loonball&quot;
Smith's head they would be but, as it stands, they are just words that
make me laugh, point and hoot in merriment.

It appears that poor Agent Smith cares much more deeply about my
opinions, doesn't it?  &lt;SMIRK&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the three-day weekend.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not really.   Those coin jars on C-store counters, kids working hard
&gt; &gt;&gt; all year washing cars and baking cookies, and other efforts by
&gt; &gt;&gt; innumerable people across the country, are what raise the money.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It's then collected (sometimes by businesses who get a tax write-off!)
&gt; &gt;&gt; and then &quot;presented&quot; to Lewis, during the longest 3 days of the year.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Can't he just go away?   None of the French people I know, think
&gt; &gt;&gt; he's funny.
