I think the parents are making the right decision, and that the nay-sayers
should mind their own business.

The medical consensus for people with her condition seems to be
unanimous that she will never, ever improve.  Her parents now have
a lifetime job of taking care of her, every moment of every day.  The
girl is not going to have the slightest understanding of what is going
on, or the implications of the decisions her parents make.  If
continuing with these medical procedures makes it easier for her parents
to care for her, with no other known downsides, then why the heck would
any rational person speak against it?

Weeeell, I can't shake my discomfort with the idea that yes, this may
be reasonable for her parents, yet would it be different if the girl
were a ward of the state? (There's a long history -- not always a nice
history -- of individuals with severe disabilities who were lifetime
residents of state schools (or institutions) who also received some
operations that in effect made it easier for the state, although the
operations were entirely optional. I'm thinking of sterilization, and
of wide-scale tooth extraction (e.g., for individuals who were
determined to require tube-feeding for the rest of their life).

For me, there's something slippery and generally uncomfortable with it,
especially if this became more widely-accepted (e.g., lifting patients
is one of the primary causes of workers' comp claims at some state
facilities -- would it make sense to restrict the patients' growth
instead?).

I think this is exactly why we have ethics boards
for these sorts of things, and an ethics board, with far
more information than we have, approved of this.  Now,
one could obviously ask whether this particular ethics
board was competent and ethical in their process, but
barring problems on that front, I would be inclined to
defer to their decision given their higher level of
expertise and access to information as well as their
mandate to resolve precisely these sorts of difficult
ethical decisions.

Like Caledonia, I have some deep-seated feelings of discomfort about
the procedures.  Nonetheless, setting aside these feelings, I have to
agree with Ericka.  In THIS case, the parents seem to have acted out of
genuine concern for their daughter, and acted to make it easier for her
to continue to be a part of their family for as long as possible.  I
cannot imagine what this family has gone through, and will continue to
go through, and I'm not about to cast aspersions on them.

I read the parents' blog, as well as most of the comments in their
guestbook, and to be quite honest, I think what they did was fine.

Many comments centered on "it's not in the child's best interests,
rather it was for their own convenience".  Part of what made it sticky
is that it does BOTH.

Yes, it does make it easier to lift their daughter.  It is easier for
them to manage her weight when bathing her, feeding her, changing her
diapers.  So yes, it DOES make their life easier. But what the
naysayers based on that reason don't realize is that BECAUSE it makes
their life easier, it also results in a huge improvement in the quality
of their daughter's life.

Because they can relatively easily manage her weight, they can and will
move her more often, thus preventing bedsores.  Because she's little,
than can carry her from room to room, and keep her a part of their
life, thus combating boredome on her part (She has the mind of a
3-month old, and 3-month olds *do* need stimulation and exposure to new
things, or they too get bored).  And moving her around, helps the
bedsore issue as well.

Because she is small, they will better be able to keep her clean - and
I'm sure everyone agrees that hygiene is important.  She will have
fewer health problems.

And because she is small, they will be able to keep her at home until
they are too old to care for her - potentially the next 40 years, or
even more.  Once she got too big for them to handle, they likely would
have had to put her in an institution, which are not known for the best
care.  Patients like her, at full size rarely get immersion baths -
rather they are most often sponge-bathed.   And the folks in
institutions have a caregiver to patient ratio MUCH worse than this
little girl will have.

There were also a lot of folks who protested with "would you like it if
someone else made the decision to mutilate *you*??"  And I think that
arguement is just plain silly.  The girl has a mind of a 3-month old.
She is not capable of understanding or even caring.   And she never
will.  Projecting your own horror at a decision being taking out of
your own hands isn't useful.  Making no decision on your child's behalf
is the same as making a decision in the other way.

She doesn't have the capability to understand that while she might be
uncomfortable for a few days now, it might save her years of discomfort
later, when she gets bedsores, isn't moved the necessary 20 times per
day, and is only given occasional spongebaths.   When she is 5' 6"
tall, and weighs 220 pounds (patients with her condition tend toward
obesity) no one will cuddle her on their lap.  Ever.

I agree completely. The child will benefit by having parents who are able to
take care of her. I don't see how anyone loses. This is not our business.

one thing I've seen mentioned on other sites is that the removal of her
ovaries would expose her to risks of all sorts of condtions, such as
osteoporosis, breast cancer would not be an issue as the breastbuds were
removed, but as she can't walk, she's not doing any of the normal things
that protect against osteoporosis, but I would presume would still feel pain
from such a degenerative condition and possibly at quite a young age. I
don't know if this question was ever answered, or whether her life
expectancy would actually be less than the revised expected age of getting
such conditions. I also have a concern about the short term effects of
surgery and any other side effects of the hormone treatment.

So that was a question I had, but beyond that, I'm not if I can even form an
opinion either way.

Cheers

I thought they left her ovaries and only removed the uterus.  They
claim that the hormone therapy to stop growth was widely used in the
60s and 70s and that there is no evidence of adverse side effects.  I
don't know how true that is, but it's what the parents say on their
blog.

I think what made me most uncomfortable about the whole thing was that they
kept on insisting that 'The "Ashley Treatment" is intended to improve our
daughter's quality of life and not to convenience her caregivers.'  As you
say, it is quite obvious that it does both; the parents are not being entirely
honest with themselves or the public.  When combined with the  complete
absence of self-doubt, it's just weird to read.  I would have been far happier
to read, 'Yeah, it will help us look after her, and we really had to think
carefully about the basis of our decision-making,' but they don't say that --
in fact, they say the opposite.

The other issue is the hormone treatment itself.  The only hormone treatment I
know about from the '60s is the David Reimer case -- not quite the same thing,
nor a happy ending.  However it certainly indicates the strength of the
God-complex that some Drs in the '60s suffered from.  It sounds very likely to
me that some poor girls then *were* given hormone treatment to make them
shorter -- but as they would only be in their 40s now the experiments done on
them can hardly be said to be complete, and the treatment has "somehow" fallen
out of fashion.  Who knows what will happen to them post-menopause?  Have they
been followed up at all?  Therefore the oestrogen treatment given to this
disabled girl might not be as uncomplicated a matter as the parents believe.
I hope it is.  I'm just surprised that the specialists claimed to *know*.

I agree very much with one statement in the replies, and it's true for
probably all Western countries, at least:

What has brought us to the place as a society where this debate even has to
happen?

It's a long history... a history of hiding people with disabilities and clumping
them into institutions.  We have a lot to be embarrassed about - if you're
willing to see it.  Families do have much more support to keep their children
at home - but we're no where near to where we need to be.  It's not only the
physical care of children who grow; it's the lack of supports in the adult
system that create a fear of appropriate care outside of the home.
&lt;snip&gt;
What are the alternatives for this family?  Perhaps if we created a system
where families felt they had some control?  What if we provided appropriate
supports in the home and community that met their needs?  That is different
then underpaid workers who come and go... it is about establishing a much
deserved level of respect for caregivers - pay/benefits.  That is about us as
a society.

I realise that now, but it does seem to have been misreported in some news

still be similar issues, which Chookie nicely indicated, that as the
earliest girls/women to have had such treatment are now in there 40s we

She is not receiving hormones now. From her parents' blog:

"Shortly after the surgery and recovery, we started the high-dose estrogen
therapy. We've just completed this treatment after two and a half years.
During this whole period, we have observed no adverse consequences."

with stuff like hormone treatment, it's not just the short term effects, she

I think that will be the least of their worries in 40 years, if indeed she
is still alive. They say she should have a normal life expectancy, but  how

&gt; &gt; She is not receiving hormones now. From her parents' blog:

&gt; &gt; &quot;Shortly after the surgery and recovery, we started the high-dose estrogen

&gt; &gt; During this whole period, we have observed no adverse consequences.&quot;

&gt; with stuff like hormone treatment, it's not just the short term effects, she
&gt; is going to be physiologically different in 40 yrs time due to having taken
&gt; these hormones now, and no one knows for sure that those differences will be
&gt; just the good ones.

True. But even so, it's worth remembering that the circumstances of
this case render most of the usual concerns about unknown effects moot.
Those worries generally speak to incapacitation or passing on harm to
unborn children -- neither of which are factors here.

The "40 yrs time" phrase is interesting, because it's been thought that
40 years is about the outer limit that her parents could continue
caring for her at home. If hormones that buy her 40 years of home care
and family life, but ultimately cause a fatal stroke at age 49, I'm not
sure that's a horrible tradeoff. The worries most parents harbor about
their naive or powerless  children being taken advantage of and harmed
tend to lessen as the children mature and prove themselves capable of
sustaining themselves in the world. From what I understand, in parents
of children who are severely developmentally disabled, those fears only
increase as their children grow older.

&gt; I think that will be the least of their worries in 40 years, if indeed she
&gt; is still alive. They say she should have a normal life expectancy, but
&gt; how could that possibly be true - I'm thinking pneumonia, infections, etc.
">

the news articles did not report her life expectancy as far as I saw, but I
would expect it would be shorted by the same reasons you mention. But it
would be awful if she then got some kind of cancer related to the hormone
treatment, she wouldn't be able to report any symptoms, and you'd expect
they would manage them only to prevent pain, but ultimately many cancer
deaths are very painful. So it may not be the least of there worries, no one
wants to watch someone die a painful death.

The same argument would also exonerate Pou, Budo and Landry for their

&gt; mandate to resolve precisely these sorts of difficult
&gt; ethical decisions.

I reluctantly agree.  Any decision is equally as wrong.  So why not let the
wrong decision be made independent of my opinion?

With that said, here's what really gets under my skin.

Weight is relative.  The girl is already genetically predisposed to a small
frame and low weight simply with because she lacks a Y chromosome.  What
precedent is set for males regarding the stunted growth hormone treatment?
Hormone treatment may make a male around the same weight as Ashley's natural
expected weight.  So if that's such a big issue for providers, what else can
be done to save weight?  Would the ethics board ok partial limb amputations
for males?

And this procedure pretty much tosses the Golden Rule out the window.  As
far as I know, no one would have this done unto themselves.  It's an
involuntary procedure, medically unnecessary, and an ectomy.  That makes my
skin crawl.

And there's the biggy.  It's already one fantastic leap towards disposal.
Why not consider euthanasia?

doesn't surprise me, acute appendicitis is life threatening in a short space
of time, I'd be surprised about the others, though they could become very
painful, they wouldn't be life threatening, though I guess for long stays in
space it might be considered.

As for removal of breasts, whilst forced removal is not on, it's also a
valid option for may women, not something I'm considering myself, as firstly
the breast cancer in our family is a non agressive one, so even treatment of
it doesn't involve mastectomy if it's caught in time and they haven't found
the gene that's causing it, so I can't be tested either way, but if I could
and it was a more agressive form I wouldn't be booking in for surgery
tomorrow, but possibly between 35 and 40 (it's non agressive but
premenopausal).

And, realistically, if you're going to do a hysterectomy, you might as well
do the appendectomy too, and avoid possible future surgery, since there is
no real need for an appendix.

I also have a friend who has a history of very, very invasive ovarian cancer
in her family, and at the recommendation of her doctors and the cancer
specialists, after having her second child (by C-section), had a complete
hysterectomy as well. It seemed drastic in someone in her early 30's, but
the cancer had killed her mother when her mother was only in her late 40's,
and she was done having children. She felt early menopause was a small price
to pay to avoid the cancer risk, and that since she was stuck with a
C-section anyway, she might as well get the surgery all done at once and
only have one recovery to deal with instead of two.

I did find something about it on
http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5402 , in an interview
with a female astronaut:
Q: To comply with Russian space flight standards you had a gall bladder
removed. You also may have to remove a wisdom tooth. How are their medical
standards different from the Americans?
GARVER: I think the Russian medical procedures may be even more stringent
because they have actually sent people for longer periods of time in space.
They hold the record for living in a space station. So far, they have been
treating their citizens like cosmonauts (Russian astronauts). If I should
go, to know that I have the same training and medical checkups and approvals
as their cosmonauts, in a way, makes me feel very safe. Astronauts go
through extremely stringent medical reviews as well. But of course, one of
the unique things about my mission is that I'm going to talk about those
things. I guarantee you that there have been astronauts who have had their
gall bladder and wisdom teeth removed for flight. But they consider that a
part of their jobs. And as government employees, they are not going to talk
about it.
