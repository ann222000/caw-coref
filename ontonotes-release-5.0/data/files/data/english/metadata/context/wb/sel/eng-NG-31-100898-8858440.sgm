Toxic Zen Story #15: Nuremberg Zen: D.T. Suzuki, et al, and the
Corruption of European Academia.

|   1897: A Japanese student named Suzuki Daisetz
|   (&quot;D.T. Suzuki&quot;) comes to the United States, where
|   he remains until 1908. In New York, Suzuki
|   studied philosophy under a German émigré named
|   Paul Carus, whose &quot;Science of Religion&quot; taught
|   that religions should reject dogma, ritual, and
|   formal organizations. During the Russo-Japanese
|   War of 1904-1905, Suzuki also became fascinated
|   with medieval Japanese warrior culture. So,
|   although he himself formally studied neither Zen
|   nor swordsmanship, Suzuki's best-known book, Zen
|   and Japanese Culture, devoted several chapters to
|   the putative relationship between Zen and
|   swordsmanship. First given as lectures in 1936
|   and published in 1938, this text's blend of
|   philosophy and militarism struck a chord when
|   reprinted in the United States in 1959, and
|   therefore led many non-Japanese to study Buddhism
|   and swordsmanship more closely.
|.
|   1900: Paul Carus [Open Court Publishing]
|   publishes the first book of D. T. Suzuki,
|   Ashvagosha's Discourse on the Awakening of Faith
|   in the Majayana. [Carus was German, so he
|   published in German as well...]

This fairly deluded underestimate of the catastrophe that was Suzuki,
is typical of academic analyses of Suzuki.

____ Preface: Zen Founder _________________________________

Zen is the snake that bites its own tail. If you embrace the void and
acausality, you will find yourself later in the midst of catastrophic
emptiness saying &quot;how'd that happen?&quot;.

Under Prajnatara (Perfect Wisdom Shining Star) of India, there was a
disciple named Bodhidharma (Buddha Law). Under these grandiose  names,
they studied the Buddha's teachings, after Buddhism had  traveled East
to China. The Buddha foretold that Buddhism would fall  into a Hellish
path in India, after the Buddha's highest teachings had  moved on.

Bodhidharma was a native of Conjeeveram, near Madras in India. He
traveled from India and arrived at Ching-Ling (now  Nanking), or
perhaps at Guangzhou (Canton), perhaps both. There, Bodhidharma met
with the Emperor's emissary (some say Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty,
see footnote), where they discussed the Sutras.

As Bodhidharma (also called Da Mo, or Ta Mo in China, and Daruma in
Japan) believed in  dhyana or meditation upon the nothingness at the
heart of life, and as the  Lotus Sutra had been translated into
Chinese by Kumarajiva who  traveled from India a century earlier and
had served the Liang Dynasty well, the  lesser and distorted teaching
of dhyana/ch'an/zen was rejected by practitioners of the highest
teaching, and Bodhidharma was banished from Imperial territory.

As an icchantika, or incorrigible disbeliever in the Lotus Sutra, he
could  not be allowed to spread his teachings in the Emperor's domain
(they  wished to live happily, you see). But by banishing him, they
did not act  as bodhisattvas, to thoroughly correct his errors and not
let him slip away  to corrupt others, and thusly fall into the hell of
incessant sufferings  (Aviichi Hell) for countless lifetimes. Out of
this single  uncompassionate act, much of the suffering of the world
has come.

After he was banished, Bodhidharma went to the Shaolin Monastery at
Loyang, West of Kaifeng in the Henan (Honan) Province of Western
China, where the Huang He (Yangtze or Yellow River) tumbles out of the
break between Zhongtiao Shan (2367m) on the North and Quanbao Shan
(2094m) on the South, to flood the rest of China. At the Shaolin
Monastery, he widely disseminated his distorted views of Buddhism,
corrupting first the Shaolin Monks and ultimately the rest of the
world.

Bodhidharma's school was known as Dhyana (from the Mahayana  source),
or as Ch'an in China, and eventually as Zen in Japan. It comes  to
flower in many different forms, in many different places down  through
the ages.

Bodhidharma's very existence is denied by the Zen community,
rendering the life of their founder as itself a void. This allows no
one to  be responsible, and the Zen community to walk away from the
train  wreck. So let's assume that the history is true, and hold
Bodhidharma  and Zen accountable, just this once. There was surely a
founder who  brought Dhyana from India, however many names he is
called.

Footnotes on Wu-Ti:

Concerning Emperor Wu: from &quot;The Selection of the Time - Nichiren,
disciple of Shakyamuni Buddha&quot;, Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, p.
544:

.       'Those concerned about their next life would
.   do better to be common people in this, the Latter
.   Day of the Law, than be mighty rulers during the
.   two thousand years of the Former and Middle Days
.   of the Law. Why won't people believe this? Rather
.   than be the chief priest of the Tendai school, it
.   is better to be a leper who chants Nam-myoho-
.   renge-kyo! As Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty said
.   in his vow, &quot;I would rather be Devadatta and sink
.   into the hell of incessant suffering than be the
.   non-Buddhist sage Udraka Ramaputra.&quot;'

This reference is to a document in which Emperor Wu (464--549), the
first ruler of the Liang dynasty, pledged not to follow the way of
Taoism. It actually says that he would rather sink into the evil paths
for a long period of time for going against Buddhism (yet nevertheless
forming a bond with it) than be reborn in heaven by embracing the non-
Buddhist teachings. This story appears in The Annotations on &quot;Great
Concentration and Insight.&quot; Udraka Ramaputra was a hermit and master
of yogic meditation, the second teacher under whom Shakyamuni
practiced. He is said to have been reborn in the highest of the four
realms in the world of formlessness.

____ Preface: Types of Zen _______________________________

There is a hierarchy of Zen, in power and toxicity. The lesser forms
of Zen pave the way in societies and cultures for the more powerful
forms. Once a society or culture is corrupted, in even the tiniest
way, by any form of Zen, the tendency will be to move inevitably
towards greater corruption by the more powerful and toxic variants. In
this way, Zen undermines everything that can be undermined in the
world, leaving only that which is incorruptible (the correct practice
of the Lotus Sutra). The hierarchy of Zen is as follows, in general
terms:

Physical Zen: All of the martial arts are based on Zen, starting
.   with Shaolin Kung Fu, Tai Chi, Karate, Aikido, JiuJitsu,
.   Judo, Kendo, Bushido, Ninjitsu, etc. Tai Chi came from
.   Shaolin Qigong, which also led to Acupuncture,
.   Acupressure and Falun Gong. As the chaos in society
.   grows, people need to feel they can protect themselves and
.   their loved ones, and in this way they are corrupted further.

Christian Zen, Jewish Zen, Hindu Zen, Islamic Zen: These are
.   basically mixtures, wherein the monotheist believer in a
.   deity, feels they can practice Zen meditation without a
.   problem, since it is not theistic. While this reasoning is true,
.   it ignores the absolutely overwhelming corruption produced
.   by Zen, which will ultimately undermine their belief system
.   and every facet of their life, by bringing all of the negatives
.   in the Zen adherent's's daily life and environment to the
.   forefront, with increasing amplification and psychotic
.   effect.

Nuremberg Zen: The widespread belief by a population, that
.   the purpose of the Buddha's advent in the world was to
.   teach Zen: that Zen is Buddhism. This is, of course, an
.   absolutely distorted view of the Buddha's life and teachings.
.   Shakyamuni made it transparently clear, at the very end of
.   his life in the Nirvana Sutra, wherein he states that the Lotus
.   Sutra is his highest teaching in the past, present and future,
.   and is the purpose of his advent on this Earth, and that his
.   followers should honestly discard provisional teachings
.   (teachings other than the Lotus Sutra).
.
.   Nuremberg Zen was promulgated first by D.T. Suzuki's
.   work with Paul Carus, then by Eugen Herrigel's Zen in the
.   Art of Archery (and the many who copies: Zen in the Art
.   of Marketing, Sales, Bakery, etc.) and finally by Alan Watts,
.   the Norman Vincent Peale of Zen. Nuremberg Zen creates
.   the environment of chaos and widespread misery that are
.   the preconditions for the spread of more toxic forms of
.   Zen.

Stanford Zen: This is the Lay organization of Zen. It was
.   developed in conjunction with the activities of Frederic
.   Spiegelberg, a Lutheran who taught theology at the
.   University of Dresden, and fleeing the effects of Nuremberg
.   Zen in Germany, came to teach at Stanford, and founded
.   the American Academy of Asian Studies with Alan Watts
.   and others, which became the California Institute of Integral
.   Studies, after it spawned Esalen with Richard Price and
.   Michael Murphy. Esalen was the proving ground for the
.   Large Group Awareness Therapy organizations, of which
.   Werner Erhard's EST was most prominent. EST morphed
.   into a business school executive training seminar
.   organization called the Landmark Forum, or Landmark
.   Education, which has now become the de facto Lay
.   organization for Zen, projecting itself onto Wall Street and
.   the Fortune 500.

Green Dragon Zen: In this category I place Soto, which is the
.   parent of the Green Dragon Society, Rinzai, Fuke, Northern
.   and Southern Chinese Ch'an sects, Vietnamese and Korean
.   sects, and all the variant sects which practice the most toxic
.   forms of Zen: those which actually use the Lotus Sutra as a
.   means to promulgate their distorted views of Buddhism.
.   This is the greatest slander of the Lotus Sutra which is
.   possible. I lump them all under the Green Dragon banner
.   (I'm sure they do not appreciate this, but that is not a
.   concern), because Green Dragon has had a tradition of
.   secret propagation, and penetration of new areas with the
.   most aggressive intent to build a lasting foothold in every
.   society it touches. All of the other sects in any locale, will
.   orient themselves to the Green Dragon.

Nuremberg Zen, Physical Zen and the monotheist Zen mixtures will all
eventually pave the way for Stanford Zen and the Green Dragon, if they
are not themselves undercut by the king of sutras, the Lotus Sutra.
(Zen believers cannot resist the allure of greater power. When they
try the Lotus Sutra and find that it fills the void inside, they will
find they like it.)

Finally, there is the enabling group for all of the worst religious
and social movements in history:

Fellowship of Evil Friends: This loosely collected group of
.   Occultists,Theology professors and educators, is at the
.   branching point for most of corrupt religious movements
.   of the world. This grandfather of this group is the occultist
.   Meister Eckart, and it includes: Dietrich Eckart (Thule
.   Society), Paul Carus (Open Court Publishing), Frederic
.   Spiegelberg (Stanford, AAAS), Michael Murphy (Esalen),
.   and a host of powerful media people, pundits, gurus and
.   self-help authors. They are all quite happy to connect you
.   up with some form of evil, but step back from
.   commitment themselves, always stopping at the door, as
.   you foolishly, trustingly pass through. In this way they
.   catalyze the evil transformation, but survive its effects to
.   spread further evil, later on.

____ Preface: Powers of Zen ______________________________

Variations upon Zen which have evolved into new strains and then major
branches of Zen, have increased their toxic power by piling slander
upon slander over hundreds of years. The greatest slanders are
attached to the most powerfully evil forms of Zen, which are those
that have attacked the Lotus Sutra directly or the votaries (devotees)
of the Lotus Sutra, the Sangha, directly. One can think of this with
the mathematical analogy of a powers of a variable, that Zen becomes
exponentially more powerful and evil as slanders are piled upon
slanders ...

[Zen] Bodhidharma discards the Lotus Sutra, seeking wisdom that is
from transmissions outside the sutras, transmitted from person to
person (ishin denshin). The families of Chinese Zen under
Bodhidharma's influence include: Dhyana, Ch'an, Western Ch'an, Qigong,
Tai-Chi, Acupuncture, and the Chinese and Korean Martial Arts up to
1200 CE.

[Zen Squared] Dogen uses the Lotus Sutra as a means to teach and
propagate Zen. The families of Japanese Zen under Dogen's influence
are: Soto Zen, Rinzai Zen, Green Dragon Zen, Bushido and the Japanese
Martial Arts up to 1500 CE.

[Zen Cubed] Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and the Tokugawa Shogunate use various
Samurai and Daimyo tactics, which are based on Zen, to subjugate and
crush Nichiren Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra in the 1500s and 1600s. The
families of Japanese Zen under the Tokugawa influence are: Soto Zen,
Rinzai Zen, Green Dragon Zen, Bushido and the Japanese Martial Arts up
to 1867 CE.

[Zen Squared Squared] After the Meiji regime's overthrow of the
Tokugawa Shogunate, the militarization and buildup of Japanese society
into an armed camp, forces all of Buddhism under Shinto, and Zen
becomes Imperial Way Zen. This ultimately leads to the crushing of the
Lay organization of Nikko's School of Nichiren Buddhism, the Soka
Kyoiku Gakkai and the imprisonment of their leaders during the war,
and the death of their President Tsunesaburo Makiguchi. The families
of Imperial Way Zen are: Soto Zen, Rinzai Zen, Green Dragon Zen,
Bushido and the Japanese Martial Arts up to 1945 CE.

[Zen to the 5th] American Lay Zen from George Leonard's [Esalen]
influence: the Large Group Awareness Therapy or Training sessions,
Werner Erhard's EST, Landmark Forum, Landmark Education Seminars.

____ Preface: Zen Offends the Law ________________________

There is a principle which is central to the Buddhism of the Lotus
Sutra: Oneness of Person and Law, known as Nimpo-ikka in Japanese.

It is eternally true that the Law and the Buddha are fused, to make
life as we know it.

Since, according to Nichiren in the Ongi Kuden (The Oral Teachings, or
class notes from his lectures on the Lotus Sutra, taken by Nikko), one
meaning of &quot;Myoho&quot; is that delusion and enlightenment are fused (this
is also explained in the essential teachings of the Lotus Sutra, in
the Juryo or Life Span chapter) ...

This means that even for deluded mortals, there is always a condition
of oneness of person and Law.

The implication of this, is that wherever there is a slander of the
Law, then nearby and coincident with it, there is a slander of
humanity, by the principle of the simultaneity of cause and effect.

Hence, wherever Zen is propagated widely, there will be in each and
every instance, Toxic Zen Stories to tell.

What follows is one of these ...

____ Introduction ________________________________________

We know the basic story of D.T. Suzuki, and the fact that he had one
face showing towards Japan's Imperial Way Zen, and a different face
showing towards the West. And that, for obvious reasons, never the
twain would meet.

We know that he went to America as a young man, to accompany his
master, the Rinzai priest Soyen Shaku, to LaSalle-Peru, Illinois, at
the behest of Dr. Paul Carus, a German who was the managing editor of
Open Court Publishing, which was owned by Zinc magnate Edward Hegeler.

We know that he had a variety of collaborators, a flock of followers,
and influenced many others:

Collaborators in the propagation of Soyen Shaku (D.T.'s Master)-D.T.
Suzuki Zen:
Beatrice Lane (wife), Paul Carus, Edward Hegeler, Martin Heidegger,
Frederic Spiegelberg, Father Thomas Merton, Alan Watts, Eric Fromm,
Carl G. Jung, Richard de Martino, Karen Horney, and a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation to lecture extensively at Columbia University
and other East Coast schools in the 1950's.

Followers of Shaku-Suzuki Zen:
John Cage, Jack Kerouac, Alan Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, and Philip
Whalen.

Those strongly affected by the Shaku-Suzuki Zen Influence:
Aldous Huxley, Karl Jaspers, Arnold Toynbee, Gabriel Marcel, Herbert
Read, and Lynn White Jr.

____ Toxic Zen Story ______________________________

Zen came to Europe, as the Church was being thrown out of Japan.

The infiltration of Zen into Europe, before the Second World War, was
only into academic circles.

As Alioune Koné writes in his utterly Zen-biased thesis &quot;Zen in
Europe: A Survey of the Territory&quot; :

|      '1.1. Early Developments (1787-1930s)'
|.
|      'European conversions to Zen Buddhism occurred
|   before the twentieth century. A notable example
|   is Christovao Ferreira (1580-1650), a Portuguese
|   missionary in Japan who renounced his faith
|   during the Christian persecutions and became a
|   Zen priest, publishing a pamphlet against
|   Christianity in 1636. More reliable information
|   on Japanese Zen Buddhism reached Europe in the
|   seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Letters
|   from Francis Xavier prior to his departure for
|   Japan exhibited some knowledge of Buddhist
|   practices. Later, Kaempfer's History of Japan
|   (published in 1727) contained accurate
|   description of Zen's seated meditation (zazen).
|   However, there was no concept of a coherent
|   Buddhist religion before the second half of the
|   nineteenth century, let alone of a distinct Zen
|   school. The first Europeans to embrace Buddhism
|   were attracted to Theravada, often praised at the
|   times as the purer Buddhism. None of the
|   organizations created in the 1920s to support
|   Buddhist practice in Europe centered on Zen. The
|   important figures of this first period for the
|   reception/reinvention of Zen in Europe were
|   writers and intellectuals; this first period is
|   one of literary interest.'
|.
|      'Christmas Humphreys's (1901-1983) itinerary
|   epitomizes the growth of a new perception of Zen
|   schools outside of academic circles in the 1930s.
|   An Englishman from a prominent family of lawyers,
|   he had adopted Buddhism as early as 1918,
|   professing in a theosophist approach that all
|   schools of Buddhism should be drawn upon.
|   However, he grew fascinated by Zen teachings,
|   writing by 1951: &quot;Zen is the apotheosis of
|   Buddhism.&quot; For Humphreys, as for many Europeans
|   during the first half of the twentieth century,
|   the shift from Theravada Buddhism to Zen Buddhism
|   was heavily influenced by the writings and
|   charisma of Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki (1870-1966).
|   D. T. Suzuki was a scholar and lay disciple of
|   the Rinzai master Soen Shaku (1859-1919). He was
|   not only -- as he modestly labeled himself --
|   &quot;the first to make a special study on Zen in
|   English.&quot; His interest in Western philosophy and
|   psychology enabled him to present Zen to a wider
|   public.'
|.
|      'D. T. Suzuki's definition of Zen, informed by
|   Western thought and philosophy, made it both
|   familiar and fascinating to his Western audience.
|   German scholars were at the forefront of interest
|   in Zen practices, just as they had been in the
|   process of translating Buddhist texts. Rudolf
|   Otto (1869-1937) prefaced the first translation
|   of Zen texts into German, pointing out the
|   existential changes fostered by the practice of
|   Zen meditation. Another influential figure of
|   these early developments was the philosophy
|   professor Eugen Herrigel (1884-1955). His
|   approach to Zen through archery is still one of
|   the most quoted readings in contemporary European
|   Zen circles. '
|.
|      'Zen came to be seen in the Western circles as
|   one of the purest forms of Buddhism, an idea with
|   a nationalistic ring in pre-war Japan. The &quot;Zen
|   experience&quot; described by Suzuki and his epigones
|   -- compatible with reason although of higher
|   status, universal yet quintessential to Japanese
|   culture -- was a philosophy that appealed to both
|   &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;rationalist&quot; interest in
|   Buddhism.'
|.
|      'Even though Suzuki brought Zen Buddhism to a
|   wider audience, the technical nature of his
|   writing made his version difficult to access.
|   Alan Watts (1915-1973), once called the &quot;Norman
|   Vincent Peale of Zen&quot;, paved the way for Zen
|   teachings to a larger public, inspiring many
|   young Europeans and Americans to consider Zen
|   practice. '
|.
|      'Other writers, less famous, have been also
|   instrumental in the popularization of Zen in
|   different circles. Their accounts expressed Zen
|   ideas through various lenses, often borrowing
|   from D. T. Suzuki's approach. Dr. Hubert Benoît
|   (1904-1992), the translator of Suzuki's work in
|   French, went on to give his own exposition of Zen
|   that reflected his interest in psychology and the
|   influence of George Gurdjieff (1912-1949). Robert
|   Raam Linssen founded the Center for New
|   Philosophies and Sciences in Brussels in 1935.
|   His writings provide popular accounts of Zen
|   along with Taoism that reflect his long-time
|   involvement with Krishnamurti. '

In trying to understand how such great trouble occurred in Europe in
the 20th Century, and the movement of Zen and its variants into Europe
and the West, I came across the following very interesting posting on
a site called &quot;The Forum&quot;, under the subject: &quot;D.T. Suzuki and the
Unconscious&quot;. Poster Name: Stephen Regan:

.      'Comments:'
.
.      '..... The presence of Zen as a group mind has
.   forced us into spending every hour trying to
.   bring our mind back into it's natural focus and
.   self center. This is neurosis. To lose this
.   battle could result in schizophrenia where the
.   mind is divided in half. I would speculate that
.   this is a good description of the transition from
.   depression era Germany to Fascist Germany. This
.   Fascism is a face schism or a face behind a face.
.   In that case Hitler's.'
.
.      '..... If Zen is a totalitarian system that
.   takes hold by parasiting in people's psyche, it
.   would be propitious for us to have look at Freud
.   and his world: early 20th century Europe. It is
.   very interesting to note right up front that the
.   &quot;founding father&quot; of modern psychology appeared
.   out of the same conditions that produced Nazi
.   Germany. By examining Freud's description of the
.   psyche we will have an excellent model for
.   understanding the conditions preceding a
.   totalitarian takeover of a modern society. This
.   is just a short look to stimulate some inquiry by
.   experts in psychology.'
.
.      '..... This in Germany led to development of
.   the superman complex called Nazism. It is the
.   introduction of this second center in the form of
.   an archetype being; the superman; which paves the
.   way for the formation of totalitarianism. The ego
.   itself is formed as an opposing self center
.   against this imposition.'
.
.      '..... We have in our current society just the
.   same psyche (Freudian model) that Europeans had
.   before WW2 and there is in our presence a new
.   and very obscure organization offering a super
.   being as the &quot;true nature&quot; of human beings.'
.
.      'His superman is the buddha of Zen.'
.
.      'We have the &quot;superego&quot; of this &quot;buddha&quot;
.   already in our mind and it is inexorably moving
.   toward complete control of our society and our
.   citizens.'
.
.      'I am witnessing the degradation of the right
.   to self-determination before my eyes and people
.   are stopped from bringing this matter forward.'
.
.      'Psychiatry in particular has a total
.   blindness to this issue and sit is one of the
.   major reasons Zen has gotten this far.'
.
.      'I think it is safe to say they are suffering
.   some mind control.'
.
.      'It is really up to the average American to
.   take responsibility for insuring our freedom.'
.
.      'Totalitarianism does not abate by itself.'
.
.      'It has to be brought into the daylight'
.
.      'Our freedom and health depend on Zen being
.   unmasked as a master race.'

These thoughts reveal some fascinating insights by Stephan Regan.

Psychiatry, as every expert will say, is originally based on Freud's
observations of patients under hypnosis. Hypnosis is a phenomenon
which reveals the group mind directly, and has something very occult
as its basis. To be blunt, one exerts an occult power over the subject
in hypnosis.

If the infiltration of occultism into every aspect of European
society, masked the approach of Zen into Western culture, would there
be traces of this?
______________________________________________________

As an interesting experiment, I took the jam-packed Chronological
History of Martial Arts and Combative Sports, by Joseph R. Svinth,
from the website
http://collection.nlc-bnc.ca/100/201/300/ejmas/kronos/2002/12-03/inde...
and  reduced it to include only that which was both Zen-Shaolin based
and related to the movement of those traditions to the West (Americas
and Europe).

With that was merged the Zen-Shaolin related elements from the
Timeline, from the website http://awakening.to/timeline.html

With that was merged the large conflicts that plagued the Western
world, from the website
http://www.thehaus.net/history.php

This reduction-merge reveals an interesting trend. Things are moving
slowly, where every 5 years or so, on the average, something happens,
until the late 1890's when D.T. Suzuki and his master Shaku Soen
arrive in LaSalle-Peru, Illinois: where the West mind meets the
Eastern mind in a deep way for the first time.

Suzuki joins Open Court Publishing under Dr. Paul Carus, and they
start to generate a lot of Westernized Buddhist texts, principally
Zen, that become somewhat popular. The U.S.S. Maine is blown up in
Cuba, and the Spanish American War occurs briefly.

After that a crescendo of infiltration of Shaolin-based Martial Arts
begins to swell, with a wave peaking a few years before the beginning
of the First World War, which occupies humanity preventing more growth
in Zen and the Martial Arts.

Then after the First World War, the infiltration of Martial Arts and
Zen is constant until the Second World War, which occupies humanity,
preventing more growth in Zen and the Martial Arts.

It would appear that World Wars limited the spread of Zen and the
Martial Arts, up to the end of the Second World War. After the War,
the trend changes.

A 57-year old Chinese boxer named Heung Chan begins teaching choy-li-
fut ch'uan fa to Chinese immigrants living in San Francisco. (The
style was named after Heung's instructors, a Buddhist monk called
Green Leaf and a pair of Shaolin boxers named Choy Ah-fok and Lee Yau-
san.) Heung supported anti-government activities in China, and his
system was notorious for teaching people how to kill using wooden
benches, iron opium pipes, and assorted farm tools. So he was probably
an enforcer for a gambling syndicate or prostitution ring rather than
a priest or monk.

The Russian mystic Helena Blavatsky and the American lawyer Henry
Olcott establish the Theosophical Society in New York and London.
While Blavatsky was something of a charlatan and Olcott is important
mainly for supporting Sri Lankan Buddhism during a time of profound
Christian oppression, together they were among the first Europeans or
Americans to systematically mine Vedic and Buddhist philosophies for
religious truths. The Theosophists' purported universalism was hardly
universal, either, as Theosophists downplayed orthodox Christianity
and Judaism, scorned Confucianism, Islam, Sikhism, and Taoism, and
ignored animism. Still, Theosophist Katherine Tingley did introduce
yoga into Southern California in 1899.

A Swedish woman named Martina Bergman-Österberg becomes the
Superintendent of Physical Education for London's public schools, and
by 1886, she had trained 1,300 English schoolteachers in the methods
of Pehr Ling. However, physical fitness was not her sole purpose.
Instead, said Bergman-Österberg, who was also a feminist, &quot;I try to
train my girls to help raise their own sex, and so accelerate the
progress of the race.&quot;

The British polymath Captain Richard Francis Burton publishes The Book
of the Sword. An idiosyncratic discussion of swordsmanship in Europe,
north Africa, and southwest Asia, it was originally intended as part
of a trilogy. Unfortunately it was released the same year as Egerton
Castle's better-received work and sold poorly, and as a result Burton
never completed the other two books. This is too bad, too, as the
Burton was a man of far-flung interests who delighted in esoteric
footnotes. One, for example, mentioned that the Chinese enjoyed
betting on fights between praying mantises. I suspect, but cannot
prove, that these insect battles, which Burton compared to battles
between human saber fencers, were a source of inspiration for the
Chinese martial art known as t'ang-lang ch'uan, or northern Praying
Mantis. (While tradition says that a Shantung master named Wang Lang
created this style during the late seventeenth century, there is no
documentary evidence of the style's existence before the 1850s.)

1894:

A Philadelphia man named James J. O'Brien accepts a job working for
the foreign settlement police at Nagasaki, Japan. In December 1895 he
was appointed a constable and attached to the Umegasaki Station, a
position he held until leaving for Boston in January 1900. In the
United States in April 1902, O'Brien showed some jujutsu tricks to
President Theodore Roosevelt. This brought him to the attention of
sportswriters such as Robert Edgren, and in April 1905 O'Brien helped
prepare the professional wrestler George Bothner for his contest with
the vaunted Katsukuma Higashi. Other Americans who trained in jujutsu
at Nagasaki before 1910 included Risher Thornberry, who trained scouts
attached to the 91st US Infantry Division during World War I and
afterwards established the American School of Jiu-Jitsu in Los
Angeles.

A Japanese student named Suzuki Daisetz (&quot;D.T. Suzuki&quot;) comes to the
United States, where he remains until 1908. In New York, Suzuki
studied philosophy under a German émigré named Paul Carus, whose
&quot;Science of Religion&quot; taught that religions should reject dogma,
ritual, and formal organizations. During the Russo-Japanese War of
1904-1905, Suzuki also became fascinated with medieval Japanese
warrior culture. So, although he himself formally studied neither Zen
nor swordsmanship, Suzuki's best-known book, Zen and Japanese Culture,
devoted several chapters to the putative relationship between Zen and
swordsmanship. First given as lectures in 1936 and published in 1938,
this text's blend of philosophy and militarism struck a chord when
reprinted in the United States in 1959, and therefore led many non-
Japanese to study Buddhism and swordsmanship more closely.

02/15/1898: The Spanish-American War had its origins in the
rebellion against Spanish rule that began in Cuba in 1895. The
repressive measures that Spain took to suppress the guerrilla war,
such as herding Cuba's rural population into disease-ridden garrison
towns, were graphically portrayed in U.S. newspapers and enflamed
public opinion. In January 1898, violence in Havana led U.S.
authorities to order the battleship USS Maine to the city's port to
protect American citizens. On February 15, a massive explosion of
unknown origin sank the Maine in the Havana harbor, killing 260 of the
400 American crewmembers aboard. An official U.S. Naval Court of
Inquiry ruled in March, without much evidence, that the ship was blown
up by a mine but did not directly place the blame on Spain. Much of
Congress and a majority of the American public expressed little doubt
that Spain was responsible, however, and called for a declaration of
war.

1899:

An English engineer named Edward W. Barton-Wright publishes an article
called &quot;The New Art of Self Defence&quot; in Pearson's Magazine. Barton-
Wright had studied jujutsu while living in Japan, and his &quot;New Art,&quot;
which he immodestly called &quot;Bartitsu,&quot; combined jujutsu with boxing
and savate. Yet, while Barton-Wright was a good enough rough-and-
tumble wrestler, he was no master of Japanese wrestling. This is
hardly unusual in itself, but what was unusual was that Barton-Wright
was honest enough to admit it, and to hire better-qualified teachers
including Tani Yukio and Uyenishi Sadakazu as his instructors. That
said, Sherlock Holmes was Bartitsu's most famous practitioner. In &quot;The
Adventure of the Empty House,&quot; published in Strand Magazine in October
1903, the Great Detective told Dr. Watson that, on the brink of a
Swiss waterfall in 1894, the evil Moriarty &quot;rushed at me and threw his
arms around me. He knew that his own game was up, and was only anxious
to revenge himself upon me. We tottered together on the brink of the
fall. I have some knowledge, however, of baritsu [sic], or the
Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very
useful to me. I slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible
scream kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his
hands. But for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over
he went.&quot;

British journalist W.T.A Beare compares various forms of self-defense.
A good Englishman, he concluded that while each of the &quot;foreign&quot; arts
has some merit, jujutsu and Bartitsu worked best when applied as
surprise attacks, La Canne was too &quot;ornamental&quot; and florid to be much
good, and that any good boxer should be able to defeat a savateur.

United States President Theodore Roosevelt starts studying judo --
then known as jiu-jitsu -- two afternoons a week. Sometimes he studied
in a second-floor office in the White House; other times he studied in
the basement. His training partners included his private secretary,
William Loeb, Jr., and the Japanese naval attaché, Takeshita Isamu.
Roosevelt's instructor was a Japanese named Yamashita Yoshiaki. Sam
Hill, a son-in-law of railroader James J. Hill, had brought Yamashita
to Seattle in September 1903. After a short stay in Seattle, Hill took
Yamashita to Washington, DC, where Hill's estranged wife lived, so
that Yamashita could teach judo to Hill's son. Young James Nathan Hill
was not interested in judo, but the Japanese naval attaché, was.
Through the attaché's influence, Yamashita received an invitation to
demonstrate judo at the White House in March 1904, and almost
immediately after began teaching judo to Roosevelt.

1905:

Hans Köck introduces &quot;Yu-Yitsu&quot; to Vienna. Köck's teachers included
Britain's Uyenishi Sadakazu, and his students included a man named
Henry Bauer, who in turn taught Austrian policemen. Following World
War I, Franz Sager, alias &quot;Willy Curly,&quot; established Austria's first
freestanding &quot;Jiu-Jitsu&quot; school in Vienna, but Austria did not have
any Kodokan yudansha until 1933, at which time judo founder Kano
Jigoro graded Ottokar Klimek to 2-dan.

G.P. Putnam's Sons of New York publishes Nitobe Inazo's Bushido: The
Soul of Japan. As Nitobe was a Quaker schoolmaster, and as his
ghostwriter was a Canadian named Anna Hartshorne, it is not surprising
that his book presented bushido (&quot;Military-Knight-Ways&quot;) as a Japanese
version of chivalry. It may surprise survivors of the Bataan Death
March and the Rape of Nanking to learn that &quot;Tenderness, Pity, and
Love were traits which adorned the most sanguinary exploits of a
samurai.&quot; Nitobe believed that judo, fencing, and archery were good
character-builders. On the other hand, he downplayed mathematical
skill, saying that &quot;chivalry is uneconomical: it boasts of penury.&quot; Or
at least public penury: the leaders of the ten largest zaibatsu
(&quot;financial cliques&quot;) that controlled Japanese land, labor, and
industry were mostly former samurai. (With the notable exception of
the Mitsui family, the traditional mercantile class resisted
modernization.) And to give an idea of the wealth of these penurious
former samurai, the wedding trousseau of 18-year Hitaro Shizue, who
married a baron's son in 1914, was valued at over $10,000.

1906:

Erich Rahn of Berlin opens Germany's first jujutsu school; the style
taught was probably Tsutsumi Hozan-ryu. Rahn taught police detectives
in 1910 and German soldiers in 1913. Early students apparently
included the German Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who wrote in 1919
that jujitsu had been of much use to him over the years. Jujutsu grew
in popularity after the World War, and by 1930, there were three
jujutsu federations and over 100 clubs in Germany and Austria. But,
after British teams practicing Kodokan judo soundly thrashed the
Germans in 1929, most of Germany's 5,600 male and 137 female judoka
claimed to be practicing Kodokan judo rather than Rahn's &quot;European jiu-
jitsu&quot;. During the 1930s, judo was often taught in Hitler Youth
gymnasiums because Adolf Hitler said that it was &quot;not the function of
the folkish state to breed a colony of peaceful aesthetes and physical
degenerates.&quot; However, after World War II, Hitler's support proved
embarrassing. So, although Rahn continued teaching jujutsu in East
Berlin until the mid-1960s, the post-World War II German judo
community prefers to date its origins to the establishment of the
Deutsches Judo Bundes (&quot;German Judo Union&quot;) in Hamburg in 1953.

Irving Hancock's Physical Training for Women by Japanese Methods is
translated into French. Two years later, Hancock's even more profusely
illustrated Complete Tricks of Jujitsu (Kano Method) is also
translated into French; this book is mistitled, however, because the
method shown is more likely a variant of Tsutsumi Hozan-ryu jujutsu.
Pioneering French judo instructors included George Dubois, Guy de
Montgrilhard, and Ernest Régnier. According to the European wrestling
champion George Hackenschmidt, something jujutsu did better than any
French wrestling system was teach wrestlers to attack with their legs.
It also taught students better balance, and had some useful arm-bars
and shoulder rolling techniques.

1907:

A reporter for the Seattle Times visits the Seattle Dojo, the oldest
extant Kodokan judo school in the United States. (It was probably
established in late 1903 or early 1904, and was first visited by the
Japanese consul -- the club's honorary leader -- in early 1907.) The
instructor was Kono Iitaro. Four months later, another judoka named
Ito Tokugoro replaced Kono as head instructor, and as Ito became a
famous professional wrestler while Kono faded into obscurity, the
founding of the Seattle Dojo is often attributed to Ito.

Japanese national champion Hitachiyama becomes the first sumotori to
visit the United States. Weighing over 300 pounds, and having a chest
nearly as big as his 6' height, the giant Japanese wrestler never lost
to a European or American opponent. But, as John Gilbey says, wherever
did he find someone willing to play?

1908:

With the patronage of Colonel Sir Malcolm Fox, inspector of gymnasia,
the British Brigade of Guards hires professionals to teach its
enlisted men to box according to Queensberry rules. The boxing was
supposed to develop aggressiveness in recruits while simultaneously
improving their skills in bayonet fighting. Championships were held
annually at Aldershot and other divisional training sites. The
Canadian Army adopted the British program in 1916 and the United
States followed suit in 1918. Around the same time, the Irish Guards
also contracted for some jujutsu exhibitions. The Japanese instructor
at Aldershot and Shorncliffe Camp was the professional wrestler
Uyenishi Sadakazu.

1909:

Japanese physical educators begin calling shinai fencing kendo,
meaning &quot;the Way of the Sword.&quot; Pioneers included Takano Sasaburo of
the Ona-ha Itto-ryu, who taught at the Tokyo Teacher's College where
Kano Jigoro was president, and Torakichi Ozawa of the Hokushin Itto-
ryu. Although the Ministry of Education preferred the name shinai
kyogi, or bamboo stick competition, the older name gekken remained in
use in Japan until 1928, when the newspaper magnate Noma Seija created
the Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei (&quot;All Japan Kendo Federation&quot;), and in the
Americas well into the 1930s. For example, a gekken tournament was
held in Salt Lake City, Utah, in October 1931. In this latter
tournament, the participants were mostly Nisei youth. Their teachers
were men named Sasaki, Teshirogi, Narita, and Miura. Gekken
tournaments were also held in Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, and
Steveston, British Columbia during the 1930s. About 30 of the 200
Seattle-area kendoka were female.

Kaneshige Naomatsu and Teshima Shigemi establish a judo club at
Kaneshige's home in Honolulu. In 1913, Kano Jigoro visited Hawaii and
named this school the Shunyo Kan. About the same time, Kitayama Yajiro
and Mino Nakajiro established the Shobu Kan Judo Club in the basement
of the Ono Bakery on Beretania Street. Hawaiian judo was technically
good, and the Kodokan accepted the Hawaii Judo Yudanshakai (Black Belt
Association) in September 1932. The Honolulu clubs also offered judo
classes for women, and early female instructors included Shizuko
Murasaki, Matsue Honda, and Yasue Kuniwake. Most Hawaiian judoka were
of Japanese ancestry, and as a result the Hawaiian Black Belt
Association's constitution, by-laws, and proceedings were all written
in Japanese until 1963.

In his book called Complete Science of Wrestling, George Hackenschmidt
writes that an amateur wrestler's training should include lifting
weights three times a week, gymnastics or calisthenics another two to
three times a week, and fast walking or jogging for ten miles daily.
Hackenschmidt also recommended that wrestlers study jujutsu, as it
included the leg sweeps, trips, and chokes that Greco-Roman wrestling
lacked.

Briton Ernest J. Harrison, the third European to earn shodan ranking
in Kodokan judo, publishes The Fighting Spirit of Japan. This was the
first English-language book to describe judo and other modern Japanese
martial arts from an insider's perspective.

1914:

Maeda Mitsuyo, a judo 5-dan who had wrestled professionally in the
United States, Britain, Spain, Cuba, Panama, and Mexico, settles in
Brazil. Around 1919, while working for a Brazilian circus, Maeda
taught a mix of Kodokan judo and catch-as-catch-can wrestling to a 17-
year old Brazilian named Carlos Gracie. In 1924 Gracie opened a
commercial martial arts academy, first in Belém and then in Rio de
Janeiro, and his students included his younger brother Hélio, who from
1932 to the mid-1950s was a well-known Brazilian professional
wrestler. Hélio's sons Royce, Rorian, and Rickson continued in their
father's profession, and during the 1990s they made Gracie Jiu-Jitsu®
famous throughout the world. Carlos Gracie's nephews, meanwhile,
introduced a related style called Machado Jiu-Jitsu® into the United
States in 1990.

Ryukyuan cane cutters introduce Okinawan sumo into the Hawaiian
Islands. Okinawan sumo was somewhat different from the Japanese game.
For example, officials restarted bouts whenever one of the players was
thrown to his stomach or knees. Also, in the Okinawan version, only
falls to the back counted for points. By the 1930s, there were annual
tournaments on all the major islands. The biggest tournament took
place on Oahu, at Kapiolani Park. It started at 10:30 a.m. and went
until 5:00 p.m., and drew several hundred spectators. There were three
weight divisions, 150 pounds and over, 130-149 pounds, and 129 pounds
and under. This being the Depression, most of the wrestlers were in
the last two categories. The dress code required a pair of shorts and
a red or white belt, 15-18 feet long and 20 inches wide, folded to
four inches in width and tied in the front.

In Vladivostok, Vasili Sergevich Oshchepkov organizes Russia's first
judo club; men who trained there included Britain's E.J. Harrison.
Born on Sakhalin Island in 1892, in 1906 Oshchepkov was sent to a
Russian Orthodox mission in Japan. Admitted to the Kodokan in 1911, he
earned his dan ranking in about six months and his 2-dan grade in
about two years. In 1914 he moved to Vladivostok, where he taught judo
and did translations. In 1921 he went to work for the Red Army, and in
1929 he introduced judo to Moscow. In 1932 he organized Russia's first
judo tournament and the following year he published judo's first
Russian language rules. In 1936 the Leningrad Sport Committee
prohibited a competition between the Moscow and Leningrad teams.
Outraged, Oshchepkov wrote protests to various government offices.
This led to his being arrested on the charge of being a Japanese spy,
and in October 1937 he died from what the NKVD termed a &quot;fit of
angina.&quot; His students took the hint and in November 1938 Anatoli
Arcadievich Kharlampiev announced the invention of &quot;Soviet freestyle
wrestling,&quot; which coincidentally looked a lot like Russian-rules judo.
Following World War II, Stalin decided that the USSR would compete in
the Olympics. Since the Olympics already had freestyle wrestling, in
1946 Soviet freestyle wrestling was officially renamed sambo, which
was an acronym for &quot;self-defense without weapons&quot; (SAMozashcita Bez
Oruzhiya). The acronym was the creation of Vladimir Spiridonov, who
had studied catch-as-catch-can, Greco-Roman, and Mongol wrestling, but
as he had been an officer in the Tsarist army, of course the Soviets
downplayed his contributions, too. Due to Soviet influences, between
1921 and the present sambo has diverged significantly from judo.
Technical differences include sambo players wearing tight jackets,
shorts, and shoes; using mats instead of tatami (this in turn causes
sambo coaches to stress groundwork and submission holds rather than
high throws); and a philosophy that emphasized sport and self-defense
rather than character development.

.       06/28/1914: In an event that is widely regarded as sparking
the outbreak of World War I, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the
Austro-Hungarian empire, is shot to death along with his wife by a
Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo, Bosnia. Ferdinand had been inspecting
his uncle's imperial armed forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite
the threat of Serbian nationalists who wanted the Austrian possessions
to join newly independent Serbia.
.

open car with little security when Serbian nationalist Nedjelko
Cabrinovic threw a bomb at their car. Ferdinand managed to deflect the
bomb onto the street, but a dozen people, including Sophie, were
injured. Later in the day, the archduke and his wife were driving
through Sarajevo's streets again when their driver took a wrong turn
onto a street named after the archduke's uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.
As the car slowed to change direction, another Serbian nationalist,

In Jiu-Jitsu: A Manual of the Science, Leopold McLaglan describes
various throws and holds adopted for military use. Yet McLaglan did
not understand the reality of patrolling no-man's land, and omitted
descriptions of strangleholds, defenses against knife attacks, and the
use of the steel helmet for attack and defense until the publication
of his 1942 book called, appropriately enough, Unarmed Attack and
Defence. By that time, Commandos had been learning such techniques for
at least two years, so in this McLaglan was, as usual, simply

Koizumi Gunji establishes the Budokwai, Britain's first Kodokan judo
school, at 15 Lower Grosvenor Place in London. (Barton-Wright's school
was earlier, but it was not traditional.) Koizumi's chief instructor
was Tani Yukio, the music hall wrestler whom Barton-Wright had brought
to England in 1899. Tani spent four or five hours a day on the mats,
and taught his students to constantly attack. &quot;In one of my early
contests at Cambridge I scored quickly with a foot throw,&quot; said Trevor
Leggett, an early student, in an article published in Judo in 1955.
&quot;Then we went to the ground, where I got astride I clung on for the
rest of the time, pretending to go for neck locks. With my one point I
won my contest. Mr. Tani wouldn't speak to me after the contest or on
the way back to London with the team. But just as we were all
separately to go home, he said, 'Coward.' It took me some time to get
over that, but it was a good lesson.&quot; When the Budokwai affiliated
with the Kodokan in 1920, Tani was awarded a second-dan rank. One has
to agree with Graham Noble that Tani was probably &quot;a real strong
second-dan.&quot;

1919:

Katherine White-Cooper becomes the first woman to join the London judo
club called the Budokwai. &quot;The memory of early days at the club brings
back many happy occasions,&quot; said White-Cooper thirty years later.
&quot;Perhaps especially choice were those evenings set aside for the only
lady member, who thereby enjoyed exclusive practice with the Founder
[Koizumi Gunji], with periods of rest when there could be delightful
and unhurried talks, sitting quietly on the mats. What fine practice!
What good talks!&quot;

1920:

In Georgia, a US Army officer named Allan Corstorphin Smith publishes
The Secrets of Jujitsu: A Complete Course in Self Defense. The book,
published as a series of pamphlets, was essentially Kodokan judo
modified for a military recruit environment. Concepts introduced in
this book included Stahara as an acronym for the Japanese shita hara,
meaning abdomen. Stahara has since been replaced in most books by the
more descriptive &quot;centering,&quot; but it nevertheless remained in use in
US military manuals until at least the 1950s.

1921:

Ueshiba Morihei opens a small dojo in Tokyo. There he taught aiki
budo, or &quot;The Unified Spirit Style Martial Way.&quot; Aiki budo differed
from judo in several ways. First, it placed more emphasis on spirit
than sport. (Ueshiba was a member of a heterodox religious group
called Omotokyo.) Second, the players did not start out touching, but
stayed apart. (The moment the aiki budo players touched, the outcome
was supposedly almost determined.) Most importantly, aiki budo's
movement was spiraling. (Karate and judo, by way of contrast, were
essentially linear. The difference was that aiki budo developed from
fencing and spear fighting whereas karate and judo developed from
boxing and wrestling.) With patronage from several leading admirals,
Ueshiba's fame grew, and during the winter of 1931-1932, Ueshiba moved
to a larger eighty tatami hall, also in Tokyo. Admiral Takeshita Isamu
made the art's first foreign demonstrations in the United States in
October 1935.

1922:

After hearing a debate featuring the Russian mystic George Ivanovitch
Gurdjieff, Alfred Orage starts publishing articles that introduce
middle-class British readers to Sufism and other non-Western
philosophies. Arcane blends of these philosophies then become known as
&quot;New Age,&quot; after the name of Orage's literary magazine.

A Norwegian diplomat named Lauritz Grønvold undertakes judo studies at
the Kodokan in Tokyo. Upon leaving Japan six years later, Grønvold
receives his black belt at a ceremony attended by the Emperor, making
him the first (and perhaps only) European to be so honored. Other
Scandinavian judo pioneers include Haakon Schonning, who started
teaching Fairbairn's defendu system to Norwegian policemen in 1929;
Knud Janson, who established a judo organization in Copenhagen in
1944; Viking Cronholm and Einar Thunander, who introduced judo into
Sweden during the late 1940s; and Torsten Muren, who established a
judo club in Helsinki in 1958. Early Scandinavian instructors were
usually foreign: British at the Norwegian clubs, French at the Danish
clubs, German at the Swedish clubs, and Japanese at the Finnish
clubs.

1923:
1924:

A German professor named Eugen Herrigel begins teaching European
philosophy at the Tohoku Higher School in Sendai. Shortly afterwards,
Herrigel also began studying kyudo, or Japanese archery, under Awa
Kenzo, as a way of learning more about Japanese culture. As he didn't
speak Japanese well, his interpreter was a Japanese law professor
named Komachiya Sozo. Upon returning home to Germany in 1929, Herrigel
wrote a famous book called Zen in the Art of Archery. Ironically,
neither Awa nor Komachiya had any training in Zen. Herrigel, though,
was personally interested in mysticism, and so his imagination colored
Awa's explanations. As a result, the much less pretentious book on
ikebana, or flower arranging, written by Herrigel's wife Gustie is
actually the more profound.

1927:

Zenshuji, a Soto Zen temple, is established in Los Angeles, for
Japanese Americans but acts as a bridge between Japanese and European
Americans.

Suzuki publishes &quot;Essays in Zen Buddhism&quot;.

1928:

Dr. A. J. (&quot;Jack&quot;) Ross introduces Kodokan judo to Brisbane,
Australia. A physically imposing six-footer, Ross studied judo from
the age of fourteen while living with his parents in Japan. Although
Ross tried to popularize judo in Australia by holding fairground
wrestling matches, he found little interest in his methods until World
War II, when the Australian Army hired him to teach hand-to-hand
combat. Sue Hendy, who took the gold in the 1978 world championships,
is the perhaps the best-known post-WWII Australian judo practitioner.

An article in a Seattle newspaper called the Japanese-American Courier
says that there are no non-Japanese who have ever learned judo to a
successful degree. Therefore judo is an art peculiarly fitted for the
Japanese. Continued the anonymous editorialist, &quot;Judo is materially
the same as jiu jitsu in practical methods but the difference lies in
the theories of instruction and learning. Judo trains not only the
physical, as jiu jitsu, but also the mental side of a person. This
mental side of the training probably has a great deal to do in
wrestlers of other nationalities not being able to become adept in the
art.&quot; Curiously, the Japanese American editorialist didn't continue
his argument to describe why Japanese and Japanese Americans were
rarely as good at boxing as Koreans or Filipinos.

1929:

Seishiro &quot;Henry&quot; Okazaki of Kahului, Maui, publishes The Science of
Self-defense of Girls &amp; Women. The method shown was Kodenkan, or
Danzan Ryu, jujutsu. (In Sino-Japanese, Danzan Ryu literally means
&quot;Sandalwood Mountain Old Flow,&quot; which in turn translates into
&quot;Hawaiian-style&quot;, while Kodenkan means &quot;Old Traditions School&quot;.)
Although Okazaki had 2-dan ranking in Kodokan judo, Kodenkan jujutsu
combined techniques from Yoshin-ryu jujutsu, western boxing and
wrestling, Okinawan karate, and Hawaiian lua. &quot;In truth,&quot; admit
members of the American Judo and Jujitsu Federation in the preface to
the modern edition, &quot;the techniques as portrayed here are not
impressive. Neither do they reflect the comprehensive nature of the
entire system. Perhaps their value is that they held the seeds of
something better.&quot;

1930:

Ark Yuey Wong begins teaching southern Five Animals, southern Shaolin,
and northern Praying Mantis ch'uan fa to the members of the Los
Angeles-based Wong Wen-sun Chinese Benevolent Association. Although
Wong had been giving private lessons since his arrival in San
Francisco in 1922, this was the first known public ch'uan fa
instruction in North America.

Seishiro &quot;Henry&quot; Okazaki establishes Danzan Ryu jujutsu on Oahu. (He
had previously taught on Maui and Big Island.) His first class had six
students, and to the disgust of many people, these classes were as
interracially mixed as Hawaii itself. Classes were held six days a
week, with a Sunday class at Okazaki's home for special students. Due
to students such as Sig Kufferath offering classes at the Honolulu
YMCA, modern Danzan Ryu stylists have asserted that Okazaki's methods
influenced US Army Field Manual 21-150, Unarmed Defense for the
American Soldier, dated June 30, 1942. However, this causality is not
proved. Similar commercial texts appeared during World War II; among
them were Unarmed Combat by Britain's James Hipkiss, Combat Without
Weapons by Canada's E. Hartley Leather, and How to Fight Tough by New
York's Jack Dempsey and Frank G. Menke. Although the military text was
fairly matter of fact, the commercial texts were often lurid. For
example, in Dempsey's How to Fight Tough, Dempsey (or, more likely,
his ghostwriter Menke) wrote, &quot;The Coast Guardsman who ... plunges his
bayonet in a Jap's belly [does not do it] for the joy of seeing blood
run -- an unbearable Nipponese pastime -- but to stop sooner the flow
of blood from the veins of free and innocent men the world over.&quot;

1931:

An English professional wrestler named Jack Robinson begins teaching
judo and jujutsu by correspondence course in South Africa. During the
1950s, Robinson's son Joe returned to Britain, where he did show
wrestling for Sir Atholl Oakeley. He also taught at a judo school in
Brighton. While Joe Robinson claimed to be about equal to a third-
degree black belt in Kodokan judo and almost as good in Cumberland
wrestling, he was mostly just a show wrestler.

Two Rinzai monks, Nyogen Senzaki and Sokei-an, colleagues of Soen
Shaku, teach Zen at a &quot;floating zendo,&quot; in New York and L.A.

1932:

Dwight Goddard, following Protestant missionary work in Asia,
publishes The Buddhist Bible.

1933:

After Kano Jigoro visits Moshe Feldenkrais's Jiu-Jitsu Club Franco-
Israelite in Paris, the French start calling their sport &quot;judo&quot;
instead of &quot;jiu-jitsu.&quot;

The first karate club to allow Caucasian membership is formed in the
basement of Honolulu's First Methodist Church. Its instructors were
Mutsu Zuiho and Higaonna Kamesuke.

1934:

The former circus strongman Maurice Van Nieuwenhuizen starts teaching
jujutsu in The Hague, Netherlands. Cartoonist Alfred Mazure was among
his students, and so Van Nieuwenhuizen became the model for the Dutch
cartoon and film hero &quot;Dick Bos.&quot; Mazure also provided some of the
illustrations for Van Nieuwenhuizen's three Dutch judo books. In 1947,
Van Nieuwenhuizen and a former schoolteacher named Simon Van Harten
became pioneers of the Netherlands judo federation. Van
Nieuwenhuizen's postwar students included Olympic champion Anton
Geesink.

Ogawa Tyuzo introduces Kodokan judo to Brazil. Ogawa's techniques
supposedly influenced capoeira Regional. This is possible, as Ogawa's
judo students and Mestre Bimba's capoeira Regional players came from
similar middle and upper class backgrounds. However, the influence may
have had a more pragmatic basis. In 1928, a judoka fought a
capoeirista in a São Paulo fairground. Said the Japanese-American
Courier's account of the match, the much larger Bahian easily knocked
the Japanese down. But when he went to finish the fight by kicking the
Japanese in the head, &quot;The little oriental by the use of a Jiu Jitsu
hold threw the Bahian and after a short struggle he was found sitting
on the silent frame of the massive opponent.&quot;

In a lecture given to the Parnassus Society in Athens, Greece, Kano
Jigoro says that judo has two aims. The first is to achieve one's
goals through the most efficient use of mental and physical energy;
the second is to maximize the progress and harmony of the group.
Physical education, on the other hand, had four aims: health,
strength, utility, and spiritual training. Spiritual training included
intellectual, moral, and esthetic phases. Anything less was not judo.
Unfortunately, said Kano, &quot;Are not many of the promoters of physical
education laying too much stress on strength and skill? Into such
mistakes people naturally fall because the aim of physical education
is not set forth and the inter-relation of those four items is not
seriously studied.&quot;

Goju-ryu karate teacher Miyagi Chojun visits Honolulu, where he gives
karate demonstrations to the Okinawan community. Among his students
was a Hawaiian jujutsuka and professional wrestling champion named Oki
Shikina, who after World War II became a well-known professional
wrestling official in Japan.

Twenty-seven-year old Charles Kenn of Honolulu organizes a play
featuring ancient Hawaiian games and sports. His goal was to replicate
a traditional mahahiki festival, and this included replicating lua and
other combative sports that had been virtually extinct since the
arrival of missionaries and smallpox during the 1840s. Toward that
end, he learned to read Hawaiian and trained with Danzan Ryu stylists.
In 1950 Kenn received a personal account of the lua, in Hawaiian, from
an 88-year old man that detailed the two schools of the nineteenth
century. &quot;To really do justice to the Oriental hand fighting arts,&quot;
Kenn wrote Robert W. Smith in November 1964, &quot;one must understand all
phases of the culture and the place that the h.f. [hand fighting] arts
have in that culture; they should not be taken apart from the culture
which brought them into existence.&quot;

1935:

Kawaishi Mikonosuke introduces Butokukai judo to Paris. At the front
of Kawaishi's school was a blackboard. On this board, Kawaishi wrote
the names of his techniques. In front of each name was a number, like
so:

Ashi-waza (Leg technique)
1. Osoto-gari
2. De-ashi-barai
3. Hiza-guruma

Kawaishi would then say, &quot;I will teach you the first movement,&quot; and
the students would follow along. As the numbers were in French, the
students thus &quot;learned by the numbers.&quot; Kawaishi's inspiration was
probably American self-defense instruction, as by 1935, New York
wrestling instructor Will Bingham had been teaching women &quot;to dispose
of a masher with neatness and dispatch [using] grip No. 7 followed by
hold No. 9&quot; for at least twenty years.

the Jiu Jitsu Department some time ago and has been sponsoring regular
tournaments since last year.&quot; The men sent were Kotani Sumiyuki and
Sato Chugo. When subsequently asked which of the South American judoka
had impressed him the most, Kotani tactfully replied, &quot;I cannot answer
this, it's a very hard question. But when I was in the USA in 1932,
most of the judoka were very competent ... So too was Mr. [Trevor]

__________________________________________________

I'll make that observation again ...

World Wars limit the spread of Zen and the Martial Arts, up to the end
of the Second World War. Then the trend changes.

Everything has its purpose. Good and evil come from the same source,
and serve the purposes of that source. That's the big picture.

As individuals, we have to choose what we will serve, good or evil.
Not choosing leads to evil. Switching sides leads to evil. You have to
know what side you're on, and not knowing, or being confused leads to
evil. That's the small picture.

I know this, I want to be on the right side.

____ Epilog _______________________________________

The Buddha's highest teachings were the purpose of the Buddha's advent
on this earth.

The Buddha did not appear on this earth to drain people's compassion
with discussions of the emptiness and meaninglessness of life which is
just a void.

The Buddha did not appear on this earth to teach people to live in
such a narrow and momentary way, that there would be no context for
self-examination and conscience.

The Buddha did not appear on this earth to possess people's minds with
such illogic as to befuddle their ability to choose correctly between
what is good and what is evil.

The Buddha did not appear on this earth to teach people how to commit
atrocities and genocide, in the exploration of their &quot;infinite
possibilities&quot;, or &quot;new states of being&quot;.

The Buddha did not appear on this earth to teach people how to maim
and kill with their hands efficiently, quietly, loudly, with increased
terror inflicted, or to maximize their subjugation to control the
public sentiments for political ends.

These are all profoundly evil distortions of the Buddha's true
teachings, which introduce infinities in the variables holding good
and evil, removing all shades of gray in the propositional calculus of
value.

Simply stated, the Buddha made his advent on this earth with the
purpose of teaching the compassionate way of the bodhisattva, which is
at the heart of the true entity of all phenomena, which is the eternal
Buddha at one with the eternal Law. Which is how to navigate the sea
of sufferings of birth, aging, sickness and death. He originally set
out on his path, because of his observation of the sufferings of
common people and wanting to understand the source of those sufferings
(enlightened wisdom) and how to transform those sufferings into
unshakable happiness (enlightened action).

When you embrace the void, your initial intent to bring tranquility
and enlightenment to your life doesn't matter ... the result is always
the same:  chaos and misery, and utter ruination and emptiness to you,
your family, and your country.

But things don't have to be that way ...
___________________________________________________

Nichiren Daishonin writes (Encouragement to a Sick Person, WND p. 78):

.   &quot;During the Former and Middle Days of the Law, the
.   five impurities began to appear, and in the Latter
.   Day, they are rampant. They give rise to the great
.   waves of a gale, which not only beat against the
.   shore, but strike each other. The impurity of
.   thought has been such that, as the Former and
.   Middle Days of the Law gradually passed, people
.   transmitted insignificant erroneous teachings
.   while destroying the unfathomable correct
.   teaching. It therefore appears that more people
.   have fallen into the evil paths because of errors
.   with respect to Buddhism than because of secular
.   misdeeds.&quot;

Because Bodhidharma discarded the Buddha's highest teaching (the Lotus
Sutra), and due to his lazy nature turned to shortcuts to
enlightenment, he came to the distorted view that life is acausal and
empty, that the true entity is the void.

This erroneous view really comes from a misunderstanding of the Sutra
of Immeasurable Meanings, where the True Entity is described by
negation (the only way it can be): &quot;... neither square, nor round,
neither short, nor long, ...&quot;

The description of the True Entity is logically voidal, but the True
Entity itself is not. Bodhidharma was simply confused, due to the
slander of negligence (laziness), and false confidence. The truth of
life is that at the heart of the True Entity is the compassion of a
bodhisattva for others.

Non-substantiality does not mean empty. Life has value. Humans are
respectworthy. There is a purpose to everything. And every cause has
an effect, so we are responsible for our thoughts, words and deeds.
Zen is acausal. Zen is the greatest poison, which compares to the even
greater medicine of the Lotus Sutra.

Suffice it to say: the purpose of Zen in the world is to corrupt and
undermine everything that is not based upon the truth and the true
teaching. All religions, disciplines, institutions and organizations
which are undermined by Zen will eventually fall after glaring
revelation of their worst defects, sooner rather than later.

If there is some good in your family, locality, society and culture,
or country that you would like to retain, then cease the Zen, and
begin to apply the medicine of the Lotus Sutra to heal the Zen wound
in your life.

&quot;Zen is the work of devilish minds.&quot; - Nichiren

has now been fulfilled.
I have converted all living beings
