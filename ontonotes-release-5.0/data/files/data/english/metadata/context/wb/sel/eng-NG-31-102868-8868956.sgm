I hope the image matches the poetic description of the chase.
Cheers.

Subject: (delhibirdpix) Chasing the European Roller

&quot;Let's chase the European Roller!&quot; - that was our rallying cry this
morning after much deliberation at Sultanpur on whether or not to go
to the jheel first or to have a look at the Flats, to pursue the paler
version of our more lively-coloured, ubiquitous bird, the Indian
Roller.  It wasn't an easy decision.  At the Sultanpur entry gates, we
were focused on a pair of Black-rumped Flamebacks that offered
photographic opportunities and a taste of what the forests around the
jheel might surprise us with.  The lure of the European Roller was too
strong .....We turned towards the flats....

The iridescence of the dark wings of the Woolly-necked Storks were
caught on camera; we caught our breaths (and almost choked) as one
bird gobbled a large amphibian that must have kept jumping up as hard
as the stork tried to swallow him down!  Mandibles agape, the stork
pumped its throat until the agitated frog could no longer struggle
against the bird's throat muscles.

Further into the flats, now covered with short grass, were Black Ibis.
With glowing white shoulder patches and red legs, they showed a
preference for these drying wet grasslands of the Sultanpur flats.

But, to the exclusion of all other species, we drove away from these
birds and into mire.  Having stuck one vehicle in the mud and one bird
in our brains, we walked into the distance to the farthest telephone
poles.

On the wires sat lone individuals of the European Roller.  Such
vantage points provided easy lookouts for this bird.  Its
uninterrupted view of its surroundings also alerted it to over-eager
birders, not to speak of our photographer friends!  The more
spectacular 'Blue Jay' is evidently more approachable and less alarmed
of the apparent aggressiveness of the birder.  Perhaps his bird brain
sees beyond our intrusive behaviour and connects with the passionate
embrace of our hearts.  Not so the European Roller - for our every
step forward, it flew several strokes away - away from these bright,
brisk and busy birders.

However, it flattered us with a fly-past designed to show off its
blue-black flight feathers and its light blue underparts.  From afar,
this light blue could look almost white.  Its mantle, a rich rufous
brown is another point of difference.  It contrasts nicely with the
turquoise-blue cast to its crown and nape.  In the Indian Roller this
reddish brown colouring is restricted to a collar on the hind neck.
Both birds pounce on their quarry below - dining on beetles, crickets,
grasshoppers, lizards, centipedes and frogs.  Tiny frogs were
certainly in abundance in the fields that we walked through ...

At the Sultanpur flats our tally was 7-8 birds. Visible at closer
range in the fields surrounding (1) Sohna, and (2) Ballabgarh which
lies south of Faridabad and Badkal Lake, were some 8-9 individuals.
It was sheer madness to drive in the burning heat and oppressive
humidity to see more and more of these elusive birds that are probably
on their autumn migration.  All other species received our careless
attention - the Crested Larks in well-defined dress, the energetic
engagements of Ashy-crowned Sparrow-lark pairs, the Plain Prinia
pouring out its rapid wheezy trill of a song, and the weak flutter of
the Paddyfield Pipit showing off its pure white outer tail feathers.

Sweat drenched our clothes not our spirits.  We returned late
afternoon after a long day of happy chasing!
