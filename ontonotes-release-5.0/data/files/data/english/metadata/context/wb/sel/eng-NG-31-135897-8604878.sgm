Some minor spoilers but the good news is real time dynamic shadows and

This era has the smell of the Daikatona period. Everyone holding on that
bit late, getting pipped by a better game, going back to do something
else better and then getting pipped again, and again .... Bioshock gets
the dough folks. And Valve of course :-;

Can you be more specific on those? I can't get the video to show up
correctly. After both the Bioshock and Airborne demos show no Doom3 or
FEAR type shadows, I wonder if the Unreal 3 engine can do theses and I
would be positively surprised if Valve managed to add it to Source.

From what I understand (and I could be wrong), the shadowing system in
Source now works properly and the surrounding lights are taken into
account when calculating the shadows an object casts, unlike before
where the lighting was fairly static. You've still got soft-shadows like
in the original HL2, but shine a flashlight at Alyx and she'll cast
another shadow as you'd expect. Boxes, barrels and other objects will
also cast more shadows when more lights are introduced, and so on.

The game won't be using stencil shadows like Doom 3/FEAR does, which is
good, because shadows with fine edges look like crap.

That's an improvement then. But will the shadows be only on the floor or
also on the wall and on other boxes or pipes possibly behind the lighted
object? After all the latter was what made Doom 3 and FEAR special. Just
dynamic shadows on the floor was done in a lot of other engines I think.

Each time I tried to play the trailer located there, my Internet
Explorer crashed. So that I found the same trailer on YouTube,
http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ng3Pm1V9zrI

It is good, but I expected to see something like that. So that I am
not surprised and am not impressed  :-(

I have a hunch that they would release a multiplayer game based on
HL2:Ep2. The indirect proof is that they gave away for free the HL2DM.

Glad to see Foolsgold answered your question.  Just one point.  D3
needed a lot more than fancy lighting to make it special - it wasn't,
and the combat was what made FEAR special for me not the lighting
(though I like any game where I can tell there's someone around the
corner because of a shadow of them).  HL2 was a great game without the
fancy effects and while I'm happy the engine is continuing to develop
I'm more interested in fun gameplay (linear or not).

Thanks for that link, I coudn't watch the other with Firefox either. Now
Alyx is indeed casting dynamic shadows from the flashlight on everything!
But then already in the scene after this is shown I noticed barrels in the
flashlight cone which didn't cast any shadows at all. So it's no integral
solution like with Doom 3 or FEAR but just a sticked on effect like HDR?

Might be due to performance issues, the fact that only certain objects
get new shadows (eg. NPCs).  Either that or Valve only felt confident
about improving certain parts of the lighting system - ripping it out
and plugging in an entirely new dynamic system would probably have taken
even longer, and it's been long enough for EP2.

Guessing you'll have to wait for Episode 3 for that tech. :)

Have you noticed that Valve is gradually getting out of the
game-development  business? They are just patching up Source for a
final gasp at Hl2:Ep2 and TF2. No new engine here. And then will
probably spend the next few years with console ports, milking the
Half-Life franchise to death.  Wondered why Ep2 has taken so long? If
Ep3 ever emerges, expect it to be just another expansion based on the
same engine update as Ep2. Valve might even contract Ep3 development
out to a third-party. Steam brings in a lot more money than
game-development, with a lot fewer resources and is far less riskier.
Steam is obviously Valve's long-term business focus.... until the
company is sold and Gabe 'n Doug sail off into the sunset.
