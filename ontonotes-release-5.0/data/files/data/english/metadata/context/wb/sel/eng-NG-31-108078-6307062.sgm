What's your favorite project that you have completed under $5?  This is $5
for the project, not including extra parts that you had to buy.  (Swapping
out plastic wheels for metal ones, for example, is about a $2.50 per car
project.)

My favorite thus far, and cheapest, has been a N-scale track inspection
car.  I cut the base out of a broken CD jewel case, and attached trucks to
it using parts left over from swapping out trucks/couplers on the cars I
run.  My cost: Free.

1.  Coal and ore loads.  Cut a piece of 3/4" soft pine to fit the open
top of the car.  Plane and file the topside down to a reasonable mounded
shape.  Paint to match the load.  Spread white glue liberally on the
wood, and cover with scale sized coal or ore.
2.  Upgrade low cost rolling stock.  Take your typical yard sale train
set car.  Cut off the molded on grab irons, drill holes and insert wire
grabs.  Install body mount Kadee couplers.  Cut the talgo mount couplers
off the trucks.  Wash and spray paint car and trucks with red auto
primer.  Mask the topside and paint the under side with dark gray auto
primer.  Decal the car for your favorite road.  Brush paint the faces of
the plastic wheels grimy black or rust.  Topcoat with Dullcote to seal
in the decals.
3.  Auxillary AC power pack.  Get a 12 volt AC transformer from Radio
Shack.  Find a blown out PC power supply.  Remove the electronics from
the power supply and you have a nice metal case, with switch, line cord,
and fuse to hold the transformer.  Drill for, and mount a couple of 5
way terminal binding posts to connect accessories to.  This works for
lamps and twin coil switch machines.

I usually toss a small chunk of charcoal briquette into an electric
coffee grinder. The scale determines how long you let it run. Same
trick works for balsa chunks dyed with food coloring for other
loads. Cheap and easy to glue, as you noted, with white glue.

Pd:

I scratchbuilt a small bungalow from cereal-box cardboard with
homemade grocery-sack shingled walls and roof and a back
sun porch with lichen plants for the cost of the paint and glue
used...probably no more than $1.  This is my favorite modeling
technique, learned from an old Raymond F. Yates book called
"How to Improve your Model Railroad", and with it I have at
various times built:

a water tower (mushroom can with card wrapper, stripwood)
a locomotive crane (first rolling-stock project ever)
a freelanced centercab diesel (on an ancient and extra-
ordinarily heavy Botchmann GP30 drive :) )
a replica of some old stores in my home town
a small country church
an engine house (this one was made from  matboard).
Unfortunately, most of these have been lost over the years,
but I still have the second one I built (a small, one-room cottage
with index-card lap siding), that house, the crane, and that water
tank.
It's so fun to build stuff.

Other bizarre, cheap projects:

a battery-powered railcar from a slot-car chassis and an old
Tyco caboose body from the scrap box

a coal yard with a conveyor built from scraps, a caboose body
for the office, piles of crushed-charcoal coal mentioned above

a junk yard on the same spur made of everything and anything
I had handy

a city park with a bench, basketball half-court, trash can, swings,
and seesaws, as well as vegetation, made from bits of this and
that

an extreeeemely ugly custom tank-engine body for a Model Power
2-6-0, made from posterboard over the filed-down plastic shell,
now mercifully lost

a rather clunky wood-and-card 2-4-0 body, made to mount on the
filed down chassis of an IHC Old Timer 0-4-0, somewhat like an
oversized Baldwin engine of the early 1900s

Man, I wish I had kept more of this stuff...

My generator for wind turbines (or lagrge electrical motor).

Everything was "on stock" for the price of zero danish kroners.

The last picture doesn't give the generator the right credit, on 20cm's
distance it looks great.

Why be a cheapskate?  $5 is tip money.  $50 is modeling money.  I am
sure the hobby stores love to see you come in the door with $5 to
spend.  If you are that cheap don't bother with metal wheels.

That's my kind of project too.

Hey, you know what you should do? Make a mold of the motor/generator so
you can cast lots of them (plaster would probably work fine, or some
kind of plastic resin). You could make bunches of them.

I can make bunches of then from wood and plastic, the way i did it

A hobby is something that is done for one's own entertainment.

Model railroading is a hobby.

Therefore, there is no "wrong" way to do it unless it involves doing
something that might kill or injure someone or otherwise cause severe
damages.
