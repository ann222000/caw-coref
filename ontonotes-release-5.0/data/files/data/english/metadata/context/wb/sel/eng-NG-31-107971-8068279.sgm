I have been selling on EBay fro over 5 years and this is a first.

I sent a gold San Fran Old Mint out last Monday....Priority and
Insured....when it was delivered..all the packaging was there, including the
coin capsule...but NO GOLD Coin........

How easy is this going to be dealing with the USPS.......I have the receipt
for the postage and insurance..

Thanks,
Bob

Are you saying that the recipient claims that the coin was absent from a
shipment that was received?  If you initiate a claim, he/she will eventually
have to sign a USPS insurance inquiry to this effect if that is the case.
That occasionally will cause missing items to miraculously re-appear.
Therein lies your hope.

Yes--he said the coin was missing,but the capsule was in the US MINT
Package....he is sending the Box back to me...I think I have to give it to
the local post office........then we will see...my guess is someone used a
razor blade to open the end of the package and then taped it with the same
type tape I used.........

Just went though a similar situation (I was the buyer)

Pkg arrived empty:  big slit cut across the padded envelope..  I
_immediately refused delivery, handed it back to the postman w/ &quot;return
to sender&quot;.

The seller filled the necessary paperwork upon receiving pkg back..  He
provided  copies of the ebay transaction/insurance receipt to his P.O.

31 days later I get a check from the USPS (less shipping fee).

Coins were obviously STOLEN by a postal worker !!!

A couple of years ago I received a package that was supposed to contain a
PCGS Morgan. I opened the Priority Mail envelope only to find a folded up
Walmart add, which the seller had packaged the coin in. Upon closer
inspection of the envelope, it was obvious it had been opened and retaped
with clear packaging tape but this occurred after being mailed. The reason
this was obvious is the tape was over the postage stamp afixed when mailed
at the Post Office. The seller said the clerk was inquisitive as to what was
in the package when shipped. The end result is it was stolen either at that
Post Office or enroute to me. The Postal Insurance did pay for the item.
Moral of the story: don't tell the clerk what is in the package.

Some of the postal clerks can be downright nosey, so much so that I tell
them I am mailing a machined tool part that has to be insured.  Now machined
tool parts are not very easy to hawk in a coin or pawn shop, in fact unless
you have a use for it, it is no good.

This happened once to one of my shipments.   The buyer received the
shipment, slit very cleanly open, with the coin gone.    I filed a
claim on the insurance, he signed it,  I got a settlement from USPS
(it took a little while, but it did arrive), and I reimbursed my
buyer.

Hopefully it will go this smoothly for you. It should.

Insulting assumptions are better kept to yourself.

Nothing prohibited is the proper response to such a question.

I sorted mail for the USPS from 1984 until 1998.

High value items should be shipped registered mail.  This class of mail
was segregated from the rest of the mail stream, sorted only in locked
rooms, and everytime it transfers from one clerk / area to another, it
was signed for.  If a piece of this disappeared, it got the attention of
management or the postal inspectors.
