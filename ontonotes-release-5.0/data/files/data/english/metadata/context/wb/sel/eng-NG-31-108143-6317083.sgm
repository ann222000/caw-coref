I do...many of my fellow friends who have shops overflowing with "good
stuff".

In my own case, I see it as a very slippery slope....one great thing
after another can follow you home until the doors to the shop won't
shut.

Sometimes...no many times...you just have to say "No".

Your thoughts?

Medical Mystery: Compulsive Hoarders
A Psychological Compulsion to Keep Everything, Even When It Ruins Your
Life
By CECILE BOUCHARDEAU

Jan. 16, 2007- - We are all pack rats to some degree. We hoard,
collect and buy more stuff than we have room to store.

But what if something in our brains made us incapable of throwing
things out? Janie Allocca and Lorraine Brennan both suffer from a
psychological disorder called compulsive hoarding -- an urge to hold on
to even the most mundane objects, even when they take over their lives.

Watch "Primetime: Medical Mysteries" Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET, and go to
ABCNEWS.com during the show to diagnose a real medical mystery.

Lorraine Brennan has been hoarding for nearly 20 years. She lives in a
two-story house in Massachusetts with her father, son and fiancée.
Most rooms in the house are cluttered, and some are even unusable. The
bedroom-office that she shares with her fiancée is overrun with stuff
they tried unsuccessfully to get rid of at a yard sale. Lorraine's
purse is bursting with junk mail and receipts.

Brennan's hoarding is not only ruining her life, but affecting her
entire family. Her son can't bring friends home from school. Brennan
and her fiancée have been engaged for eight years, but he hasn't been
able to commit to marrying her because of the clutter.

'There's No Place to Sit Down'

Many hoarders are also compulsive shoppers. Janie Allocca has
accumulated so much stuff that she uses her own house as a storage
facility and lives with her mother.

"I remember collecting, and keeping, and hoarding things since I can
remember," Allocca said. "And now I am just living around the piles and
piles I need to get rid of."

"I have so much stuff that my house is totally unlivable," she
continued. "There's no place to sit down. I can't get to the kitchen. I
can't have anyone over for tea even though I have everything for tea.
My collecting is taking up the space where I normally would live."

There's a fine line between simple clutter and extreme hoarding. Most
hoarders, observers say, are physically incapable of throwing things
out. They can't live in, or use, rooms like the kitchen for their
intended use. They also experience extreme distress from their
condition.

The Brain of a Hoarder

Hoarding is currently considered a subset of obsessive compulsive
disorder, but that may soon change. New research is finding that
hoarding may be a unique disorder completely separate from OCD.

Dr. David Tolin, director of the Anxiety Disorders Center at the
Institute of Living in Hartford, Conn., has devoted his career to
studying what goes on inside the mind of a hoarder.

"At the moment, compulsive hoarding hasn't been fully defined by the
psychiatric and psychological communities," he said. "One of the things
that we wanted to do was to understand some of the brain mechanisms
behind compulsive hoarding."

Allocca is part of a study Tolin is conducting to see which parts of a
hoarder's brain become active when they are faced with making
decisions. She is hooked up to a brain-scan machine and asked to look
at pieces of her mail and decide whether she wants them to be thrown
out. She then must watch the mail get shredded.

At this point, two parts of a hoarder's brain become active. The
brain's orbitofrontal cortex is involved in decision making and causes
a hoarder to process this experience as a punishing one. At the same
time, the hippocampus of a hoarder actively searches for memories about
the object. The hoarder tries to remember the object: what it is and
why they saved it in the first place. By contrast, people without
hoarding problems just don't think about the object that much.

'A Painful and Effortful Process'

"What we find is that the brain is acting very, very differently when a
person hoards," Tolin said. "When the person is trying to make a
decision about what to throw away, it seems that the person who is
hoarding, is processing this activity as if it is deeply punishing."

"The person who hoards is going through a very, very effortful search
of their memory to try to think of as many things as they can about
this item before they make the decision," Tolin added. "What this all
amounts to then is a painful and effortful process of decision-making,
that you and I might take for granted."

There is no cure for hoarding, and there is no medication to treat the
condition. Right now, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only way to
help hoarders make decisions and deal with their emotions.

Getting Help

In Beth Johnson's "Clutter Workshop" in Hartford, hoarders and
clutterers practice throwing out possessions they have grown attached
to. Johnson also takes her clients on nonshopping -- or nonacquiring --
trips to teach them not to buy things they don't need.

"I try to help them see the larger picture and how this item won't fit
into their life," said Johnson. "If you have a jam-packed house, if
you're adding to it on a weekly or daily basis, you're basically
defeating yourself."

Dr. Randy Frost, a professor of psychology at Smith College in
Massachussetts, focuses on helping hoarders make their homes
clutter-free.

"One of the things we know about hoarding is that the beliefs people
have about their possessions are so powerful, that it's very difficult
for them to get out of this behavior," said Frost, who is also author
of the upcoming book "Buried in Treasures." "If the person throws
something away and experiences distress, and does it again and again,
eventually, they won't have that extreme emotional response, throwing
something away."

Frost held a one-on-one session with Brennan to see if he could help
her. After a few hours, she was able to throw away receipts and a few
pieces of junk, but, as with most hoarders, there is still a long road
ahead.

One major motivator for Brennan is the possibility of losing her
fiancée if she doesn't clean up her home. When asked if she thought he
would really leave, Lorraine said, "I don't want to find out. I don't
want to end my relationship. I want to do better. I want to make it
work. I don't want to live like this anymore. I really don't."

Dr. David Tolin and Professor Randy Frost are co-authors of a self-help
book called "Buried in Treasures," to be published on February 5th.

You are not aloneth....the reason why I copied rec.woodworking on this

Estate auctions of woodworkers always have tons of wood scraps neither

I too hoard scraps, but every once in a while I tend to just sort them
out and what I haven't used or plan to use in the future, gets made
into kindling for our wood stove.

I received some great training in this regard.

As a matter of company policy, once a year had to go thru the files
and throw away anything over one year old with tax records and
engineering documents excepted.

After completing this task, had to sign off that you actually had done it.

Was told the lawyers were the reason for the policy.

Something to the effect that if it doesn't exist, it can't come back
to haunt you.

Had customers with similar policies.

Sort of sets the mood not to hoard things.

Also, a move every 5 years or so, gets rid of a lot of "stuff".

And the fact you can actually part with above mentioned scraps proves
you're just an average pack rat...a "real" hoarder would have a panic
attack trying to sort through or throw away the scraps.

Then again...I've seen what appear to be packrats on TLC's Clean Sweep
who break down sobbing over letting go of some pillow they've had since
childhood.  But they do it....eventually.

Don't say that.  A friend used hardwood scraps as backing for his
handmade trophies. One of a kind stuff. You might offer yours to a
trophy maker if you aren't interested in getting into the business.  Or
turn them into individual bookends.  Or offer to some woodworking type
at a craft show.

My hoarding problem is this. I have a lot of valuable stuff left over
from my ebay dealings. Like little T6061 aluminum plates and bars for
example. Or super nice strong stainless painted steel handles. Super
high quality. I may use a few "one day". In fact I will use some on my
trailer project. Or a few pulleys. But, despite being valuable, they
are not economical to try to sell them. Too little money, too much
hassle, and quite possibly they would not sell at all. But I cannot
throw them away in good conscience.

True, when I was building the house, I'd bring back quite
a bit of stuff from the dump. Some got used right away,
particularly discarded seedling trees etc, other stuff got
used later, particularly scrap wood and steel etc. Other
stuff never did get used like the VW beetle transaxel etc
that I considered turning into a dune buggy etc and never
did get around to. Tried to drag it out the front for the most
recent collection day but it was too heavy to move easily
so I took the easy way out and gave up till next time.

I dont bother to get rid of most stuff that dies. I've still got
the hot water service that died, because the big white metal
square case is decent metal for making letterboxes etc.

Still got the washing machine I last used 35 years ago,
mainly for the decent motor and pump, should bin that
on the next collection day, its a bit hard to get out tho.

Still got the smaller upright freezer that is uneconomic
to repair, just because it seems such a waste of what
is a very decent little cabinet thing, might one day get
around to putting a beer brewing barrel into for easier
heater control in winter. I currently put a big wrap around
insulating foam pad around the barrel with a heater belt
with monster zip ties initially and once its bottled or when
I have two barrels brewing, I have a fan heater in the
smallest room in the house that doesnt get used as
a toilet since I have two of those.

LOL....I know of several companies that are now spending millions of
dollars to recreate a product they had but lost the recipe to because
they purged their files.

The retirees that they have had to rehire at expensive contractor rates
are very appreciative of the management's stupidity to enforce a "clean
desk" policy. They are very happy to participate in the "purge".

Of course those responsible for this stupidity received promotions for
their ideas.

&gt;&gt; Medical Mystery: Compulsive Hoarders
&gt;&gt; A Psychological Compulsion to Keep Everything,
&gt;&gt; Even When It Ruins Your Life

&gt; Most of us are nothing like these pathetic wretches,
&gt; we dont keep discarded packaging etc much.

&gt;&gt; By CECILE BOUCHARDEAU

&gt;&gt; Jan. 16, 2007- - We are all pack rats to some degree.

&gt; Some people arent.

&gt;&gt; We hoard, collect and buy more stuff than we have room to store.

&gt; I've got plenty of room.

&gt;&gt; But what if something in our brains made
&gt;&gt; us incapable of throwing things out?

&gt; There's no one that bad. If you threaten to kill them if they dont
&gt; throw it away, they wont refuse to part with it and die clutching it.

&gt;&gt; Janie Allocca and Lorraine Brennan both suffer from a psychological
&gt;&gt; disorder called compulsive hoarding -- an urge to hold on to even the
&gt;&gt; most mundane objects, even when they take over their lives.

&gt;&gt; Watch &quot;Primetime: Medical Mysteries&quot; Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET, and go
&gt;&gt; to ABCNEWS.com during the show to diagnose a real medical mystery.

&gt;&gt; Lorraine Brennan has been hoarding for nearly 20 years. She lives in
&gt;&gt; a two-story house in Massachusetts with her father, son and fiancée.
&gt;&gt; Most rooms in the house are cluttered, and some are even unusable.
&gt;&gt; The bedroom-office that she shares with her fiancée is overrun with
&gt;&gt; stuff they tried unsuccessfully to get rid of at a yard sale. Lorraine's
&gt;&gt; purse is bursting with junk mail and receipts.

&gt;&gt; Brennan's hoarding is not only ruining her life, but affecting her
&gt;&gt; entire family. Her son can't bring friends home from school. Brennan
&gt;&gt; and her fiancée have been engaged for eight years, but he hasn't
&gt;&gt; been able to commit to marrying her because of the clutter.

&gt;&gt; 'There's No Place to Sit Down'

&gt;&gt; Many hoarders are also compulsive shoppers. Janie Allocca
&gt;&gt; has accumulated so much stuff that she uses her own house
&gt;&gt; as a storage facility and lives with her mother.

&gt;&gt; &quot;I remember collecting, and keeping, and hoarding things since I can
&gt;&gt; remember,&quot; Allocca said. &quot;And now I am just living around the piles
&gt;&gt; and piles I need to get rid of.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &quot;I have so much stuff that my house is totally unlivable,&quot; she
&gt;&gt; continued. &quot;There's no place to sit down. I can't get to the kitchen.
&gt;&gt; I can't have anyone over for tea even though I have everything for
&gt;&gt; tea. My collecting is taking up the space where I normally would
&gt;&gt; live.&quot;

&gt;&gt; There's a fine line between simple clutter and extreme hoarding. Most
&gt;&gt; hoarders, observers say, are physically incapable of throwing things
&gt;&gt; out. They can't live in, or use, rooms like the kitchen for their
&gt;&gt; intended use. They also experience extreme distress from their
&gt;&gt; condition.

&gt;&gt; The Brain of a Hoarder

&gt;&gt; Hoarding is currently considered a subset of obsessive compulsive
&gt;&gt; disorder, but that may soon change. New research is finding that
&gt;&gt; hoarding may be a unique disorder completely separate from OCD.

&gt;&gt; Dr. David Tolin, director of the Anxiety Disorders Center at the
&gt;&gt; Institute of Living in Hartford, Conn., has devoted his career to
&gt;&gt; studying what goes on inside the mind of a hoarder.

&gt;&gt; &quot;At the moment, compulsive hoarding hasn't been fully defined by the
&gt;&gt; psychiatric and psychological communities,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the
&gt;&gt; things that we wanted to do was to understand some of the brain
&gt;&gt; mechanisms behind compulsive hoarding.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Allocca is part of a study Tolin is conducting to see which parts of a
&gt;&gt; hoarder's brain become active when they are faced with making
&gt;&gt; decisions. She is hooked up to a brain-scan machine and asked to look
&gt;&gt; at pieces of her mail and decide whether she wants them to be thrown
&gt;&gt; out. She then must watch the mail get shredded.

&gt;&gt; At this point, two parts of a hoarder's brain become active. The
&gt;&gt; brain's orbitofrontal cortex is involved in decision making and causes
&gt;&gt; a hoarder to process this experience as a punishing one. At the same
&gt;&gt; time, the hippocampus of a hoarder actively searches for memories
&gt;&gt; about the object. The hoarder tries to remember the object: what it
&gt;&gt; is and why they saved it in the first place. By contrast, people
&gt;&gt; without hoarding problems just don't think about the object that much.

&gt;&gt; 'A Painful and Effortful Process'

&gt;&gt; &quot;What we find is that the brain is acting very, very differently when
&gt;&gt; a person hoards,&quot; Tolin said. &quot;When the person is trying to make a
&gt;&gt; decision about what to throw away, it seems that the person who is
&gt;&gt; hoarding, is processing this activity as if it is deeply punishing.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &quot;The person who hoards is going through a very, very effortful search
&gt;&gt; of their memory to try to think of as many things as they can about
&gt;&gt; this item before they make the decision,&quot; Tolin added. &quot;What this all
&gt;&gt; amounts to then is a painful and effortful process of decision-making,
&gt;&gt; that you and I might take for granted.&quot;

&gt;&gt; There is no cure for hoarding, and there is no medication to treat the
&gt;&gt; condition. Right now, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only way to
&gt;&gt; help hoarders make decisions and deal with their emotions.

&gt;&gt; Getting Help

&gt;&gt; In Beth Johnson's &quot;Clutter Workshop&quot; in Hartford, hoarders and
&gt;&gt; clutterers practice throwing out possessions they have grown attached
&gt;&gt; to. Johnson also takes her clients on nonshopping -- or nonacquiring
&gt;&gt; -- trips to teach them not to buy things they don't need.

&gt;&gt; &quot;I try to help them see the larger picture and how this item won't fit
&gt;&gt; into their life,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;If you have a jam-packed house, if
&gt;&gt; you're adding to it on a weekly or daily basis, you're basically
&gt;&gt; defeating yourself.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Dr. Randy Frost, a professor of psychology at Smith College in
&gt;&gt; Massachussetts, focuses on helping hoarders make their homes
&gt;&gt; clutter-free.

&gt;&gt; &quot;One of the things we know about hoarding is that the beliefs people
&gt;&gt; have about their possessions are so powerful, that it's very difficult
&gt;&gt; for them to get out of this behavior,&quot; said Frost, who is also author
&gt;&gt; of the upcoming book &quot;Buried in Treasures.&quot; &quot;If the person throws
&gt;&gt; something away and experiences distress, and does it again and again,
&gt;&gt; eventually, they won't have that extreme emotional response, throwing
&gt;&gt; something away.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Frost held a one-on-one session with Brennan to see if he could help
&gt;&gt; her. After a few hours, she was able to throw away receipts and a few
&gt;&gt; pieces of junk, but, as with most hoarders, there is still a long road
&gt;&gt; ahead.

&gt;&gt; One major motivator for Brennan is the possibility of losing her
&gt;&gt; fiancée if she doesn't clean up her home. When asked if she thought he
&gt;&gt; would really leave, Lorraine said, &quot;I don't want to find out. I don't
&gt;&gt; want to end my relationship. I want to do better. I want to make it
&gt;&gt; work. I don't want to live like this anymore. I really don't.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Dr. David Tolin and Professor Randy Frost are co-authors of a
&gt;&gt; self-help book called &quot;Buried in Treasures,&quot; to be published on
&gt;&gt; February 5th.

Langley Collyer: The Mystery Hoarder Of Harlem
Fred Penzel[1], Ph.D
On March 21st, 1947, at 8:53 a.m., the New York City police department
received a phone call from a man giving the name of Charles Smith,
notifying them that he believed a man was dead inside a decaying
building on Fifth Avenue in Harlem. Officers arrived on the scene by 10
a.m., and cordoned off the house in order to hold back the crowd that
had gathered. The police removed an iron grill-covered basement door
from its hinges, only to find the entrance completely sealed off by a
solid mass of debris. Thus was thrust before the public one of the
best-known and most mysterious compulsive-hoarding cases of all time.

Compulsive hoarding is a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a
neurobiological condition, most likely genetically based. OCD comes in
a wide variety of forms, of which hoarding is only one. Compulsive
hoarders may collect only certain types of things, or they may
indiscriminately save everything. We are not talking here about
collecting things that are valuable or important such as art, coins, or
stamps.

Hoarders tend to save things of little or no value...
Hoarders generally tend to save things that are of little or no value,
or if the things they save do have real value, they tend to save them
in ridiculously larger quantities than would ever be necessary. One of
the main obsessive thoughts that causes sufferers to do this is their
worry that if they throw a particular item away, it will be lost
forever, and they may one day be in need of it in order to be able to
use it, to be able to remember it, or do something connected with it.

They seem to have difficulty discriminating between what is or will be
useful, and what is not. Some hoarders can freely admit that the things
they are saving are currently broken or damaged and unusable. They will
stubbornly insist, however, that they will someday repair or refurbish
the items and either make use of them or give them away.

Throwing away something is seen as being irresponsible...
Another reason for hoarding resembles the type of thinking seen in
hyper-responsible obsessions. It is the idea that each thing they save
and/or repair might be useful to others (rather than themselves), and
that the hoarder would be responsible (and therefore blameful and
guilty) for another person not having this vital item should the need
arise. They may also rationalize that what they are doing is actually
"recycling," and are performing a community service by conserving
resources. Throwing away something that could possibly be reused is
seen as being highly irresponsible. In actuality, there really is no
need for what they have saved, there is no one to give the items to,
and the only result is that the hoarder is burdened with a house full
of junk.

Some of the things most commonly saved include newspapers, magazines,
lists, pens, pencils, empty boxes, pamphlets, old greeting cards, junk
mail, old appliances, outdated books and even assorted labels, string,
rubber bands, plastic containers, bottles, and bottle caps. In the most
extreme cases, people have been known to save such things as empty
matchbooks, used tissues, old cigarette butts, bird feathers, old cars,
discarded paper cups, used aluminum foil, paper towels, lint, and
hairs. Some of these sufferers will even rummage through other people's
trash, and bring home obvious junk that to them, seems quite useful or
repairable.

Accumulate things create fire or health hazards...
Compulsive savers can accumulate large amounts of things, creating
storage problems and fire or health hazards. Their houses can take on
the appearance of having been ransacked, with floors waist-deep in
trash and debris, rooms filled wall-to-wall with overflowing paper bags
and cardboard boxes. Many sufferers can only make their way around
their homes by creating aisles around and through the trash. Problems
with municipal authorities are not uncommon, and hoarders are sometimes
evicted or charged with violation of zoning or public-health laws.
Ironically, the majority of people who save things compulsively rarely
use or look at these things. Their security comes from merely having
the things around "just in case" and in not having to make what seem
like difficult decisions about what to discard.

Let us now return to our story.

The Collyers were part of one of New York's oldest families...
Its main figures are two brothers, Homer Lusk Collyer (b. Nov. 6th,
1881), and Langley Collyer (b. October 3rd, 1885). The Collyers were
part of one of New York's oldest families, a branch of the well-known
Livingstons. Their ancestors had come over to America on the ship
"Speedwell" in 1664, about a week after the Mayflower. The family had
been members of the congregation of Trinity Church since 1697. Their
father, Dr. Herman L. Collyer was a successful and renowned
gynecologist, and his father, William Collyer, was said to have been
one of the leading shipbuilders in America. In 1909, Dr. Collyer moved
his family from Murray Hill to a fine upper-middle-class home in
Harlem. It was a three-story brownstone located at 2078 Fifth Avenue
(at 128th Street). Beyond his fame as a physician, the doctor was known
to be a bit eccentric, paddling a small canoe to work each day at City
Hospital on Blackwell's Island in the East River. He would subsequently
paddle home at the end of his day, and then carry the boat on his head
back to his house.

Dr. Collyer's two sons seemed destined for successful lives of their
own. Both attended Columbia University, where Homer earned a law
degree, and his younger brother graduated with a degree in mechanical
engineering and chemistry. Homer went on to practice admiralty law, but
Langley, so far as is known, never held employment, and spent his time
playing the piano. He is reputed to have won prizes as a concert
pianist, but this cannot be verified. Perhaps Langley's inability to
establish a career was an early sign of personal difficulties he may
already have been experiencing.

In 1917, the brothers had their telephone disconnected...
It was probably a warning of things to come when in 1917, the brothers
had their telephone disconnected, after being billed for long distance
calls they claimed to have never made. This may have been the beginning
of what would become a growing isolation from the outside world. Six
years later, in 1923, Dr. Collyer died. Several years prior to his
death, for reasons unknown, he had moved from his Fifth Avenue home to
one at 153 West 77th Street. His sons remained at the family home with
their mother. It is possible that a family breakup may have occurred.

Life seems to have taken an abnormal turn for the two brothers in the
year preceding the death of their mother in 1929. It appears that their
gas was shut off in 1928, and they also seemed to have given up the
convenience of running water and steam heat, and began using kerosene
to light their home and to cook with. Water was obtained from a public
fountain four blocks from their home. This was all clearly out of step
for people of their education and social status.

No one was ever permitted to enter their house...
Despite all this, nothing appeared out of the ordinary to those in the
outside world. The brothers were said to be courteous, cultured, and
shy. The only sign that something might be amiss was that no one was
ever permitted to enter their house. Around 1928, Homer worked for
another attorney, John R. McMullen, who later became the family legal
advisor. Homer next worked for City Title Insurance doing research in
the New York City Hall of Records. He was described, at the time, as
being courtly, and dressing in 19th century attire, presenting a rather
Victorian appearance. He was said to resemble a gentleman of the
1880's.

In 1932, Homer purchased a building across the street at 2077 Fifth
Avenue for $8,000. He planned to divide it into apartments and to rent
them. This plan was never realized, as he suffered a stroke in 1933,
becoming blind as the result of hemorrhages in both of his eyes. With
one exception, he was reportedly never seen outside of his home again.
Langley then gave up his music to take on the job of nursing his
brother back to health. No physician was ever consulted. Langley
apparently believed that the cure for his brother's blindness was for
him to eat 100 oranges a week, and to keep his eyes closed at all
times, in order to rest them. The brothers possessed a large library of
medical books, and it would seem that Langley felt he had the
information and knowledge necessary to treat his brother.

An intact Model-T Ford was discovered in the basement...
At some point in the 1930's, the West 77th Street home where their
father had lived was sold, and the new owner, a Mrs. Peter Meyer,
discovered an intact Model-T Ford in the basement. It is not clear how
it got there. Mrs. Meyer is said to have paid a workman $150 to
disassemble the car and put the pieces in the street. This somehow came
to Langley's attention, and for reasons known only to him, he carried
the car piece-by-piece back to the basement of his Fifth Avenue home.
It would appear that along with the loss of their other utilities, the
brothers had no electricity, as Langley apparently tried to connect a
generator to the car's engine in order to provide power, but was
unsuccessful.

The brothers eventually came to the attention of the general public
when they were mentioned in an article written by Helen Worden, a
reporter for the World-Telegram. A real estate agent named Maurice
Gruber was attempting to buy some farmland in Queens that belonged to
the brothers. Their refusal to respond to his letters or to answer the
door when he tried to see them in person resulted in Gruber keeping a
vigil at their home. In her article, Worden referred to Langley Collyer
as "the mystery man of Harlem," and included in it, a whole range ...

Count me in. And proud of it I might add.

I've always had an interest in electronics, even at a tender age.
Not having much money to spend to build stuff, I had to
cruise the neighborhood on trash day looking for discarded
TV's and radios that I could use for parts. A couple of friends
got into the act as well. This was a fun way to support a fun,
and ultimately very profitable hobby.

Fast forward 40+ years, and I still have the stash of tubes I
accumulated as a kid (and added to over the years). If I come
across something that might be useful for free or cheap, I'll
bag it and figure out where to put it later on. Picked up an
old TV chassis a couple of weeks ago. Its an Admiral that
was built in 1951. The owner wanted to keep the case to
use in a high school play. A couple of hours of tinkering,
and I got it working. Watched the football playoffs last
weekend on a 17" black and white TV. The games were
good, but watching them on an old TV I saved from the
landfill, then repaired myself was a blast. Kept the shop
nice and warm too!

I suppose anything can be taken to exteremes, but its a fine
line. One persons trash is most certainly anothers treasure.

No, they are little square 5x5 plates, about 1/8" thick.

I do, however, have 3/8" about 8x14 plate and 1/2" 8x13 or so. Also
aluminum.

Also I have big Al heatsinks, with which I can part very cheaply.

I have no idea what they were intended for. I'm checking with some of
my friends who do woodworking and home fixup projects who might be
interested in some of them. Stacking two of the 36" size (the 430 items)
would be a good height for a childrens' play gazebo or something of that
sort. Maybe build up sets of three for table legs, but they'd need to be
cut down a bit.

Othewise, they were headed for the curb and didn't cost me anything.

It occurs in varying degrees. I've always seen scrounging of
electronic goodies as more of a 'flow-thru' than a one-way path to my
lab. Much stuff, of course, does end up on a one-way path to my
workbench, but it's stuff that I constantly use (tools,
soldering/desoldering gear, test gear, etc.)

The trick is learning what to shed, and when and how to shed it.
Ham radio swap meets and Ebay are good paths.

Keep the peace(es).

I have seen this problem.

it is completely over come by Ockleshaw's workshop principle.
Ockleshaw being the possesor of the most amazing workshop.

"if it looks useful it isnt.turf it out.

if it looks *really* useful keep it for a month.
if you havent touched it in that month turf it out.

If something is actually useful but hasnt been used in a year turf it
out.

that way you will have a workshop full of only the gear that you
actually need"

...of course ockleshaw had a second shed :-)

Its interesting that when true hoarders collect things that are
actually valuable, they usually manage to make them worthless by the
time somebody else gets em.

There was guy down near Centralia Washington that collected cars- at
his peak, he had something like 2000 of em. He was sure every one was
"valuable" and would never sell. And as they sat, they rotted, tires
grew thru the hoods, paint and chrome peeled, engines rusted solid, and
when he finally died, and the family had to dispose of them, virtually
none of them were worth anything, even as parts.

I have seen this same thing happen with tool collectors- the old guys
are so sure that the stuff is worth a fortune, they routinely chase
away people who would actually reuse, restore, or understand their
tools, and want to pay reasonable prices for them- and so, in the end,
it all becomes scrap.

There was a famous junkyard in Richmond Virginia, where the old guy
saved Steam Railroad engines, and other huge machines. He never would
sell, convinced he was sitting on a gold mine. Well, when he died, the
relatives found he was- and it was the real estate. The land itself was
worth a lot, the scrap metal on it was just that- scrap metal. A
foundation was set up to save the oldest engines, and the relatives
gave them away for free- and if it had happened 20 or 30 years earlier,
there would have been a lot more to save- age, weather, and vandals had
taken a severe toll. While alive, he cagily quoted prices of a hundred
thousand dollars for a steam engine, and when he died, they were free
for the hauling. Assuming you could afford to haul something that was
80 feet long and weighed 20 tons.

Not to pick on you personally, but that is exactly the thinking that
can lie behind hoarding things excessively.  And the thing about
it is, it is TRUE.  You might very well MIGHT find a perfect use for
that item later on.

The problem is when the thinking ends there.  For it to be the best
decision to hold on to something, the fact that it might be useful
is, by itself, not enough.  There are positives of keeping it, but
there are negatives too, and the positives need to outweigh the
negatives.  One possible negative is reducing the amount of space
you have for other things, making it harder to walk around, harder
to work, and harder to find the stuff that truly is useful among
the sea of stuff.  Another negative is if you wind up paying extra
money to rent a storage space.  In a lot of cases, you could re-buy
every single item in a rented storage space for less than the
$75/month rental fees multiplied by however many years you keep
it.  It just doesn't make sense to store $1000 worth of furniture
in a $75/month storage space for 2 years.  And of course, there
are other negatives of storing things, too, like having to look
at clutter, the extra time out of your life it takes to deal with
all of it, and so on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IIRC, I have one about 5&quot; pulley with 1 3/8&quot; shaft hole with keyway
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and special tightening screws. I have more, but those I may need.

Picture of the pulley is here:

http://igor.chudov.com/tmp/pulley.jpg

It has two grooves for V belts, 1 3/8" hole with keyway, and special
threaded holes that are called TAPER LOCK. The holes are 3/8" NC
threaded, I think, I found some bolt that looks like 3/8" and it fit
the threads. It came off a 7.5 HP three phase motor from which I cut off
its shaft a while ago. It has some rust on it, but not much.

I think I could organize my tools purchased in a compulsive hording
craze, but my compulsive eating, computer, and TV habit is getting in
the way.

&gt;  &gt; Although I shouldn't talk.. I got a great deal on some Oak 2 x 2 at

&gt;  &gt; them (about 40).. Haven't figured out a use
&gt;  &gt; for them yet, although I convince myself that I will eventually LOL.

&gt; A gallon of glue, some clamps, some time, and you have enough material
&gt; for a small table for a bedroom, hallway, etc.

&gt; Of course, now you are going to need a table lamp for it&lt;G&gt;.

That's a pretty good idea.. I may do that when I get some time..LOL.
Too big of a backload of projects now. I turned down a pretty good deal
on about 150 board feet
of Mahagony.. because I know it would sit in the shop for a few years
before I figured out what to make with it.
I guess I'm on the road to recovery.

you see that all the time.
no preservation effort.
totally stuffed when someone can get access to it eventually.

btw I know of two (once) very valuable aircraft that are sitting in
weeds almost totally stuffed because the owners didnt have the
intelligence to sell them at a realistic price when they found they
couldnt maintain them.
