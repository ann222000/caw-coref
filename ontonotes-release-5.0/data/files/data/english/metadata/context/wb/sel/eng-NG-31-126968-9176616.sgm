Well, I've got the last remaining supply of the printing plates that
were used to print them.

They're for sale on ebay.

Best memory of punch cards: Somebody pulled out the

with the contents (actual numbers carefully imprinted on
almost every cardboard rectangle!), sealed the neck with
one of those water-sprinkler gadgets we used to dampen
clothes with when ironing, and labeled the assembly &quot;DATA.&quot;

Who knows.

But on a 1402 read punch the warning light is labled &quot;CHIPS&quot;.

On a 2540 read punch it is labled &quot;CHIP BOX&quot;.

This may well be the official terminology used by IBM in its manuals.

But, as we know, IBM speaks of &quot;direct access storage devices&quot; when
everybody else says &quot;disk drives&quot;.

As for the word &quot;chad&quot;, this word comes from the world of
teletypewriter machines. The round pieces of teletypewriter tape that
result from punching holes in tape are called &quot;chad&quot;.

There are references, for example in _Datamation_ magazine, to the
term &quot;card chad&quot; being used for the normal contents of the chip bucket
on a model 029 keypunch.

Thus, even if it isn't official IBM terminology, I think one has to
admit that describing the punched-card equivalent of Timbits as &quot;chad&quot;
or at least &quot;card chad&quot; is a legitimate and attested usage. Even if
the waste produced from punching 90 and 96 column cards, as opposed to
80 column cards has greater chad nature.

Must have depended on local custom.  When I was introduced to the 1620
console in 1965 I was told that the candy jar full of paper particles
that sat on top contained &quot;chad&quot;.  They didn't use paper tape there.

m-w.com, the jargon file, and www.computer-dictionary-online.org all
include both tape and cards in their definitions, though the last does
mention that IBM called a &quot;chad box&quot; a &quot;chip box&quot;.  But it seemed to me
that IBM made it a matter of principle to have their own unique word for
everything.

You can excuse that because it also encompassed things like the

One rumour I heard was that &quot;chad&quot; is a back-formation from the

chadless tape, but this is no doubt an urban legend.  Wikipedia

For the kinds of data processing it was designed for COBOL is not bad at
all. Remember it was designed to let junior programmers make changes to
live programs at 3 AM in the morning when the senior programs were not
there.

I would hate to do a COBOL type job in FORTH, for example unless like
one variant I saw it allowed record definition, and adding operators for
decimal operators would be weird.

Don't knock the PHB either.

Face it, PHB's fill many important functions where they have a lot
of power, including for purchasing, and they need technical support
they can handle too.

Their tasks are normally based on the commercial functioning of a
company; where the complexity is small to medium, and mostly
centered about doing it faster and for less money, and for as huge
a number of customers as possible. It must be repeatable, auditable,
and budgetable.

The PHBs are not very technically savvy. They struggle to understand
programming, and a language like C, or modern Fortran, or even Java
is way beyond what they can be expected to handle. PHB's thinking isn't
directed in this way at all.

But I have found that they can grok cobol pretty well; and they find
the listing support useful. (Listing of memory layout and cross reference
of usage is a mandatory part of cobol).

They don't mind the fuzzy syntax so much.

Cobol compilers have also gotten pretty good. Cobol programs need
not be monstrosities.

I suggest we don't bash COBOL, but that we make a _lot_ more cobol-like
languages where the PHB concepts are included in the language. I call
these &quot;surface languages&quot;. Lots of packages have surface languages as
a config language.

I can see the need for  a specific &quot;accountant and auditor language&quot; (AAAL?),
where t-accounts, transactions, audit trails, mandated rounding modes,
attribute associations and on-units for interest, credit violations, etc
are part of the language; and the language has a formal validation process.

It would then be a lot easier to write automation tools for these people,
when you can work from within their frame of reference (language, tools,
auditabinity) instead of having to recreate the reference frame for every
statement in the program.

Cobol has done a lot of this; and was amazingly early. Too bad we haven't
seen a good followup.

In my first job out of college, I ran a PDP-11/20 for administrative
purposes at a high school in northern Vermont.  I found the code online
at trailing-edge.com not too long ago.

This program wrote payroll transactions in preparation for printing the
checks.  (EXPX46.BAS prints the checks.)

http://pdp-11.trailing-edge.com/rsts11/rsts-11-046/EXPX44.BAS

Note the clarity with which the variables are names.  Note also the lack
of comments.  One of the &quot;features&quot; of RSTS is that comments counted as
part of the 28K memory space.  As soon as programs got complex, you'd
delete the comments to save space!

(BTW: This isn't my code, it's from before I started.  But I maintained
and updated it for two years starting in Sept 1973.)

COBOL apparently was good enough to drive out competitors for its role.

I don't think anyone maintains that it is a good language for doing
numerical programming. FORTRAN did not get recursion until very late,
and believe me, the lack of recursion made easy problems hard. Doing
decimal arithmetic in FORTRAN is not something I much fancy either.

I had to do something like that once, but being limited to 36 bit

You seem to be describing the competent, functional manager. I see
the PHB far more as being of the middle management empire builder type.
They run a department or a group that's large and clearly important because
it is so large, they have great skill in organising growth and obtaining
budget while not achieving (either directly or via those they manage) to
produce or do anything that could affect the commercial functioning of the
company. They are more common in civil service than in the commercial

This I think will be popular with managers that like to get things
done.

Also it should map well onto the underlying structure of well
written software for that domain - ack that's not too well said, try it
this way. One good way to approach software for a well defined speciality
area is to start with a set of abstractions that embody the concepts and
entities normal to the domain and then start layering abstractions to get
the higher level interactions. Effectively by the time you get to the
application layers the code looks a lot like a specialised language
describing the application in domain terms.

Layering a language on top of the abstraction layers that embody
the speciality at hand should be a fairly easy task. Hmm given the number
of times I have used this approach why haven't I ever considered putting a
dedicated language in ?

In the early 70s a friend worked at an unnamable
agency in DC.  One day the order came down to
treat chad as secret scrap, put it in burn bags, .....
the whole shtick.

We thought it would have been more effective
to put it in regular bags and leave them on
the lawn of the Soviet embassy on the hypothesis
that the Soviets would expend huge resources
trying to extract information from them, with
no useful results.

This predated the Iranian student reassembly

Ok, you have application objects defined in Objective Pascal (OP) say.
It should be doable to have a language close to the practitioners of
