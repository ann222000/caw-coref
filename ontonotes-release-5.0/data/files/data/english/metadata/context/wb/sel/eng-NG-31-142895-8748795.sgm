Dark Star:
A Look at Sri Paul Twitchell

by Michael Turner
© 1996, 2007

Shall we go?
You and I, while we can
Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?
- Robert Hunter

&quot;How does one die daily and yet live?&quot;  This is the seventh spiritual
question which one must confront once he steps out on the pathway to
the Absolute.  The answer is simple if you know Shabda Yoga - that is,
you must learn to leave the body at will and dwell on the other
planes, and return to the body when possible, and at your own command.
- Sri Paul Twitchell

Paul Twitchell is an enigma.
- Brad Steiger

This month we will take a look at one of Sant Mat's most provocative
figures: Sri Paul Twitchell.  As someone once noted (I believe it was
Sri Harold Klemp), a whirlwind of controversy has surrounded Paul for
a long time.  Since at least the late 1970's, when the first serious
accusations about Paul's character came to light, people who are aware
of Paul's life and works have pretty much been divided into two camps;
those who consider Paul to have been a Living Master of the highest
order and soul traveler par excellence; and those who think of him as
a &quot;notorious&quot; plagiarist and unmitigated fraud.

One thing I have noticed in my short life is that people rarely fit
neatly into the pigeonholes by which we try to define them.  There are
elements of light and darkness present in all of us, regardless of our
station in life and spiritual attainment (or lack thereof), just like
the symbol of yin and yang.  So long as we inhabit mental, emotional
and physical bodies, we are fallible.  We can soar to spiritual
heights one moment, and plummet back to earth the next - only to stand
up, dust ourselves off, and leap for the stars once again.  As Sant
Kirpal Singh so often said, every Saint has His past, and every sinner
his future.

Let's see with our hearts
These things our eyes have seen
And know the truth must
Still lie somewhere in between.
- Blues for Allah: Robert Hunter

Was Paul Twitchell Living Truth, or rank deceiver?  Was he a
combination of both, or more than all of the above?  As I have
mentioned on occasion, Paulji has long struck me as a cross between
P.T. Barnum, Huck Finn and Kirpal Singh.  Even His staunchest critics
will admit that Paul had a genuine interest in occult and spiritual
matters, particularly those which pertained to conscious, intentional
out-of-body exploration.  This subject seems to have captured His
imagination early on, and drove him to study every philosophy, occult,
metaphysical and spiritual disciplines which even vaguely pertained to
it.  Paul was a restless soul, always moving and growing, learning and
mutating.  He was an iconoclast, a true mystic, a cliff hanger, a &quot;one
man cult,&quot; an enigma.  More than anything else, Sri Paul Twitchell was
an American original.

I suppose the best way to study Paulji is to start with the facts,
the things we can be sure of about His life.  To the casual observer,
this might seem self-evident.  However, given the fact that there is
very little which is objectively known about Paul Twitchell before he
became a public figure as the &quot;Living Eck Master,&quot; I believe it is
important to have at least a skeletal human framework from which to
proceed.  Most of the historical data following is derived from
Professor David C. Lane's renowned critique of Paul Twitchell and
Eckankar, The Making of a Spiritual Movement.

John Paul Twitchell was born in Paducah, Kentucky, on October 22,
1908-11 (the year is still uncertain).  His parents were Jacob and
Effie Twitchell, and He had three siblings, Howard Clyde, Rupert and
Katherine (Katie).

According to Paul, his father was a student of the Indian &quot;Eck&quot;
Master, Sudar Singh, Who taught Jacob the art of utilizing the Sound
Current to facilitate above-body consciousness.  Jacob in turn taught
Paul and His sister, Katie, this process as well.  In Brad Steiger's
hitherto official biography of Paul Twitchell, In My Soul I Am Free
(which now appears to be out of print), Paul stated that He and Katie
used to pop spontaneously out of their bodies for fun and frolic, a
practice their fundamentalist mother greatly disapproved of.

According to this account, Paul's knowledge of out-of-body
exploration grew throughout His youth, hitting an initial peak in His
mid-teens (which would correlate to the mid-1920's), when He and Katie
went to Allahabad, India to study with Sudar Singh.

At this point it is time to pause for a realty check.  For it is in
these initial stages of Paul's authorized biography that critics begin
to take issue.  According to other members of Paul's family (notably
Katie's husband, Paul Iverlet), Katie never set foot out of the United
States.  In addition, according to all reputable Sant Mat scholars,
there is absolutely no record whatsoever of a Shabda Master named
Sudar Singh.

From here on, critics say Paul Twitchell fabricated his whole life
story to make Himself a modern day Shabda superman.  However, to be
fair, it must be pointed out that Katie and Jacob were dead for
several years before Paul began His public Mastership, so all negative
accounts are based on here say from members of His extended family who
may (or may not) have had an ax to grind.

In addition, while there is no account of a &quot;Sudar&quot; Singh in Sant
Mat, there was a Master named &quot;Sudarshan&quot; Singh, Who was the nephew of
Soamiji Dayal, and who resided at the Radhasoami ashram in Allahabad
for several years (during the 1920's, I believe).  So it is
conceivable that Paul went to India and stayed at this ashram.  The
best way to resolve this question would be to thoroughly scan travel
records for this time period and see if John Paul Twitchell went to
India, as well as contact the Radhasoami Satsang at Soamibagh, and see
if they have records of American visitors to Allahabad.  There
couldn't have been that many.

In addition, there is a decent chance that Paul's father, if he was
interested in eastern mysticism, came into contact with the Sant Mat
Teachings in the early 20th Century.  While there wasn't a whole lot
of information available in the United States at the time, Phelps
Notes (written by an American Satsangi of Brahm Shankar Mishra, Rai
Saligram's successor) had been published in 1911, and a small
selection of Rai Saligram's discourses had been published as well.

Before we get too far afield, let's refocus on Paul's actual life.
He apparently graduated from high school sometime in the late 1920's,
and then attended some sort of junior college for a time thereafter.
He also began to ply His talents as a writer, publishing a variety of
articles in local newspapers and at least two books of mystical
poetry, one of which was Coins of Gold, later published by Eckankar
under the aegis of Illuminated Way Press.  He also managed to get
himself listed in the local Who's Who.

While few details about Paulji's life during this period (and, in
fact, on up through World War II) are recorded, a reading of Coins of
Gold (first published in 1939) clearly indicates that spirituality was
very much on His mind at an early point in His life.  It conveys the
sweet agony of separation, of the reed flute from its stock, of the
drop of water for the ocean, of Soul for God.  For example:

I wait and in the reflection of the stars
I cup my hands to hold the tranquil night
The soft touch of the silence heals the impatience
That awaits your coming and the moonlight

In the heart I find you dwelling there . . .
As clear as the flow of an endless song
And in the eternity of a moment of God's kindness
I find the beauty for which I long

Then softly a step tinkles in the silence
And there is an interlude in the velvet still
A rainbow of echoes answers the challenge . . .
And at your coming they retire to the hill.
- Waiting

Judging from Paul's writing style, and the suggested reading list He
put in the last chapter of Letters to Gail: I, we can get an idea of
some of His formative spiritual and literary influences.  In looking
at Paul's early years, it is important to understand that metaphysics
in general, and eastern religion in particular, were not in vogue as
they have been in the past 30 years.  There was only a handful of
books, and even fewer authors, who made a dent in the western
consciousness.  From India there was Swami Vivekananda (chief disciple
of Ramakrishna), Meher Baba and, most notably over the long run,
Paramahansa Yogananda.  From Russia, there were Madame Blavatsky and
G.I. Gurdjieff.  From England there was Christopher Isherwood (the
main western disciple of Vivekananda) and Paul Brunton (who helped
introduce Ramana Maharshi to the west).

Based upon my reading thus far, Paul Brunton appears to have had
greater impact than most upon Paul Twitchell's writing style.  Both
share a sense of inquiry of, and a zest for, exploring the esoteric
and arcane knowledge of the east.  And Paul Brunton had a delightful,
droll, poetic - very British - way of expressing himself.  His
accounts of exploring Egypt and India (A Search in Ancient Egypt and A
Search in Secret India, respectfully) convey the feel of strolling
through these ancient cultures at an easy pace, taking in the sights
and sounds along the way.  A Search in Secret India is especially
noteworthy for its accounts of Brunton's encounters with Meher Baba
(unimpressed), Ramana Maharshi (very impressed, to the point of
seeking initiation), and the Radhasoami colony at Dayalbagh
(borderline bewilderment about a &quot;secret fraternity&quot; which listened to
the sounds inside their heads).  The latter are especially significant
in that it is most likely the first exposure most westerners had with
the Radhasoami teachings.  Brunton's short book, A Hermit in the
Himalayas, is a wonderful account of a summer he spent living alone in
a Himalayan hut, visited

&gt; As clear as the flow of an endless song
&gt; And in the eternity of a moment of God's kindness
&gt; I find the beauty for which I long

&gt; Then softly a step tinkles in the silence
&gt; And there is an interlude in the velvet still
&gt; A rainbow of echoes answers the challenge . . .
&gt; And at your coming they retire to the hill.
&gt; - Waiting

&gt;         Judging from Paul's writing style, and the suggested reading list He
&gt; put in the last chapter of Letters to Gail: I, we can get an idea of
&gt; some of His formative spiritual and literary influences.  In looking
&gt; at Paul's early years, it is important to understand that metaphysics
&gt; in general, and eastern religion in particular, were not in vogue as
&gt; they have been in the past 30 years.  There was only a handful of
&gt; books, and even fewer authors, who made a dent in the western
&gt; consciousness.  From India there was Swami Vivekananda (chief disciple
&gt; of Ramakrishna), Meher Baba and, most notably over the long run,
&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda.  From Russia, there were Madame Blavatsky and
&gt; G.I. Gurdjieff.  From England there was Christopher Isherwood (the
&gt; main western disciple of Vivekananda) and Paul Brunton (who helped
&gt; introduce Ramana Maharshi to the west).

&gt;         Based upon my reading thus far, Paul Brunton appears to have had
&gt; greater impact than most upon Paul Twitchell's writing style.  Both
&gt; share a sense of inquiry of, and a zest for, exploring the esoteric
&gt; and arcane knowledge of the east.  And Paul Brunton had a delightful,
&gt; droll, poetic - very British - way of expressing himself.  His
&gt; accounts of exploring Egypt and India (A Search in Ancient Egypt and A
&gt; Search in Secret India, respectfully) convey the feel of strolling
&gt; through these ancient cultures at an easy pace, taking in the sights
&gt; and sounds along the way.  A Search in Secret India is especially
&gt; noteworthy for its accounts of Brunton's

&gt; &gt; A Look at Sri Paul Twitchell

&gt; &gt; Shall we go?
&gt; &gt; You and I, while we can
&gt; &gt; Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?
&gt; &gt; - Robert Hunter

&gt; &gt;         &quot;How does one die daily and yet live?&quot;  This is the seventh spiritual
&gt; &gt; question which one must confront once he steps out on the pathway to
&gt; &gt; the Absolute.  The answer is simple if you know Shabda Yoga - that is,
&gt; &gt; you must learn to leave the body at will and dwell on the other
&gt; &gt; planes, and return to the body when possible, and at your own command.
&gt; &gt; - Sri Paul Twitchell

&gt; &gt; Paul Twitchell is an enigma.
&gt; &gt; - Brad Steiger

&gt; &gt;         This month we will take a look at one of Sant Mat's most provocative
&gt; &gt; figures: Sri Paul Twitchell.  As someone once noted (I believe it was
&gt; &gt; Sri Harold Klemp), a whirlwind of controversy has surrounded Paul for
&gt; &gt; a long time.  Since at least the late 1970's, when the first serious
&gt; &gt; accusations about Paul's character came to light, people who are aware
&gt; &gt; of Paul's life and works have pretty much been divided into two camps;
&gt; &gt; those who consider Paul to have been a Living Master of the highest
&gt; &gt; order and soul traveler par excellence; and those who think of him as
&gt; &gt; a &quot;notorious&quot; plagiarist and unmitigated fraud.

&gt; &gt;         One thing I have noticed in my short life is that people rarely fit
&gt; &gt; neatly into the pigeonholes by which we try to define them.  There are
&gt; &gt; elements of light and darkness present in all of us, regardless of our
&gt; &gt; station in life and spiritual attainment (or lack thereof), just like
&gt; &gt; the symbol of yin and yang.  So long as we inhabit mental, emotional
&gt; &gt; and physical bodies, we are fallible.  We can soar to spiritual
&gt; &gt; heights one moment, and plummet back to earth the next - only to stand
&gt; &gt; up, dust ourselves off, and leap for the stars once again.  As Sant
&gt; &gt; Kirpal Singh so often said, every Saint has His past, and every sinner
&gt; &gt; his future.

&gt; &gt; Let's see with our hearts
&gt; &gt; These things our eyes have seen
&gt; &gt; And know the truth must
&gt; &gt; Still lie somewhere in between.
&gt; &gt; - Blues for Allah: Robert Hunter

&gt; &gt;         Was Paul Twitchell Living Truth, or rank deceiver?  Was he a
&gt; &gt; combination of both, or more than all of the above?  As I have
&gt; &gt; mentioned on occasion, Paulji has long struck me as a cross between
&gt; &gt; P.T. Barnum, Huck Finn and Kirpal Singh.  Even His staunchest critics
&gt; &gt; will admit that Paul had a genuine interest in occult and spiritual
&gt; &gt; matters, particularly those which pertained to conscious, intentional
&gt; &gt; out-of-body exploration.  This subject seems to have captured His
&gt; &gt; imagination early on, and drove him to study every philosophy, occult,
&gt; &gt; metaphysical and spiritual disciplines which even vaguely pertained to
&gt; &gt; it.  Paul was a restless soul, always moving and growing, learning and
&gt; &gt; mutating.  He was an iconoclast, a true mystic, a cliff hanger, a &quot;one
&gt; &gt; man cult,&quot; an enigma.  More than anything else, Sri Paul Twitchell was
&gt; &gt; an American original.

&gt; &gt;         I suppose the best way to study Paulji is to start with the facts,
&gt; &gt; the things we can be sure of about His life.  To the casual observer,
&gt; &gt; this might seem self-evident.  However, given the fact that there is
&gt; &gt; very little which is objectively known about Paul Twitchell before he
&gt; &gt; became a public figure as the &quot;Living Eck Master,&quot; I believe it is
&gt; &gt; important to have at least a skeletal human framework from which to
&gt; &gt; proceed.  Most of the historical data following is derived from
&gt; &gt; Professor David C. Lane's renowned critique of Paul Twitchell and
&gt; &gt; Eckankar, The Making of a Spiritual Movement.

&gt; &gt;         John Paul Twitchell was born in Paducah, Kentucky, on October 22,
&gt; &gt; 1908-11 (the year is still uncertain).  His parents were Jacob and
&gt; &gt; Effie Twitchell, and He had three siblings, Howard Clyde, Rupert and
&gt; &gt; Katherine (Katie).

&gt; &gt;         According to Paul, his father was a student of the Indian &quot;Eck&quot;
&gt; &gt; Master, Sudar Singh, Who taught Jacob the art of utilizing the Sound
&gt; &gt; Current to facilitate above-body consciousness.  Jacob in turn taught
&gt; &gt; Paul and His sister, Katie, this process as well.  In Brad Steiger's
&gt; &gt; hitherto official biography of Paul Twitchell, In My Soul I Am Free
&gt; &gt; (which now appears to be out of print), Paul stated that He and Katie
&gt; &gt; used to pop spontaneously out of their bodies for fun and frolic, a
&gt; &gt; practice their fundamentalist mother greatly disapproved of.

&gt; &gt;         According to this account, Paul's knowledge of out-of-body
&gt; &gt; exploration grew throughout His youth, hitting an initial peak in His
&gt; &gt; mid-teens (which would correlate to the mid-1920's), when He and Katie
&gt; &gt; went to Allahabad, India to study with Sudar Singh.

&gt; &gt;         At this point it is time to pause for a realty check.  For it is in
&gt; &gt; these initial stages of Paul's authorized biography that critics begin
&gt; &gt; to take issue.  According to other members of Paul's family (notably
&gt; &gt; Katie's husband, Paul Iverlet), Katie never set foot out of the United
&gt; &gt; States.  In addition, according to all reputable Sant Mat scholars,
&gt; &gt; there is absolutely no record whatsoever of a Shabda Master named
&gt; &gt; Sudar Singh.

&gt; &gt;         From here on, critics say Paul Twitchell fabricated his whole life
&gt; &gt; story to make Himself a modern day Shabda superman.  However, to be
&gt; &gt; fair, it must be pointed out that Katie and Jacob were dead for
&gt; &gt; several years before Paul began His public Mastership, so all negative
&gt; &gt; accounts are based on here say from members of His extended family who
&gt; &gt; may (or may not) have had an ax to grind.

&gt; &gt;         In addition, while there is no account of a &quot;Sudar&quot; Singh in Sant
&gt; &gt; Mat, there was a Master named &quot;Sudarshan&quot; Singh, Who was the nephew of
&gt; &gt; Soamiji Dayal, and who resided at the Radhasoami ashram in Allahabad
&gt; &gt; for several years (during the 1920's, I believe).  So it is
&gt; &gt; conceivable that Paul went to India and stayed at this ashram.  The
&gt; &gt; best way to resolve this question would be to thoroughly scan travel
&gt; &gt; records for this time period and see if John Paul Twitchell went to
&gt; &gt; India, as well as contact the Radhasoami Satsang at Soamibagh, and see
&gt; &gt; if they have records of American visitors to Allahabad.  There
&gt; &gt; couldn't have been that many.

&gt; &gt;         In addition, there is a decent chance that Paul's father, if he was
&gt; &gt; interested in eastern mysticism, came into contact with the Sant Mat
&gt; &gt; Teachings in the early 20th Century.  While there wasn't a whole lot
&gt; &gt; of information available in the United States at the time, Phelps
&gt; &gt; Notes (written by an American Satsangi of Brahm Shankar Mishra, Rai
&gt; &gt; Saligram's successor) had been published in 1911, and a small
&gt; &gt; selection of Rai Saligram's discourses had been published as well.

&gt; &gt;         Before we get too far afield, let's refocus on Paul's actual life.
&gt; &gt; He apparently graduated from high school sometime in the late 1920's,
&gt; &gt; and then attended some sort of junior college for a time thereafter.
&gt; &gt; He also began to ply His talents as a writer, publishing a variety of
&gt; &gt; articles in local newspapers and at least two books of mystical
&gt; &gt; poetry, one of which was Coins of Gold, later published by Eckankar
&gt; &gt; under the aegis of Illuminated Way Press.  He also managed to get
&gt; &gt; himself listed in the local Who's Who.

&gt; &gt;         While few details about Paulji's life during this period (and, in
&gt; &gt; fact, on up through World War II) are recorded, a reading of Coins of
&gt; &gt; Gold (first published in 1939) clearly indicates that spirituality was
&gt; &gt; very much on His mind at an early point in His life.  It conveys the
&gt; &gt; sweet agony of separation, of the reed flute from its stock, of the
&gt; &gt; drop of water for the ocean, of Soul for God.  For example:

&gt; &gt; I wait and in the reflection of the stars
&gt; &gt; I cup my hands to hold the tranquil night
&gt; &gt; The soft touch of the silence heals the impatience
&gt; &gt; That awaits your coming and the moonlight

&gt; &gt; In the heart I find you dwelling there . . .
&gt; &gt; As clear as the flow of an endless song
&gt; &gt; And in the eternity of a moment of God's kindness
&gt; &gt; I find the beauty for which I long

&gt; &gt; Then softly a step tinkles in the silence
&gt; &gt; And there is an interlude in the velvet still
&gt; &gt; A rainbow of echoes answers the challenge . . .

Hi Michael,

I see you're posting here lately. The irony kills me! I remember
vividly you sitting in my house, when I was a foolish High Initiate in
eckankar, saddled with the thankless job of editing an eckankar
newsletter, and I was handing over the job to you. You were full of
doubts and questions at the time, going around and around with the
issues of Darwin Gross vs Klemp and Twitchell, and you spoke right up
about without hiding your lack of being a 'true believer.&quot; At the
time, I was having my own doubts, and was actually close to the time
when I would gradually leave eckankar. You were so irreverent! You
smoked up a storm, played your rock music (you played drums, didn't
you?). I secretly got a kick out of making you the editor of the
newsletter, since I knew the local eckankar bosses would have a stroke
with some of the things you were suggesting be done with the
newsletter.

Lisa remembers you well, also, from her trip with you out to a seminar
in, where, San Diego?

So, as you can imagine, it really is a crazy thing to see you showing
up having become a Light and Sound guru of your own making! Wow!  I
get a smile out of this every time I see your name. I really enjoyed
the irreverent, iconoclastic person that you were. I hope that hasn't
changed. Do your followers know about that side of your character?

&gt; &gt; Paul Twitchell is an enigma.
&gt; &gt; - Brad Steiger

&gt; &gt;         This month we will take a look at one of Sant Mat's most provocative
&gt; &gt; figures: Sri Paul Twitchell.  As someone once noted (I believe it was
&gt; &gt; Sri Harold Klemp), a whirlwind of controversy has surrounded Paul for
&gt; &gt; a long time.  Since at least the late 1970's, when the first serious
&gt; &gt; accusations about Paul's character came to light, people who are aware
&gt; &gt; of Paul's life and works have pretty much been divided into two camps;
&gt; &gt; those who consider Paul to have been a Living Master of the highest
&gt; &gt; order and soul traveler par excellence; and those who think of him as
&gt; &gt; a &quot;notorious&quot; plagiarist and unmitigated fraud.

&gt; &gt;         One thing I have noticed in my short life is that people rarely fit
&gt; &gt; neatly into the pigeonholes by which we try to define them.  There are
&gt; &gt; elements of light and darkness present in all of us, regardless of our
&gt; &gt; station in life and spiritual attainment (or lack thereof), just like
&gt; &gt; the symbol of yin and yang.  So long as we inhabit mental, emotional
&gt; &gt; and physical bodies, we are fallible.  We can soar to spiritual
&gt; &gt; heights one moment, and plummet back to earth the next - only to stand
&gt; &gt; up, dust ourselves off, and leap for the stars once again.  As Sant
&gt; &gt; Kirpal Singh so often said, every Saint has His past, and every sinner
&gt; &gt; his future.

&gt; &gt; Let's see with our hearts
&gt; &gt; These things our eyes have seen
&gt; &gt; And know the truth must
&gt; &gt; Still lie somewhere in between.
&gt; &gt; - Blues for Allah: Robert Hunter

&gt; &gt;         Was Paul Twitchell Living Truth, or rank deceiver?  Was he a
&gt; &gt; combination of both, or more than all of the above?  As I have
&gt; &gt; mentioned on occasion, Paulji has long struck me as a cross between
&gt; &gt; P.T. Barnum, Huck Finn and Kirpal Singh.  Even His staunchest critics
&gt; &gt; will admit that Paul had a genuine interest in occult and spiritual
&gt; &gt; matters, particularly those which pertained to conscious, intentional
&gt; &gt; out-of-body exploration.  This subject seems to have captured His
&gt; &gt; imagination early on, and drove him to study every philosophy, occult,
&gt; &gt; metaphysical and spiritual disciplines which even vaguely pertained to
&gt; &gt; it.  Paul was a restless soul, always moving and growing, learning and
&gt; &gt; mutating.  He was an iconoclast, a true mystic, a cliff hanger, a &quot;one
&gt; &gt; man cult,&quot; an enigma.  More than anything else, Sri Paul Twitchell was
&gt; &gt; an American original.

&gt; &gt;         I suppose the best way to study Paulji is to start with the facts,
&gt; &gt; the things we can be sure of about His life.  To the casual observer,
&gt; &gt; this might seem self-evident.  However, given the fact that there is
&gt; &gt; very little which is objectively known about Paul Twitchell before he
&gt; &gt; became a public figure as the &quot;Living Eck Master,&quot; I believe it is
&gt; &gt; important to have at least a skeletal human framework from which to
&gt; &gt; proceed.  Most of the historical data following is derived from
&gt; &gt; Professor David C. Lane's renowned critique of Paul Twitchell and
&gt; &gt; Eckankar, The Making of a Spiritual Movement.

&gt; &gt;         John Paul Twitchell was born in Paducah, Kentucky, on October 22,
&gt; &gt; 1908-11 (the year is still uncertain).  His parents were Jacob and
&gt; &gt; Effie Twitchell, and He had three siblings, Howard Clyde, Rupert and
&gt; &gt; Katherine (Katie).

&gt; &gt;         According to Paul, his father was a student of the Indian &quot;Eck&quot;
&gt; &gt; Master, Sudar Singh, Who taught Jacob the art of utilizing the Sound
&gt; &gt; Current to facilitate above-body consciousness.  Jacob in turn taught
&gt; &gt; Paul and His sister, Katie, this process as well.  In Brad Steiger's
&gt; &gt; hitherto official biography of Paul Twitchell, In My Soul I Am Free
&gt; &gt; (which now appears to be out of print), Paul stated that He and Katie
&gt; &gt; used to pop spontaneously out of their bodies for fun and frolic, a
&gt; &gt; practice their fundamentalist mother greatly disapproved of.

&gt; &gt;         According to this account, Paul's knowledge of out-of-body
&gt; &gt; exploration grew throughout His youth, hitting an initial peak in His
&gt; &gt; mid-teens (which would correlate to the mid-1920's), when He and Katie
&gt; &gt; went to Allahabad, India to study with Sudar Singh.

&gt; &gt;         At this point it is time to pause for a realty check.  For it is in
&gt; &gt; these initial stages of Paul's authorized biography that critics begin
&gt; &gt; to take issue.  According to other members of Paul's family (notably
&gt; &gt; Katie's husband, Paul Iverlet), Katie never set foot out of the United
&gt; &gt; States.  In addition, according to all reputable Sant Mat scholars,
&gt; &gt; there is absolutely no record whatsoever of a Shabda Master named
&gt; &gt; Sudar Singh.

&gt; &gt;         From here on, critics say Paul Twitchell fabricated his whole life
&gt; &gt; story to make Himself a modern day Shabda superman.  However, to be
&gt; &gt; fair, it must be pointed out that Katie and Jacob were dead for
&gt; &gt; several years before Paul began His public Mastership, so all negative
&gt; &gt; accounts are based on here say from members of His extended family who
&gt; &gt; may (or may not) have had an ax to grind.

&gt; &gt;         In addition, while there is no account of a &quot;Sudar&quot; Singh in Sant
&gt; &gt; Mat, there was a Master named &quot;Sudarshan&quot; Singh, Who was the nephew of
&gt; &gt; Soamiji Dayal, and who resided at the Radhasoami ashram in Allahabad
&gt; &gt; for several years (during the 1920's, I believe).  So it is
&gt; &gt; conceivable that Paul went to India and stayed at this ashram.  The
&gt; &gt; best way to resolve this question would be to thoroughly scan travel
&gt; &gt; records for this time period and see if John Paul Twitchell went to
&gt; &gt; India, as well as contact the Radhasoami Satsang at Soamibagh, and see
&gt; &gt; if they have records of American visitors to Allahabad.  There
&gt; &gt; couldn't have been that many.

&gt; &gt;         In addition, there is a decent chance that Paul's father, if he was
&gt; &gt; interested in eastern mysticism, came into contact with the Sant Mat
&gt; &gt; Teachings in the early 20th Century.  While there wasn't a whole lot
&gt; &gt; of information available in the United States at the time, Phelps
&gt; &gt; Notes (written by an American Satsangi of Brahm Shankar Mishra, Rai
&gt; &gt; Saligram's successor) had been published in 1911, and a small
&gt; &gt; selection of Rai Saligram's discourses had been published as well.

&gt; &gt;         Before we get too far afield, let's refocus on Paul's actual life.
&gt; &gt; He apparently graduated from high school sometime in the late 1920's,
&gt; &gt; and then attended some sort of junior college for a time thereafter.
&gt; &gt; He also began to ply His talents as a writer, publishing a variety of
&gt; &gt; articles in local newspapers and at least two books of mystical
&gt; &gt; poetry, one of which was Coins of Gold, later published by Eckankar
&gt; &gt; under the aegis of Illuminated Way Press.  He also managed to get
&gt; &gt; himself listed in the local Who's Who.

&gt; &gt;         While few details about Paulji's life during this period (and, in
&gt; &gt; fact, on up through World War II) are recorded, a reading of Coins of
&gt; &gt; Gold (first published in 1939) clearly indicates that spirituality was
&gt; &gt; very much on His mind at an early point in His life.  It conveys the
&gt; &gt; sweet agony of separation, of the reed flute from its stock, of the
&gt; &gt; drop of water for the ocean, of Soul for God.  For example:

&gt; &gt; I wait and in the reflection of the stars
&gt; &gt; I cup my hands to hold the tranquil night
&gt; &gt; The soft touch of the silence heals the impatience
&gt; &gt; That awaits your coming and the moonlight

&gt; &gt; In the heart I find you dwelling there . . .
&gt; &gt; As clear as the flow of an endless song
&gt; &gt; And in the eternity of a moment of God's kindness
&gt; &gt; I find the beauty for which I long

&gt; &gt; Then softly a step tinkles in

&gt; Hi Michael,

&gt; I see you're posting here lately. The irony kills me! I remember
&gt; vividly you sitting in my house, when I was a foolish High Initiate in
&gt; eckankar, saddled with the thankless job of editing an eckankar
&gt; newsletter, and I was handing over the job to you. You were full of
&gt; doubts and questions at the time, going around and around with the
&gt; issues of Darwin Gross vs Klemp and Twitchell, and you spoke right up
&gt; about without hiding your lack of being a 'true believer.&quot; At the
&gt; time, I was having my own doubts, and was actually close to the time
&gt; when I would gradually leave eckankar. You were so irreverent! You
&gt; smoked up a storm, played your rock music (you played drums, didn't
&gt; you?). I secretly got a kick out of making you the editor of the
&gt; newsletter, since I knew the local eckankar bosses would have a stroke
&gt; with some of the things you were suggesting be done with the
&gt; newsletter.

&gt; Lisa remembers you well, also, from her trip with you out to a seminar
&gt; in, where, San Diego?

&gt; So, as you can imagine, it really is a crazy thing to see you showing
&gt; up having become a Light and Sound guru of your own making! Wow!  I
&gt; get a smile out of this every time I see your name. I really enjoyed
&gt; the irreverent, iconoclastic person that you were. I hope that hasn't
&gt; changed. Do your followers know about that side of your character?

&gt; Tian Yue

Hey there!  How's it going?  And how's Lisa?

Yeah, you did give me a lovely gift with the Tucson newsletter, didn't
you.  Kind of like the gifts cats leave on their owners pillows.  &lt;G&gt;
Actually, I went through two HI reviewers before I parted ways with
the group (their heads kept exploding for some odd reason).  But
that's a story best left for another time.  In answer to your tacit
question, I hung out my shingle in late '93 and did formal teaching
from then until 2000 or thereabouts.  Decided to take a break from
formal instruction after my son Benjamin was born and I became a
single dad, and have been doing that pretty much ever since.

Late last year we moved from Tucson up to Reno and, with the change in
climate and Benjamin entering first grade, I decided to go through my
boxes of  tapes, discs, newsletters and books and see what was there.
Found I have about 150 hours of my own satsangs on cassette, not to
mention weekend seminars (on both cassette and video) I gave and all
sorts of published materials.  It's funny how single parenthood can
occupy your attention.  I forgot there was so much stuff!  I'm still
cataloging all of it, and beginning to transfer my satsangs from
cassette to cd.  May even upload some of them for listening.

One thing I've learned is that my perspective has changed a bit in the
14 years since I first started teaching, and some of the things I
wrote need some editing and updating.  For instance, this thread's
piece on Paulji would probably benefit from me taking the time to read
that new bio that's been discussed here (the one Gail likes so
much).

Probably the other tacit question is, where do I go from here?  Not
sure.  The Current seems to still want to express ItSelf through me,
and is flowing again - stronger than ever.  So as I go through my
files and dip my toes online, I'm looking for a way I can balance my
parental responsibilities with being an active, creative instrument
for Naam's expression.  Then again, I guess that's always part of the
ongoing process, the flow of the river, isn't it.

Gotta run - work to do.

Much love in Eck,

Michael

&gt; &gt; &gt; you must learn to leave the body at will and dwell on the other

&gt; &gt; &gt; A rainbow of echoes answers the challenge . . .
&gt; &gt; &gt; And at your coming they retire to the hill.
&gt; &gt; &gt; - Waiting

&gt; &gt; &gt;         Judging from Paul's writing style, and the suggested reading list He
&gt; &gt; &gt; put in the last chapter of Letters to Gail: I, we can get an idea of
&gt; &gt; &gt; some of His formative spiritual and literary influences.  In looking
&gt; &gt; &gt; at Paul's early years, it is important to understand that metaphysics
&gt; &gt; &gt; in general, and eastern religion in particular, were not in vogue as
&gt; &gt; &gt; they have been in the past 30 years.  There was only a handful of
&gt; &gt; &gt; books, and even fewer authors, who made a dent in the western
&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness.  From India there was Swami Vivekananda (chief disciple
&gt; &gt; &gt; of Ramakrishna), Meher Baba and, most notably over the long run,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Paramahansa Yogananda.  From Russia, there were Madame Blavatsky and
&gt; &gt; &gt; G.I. Gurdjieff.  From England there was Christopher Isherwood (the

&gt; &gt; Lisa remembers you well, also, from her trip with you out to a seminar
&gt; &gt; in, where, San Diego?

&gt; &gt; So, as you can imagine, it really is a crazy thing to see you showing
&gt; &gt; up having become a Light and Sound guru of your own making! Wow!  I
&gt; &gt; get a smile out of this every time I see your name. I really enjoyed
&gt; &gt; the irreverent, iconoclastic person that you were. I hope that hasn't
&gt; &gt; changed. Do your followers know about that side of your character?

&gt; &gt; Tian Yue

&gt; Hey there!  How's it going?  And how's Lisa?

&gt; Yeah, you did give me a lovely gift with the Tucson newsletter, didn't
&gt; you.  Kind of like the gifts cats leave on their owners pillows.  &lt;G&gt;
&gt; Actually, I went through two HI reviewers before I parted ways with
&gt; the group (their heads kept exploding for some odd reason).  But
&gt; that's a story best left for another time.  In answer to your tacit
&gt; question, I hung out my shingle in late '93 and did formal teaching
&gt; from then until 2000 or thereabouts.  Decided to take a break from
&gt; formal instruction after my son Benjamin was born and I became a
&gt; single dad, and have been doing that pretty much ever since.

&gt; Late last year we moved from Tucson up to Reno and, with the change in
&gt; climate and Benjamin entering first grade, I decided to go through my
&gt; boxes of  tapes, discs, newsletters and books and see what was there.
&gt; Found I have about 150 hours of my own satsangs on cassette, not to
&gt; mention weekend seminars (on both cassette and video) I gave and all
&gt; sorts of published materials.  It's funny how single parenthood can
&gt; occupy your attention.  I forgot there was so much stuff!  I'm still
&gt; cataloging all of it, and beginning to transfer my satsangs from
&gt; cassette to cd.  May even upload some of them for listening.

&gt; One thing I've learned is that my perspective has changed a bit in the
&gt; 14 years since I first started teaching, and some of the things I
&gt; wrote need some editing and updating.  For instance, this thread's
&gt; piece on Paulji would probably benefit from me taking the time to read
&gt; that new bio that's been discussed here (the one Gail likes so
&gt; much).

&gt; Probably the other tacit question is, where do I go from here?  Not
&gt; sure.  The Current seems to still want to express ItSelf through me,
&gt; and is flowing again - stronger than ever.  So as I go through my
&gt; files and dip my toes online, I'm looking for a way I can balance my
&gt; parental responsibilities with being an active, creative instrument
&gt; for Naam's expression.  Then again, I guess that's always part of the
&gt; ongoing process, the flow of the river, isn't it.

&gt; Gotta run - work to do.

&gt; Much love in Eck,

Sounds like you're doing well. I still chuckle to myself at all the
hysterics some of my friends went through when your brochures showed
up around town in Tucson. Didn't the brochure have a line drawing of
you smoking a cigarette with a halo around your head (or something
like that?) ? Heh, heh. Believe it or not, I actually stuck up for you
at the time. Of course, few of them knew I'd drifted away from the
group. But they were all ready to hang you from the nearest yard arm.

As for me, Lisa and I went sailing for eight months on my 37' ketch,
down to Mexico and into the Sea of Cortez, all the while realizing
more and more it was time to leave eckankar. We went through some
horrible storms on the way, feeling as if our time on the planet was
near an end, so violent was the sea. But the trip was astounding.

I'd been studying Chinese medicine informally for years and years, so
decided to formalize my education. Went back to school for a good many
years in Santa Fe, NM. I've been practicing acupuncture and Chinese
medicine for years now. I'm now living in the Midwest, of all places.
Lisa's home town.

We're getting ready for a big move back out to the west coast. I miss
the ocean and the mountains, and the evergreens.

Aside from that, I'm think I'm really getting tired of all this
controversy about eckankar. I'm just dropping in to see what's
happening.

But I did want to set the record straight about what I see as the real
eckankar, the real motives of the founders, and tell about the
eckankar experience from the perspective of a longtime former member.

Anyway, nice to hear from you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dark Star:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Look at Sri Paul Twitchell

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by Michael Turner
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; © 1996, 2007

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shall we go?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You and I, while we can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Robert Hunter

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         &quot;How does one die daily and yet live?&quot;  This is the seventh spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question which one must confront once he steps out on the pathway to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Absolute.  The answer is simple if you know Shabda Yoga - that is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you must learn to leave the body at will and dwell on the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planes, and return to the body when possible, and at your own command.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Sri Paul Twitchell

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul Twitchell is an enigma.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Brad Steiger

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         This month we will take a look at one of Sant Mat's most provocative
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; figures: Sri Paul Twitchell.  As someone once noted (I believe it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Harold Klemp), a whirlwind of controversy has surrounded Paul for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a long time.  Since at least the late 1970's, when the first serious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accusations about Paul's character came to light, people who are aware
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Paul's life and works have pretty much been divided into two camps;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those who consider Paul to have been a Living Master of the highest
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; order and soul traveler par excellence; and those who think of him as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;notorious&quot; plagiarist and unmitigated fraud.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         One thing I have noticed in my short life is that people rarely fit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neatly into the pigeonholes by which we try to define them.  There are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elements of light and darkness present in all of us, regardless of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; station in life and spiritual attainment (or lack thereof), just like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the symbol of yin and yang.  So long as we inhabit mental, emotional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and physical bodies, we are fallible.  We can soar to spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heights one moment, and plummet back to earth the next - only to stand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up, dust ourselves off, and leap for the stars once again.  As Sant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kirpal Singh so often said, every Saint has His past, and every sinner
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his future.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's see with our hearts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These things our eyes have seen
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And know the truth must
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still lie somewhere in between.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Blues for Allah: Robert Hunter

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Was Paul Twitchell Living Truth, or rank deceiver?  Was he a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combination of both, or more than all of the above?  As I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned on occasion, Paulji has long struck me as a cross between
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.T. Barnum, Huck Finn and Kirpal Singh.  Even His staunchest critics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will admit that Paul had a genuine interest in occult and spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matters, particularly those which pertained to conscious, intentional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out-of-body exploration.  This subject seems to have captured His
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imagination early on, and drove him to study every philosophy, occult,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metaphysical and spiritual disciplines which even vaguely pertained to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.  Paul was a restless soul, always moving and growing, learning and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mutating.  He was an iconoclast, a true mystic, a cliff hanger, a &quot;one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; man cult,&quot; an enigma.  More than anything else, Sri Paul Twitchell was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an American original.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         I suppose the best way to study Paulji is to start with the facts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the things we can be sure of about His life.  To the casual observer,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this might seem self-evident.  However, given the fact that there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very little which is objectively known about Paul Twitchell before he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; became a public figure as the &quot;Living Eck Master,&quot; I believe it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important to have at least a skeletal human framework from which to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proceed.  Most of the historical data following is derived from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Professor David C. Lane's renowned critique of Paul Twitchell and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eckankar, The Making of a Spiritual Movement.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         John Paul Twitchell was born in Paducah, Kentucky, on October 22,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1908-11 (the year is still uncertain).  His parents were Jacob and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Effie Twitchell, and He had three siblings, Howard Clyde, Rupert and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katherine (Katie).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         According to Paul, his father was a student of the Indian &quot;Eck&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Master, Sudar Singh, Who taught Jacob the art of utilizing the Sound
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Current to facilitate above-body consciousness.  Jacob in turn taught
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul and His sister, Katie, this process as well.  In Brad Steiger's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hitherto official biography of Paul Twitchell, In My Soul I Am Free
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (which now appears to be out of print), Paul stated that He and Katie
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used to pop spontaneously out of their bodies for fun and frolic, a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice their fundamentalist mother greatly disapproved of.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         According to this account, Paul's knowledge of out-of-body
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exploration grew throughout His youth, hitting an initial peak in His
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mid-teens (which would correlate to the mid-1920's), when He and Katie
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Allahabad, India to study with Sudar Singh.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         At this point it is time to pause for a realty check.  For it is in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these initial stages of Paul's authorized biography that critics begin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to take issue.  According to other members of Paul's family (notably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katie's husband, Paul Iverlet), Katie never set foot out of the United
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; States.  In addition, according to all reputable Sant Mat scholars,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is absolutely no record whatsoever of a Shabda Master named
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudar Singh.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         From here on, critics say Paul Twitchell fabricated his whole life
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; story to make Himself a modern day Shabda superman.  However, to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fair, it must be pointed out that Katie and Jacob were dead for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several years before Paul began His public Mastership, so all negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accounts are based on here say from members of His extended family who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may (or may not) have had an ax to grind.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         In addition, while there is no account of a &quot;Sudar&quot; Singh in Sant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mat, there was a Master named &quot;Sudarshan&quot; Singh, Who was the nephew of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soamiji Dayal, and who resided at the Radhasoami ashram in Allahabad
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for several years (during the 1920's, I believe).  So it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conceivable that Paul went to India and stayed at this ashram.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way to resolve this question would be to thoroughly scan travel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; records for this time period and see if John Paul Twitchell went to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; India, as well as contact the Radhasoami Satsang at Soamibagh, and see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if they have records of American visitors to Allahabad.  There
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn't have been that many.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         In addition, there is a decent chance that Paul's father, if he was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in eastern mysticism, came into contact with the Sant Mat
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teachings in the early 20th Century.  While there wasn't a whole lot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of information available in the United States at the time, Phelps
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notes (written by an American Satsangi of Brahm Shankar Mishra, Rai
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saligram's successor) had been published in 1911, and a small
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selection of Rai Saligram's discourses had been published as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Before we get too far afield, let's refocus on Paul's actual life.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He apparently graduated from high school sometime in the late 1920's,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and then attended some sort of junior college for a time thereafter.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He also began to ply His talents as a writer, publishing a variety of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; articles in local newspapers and at least two books of mystical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poetry, one of which was Coins of Gold, later published by Eckankar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under the aegis of Illuminated Way Press.  He also managed to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself listed in the local Who's Who.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         While few details about Paulji's life during this period (and, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact, on up through World War II) are recorded, a reading of Coins of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gold (first published in 1939) clearly indicates that spirituality was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very much on His mind at an early point in His life.  It conveys the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweet agony of separation, of the reed flute from its stock, of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drop of water for the ocean, of Soul for God.  For example:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wait and in the reflection of the stars
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I cup my hands to hold the tranquil night
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The soft touch of the silence heals the impatience
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That awaits your coming and the moonlight

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the heart I find you dwelling there . . .
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As clear as the flow of an endless song
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And in the eternity of a moment of God's kindness
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I find the beauty for which I long

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then softly a step tinkles in the silence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And there is an interlude in the velvet still
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rainbow of echoes answers the challenge . . .
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And at your coming they retire to the hill.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Waiting

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Judging from Paul's writing style, and the suggested reading list He
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put in the last chapter of Letters to Gail: I, we can get an idea of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some of His formative spiritual and literary influences.  In looking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at Paul's early years, it is important to understand that metaphysics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in general, and eastern religion in particular, were not in vogue as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they have been in the past 30 years.  There was only a handful of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; books, and even fewer authors, who made a dent in the western

&gt; &gt; &gt; eckankar, saddled with the thankless job of editing an eckankar

&gt; &gt; &gt; doubts and questions at the time, going around and around with the

&gt; &gt; &gt; about without hiding your lack of being a 'true believer.&quot; At the

&gt; &gt; &gt; when I would gradually leave eckankar. You were so irreverent! You
&gt; &gt; &gt; smoked up a storm, played your rock music (you played drums, didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; you?). I secretly got a kick out of making you the editor of the

Sounds like you're doing well, Kent.  So glad to hear it!

So I had folks in Tucson in a kerfuffle?  Oh my.  I was just trying to
chart a middle path of Naam as best as I knew how, without being
hidebound by anybody's rhetoric or dogma.

To me, it's always been about the Light and Sound - always has been,
always will be.  The point of the Master, as I see it, is primarily to
serve as a human point of expression for IT.  Beyond that, it's a
matter of personal choice - and one's own creative inspiration - how
to express IT.  One of the things I've been doing during my - for lack
of better word - sabattical, is taking the time to consider if overt
teaching and lessons are even necessary, and if so what those lessons
and that mode of teaching should be.

As Paul once (or more than once) noted, the entirety of the path can
be taught in a matter of minutes, or a few paragraphs.  Harmonize your
attention with the return flow of Naam/Eck/Word, let go to IT and let
it lift you up and take you Home.  Even more simply: Commune with the
Word.  That's pretty much it right there.  What else is there to say.
Beyond that, it is between soul, Word, Gurudev and God.

So, like I said, I'm feeling inspired to do something again, but I'm
not quite sure what that is.  It's kind of like how I felt in the late
80's and early 90's - on the verge of something, but waiting and
allowing IT to express ItSelf in Its own time.  When it's time, It
will let me know.  In the meantime, if you (or anybody else here) ever
feels like chatting back and forth in e-mails, or on the phone, or
even via Yahoo IM, that would be great.

Oh, before I forget, I think the logo you're talking about is the same
one in my profile.  My ex-wife - when we were first dating back in
1994 - sketched me kicking back on her couch one evening, and the
erased most of me except for my eyes looking over the top of my
glasses, nose and smile.  No cig.

Have a great night!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Look at Sri Paul Twitchell

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by Michael Turner

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shall we go?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You and I, while we can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Robert Hunter

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         &quot;How does one die daily and yet live?&quot;  This is the seventh spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question which one must confront once he steps out on the pathway to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Absolute.  The answer is simple if you know Shabda Yoga - that is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you must learn to leave the body at will and dwell on the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planes, and return to the body when possible, and at your own command.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Sri Paul Twitchell

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul Twitchell is an enigma.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Brad Steiger

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         This month we will take a look at one of Sant Mat's most provocative
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; figures: Sri Paul Twitchell.  As someone once noted (I believe it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Harold Klemp), a whirlwind of controversy has surrounded Paul for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a long time.  Since at least the late 1970's, when the first serious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accusations about Paul's character came to light, people who are aware
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Paul's life and works have pretty much been divided into two camps;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those who consider Paul to have been a Living Master of the highest
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; order and soul traveler par excellence; and those who think of him as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;notorious&quot; plagiarist and unmitigated fraud.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         One thing I have noticed in my short life is that people rarely fit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neatly into the pigeonholes by which we try to define them.  There are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elements of light and darkness present in all of us, regardless of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; station in life and spiritual attainment (or lack thereof), just like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the symbol of yin and yang.  So long as we inhabit mental, emotional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and physical bodies, we are fallible.  We can soar to spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heights one moment, and plummet back to earth the next - only to stand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up, dust ourselves off, and leap for the stars once again.  As Sant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kirpal Singh so often said, every Saint has His past, and every sinner
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his future.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's see with our hearts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These things our eyes have seen
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And know the truth must
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still lie somewhere in between.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Blues for Allah: Robert Hunter

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Was Paul Twitchell Living Truth, or rank deceiver?  Was he a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combination of both, or more than all of the above?  As I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned on occasion, Paulji has long struck me as a cross between
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.T. Barnum, Huck Finn and Kirpal Singh.  Even His staunchest critics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will admit that Paul had a genuine interest in occult and spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matters, particularly those which pertained to conscious, intentional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out-of-body exploration.  This subject seems to have captured His
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imagination early on, and drove him to study every philosophy, occult,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metaphysical and spiritual disciplines which even vaguely pertained to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.  Paul was a restless soul, always moving and growing, learning and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mutating.  He was an iconoclast, a true mystic, a cliff hanger, a &quot;one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; man cult,&quot; an enigma.  More than anything else, Sri Paul Twitchell was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an American original.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         I suppose the best way to study Paulji is to start with the facts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the things we can be sure of about His life.  To the casual observer,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this might seem self-evident.  However, given the fact that there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very little which is objectively known about Paul Twitchell before he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; became a public figure as the &quot;Living Eck Master,&quot; I believe it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important to have at least a skeletal human framework from which to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proceed.  Most of the historical data following is derived from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Professor David C. Lane's renowned critique of Paul Twitchell and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eckankar, The Making of a Spiritual Movement.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         John Paul Twitchell was born in Paducah, Kentucky, on October 22,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1908-11 (the year is still uncertain).  His parents were Jacob and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Effie Twitchell, and He had three siblings, Howard Clyde, Rupert and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katherine (Katie).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         According to Paul, his father was a student of the Indian &quot;Eck&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Master, Sudar Singh, Who taught Jacob the art of utilizing the Sound
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Current to facilitate above-body consciousness.  Jacob in turn taught
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul and His sister, Katie, this process as well.  In Brad Steiger's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hitherto official biography of Paul Twitchell, In My Soul I Am Free
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (which now appears to be out of print), Paul stated that He and Katie
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used to pop spontaneously out of their bodies for fun and frolic, a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice their fundamentalist mother greatly disapproved of.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         According to this account, Paul's knowledge of out-of-body
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exploration grew throughout His youth, hitting an initial peak in His
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mid-teens (which would correlate to the mid-1920's), when He and Katie
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Allahabad, India to study with Sudar Singh.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         At this point it is time to pause for a realty check.  For it is in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these initial stages of Paul's authorized biography that critics begin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to take issue.  According to other members of Paul's family (notably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katie's husband, Paul Iverlet), Katie never set foot out of the United
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; States.  In addition, according to all reputable Sant Mat scholars,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is absolutely no record whatsoever of a Shabda Master named
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudar Singh.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         From here on, critics say Paul Twitchell fabricated his whole life
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; story to make Himself a modern day Shabda superman.  However, to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fair, it must be pointed out that Katie and Jacob were dead for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several years before Paul began His public Mastership, so all negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accounts are based on here say from members of His extended family who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may (or may not) have had an ax to grind.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         In addition, while there is no account of a &quot;Sudar&quot; Singh in Sant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mat, there was a Master named &quot;Sudarshan&quot; Singh, Who was the nephew of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soamiji Dayal, and who resided at the Radhasoami ashram in Allahabad
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for several years (during the 1920's, I believe).  So it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conceivable that Paul went to India and stayed at this ashram.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way to resolve this question would be to thoroughly scan travel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; records for this time period and see if John Paul Twitchell went to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; India, as well as contact the Radhasoami Satsang at Soamibagh, and see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if they have records of American visitors to Allahabad.  There
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn't have been that many.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         In addition, there is a decent chance that Paul's father, if he was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in eastern mysticism, came into contact with the Sant Mat
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teachings in the early 20th Century.  While there wasn't a whole lot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of information available in the United States at the time, Phelps
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notes (written by an American Satsangi of Brahm Shankar Mishra, Rai
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saligram's successor) had been published in 1911, and a small
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selection of Rai Saligram's discourses had been published as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Before we get too far afield, let's refocus on Paul's actual life.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He apparently graduated from high school sometime in the late 1920's,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and then attended some sort of junior college for a time thereafter.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He also began to ply His talents as a writer, publishing a variety of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; articles in local newspapers and at least two books of mystical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poetry, one of which was Coins of Gold, later published by Eckankar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under the aegis of Illuminated Way Press.  He also managed to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself listed in the local Who's Who.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         While few details about Paulji's life during this period (and, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact, on up through World War II) are recorded, a reading of Coins of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gold (first published in 1939) clearly indicates that spirituality was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very much on His mind at an early point in His life.  It conveys the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweet agony of separation, of the reed flute from its stock, of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drop of water for the ocean, of Soul for God.  For example:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wait and in the reflection of the stars
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I cup my hands to hold the tranquil night
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The soft touch of the silence heals the impatience
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That awaits your coming and the moonlight

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the heart I find you dwelling there . . .
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As clear as the flow of an endless song
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And in the eternity of a moment of God's kindness
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I find the beauty for which I long

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then softly a step tinkles in the silence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And there is an interlude in the velvet still
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rainbow of echoes answers the challenge . . .
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And at your coming they retire to the hill.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Waiting

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Judging from Paul's writing style, and the suggested reading list He
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put in the last chapter of Letters to Gail: I, we can get an idea of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some of His formative spiritual

It's strange that people express surprise that people they knew
decades before are not exactly the same person they knew decades
before except just older. Life can be about learning, developing and
yes, growing spiritually.

Indeed. But I didn't express surprise. Don't assume that everything I
might know or think about a situation or person is laid bare, or that
you know enough about people who post here to step into the middle of
a conversation based on circumstances you have no knowlege of.

As to what is strange, I would also include the tendency for people to
see what they want to see to justify their stereotypes.

As to Michael, I always genuinely get a smile when I remember him.
There are times when all the eckankar nonsense just doesn't matter.

When I last saw him, there were things going on regarding eckankar
that, when I look back on it now, are rather humorous. There were
certain &quot;high&quot; initiates who were involved that, remembering their
pomposity and self importance and their grave concerns over mundane
trivialities like eckankar newsletter guidelines, sparks off some
laughter.

I knew that when I turned over the newsletter to him he would find
himself in the middle of that absurd world, and I also knew that the
powers that be were in for a suprise.

Michael actually wanted to edit a real newsletter, with open
duscussion and freedom of speech, allowing more latitude to
expression, which could have actually resulted in something far more
stimulating and enjoyable, and perhaps even meaningful, than the
typical standard edition eckankar newsletter with stories about
people's pets wagging tails while looking at Klemps' photo (or
something equally inane).

Of course, that sort of latitude isn't allowed in eckankar. Newlsetter
guidelines don't permit too much freedom of speech, and are fraught
with inhibiting rules.

You're asserting erroneous assumptions about my point of view, and
those assumptions aren't substantiated by you with any supporting

After thinking a bit longer about your reply, Dave, it occurs to me
that you possibly have been thinking that I don't accept Michael's
claims of having become an eck master (or whatever he calls it).

You would be correct, if that's what is bothering you. The vast
majority of such claims are bogus. Since Twitchell's claim to
mastership has been thrust into serious doubt, and since much of what
PT asserted has been found to be outright fraud, it follows that all
who've followed in his &quot;lineage&quot; are equally lacking in authenticity.
All of the offshoots of eckankar (with eckanakar itself being an
offshoot) are thus based upon the same lies.

I'm not saying that Michael doesn't genuinely believe himself to be a
master, but the entire eckankar lineage, including all the offshoots,
is obviously fake in terms of the claims of having the extraordinary
ability to free souls from the wheel of reincarnation by linking them
to the sound current, which implies some sort of monopoly on life, as
if without the link-up soul is doomed to a life of deprivation from
God. Utter nonsense!

Sometimes people can see a few of the limitations that get imposed
externally by other people, but often enough, usually because of ego,
these same people cannot see the limitations that they attempt to
impose on others. So you know a person decades ago and then feign
surprise that he is not the same person just older that you knew.
That's what I'm commenting on and that's what I find strange. Life can
provide individuals with many wonderful opportunities for developing,
learning, changing, and growth, including spiritual growth. But the
individual first and always will have to overcome the limitation
techniques that others rely on to attempt to limit the possibilities
that potentially exist. Usually, this is done in order to allay their
own inner personal insecurities. Some people just don't want others to
succeed where they have had less than stellar results. They want
everyone to have less than success because this enables them to put
the blame on external factors rather than having to do the more
difficult and sometimes painful work of looking inwardly to face
themselves.

And I've had similar experiences with the foibles of people, these
inane &quot;rule-makers&quot; yet came away with a completely different point of
view about the effectiveness of the Light and Sound spiritual
practices for my inner growth. People's idiosyncrasies and anything
else of an external nature have nothing to do with the inner spiritual
path.

You're actually trying to do to me what you're claiming I am doing to
others. That is, attempting to impose on me your limited understanding
of my point of view.

I will state, once again, that I didn't &quot;feign surprise&quot; at anything
said by Michael. If you want to be consistent with your own words, you
should realize that you shouldn't be imposing this on me, despite the
fact that it isn't true. Do you see this?

Do you know Michael? Do you know me? Were you present at the events
that I'm referring to? Unless you actually ARE Michael, and are using
a speudo, you're clueless

I'm not quite sure just what your beef is. Why don't you just spit out
what's bothering you?

Also, I never wrote that &quot;light and sound exercises&quot; don't work. I was
using those before I ever heard of eckankar. Eckankar didn't invent
those techniques. These have come from other groups, such as tantra
yoga, for example, that predate eckankar. In India, the techniques are
very common.

It's great that you create with the Light and Sound. I was also
inspired in the past by thru you via your expressed interest in Taoism
to buy a translation of the Tao Te Ching.

http://www.amazon.com/Lao-Tzu-Ching-About-Power/dp/1570623953/ref=sr_...

I couldn't figure out what was meant by the many references to the
&quot;10,000 things.&quot; I thought about this for very long. Then one day I
just understood. I don't have this particular translation of the Tao
Te Ching as I give away my spiritual books every so often, but it's
easy to understand, read, and appreciate. Highly recommended to those
interested in the Tao.

Well, given your attitude, I'm not surprised you think I don't
understand your posts. I suppose I could claim the same about your
lack of understanding of mine. Your posts are understandable enough,
but I do perceive there is more that you left unsaid that would shed
light on your particular slant, and even that I think is becoming
rather clear.

Still, it all comes down to the written languange and how its used.
For example, you were unsure about what &quot;10,000 things&quot; means in
Daoism, and yet, just about any Chinese would have at least some idea
of the meaning. Its simply the gulf that exists between two
individuals that occurs because of languange, and assumptions people
make about their own way of expressing themselves

Thanks for the link to the daodejing site. I've visited many, so I'll
leave that to another time to visit. As it is, I have about eight
translations of the book, although I've kind of lost count.

I'm going to be busy over the weekend, so will propably not be around
to answer any posts 'till the weekend is over.

&gt; It's great that you create with the Light and Sound. I was also
&gt; inspired in the past by thru you via your expressed interest in Taoism
&gt; to buy a translation of the Tao Te Ching.

&gt; I couldn't figure out what was meant by the many references to the
&gt; &quot;10,000 things.&quot; I thought about this for very long. Then one day I
&gt; just understood. I don't have this particular translation of the Tao
&gt; Te Ching as I give away my spiritual books every so often, but it's
&gt; easy to understand, read, and appreciate. Highly recommended to those
&gt; interested in the Tao.

&gt; &gt; You're actually trying to do to me what you're claiming I am doing to
&gt; &gt; others. That is, attempting to impose on me your limited understanding
&gt; &gt; of my point of view.

&gt; &gt; I will state, once again, that I didn't &quot;feign surprise&quot; at anything
&gt; &gt; said by Michael. If you want to be consistent with your own words, you
&gt; &gt; should realize that you shouldn't be imposing this on me, despite the
&gt; &gt; fact that it isn't true. Do you see this?

&gt; &gt; Do you know Michael? Do you know me? Were you present at the events
&gt; &gt; that I'm referring to? Unless you actually ARE Michael, and are using
&gt; &gt; a speudo, you're clueless

&gt; &gt; I'm not quite sure just what your beef is. Why don't you just spit out
&gt; &gt; what's bothering you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes people can see a few of the limitations that get imposed
&gt; &gt; &gt; externally by other people, but often enough, usually because of ego,
&gt; &gt; &gt; these same people cannot see the limitations that they attempt to
&gt; &gt; &gt; impose on others. So you know a person decades ago and then feign
&gt; &gt; &gt; surprise that he is not the same person just older that you knew.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That's what I'm commenting on and that's what I find strange. Life can
&gt; &gt; &gt; provide individuals with many wonderful opportunities for developing,
&gt; &gt; &gt; learning, changing, and growth, including spiritual growth. But the
&gt; &gt; &gt; individual first and always will have to overcome the limitation
&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques that others rely on to attempt to limit the possibilities
&gt; &gt; &gt; that potentially exist. Usually, this is done in order to allay their
&gt; &gt; &gt; own inner personal insecurities. Some people just don't want others to
&gt; &gt; &gt; succeed where they have had less than stellar results. They want
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone to have less than success because this enables them to put
&gt; &gt; &gt; the blame on external factors rather than having to do the more
&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult and sometimes painful work of looking inwardly to face
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And I've had similar experiences with the foibles of people, these
&gt; &gt; &gt; inane &quot;rule-makers&quot; yet came away with a completely different point of
&gt; &gt; &gt; view about the effectiveness of the Light and Sound spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; practices for my inner growth. People's idiosyncrasies and anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; else of an external nature have nothing to do with the inner spiritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; path.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After thinking a bit longer about your reply, Dave, it occurs to me
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you possibly have been thinking that I don't accept Michael's
