Meat and the Planet

The New York Times
December 27, 2006

When you think about the growth of human population over
the last century or so, it is all too easy to imagine it
merely as an increase in the number of humans. But as we
multiply, so do all the things associated with us,
including our livestock. At present, there are about 1.5
billion cattle and domestic buffalo and about 1.7 billion
sheep and goats. With pigs and poultry, they form a
critical part of our enormous biological footprint upon
this planet.

Just how enormous was not really apparent until the
publication of a new report, called "Livestock's Long
Shadow," by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations.

Consider these numbers. Global livestock grazing and feed
production use "30 percent of the land surface of the
planet." Livestock -- which consume more food than they
yield -- also compete directly with humans for water. And
the drive to expand grazing land destroys more
biologically sensitive terrain, rain forests especially,
than anything else.

But what is even more striking, and alarming, is that
livestock are responsible for about 18 percent of the
global warming effect, more than transportation's
contribution. The culprits are methane -- the natural
result of bovine digestion -- and the nitrogen emitted by
manure. Deforestation of grazing land adds to the effect.

There are no easy trade-offs when it comes to global
warming -- such as cutting back on cattle to make room
for cars. The human passion for meat is certainly not
about to end anytime soon. As "Livestock's Long Shadow"
makes clear, our health and the health of the planet
depend on pushing livestock production in more
sustainable directions.

Jay stevens,aka dr. jai etc., seems to have s. asia in mind as he
preaches:

"At present, there are about 1.5 billion cattle and domestic buffalo and
about 1.7 billion sheep and goats. With pigs and poultry, they form a
critical part of our enormous biological footprint upon this planet."

In confirmation we find:

" "I grew up with the ayurvedic wisdom that milk and milk products are
essential, not only as nutrients but also because they have medicinal
value," says Noida-based ayurveda researcher Dr Vinod Verma. "For"

"India has one of the largest livestock
population in the world. Fifty percent of the buffaloes and twenty
percent of the cattle in the world are found in India, most of which
are milch cows and milch buffaloes.

Dairy development in India has been acknowledged the world over as
one
of modern India's most successful developmental programme. India is
the second largest milk producing country with anticipated production
of about 78 million tons during 1999-2000.."

Way to twist the truth to achieve a vegan slant.  You should probably
have kept your junk science restricted to purely vegan newsgroups,
though, if you were planning on everyone agreeing with you.  Your above
info is pure political junk.

First of all, if you're trying to sound credible, then when you say
"Consider these numbers. Global livestock grazing and feed production
use '30 percent of the land surface of the planet.'" you should
probably mention that the # 30 is high and that you're talking strictly
about land that doesn't freeze.

Second, you mention the methane, but fail to mention *why* there's so
much methane.  The cast majority of methane produced by cattle comes
from cattle in feed lots being fed grains... a food completely
unnatural for cows.  Grains cause the cow's rumen to fill with gas
because the rumen becomes acidic and begins to ferment the grains.
That doesn't happen with cows that eat mostly grass.  The rumen of
grass fed cows is far less acidic than that of grain fed cows... thus
yielding far less methane.

You also seem to think that having all that grazing land is a BAD
thing.  You couldn't be further off.  1st, much of the grazing land is
on rocky territory that could not otherwise be used for crops.  In
essence, cattle are converting land that couldn't be used for food
growth into food-producing land.  Second, those grazing fields are
producing loads of oxygen that we all need to survive.

Just thought I'd take a moment to see that the "other side" of the
story was told.

The only truth about Islam and Muslims I need to know is that it seems
to be the only religion trying to kill me and my fellow Americans right
now.  It is the only religion that has waged "Jihad" against my
country.  It also seems to be the only religion regularly recruiting
young men and women to blow themselves up in the name of Islam.  And
what do they get for this?  72 virgins?  Why do they need virgins in
Heaven?  What reason does procreation serve in heaven?

Interesting link, though.

A well spent moment which makes several good points.

people used to live over 100 years.

There have always been some people who lived to be over 100.  Just not
very many of them.  The idea that back in the Good Old Days, everyone
used to live that long is mere hogwash.

And where did you get that lie from?

Humans are omnivores.

&gt;&gt; Editorial

&gt;&gt; Meat and the Planet

&gt;&gt; The New York Times
&gt;&gt; December 27, 2006

&gt;&gt; When you think about the growth of human population over
&gt;&gt; the last century or so, it is all too easy to imagine it
&gt;&gt; merely as an increase in the number of humans. But as we
&gt;&gt; multiply, so do all the things associated with us,
&gt;&gt; including our livestock. At present, there are about 1.5
&gt;&gt; billion cattle and domestic buffalo and about 1.7 billion
&gt;&gt; sheep and goats. With pigs and poultry, they form a
&gt;&gt; critical part of our enormous biological footprint upon
&gt;&gt; this planet.

&gt;&gt; Just how enormous was not really apparent until the
&gt;&gt; publication of a new report, called &quot;Livestock's Long
&gt;&gt; Shadow,&quot; by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
&gt;&gt; United Nations.

&gt;&gt; Consider these numbers. Global livestock grazing and feed
&gt;&gt; production use &quot;30 percent of the land surface of the
&gt;&gt; planet.&quot; Livestock -- which consume more food than they
&gt;&gt; yield -- also compete directly with humans for water. And
&gt;&gt; the drive to expand grazing land destroys more
&gt;&gt; biologically sensitive terrain, rain forests especially,
&gt;&gt; than anything else.

&gt;&gt; But what is even more striking, and alarming, is that
&gt;&gt; livestock are responsible for about 18 percent of the
&gt;&gt; global warming effect, more than transportation's
&gt;&gt; contribution. The culprits are methane -- the natural
&gt;&gt; result of bovine digestion -- and the nitrogen emitted by
&gt;&gt; manure. Deforestation of grazing land adds to the effect.

&gt;&gt; There are no easy trade-offs when it comes to global
&gt;&gt; warming -- such as cutting back on cattle to make room
&gt;&gt; for cars. The human passion for meat is certainly not
&gt;&gt; about to end anytime soon. As &quot;Livestock's Long Shadow&quot;
&gt;&gt; makes clear, our health and the health of the planet
&gt;&gt; depend on pushing livestock production in more
&gt;&gt; sustainable directions.

I don't dispute that humans are omnivores, I was referring to the other two
assertions. Could you please provide some support for them?

As for the first, "Vegetarian diets KILL (Shorten life expectancy)" read
through some of the results of the Loma Linda Adventist Health Study
http://www.llu.edu/llu/health/mortality.html . Although I do hold that it's a
given that meat consumption shortens life expectancy per se as some
reporters have said, it seems pretty apparent from this long-term study
that vegetarian diets do not. I am not a vegetarian myself, however it is
ill-advised in my view to make such blanket statements as you have
made. I would be very happy to be proven wrong, so please be my guest.

As for your comments on the Mediterranean diet, if you read this study
abstract "Mediterranean Diet, Lifestyle Factors, and 10-Year Mortality in
Elderly European Men and Women" on the website of the Journal of the
American Medical Association you will not find a single reference to sugar,

Slip there.. I mean that I do NOT believe that that meat consumption
shortens life expectancy per se, it is my conclusion from the data I have
read that the average person in the west consumes TOO MUCH meat for ideal
health, particularly red meat, relative to other dietary components, as well
as too many calories overall. Vegetarian diets do not fare better than
Mediterranean diets, which include smaller amounts of dairy and meat and are
comparable in caloric intake.

Since the meat-eating habit causes toxins and a lot

Yes
The Mediterranean diet is high in good fiber.  It's one of it's great
attributes.

Plus meat, especially fish is super great in the combination.

All eating causes toxins.
Human intestines are designed very well for meat consumption.

You are assuming something that really isn't so.
Yes, Americans eat a lot of meat, but in caloric percentage, very low.
That's why the low carb diet was so popular and like other diets, over done.
The average American diet is 75-80% carbs.  It should not be above 40%.
Protein consumption is below the optimum 30%, BUT too much from meats.

There isn't a REAL one.
There are many commentaries.
It's hype just like all "diets"
The closest thing to a REALISTIC HUMAN diet is what is often called the
alkaline diet.  Close to what people THINK the Mediterranean is but
medically proven successful.

In any case here is a half way decent coverage (commentary) of the
Mediterranean diet.

http://www.womensheartfoundation.org/content/Nutrition/mediterranean.asp

Note the fact that "meat" is divided into categories.

ALSO
Note that what is considered the Mediterranean diet is what westerners
perceive the meds to eat.

And as I said before, in the era that they CLAIM heart disease to be almost
unknown, they had almost ZERO sugar.  The commentators concentrate on the
low red meat.

I think that the key thing to consider is not how much meat but what kind of
meat and other foods that may be high in saturated fat. It's much different
to talk about broiled skinless chicken breast or halibut vs steak, roast
pork or fast-food fried chicken.

Again, I wish you'd show some figures, your average seems high and that
target seems low. The important key again is not so much the numbers as
complex carbs vs simple, as with fat, bad vs good.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Unfortunately for meat lovers like me, the ideal amount of meat is probably
very small. Otoh, I am happy to compensate by choosing carefully working
hard to optimize the other components of my diet, like avoiding fast-food,
refined sugar, salt, and transfats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the first, &quot;Vegetarian diets KILL (Shorten life expectancy)&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through some of the results of the Loma Linda Adventist Health Study
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.llu.edu/llu/health/mortality.html . Although I do hold that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; given that meat consumption shortens life expectancy per se as some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reporters have said, it seems pretty apparent from this long-term
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; study
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that vegetarian diets do not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Slip there.. I mean that I do NOT believe that that meat consumption
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shortens life expectancy per se, it is my conclusion from the data I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have read that the average person in the west consumes TOO MUCH meat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for ideal health, particularly red meat, relative to other dietary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; components, as well as too many calories overall. Vegetarian diets do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not fare better than Mediterranean diets, which include smaller
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amounts of dairy and meat and are comparable in caloric intake.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Change to, not enough green vegetables.  It's in the percentages.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's primarily in the total caloric intake. It is impossible to consume
&gt;&gt;&gt; the amount of meat that most people do AND eat proportionally more
&gt;&gt;&gt; vegetables AND maintain a healthy low level caloric intake.

&gt;&gt; You are assuming something that really isn't so.
&gt;&gt; Yes, Americans eat a lot of meat, but in caloric percentage, very low.

&gt; I think that the key thing to consider is not how much meat but what kind
&gt; of meat and other foods that may be high in saturated fat. It's much
&gt; different to talk about broiled skinless chicken breast or halibut vs
&gt; steak, roast pork or fast-food fried chicken.

Chicken is plain garbage.
FISH is the protein alternative.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That's why the low carb diet was so popular and like other diets, over
&gt;&gt; done.

&gt; Again, I wish you'd show some figures, your average seems high and that

&gt; complex carbs vs simple, as with fat, bad vs good.

Carbs are carbs.  The difference between simple and complex is how long it
take the body to convert the CARBS to SUGAR.  100 carbs is 100 carbs.
The numbers have been published over and over and over.

The optimum diet in practically EVERY diet book published (by the time you

30% protein, 30%fats.

There are criticisms because people don't apply other rules.
Simple carbs don't supply enough fiber.  Carbs from vegetables and fruits
do.
Protein can come from many vegetables and some grains and fish.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Protein consumption is below the optimum 30%, BUT too much from

&gt;&gt;&gt; belongs in a proper diet.

&gt;&gt; I have.  You apparently have a specific definition of a &quot;fast food&quot;

&gt; I have pretty much the same definition everyone does, I'd say it's you who
&gt; has the specific definition. I am referring to McD's, Burger King,
&gt; Wendy's, Taco Bell.

&gt;&gt; It has become some sort of dirty phrase to you.

&gt; Only if you care about your health.

&gt;&gt; To me &quot;fast food&quot; restaurant is where I can go in, walk up to a counter,
&gt;&gt; get my meal within 20 to 90 seconds, sit down and eat it OR drive thru.

Exactly what I thought.  You have taken a few outlets and CALLED them and
CATEGORIZED them as "OOOOOOO" "Fast food"
To me "fast food" restaurant is where I can go in, walk up to a counter,
get my meal within 20 to 90 seconds, sit down and eat it OR drive thru.

There are several within a five mile radius of my house and they don't even
serve what you describe, even if you ask for it.

FYI fast occurs from either pre-prepared foods OR, NOTE, OR, NON COOKED
foods.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would greatly appreciate it if you would try to restrain yourself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from uttering unsupported statements of opinion.  If you must blurt out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things like &quot;Chicken is plain garbage&quot; then make a case.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FISH is the protein alternative.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are wide variations in fish types also, some are very high in fat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and may not fit depending on the other components.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In fish, the higher the fat, the better, almost entirely.

&gt;&gt; Better for whom and when? If a particular indivdual is challenged to
&gt;&gt; maintain an ideal caloric intake on a given day, then a low fat serving
&gt;&gt; of fish may be a better option in that instance.

&gt; STILL, lower calories is not in RATIOS.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's why the low carb diet was so popular and like other diets,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over done.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The average American diet is 75-80% carbs.  It should not be above
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 40%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, I wish you'd show some figures, your average seems high and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that target seems low. The important key again is not so much the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers as complex carbs vs simple, as with fat, bad vs good.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Carbs are carbs.  The difference between simple and complex is how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long it take the body to convert the CARBS to SUGAR.  100 carbs is 100
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carbs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The numbers have been published over and over and over.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The optimum diet in practically EVERY diet book published (by the time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you get past the hype in the first half of the books) is calories from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 40%carbs, 30% protein, 30%fats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those figures don't tell the real story, what kinds of carbs, protein,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and fats determines whether a diet is good or bad.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong.  Now maybe WHERE the carbs come from (foods that have other
&gt;&gt;&gt; things such as protein, fiber etc. is important, BUT CARBS BECOME SUGAR
&gt;&gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE FROM.
&gt;&gt;&gt; When they analyse and state the Carb content, it means carbs (sugar
&gt;&gt;&gt; producing) STILL 40% carb, 30% fats, 30% protein.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct, fats should have high percentage of omegas and ZERO
&gt;&gt;&gt; hydrogenated and as close to zero transfats.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Proteins are always good.  The foods they come from may be wrong and
&gt;&gt;&gt; like carbs it depends on what ELSE is there.  Men should avoid soy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Women thrive on soy.  (an example.

&gt;&gt; Fair enough..

&gt;&gt;&gt; It Still, withing the carriers comes down to 40% carbs, 30% fats and 30%
&gt;&gt;&gt; protein.  fats and protein are generic terms.  Carbs is a SPECIFIC term.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many dieticians go off the deep end with &quot;complex&quot; ccarbs.  They are
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;better&quot; only because of the carriers, not because the carbs are not
&gt;&gt;&gt; carbs.

&gt;&gt; When people refer to eating &quot;carbs&quot; they mean &quot;high-carbohydrate foods&quot;,
&gt;&gt; not the underlying chemicals.

&gt; Carbs are carbs.

&gt; I think that the key thing to consider is not how much meat but what kind of

'There is a relationship between animal protein and heart disease.
For example, plasma apolipoprotein B is positively associated
with animal-protein intake and inversely associated (lowered)
with vegetable-protein intake (e.g., legumes and greens).
Apolipoprotein B levels correlate strongly with coronary heart
disease.1 Unknown to many is that animal proteins have a
significant effect on raising cholesterol levels as well, while plant
protein lowers it.2

Scientific studies provide evidence that many animal protein's effect
on blood cholesterol may be significant. This is one of the reasons
those switching to a low fat-diet do no experience the cholesterol
lowering they expect unless they also remove the low-fat animal
products as well. Surprising to most people is that yes, even low-fat
dairy and skinless white-meat chicken raise cholesterol. I see this
regularly in my practice. Many individuals do not see the dramatic
drop in cholesterol levels unless they go all the way by cutting all
animal proteins from their diet.
..
Red meat is not the only problem. The consumption of chicken and
fish is also linked to colon cancer. A large recent study examined the
eating habits of 32,000 adults for six years and then watched the
incidence of cancer for these subjects over the next six years. Those
who avoided red meat but ate white meat regularly had a more than
300 percent increase in colon cancer incidence.3 The same study
showed that eating beans, peas, or lentils, at least twice a week was
associated with a 50 percent lower risk than never eating these foods.

Chicken has about the same amount of cholesterol as beef, and the
production of those potent cancer-causing compounds called
heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are even more concentrated in grilled
chicken than in beef.4 Another recent study from New Zealand
that investigated heterocyclic amines in meat, fish, and chicken
found the greatest contributor of HCAs to cancer risk was chicken.5
Likewise, studies indicated that chicken is almost as dangerous as
red meat for the heart. Regarding cholesterol, there is no advantage
to eating lean white instead of lean red meat.6

Associations between diet and cancer, ischemic heart disease,
and all-cause mortality in non-Hispanic white California
Seventh-day Adventists.
Fraser GE. Center for Health Research and the Department of
Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Loma Linda University, CA USA.

Results associating diet with chronic disease in a cohort of 34192
California Seventh-day Adventists are summarized. Most Seventh-
day Adventists do not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, and there
is a wide range of dietary exposures within the population. About
50% of those studied ate meat products &lt;1 time/wk or not at all,
and vegetarians consumed more tomatoes, legumes, nuts, and fruit,
but less coffee, doughnuts, and eggs than did nonvegetarians.
Multivariate analyses showed significant associations between beef
consumption and fatal ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men [relative
risk (RR) = 2.31 for subjects who ate beef &gt; or =3 times/wk
compared with vegetarians], significant protective associations
between nut consumption and fatal and nonfatal IHD in both sexes
(RR approximately 0.5 for subjects who ate nuts &gt; or =5 times/wk
compared with those who ate nuts &lt;1 time/wk), and reduced risk
of IHD in subjects preferring whole-grain to white bread. The
lifetime risk of IHD was reduced by approximately 31% in those
who consumed nuts frequently and by 37% in male vegetarians
compared with nonvegetarians. Cancers of the colon and prostate
were significantly more likely in nonvegetarians (RR of 1.88 and
1.54, respectively), and frequent beef consumers also had higher
risk of bladder cancer. Intake of legumes was negatively associated
with risk of colon cancer in nonvegetarians and risk of pancreatic
cancer. Higher consumption of all fruit or dried fruit was associated
with lower risks of lung, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Cross-
sectional data suggest vegetarian Seventh-day Adventists have
lower risks of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and arthritis than
nonvegetarians. Thus, among Seventh-day Adventists, vegetarians
are healthier than nonvegetarians but this cannot be ascribed only
to the absence of meat.   - PMID: 10479227

'.. disease rates were significantly associated within a range of
dietary plant food composition that suggested an absence of a
disease prevention threshold. That is, the closer a diet is to an
all-plant foods diet, the greater will be the reduction in the rates
of these diseases.'

'Analyses of data from the China studies by his collaborators and
others, Campbell told the epidemiology symposium, is leading to
policy recommendations. He mentioned three:

* The greater the variety of plant-based foods in the diet, the greater
the benefit. Variety insures broader coverage of known and unknown
nutrient needs.

* Provided there is plant food variety, quality and quantity, a healthful
and nutritionally complete diet can be attained without animal-based
food.

* The closer the food is to its native state - with minimal heating,
salting and processing - the greater will be the benefit.

'Livestock a major threat to environment

Remedies urgently needed

29 November 2006, Rome - Which causes more greenhouse gas
emissions, rearing cattle or driving cars?

Surprise!

According to a new report published by the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization, the livestock sector generates more
greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalent - 18
percent - than transport.  It is also a major source of land and water
degradation.

Says Henning Steinfeld, Chief of FAO's Livestock Information and
Policy Branch and senior author of the report: "Livestock are one of
the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental
problems. Urgent action is required to remedy the situation."

With increased prosperity, people are consuming more meat and dairy
products every year. Global meat production is projected to more than
double from 229 million tonnes in 1999/2001 to 465 million tonnes in
2050, while milk output is set to climb from 580 to 1043 million tonnes.

Long shadow

The global livestock sector is growing faster than any other agricultural
sub-sector. It provides livelihoods to about 1.3 billion people and
contributes about 40 percent to global agricultural output. For many
poor farmers in developing countries livestock are also a source of
renewable energy for draft and an essential source of organic fertilizer
for their crops.

['In 1991, Dr. Sanchez accepted a position as the head of ICRAF
in Nairobi, Kenya. There, he quickly discovered that African
agricultural production lagged due to the extremely depleted nature
of the soil. Dr. Sanchez' most enduring contribution to ending
world hunger has been his development of the means to replenish
crucial nutrients in exhausted soils, through the development and
promotion of agroforestry. This practice of planting trees on farms,
when combined with adding locally available rock phosphate to
the soil, has provided farmers in Africa with a way to fertilize
their soils inexpensively and naturally, without relying on costly
chemical fertilizers.

The 150,000 small scale farmers who are utilizing Dr. Sanchez'
methods are experiencing greatly increased yields, in some cases
200% to 400% above previous plantings. In response to this
success, ICRAF plans to help African farmers plant 5.5 billion
more trees over the next decade, the equivalent of another
tropical rainforest. ICRAF's goal is to move 20 million people
out of poverty and remove more that 100 million tons of CO2
from the air with this project.'
http://www.worldfoodprize.org/2002Laureate/pressrelease.htm ]

But such rapid growth exacts a steep environmental price, according to
the FAO report, Livestock's Long Shadow -Environmental Issues and
Options. "The environmental costs per unit of livestock production must
be cut by one half, just to avoid the level of damage worsening beyond
its present level," it warns.

When emissions from land use and land use change are included, the
livestock sector accounts for 9 percent of CO2 deriving from human-
related activities, but produces a much larger share of even more harmful
greenhouse gases. It generates 65 percent of human-related nitrous oxide,
which has 296 times the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CO2.
Most of this comes from manure.

And it accounts for respectively 37 percent of all human-induced methane
(23 times as warming as CO2), which is largely produced by the digestive
system of ruminants, and 64 percent of ammonia, which contributes
significantly to acid rain.

Livestock now use 30 percent of the earth's entire land surface, mostly
permanent pasture but also including 33 percent of the global arable land
used to producing feed for livestock, the report notes. As forests are
cleared to create new pastures, it is a major driver of deforestation,
especially in Latin America where, for example,
