I'm unhappy with my carbonation.  I brew kits, and put the beer into plastic
brown bottles after fermentation. They get a kitchen measuring spoon
teaspoon of sugar for carbonation.   I get great initial heads, but rubbish
carbonation. Almost no bubbles. The beer is clear (although it clouds if
chilled), and there's a slight effervescence, but not the real bubble that
one expects. When I take the lid off there's a fizz and even mist of stuff
as it comes off.  More sugar?! What!

I don't use detergeant. To clean the bottles, I just do series' of water
until I can't smell the old beer any more.  But even when I use brand-new
bottles (cleaned and sanitised), the result is the same.

One teaspoon in a 12oz bottle should give you great carbonation, maybe even
a little over carbonated.
Is it the entire batch? What size are your bottles?
How do you store them after priming and sealing? (70 f or higher for two
weeks)
Are you sure the caps are sealing tight enough to hold carbonation pressure?

I'm using 750 ml plastic brown bottles. there's a real zzzzt as the lid
screws off, sometimes with a spurt of mist as well. The head as i pour is
massive, but it dies down and there's little left behind. I can see a fine
bead going up if I hold the glass in the light, but generally the
bead/bubble to the taste is disappointing.    This has been pretty-well
universal, every batch I've done.  I tolerated it, but I made a batch for my
mother with no corn/wheat sugars used, just malt, and she commented on the
lack of fizz (she's allergic to everything, including preservatives, wheat
and corn).

After I bottle them, they are kept in a top room where it gets pretty warm
every day, (in dark boxes). probably in the mid 20s C every day, at least,
if not more.
They taste great, but the insipid bubbles are really quite depressing.
they're there, but just a furring on the tongue, rather than bursting and
popping.

How big are the bottles? IMO you should really add your priming sugar
to the wort before separating the fermented beer into bottles.

Detergent would impact head retention, but probably not carbonation.

eh? that's new to me.  Interesting. I usually let it sit on the wort after

Well, the heads are huge, but they don't stay. And the bead is fine and
subtle, to be positive. And I don't use detergent, ever. I just soak them in
the sink for a few minutes, then go through a shake and pour cycle. The last
few are with fresh, warm water. And it's rain water (I'm on tank water
here).

Maybe it's because we're used to gas carbonated beers in Australia, the bead

Nope, that will stir up all the crus in your fermenter when you stir in
the sugar.  The &quot;normal&quot; method is to siphon the beer to another
container for bottling and add the sugar for the entire batch to that.
Take a look at this...

750ml = about 25 oz.

I don't carbonate this way, but if someone says that amount of sugar
(a teaspoon) works well for 12 oz, maybe you should consider doubling
it for 25 oz (or use prime tabs and follow the instructions).

Mixing sugar with the whole batch first is more accurate if you are
able to do it. You don't do it in the fermenter, but in another vessel
used specifically to hold the racked beer from the fermenter to bottle
it. Boil the sugar in a little water and dump it in the sanitized
bucket, then rack your beer into it. Stir a little (don't airate) and
bottle from there. One of my recipes says 3/4 cup of corn sugar for a
5.5 gallon batch. Table sugar will work just as well, however it
measures differently, so let someone else provide opinion on how much
to use. Measuring by weight is far more accurate.

( see also Denny's pointer to howtobrew.com )

Nah - when we bottled we would sanitize our priming sugar in a few ozs
of boiling water, let it cool, put it in the bottling bucket, rack the
finished beer over onto the priming solution and then bottle from
there. This would help to mix it up well without any aeration.

No, you're definitely having a carbonation problem. Boil 3/4 cup of
sugar in a few ounces of water, let it cool, and follow the rest of
the steps above and you should be fine. If not, perhaps your yeast are
running our of energy and are not metabolizing the priming sugar?
Unlikely, but not impossible.

Good luck!

An aside, I'd suggest batch priming rather than bottle priming.  Check out
http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter11-4.html
for details.  That probably won't give longer lasting bubbles, however.

Long lasting bubbles are a result of proteins in the beer.

If I remember from earlier posts, you use kits, right?  To add protein,
you may have to do some type of mini-mash.  Just mini-mashing some barley
malt may be enough.  However, many folks use oats or wheat in their
mash to help head retention.  (You can get flaked wheat from your Local
Homebrew Shop (LHBS)).

A mini-mash is pretty simple... just put some barley malt in some
hot water to around 150F and keep it around 150F for 30 minutes or so
(stick it into an oven, set to the lowest warming setting, for example.
The consistancy should be a little wetter than porridge.  After 30 or
more minutes, strain it out with a strainer into your boiling pot and
flush it with a little hot water (do not squeeze it).  Continue to boil
and the rest is your usual procedure.

For an example of grains, you might use a lb of &quot;pale malt&quot; or perhaps
1/2 lb of &quot;pale malt&quot; and 1/4 lb of &quot;instant&quot; oats used for oatmeal.
(You always have to have 1/2 or more of some sort of &quot;malt&quot; - pure grains
like oatmeal, corn flakes, flaked wheat, flaked barley, etc. have no
active enzymes and will not convert the starch to sugar during the mash).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The beer is clear (although it clouds if chilled),
">

That's just chill haze.  It doesn't matter, except for looks.  If you
refrigerate the bottles for 3 or 4 weeks, the haze will usually all
settle out and stay out as long as it is kept cold.

How long do you let them carbonate for, before you open them?

What temp are they stored at during carbonation?

How big are the bottles?  Typical priming rates are around 5oz of sugar
(roughly 3/4 cup) per 5 gallons, which is like .75 teaspoons per 12oz bottle
if my math is right.  However, if you've got larger bottles maybe 1 teaspoon
isn't enough.

When you pour, are you doing it gently down the side, or do you &quot;glug&quot; the
beer into the glass which can cause a lot of the CO2 to come out.

740ml is roughly 24oz.  If you really want to individually prime each bottle,
you probably want to be using 1.5 teaspoons each.  IMO, a much better way to
do it though is to bulk prime the entire batch before you bottle.  That makes
sure that you get better consistency and don't have to worry about bottle
sizes, etc.  5oz (roughly 3/4 cup) is probably typical for a 5 gallon batch.

Yeah, sounds undercarbonated.  You're probably not using enough sugar for
your bottle size.

You can, but then you stir up a lot of the sediment when trying to mix in the
sugar.  The standard way of doing it is to put your priming sugar into a
seperate &quot;bottling bucket&quot; and transfer the beer out of the fermenter into
that.  Then you fill the bottles from the bottling bucket.  That way you
know that you're getting an even distribution of the sugar in each bottle.
Trying to measure out and fill each bottle with sugar is a real pain, and it's
very easy to make a mistake (a bit too much sugar in one bottle, a bit too
little in another, woops I forgot to prime that bottle, uh oh I added sugar
twice to another one.... etc).  IMO, measuring and dumping sugar once into
the bottling bucket is a lot easier.

Hmmm.  There's a lot of interesting info here, thanks people.
My fermenter has a little tap on the side, at the bottom, so decanting the
stuff into another big bucket would be a bit painful. I guess I could do
that,  clean the grey gunge out of the fermenter, re-sanitise it, and pour
the brew back in! But I think I read somewhere that all that aeration might
be a bad thing.

I don't find sugar priming the bottles to be too painful. I use a shiny
steep funnel, and a kitchen measuring spoon.   Which evidently isn't big
enough! I might grab my half-teaspoon measurer, and do one of each. The
bottles are plastic, so they can swell a bit.  Depending on the beer, I let
it carbonatte for 1 or 2 weeks, going by what the instructions say. The last
beer, the one that's annoying me, I let it carbonate for 2 weeks as that was
the instructions, in a very warm room (it's spring). That was 3 weeks ago.
It's a Tooheys lager (based on a popular beer here) although from what
people are saying, our lager kits are really ales! And I used Malt rather
than Dextrose, as a relative is allergic to corn.  It tastes good, rather
smooth, easy-drinking style, but this bubbles thing is frustrating.

I've been busy washing bottles today. Will repeat tomorrow (I believe
repetition is key) and then try the simplest solution first: more sugar.
And then with the next lot that'll get mixed up tomorrow, I might try the
decanting thing.

I have two pails and a carboy, one pail has the spigot on the side and the
other doesn't. The plain pail is used for primary, the carboy is used for
secondary which I do 95% of the time, and the second pail with spigot is for
bottling only. One of the reasons is the spigot sometimes leaks a tiny bit
and it's easier to avoid any mess. You need to get a second pail without a
tap or spigot. That way you can primary in the plain pail and bottle in the
one with the spigot. Or if you want to secondary, you start with the spigot,
secondary in the one without, then back to the first pail for bottling.

There's a big issue right there. You need double the amount of dried

bottles, you need &lt;rough calulation&gt; 4 tsp, I figure.

What's this secondary thing? I have a giant bucket (with a lid) that would

sit in there, without the grey gunge? Can you tip it back into the original
fermenter when it's done?

I used Malt as the &quot;sugar&quot; in the initial ferment. It was a big can of
Cooper's malt, same size can as the kit can (which was hopped malt).
for the priming of the bottles, I use ordinary old sugar (cane sugar here in
Oz). they reckon you need 8 mg per bottle... but maybe there's soem nexus
with the malt and the sugar... might need more sugar for the malty brews.

Secondary fermentation is where you transfer from primary after initial
fermentation into another container and let it sit longer before bottling.
Depending on the style it could sit in secondary for months not weeks. This
helps with aging and clarity of the beer. You can find more about
secondaries in &quot;How To Brew.&quot;

Because your beer tends to sit longer in secondary and it produces less CO2
it is more important to have a fairly air tight container and one with a
minimized head space for your secondary. If the bucket with lid above fits
that description then go for it.

Ah ha! thanks.

I even went out yesterday and bought a small digital kitchen scale, so i can
work out how much sugar I'm really putting in.

Got it for pizza dough making too. Stupid recipes say 7g of yeast. how the
hell do you measure such a small amount?! So I got these scales, figuring
they'll be useful for beer, too.  From memory, one kit said said 8mg of
sugar per bottle. so now I'll find out how much 8 mg really is.

It could definately affect a number of qualities, including head retention.  Fortunately for you,
it's easier to add minerals than to remove them.  My brother brews with *very* hard well water (lots of
iron in addition to calcium and magnesium).  We figured out a way to get the iron out, but the other
stuff is a lot more difficult.

To get an idea on this, take a read through here as well as some googling:
http://www.allaboutbeer.com/homebrew/water3.html
http://hbd.org/brewery/library/wchmprimer.html

You should be able to pick something similar to what you're looking for, and then get some
brewing salts to replicate it.

Even still, I've noticed some significant changes in flavor in only a week, as well as a loss of
carbonation.  I'm not saying you can't do the bottles, but might want to prime a bit more and keep them
cool to have them slow-condition at the same rate as they outgas.  Just a thought.

That *COULD* happen over a very long period and would be called &quot;yeast
autolysis.&quot;

However, for weeks or a month, there's no problem with it on the &quot;sludge.&quot;
((You'll more often see that &quot;sludge&quot; referred to as &quot;spent yeast,&quot;
&quot;trub,&quot; or (in winemaking) &quot;lees.&quot;))

Yes it would.  Generally, most folks' procedure on this newsgroup is:
1. Ferment in a &quot;primary&quot; fermenter for a week or two
2. Siphon into a &quot;secondary&quot; fermenter for another week or two.
3. (For a lager, it might then be dropped to 33F and held for
many weeks for &quot;lagering.&quot;)
4. Siphon into a &quot;bottling bucket&quot; (on top of boiled sugar/water
priming solution) for bottling.
Ideally, the primary fermenter might be any bucket, the secondary might
be glass (for oxygen free longer storage periods), and the bottling
bucket might have a spigot.  In the real world, you use what you have
available! :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, that would be ok.  Some on here would say not to do that becuase
every time you move your beer around, you possibly expose it to more
oxygen, which will cause your beer to stale more quickly.  However,
since you mention in another post that you drink up your beer quickly,
the oxidation probably isn't an issue (it would take months to notice).
Just be careful transferring it and don't splash or foam it up!

OR... maybe you can switch your primary and secondary containers so that
the spigot bucket is free at bottling time --- or install a spigot in
all of them (just be aware that they may start to drip/leak over time
and keep spares handy).

That's what I was trying to say. If you do your primary in a different
bucket then put it in the one with the spigot for bottling it will work much
better. Or if you use the spigot bucket for primary and transfer to
secondary, then your spigot bucket will be clean and ready when you want to
bottle.

Whether to secondary depends on the beer.  No absolute rules.
Some lower gravity beers, like milds and ordinary bitters, that
you drink young, I just go from a long primary to keg.  Other
beers, you might want to condition for awhile, lagers and
stronger ales, these are good to secondary.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Sure.  Alot of people use a dedicated bottling bucket after
secondary in a glass carboy.  With the beer off the yeast, this
is a good time to gently mix in sugar/malt solution for
carbonation.

I primary in a plain bucket, then siphon to secondary carboy or
serving keg when ready.

Usually the bucket with the tap is for bottling and the bucket without the

&gt;&gt; I have two pails and a carboy, one pail has the spigot on the side
&gt;&gt; and the other doesn't. The plain pail is used for primary, the carboy
&gt;&gt; is used for secondary which I do 95% of the time, and the second pail
&gt;&gt; with spigot is for bottling only. One of the reasons is the spigot
&gt;&gt; sometimes leaks a tiny bit and it's easier to avoid any mess. You
&gt;&gt; need to get a second pail without a tap or spigot. That way you can
&gt;&gt; primary in the plain pail and bottle in the one with the spigot. Or
&gt;&gt; if you want to secondary, you start with the spigot, secondary in the
&gt;&gt; one without, then back to the first pail for bottling.

&gt; What's this secondary thing? I have a giant bucket (with a lid) that would
&gt; work.  so say you decant the beer from the initial container (with the
&gt; spigot) into the clean bucket... do you put anything in it? Or does it just
&gt; sit in there, without the grey gunge? Can you tip it back into the original
&gt; fermenter when it's done?
">

http://www.howtobrew.com ;)

Secondaries are optional, but the general idea is that you leave the beer in
the primary fermenter until the majority of activity is over.  Then you
rack the beer over to the secondary fermenter so that it has time to finish
and settle/clear away from the trub (aka grey gunge).  Then after it's been
in the secondary for however long you want, you rack it to the bottling
bucket.

It varies a lot based on the beer, but in general my schedule is about a week
in the primary, two weeks in the secondary, and then about a week to carbonate.

That can happen, but usually not for several months.  Secondaries are really
optional.  One benefit could be that if your primary fermenter is oxygen
permeable and you want to let the beer age without worrying about oxidation,
then you could use a secondary.  Another benefit is that getting it off of
the trub (grey sludge) and into another container will let you do your
final racking to the bottling bucket with less of a chance of stirring up
the sediment.  Some people just do them out of habit because that's how they
learned.  ;)

I wouldn't worry about it for quite a while yet.  IMO, it takes more than a
couple weeks for there to be any real concerns of autolysis (the sludge going
bad).

If that's your only container with a tap, then yes.  Usually a seperate
bottling bucket with it's own tap is used.

First I'm no &quot;Beer Historian&quot; and I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn Express.
Not that I want to start an argument but I would be willing to bet a brew (a
safe bet because if we ever met in person I'd be more than willing to buy
you a brew anyway) that it was home brewing that started the secondary
fermentation idea out of the need to use more than one &quot;fermenter&quot; to
achieve what the production breweries can do in one vessel. While the
breweries can drain off the trub, home brewers needed to use a secondary
fermenter.

I'm guessing you're referring to the point where the yeast go from the
simple sugars to the complex. I'm no biochemist but my guess is that some
yeast are working on the complex sugars right from the start and the simple
sugars, being simple, run out first. Depending on the ingredients and mash
schedule you could have a brew with very little complex sugars, probably
like Budmilloors.

So I was wrong and it's probably wrong for anyone to say secondary
fermentation as it's all just the fermentation process. When he asked what
this secondary thing is I should have said the &quot;secondary fermenter.&quot; I did
send Ant to John Palmer's book where he should get a better understanding of
what a secondary vessel can accomplish for the home brewer.

And John, I realize you weren't trying to rag on me but it was a rough night
at the Post Office last night and I'm still in a bit of a &quot;postal&quot; mood. And
I'll buy you the first beer if we ever meet.

I'm sure John will chime in, but I think the &quot;nit picky&quot; definition of
secondary fermentation is: when ADDITIONAL wort/sugars are added and
fermentation starts up again.  Adding priming sugar for carbonation
causes a true secondary fermentation, for example.

Besides priming, using a true secondary fermentation is probably rare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What's this secondary thing? I have a giant bucket (with a lid) that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Secondary fermentation is where you transfer from primary after initial
&gt;&gt;&gt; fermentation into another container and let it sit longer before
&gt;&gt;&gt; bottling.

&gt;&gt; Just to be a bit nit picky, &quot;secondary fermentation&quot; and &quot;secondary
&gt;&gt; fermenter&quot;
&gt;&gt; are two different things.  What we're really talking about here is a
&gt;&gt; secondary fermenter.  A lot of homebrewers use the terms interchangeably,
&gt;&gt; but they don't really mean the same thing.

&gt; ...

&gt; And John, I realize you weren't trying to rag on me but it was a rough night

No problem.  I didn't really care (and wasn't trying to rag on you), but I've
seen people get confused by the terms before so thought I'd try and clarify
incase ant didn't understand.

If you don't care, just hit delete now.  ;)

Basically, a secondary fermenter refers to another vessel used during the
fermentation of the beer.  There's only one fermentation, but it occurs in
two containers, the &quot;primary fermenter&quot; and &quot;secondary fermenter&quot;.

A secondary fermentation refers to starting a new fermentation after the
original one has completed.  Most of the time you see this term used in the
commercial world they're talking about &quot;naturally carbonated&quot; beer.  IOW,
adding priming sugar to the bottles creates a secondary fermentation, which
is where the carbonation comes from.  We don't really give this a special
name in homebrewing.

One refers to the number of containers, the other refers to the number of
fermentations.

John.

Exactly.  We don't use it in that sense for homebrewing and pretty much
use the terms interchangeably to mean a secondary fermenter.  However,
commercial brewers do use the term to mean an additional fermentation, so
sometimes people get confused.
