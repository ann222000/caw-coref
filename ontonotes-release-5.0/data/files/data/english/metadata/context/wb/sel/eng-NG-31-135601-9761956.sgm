Not while there's still money or political mileage to be made.

Thanks for the link. I have a friend who often says &quot;The truth, crushed to the
ground, will rise again.&quot; Unfortunately, powerful people can sometimes &quot;crush
the truth to the ground&quot; for a long time (e.g. Communism). Fortunately it looks
like the GW fiasco may possibly be entering its final days. If so, thank God!

Don't count on it. As I pointed out elsewhere, it's about the money. If
China, India, Russia, et all can hobble our economic engine (today's report,
GDP grew 4.9%), they'll be relatively better off - I don't think absoulutely
better off, but they won't be so far behind at least.

For what it's worth, a friend sent me the email below.

Year of global cooling

By David Deming
December 19, 2007

Al Gore says global warming is a planetary emergency. It is difficult
to see how this can be so when record low temperatures are being set
all over the world. In 2007, hundreds of people died, not from global
warming, but from cold weather hazards.

Since the mid-19th century, the mean global temperature has increased
by 0.7 degrees Celsius. This slight warming is not unusual, and lies
well within the range of natural variation. Carbon dioxide continues to
build in the atmosphere, but the mean planetary temperature hasn't
increased significantly for nearly nine years. Antarctica is getting
colder. Neither the intensity nor the frequency of hurricanes has
increased. The 2007 season was the third-quietest since 1966. In 2006
not a single hurricane made landfall in the U.S.

South America this year experienced one of its coldest winters in
decades. In Buenos Aires, snow fell for the first time since the year
1918. Dozens of homeless people died from exposure. In Peru, 200 people
died from the cold and thousands more became infected with respiratory
diseases. Crops failed, livestock perished, and the Peruvian government
declared a state of emergency.

Unexpected bitter cold swept the entire Southern Hemisphere in 2007.
Johannesburg, South Africa, had the first significant snowfall in 26
years. Australia experienced the coldest June ever. In northeastern
Australia, the city of Townsville underwent the longest period of
continuously cold weather since 1941. In New Zealand, the weather
turned so cold that vineyards were endangered.

Last January, $1.42 billion worth of California produce was lost to a
devastating five-day freeze. Thousands of agricultural employees were
thrown out of work. At the supermarket, citrus prices soared. In the
wake of the freeze, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger asked
President Bush to issue a disaster declaration for affected counties. A
few months earlier, Mr. Schwarzenegger had enthusiastically signed the
California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, a law designed to cool
the climate. California Sen. Barbara Boxer continues to push for
similar legislation in the U.S. Senate.

In April, a killing freeze destroyed 95 percent of South Carolina's
peach crop, and 90 percent of North Carolina's apple harvest. At
Charlotte, N.C., a record low temperature of 21 degrees Fahrenheit on
April 8 was the coldest ever recorded for April, breaking a record set
in 1923. On June 8, Denver recorded a new low of 31 degrees Fahrenheit.
Denver's temperature records extend back to 1872.

Recent weeks have seen the return of unusually cold conditions to the
Northern Hemisphere. On Dec. 7, St. Cloud, Minn., set a new record low
of minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit. On the same date, record low
temperatures were also recorded in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

Extreme cold weather is occurring worldwide. On Dec. 4, in Seoul,
Korea, the temperature was a record minus 5 degrees Celsius. Nov. 24,
in Meacham, Ore., the minimum temperature was 12 degrees Fahrenheit
colder than the previous record low set in 1952. The Canadian
government warns that this winter is likely to be the coldest in 15
years.

Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri are just emerging from a destructive ice
storm that left at least 36 people dead and a million without electric
power. People worldwide are being reminded of what used to be common
sense: Cold temperatures are inimical to human welfare and warm weather
is beneficial. Left in the dark and cold, Oklahomans rushed out to buy
electric generators powered by gasoline, not solar cells. No one seemed
particularly concerned about the welfare of polar bears, penguins or
walruses. Fossil fuels don't seem so awful when you're in the cold and
dark.

If you think any of the preceding facts can falsify global warming,
you're hopelessly naive. Nothing creates cognitive dissonance in the
mind of a true believer. In 2005, a Canadian Greenpeace representative
explained &quot;global warming can mean colder, it can mean drier, it can
mean wetter.&quot; In other words, all weather variations are evidence for
global warming. I can't make this stuff up.

Global warming has long since passed from scientific hypothesis to the
realm of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo.
