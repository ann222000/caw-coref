I have never really known what is likely to cause the large STOP sign on the
dashboard of my 406 HDI 110 (1999) to come on.   The reason that I ask is
that today it flickered for a few seconds and a few minutes later flickered
again.   Since then it has stayed off and I have done another 20 miles.  The
oil level is fine and the engine temp is exactly as normal.  There was, and
is, no other sign of a problem, the car seems to be running fine.   Does
anyone have any idea what is likely to light it up and, for that matter,
what is likely to cause just a flicker or two?

I believe the large stop lamp is associated with the control module for the
fans. If this is the case try removing the bitrol temp sensor by unplugging.
I will check the colour of the sensor for you as there are 3 on my 1.9
Diesel. This should cause BOTH fans to come on. If only one fan or none come
on you have a fan problem. Normal ram effect when moving fast will cool the
engine unless travelling up hill or making the engine work hard. The
temperature gauge is fed from a separate sensor. I am waiting for warmer
weather to cure a problem with only one fan working on my 1.9 as this means
removing the rad, intercooler and aircon rad. I have proved the problem down
to one if the fans or its wiring.

It's not brake pad wear is it? I also had this in a Citroen XM but only when
I put the right indicator on. Never could really fathom it out, it would go
away with a new/cleaned up bulb and then return at random. It gave me hell
of a fright when it happened on a busy motorway.

Often caused by low level of the brake fluid. As the brake pads wear, the
pistons have to travel further, thus lowering the level in the brake
reservoir. Doesn't need much topping up to correct.

Thanks for the response gents.   I topped up the brake fluid as suggested
although it was only down by a small amount.   This prompted me to look at
the power steering fluid which was down to a fraction below minimum and I
also noticed that this reservoir has a sensor attached, like the brake one.
I have now topped that up as well and will post back here in a week or so if
all is now well (sooner if it ain't).   As for Malc's right indicator, I
suspect it was the car turning and causing the fluid to drop on the same
side of the reservoir as the sensor that caused it.  I say this because the
sensor on the steering reservoir is on the left and the light flickered when
I went round a sharp bend to the left which would make the fluid slosh to
the right.   On my car the brake reservoir sensor is on the right and would
be affected by fluid sloshing to the left on a right hand turn.   I'll stop
now, my head is hurting.

Thanks for the suggestion Mike.  I had wondered about that but discounted it
because throughout the temperature needle stayed in the same position it has
occupied for the last 101,000 miles, i.e. just under 80c, despite my going
through rush hour traffic after the incident.   You will see in my other
response that, after it was suggested that it could be low brake fluid, I
also found low steering fluid, so I have topped up both and will now wait
and see what develops.

At the risk of continuing a pointless debate, mo it wasn't. I put the
indicator on before turning right or overtaking and that's when the fault
happened. Once you got used to it, you could happily ignore it.

Weird.   But you must admit my suggestion, however wrong, does sound good.
Bit like Magnus Pyke if your memory goes back that far.

Yes and yes. I have had the sloshing brake fluid option on another car.
Is he dead yet?

Regrettably yes, he made science enjoyable and used his arms in speech like
he was a windmill.  Long live Sir Patrick Moore who keeps the wonderful
eccentric scientist image going.
