Hello all,

I got to thinking about how Voldemort is the last remaining descendant of
Salazar Slytherin.  However, we also know that Harry and Voldemort are
distantly related through the Peverell family (see [1]).  Therefore, it must
be the case that Salazar Slytherin is a descendant of Cadmus Peverell; we
can conclude that the Peverell family and its Hallows are over one thousand
years old, and predate Hogwarts.  Just a thought.

How come? Harry Potter and Voldemort are related to Peverells through
the maternal line. Salazar Slytherin, or one of his descendants,
probably a Gaunt, married a daughter of Cadmus Peverell, or one of her
descendants. Similarly, an ancestor of Harry Potter married a daughter
of Ignotus Peverell, or a daughter of one of his descendants.

As the three Peverell Brothers are burried in Godric´s Hollow and the
village was named after Gryffindor and probably founded by his time
the Peverells should have lived after Slytherin, who lived at the same
time as Gryffindor.
As the line, as far as I remember, only includes the names of Peverell
and Gaunt this means somewhen a Miss Peverell married a Mr. Gaunt, all
others were men of the name Peverell and Gaunt who married women with
names unknown.
So I think Slytherin has nothing to do with that line. One line is the
Peverell one and one the Slytherin one and they find their match in
Marvolo Gaunt´s parents or grandparents or something like that.
Does it say anywhere that Slytherin has anything to do with the
Peverells?

Maybe there wasn't really a village there at all before GG came along; the

looking for the Hallows and decided to settle where the Peverells had lived.
Otherwise, either they renamed the village after GG after he lived there, or

I'll have to think about this... I'm not actually that strong with
genealogy, so I might have confused marriage relations with blood relations
at some point.

Not at all, if you consider the nature of the wand: it´s just natural
that something that had to be earned by force to attain maximum
strength passed many different hands, and was sought by people all
around the world.

The stone and the cloak keep a much lower profile.

Somehow,I got the idea that the Peverell brothers and the creation of
the Hallows were centuries AFTER the time of Godric Gryffindor and
Salazar Slytherin...is this precluded anywhere in the text?

I recall the grave of Ignotus in the Godric's Hollow cemetery,
but not those of Antioch or Cadmus.

In any case,a Slytherin heiress and a Peverell heiress are clearly
among the ancestors of Marvolo Gaunt,and a different Peverell heiress
and NO Slytherin heiress are among the ancestors of James Potter.
