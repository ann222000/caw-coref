the 1990s

For as long as there have been fathers and sons, overshadowed
offspring have struggled to get out from under the shadow of their
famous forbearers. In the old days, this could mean princes helping
the king to an early death; in modern times, you see it with
everything from Robin Thicke refusing to pimp his old man Alan's
legendary &quot;Growing Pains&quot; street cred to kick start his singing career
to Carrot Top dying his hair red so as not to be confused with Papa
Grut.

But none of them covered themselves in gold paint and became a
sexually ambiguous fetish freak-Dustin Runnels did. For that-and for
being one of the most groundbreaking and charismatic performers of the
1990s-we salute the man who became much more than just the son of &quot;The
American Dream&quot; Dusty Rhodes.

When Dustin started out, he actually followed about as close in his
dad's cowboy boot steps as he could. While he may have been a mite
lankier than his pop and not possessing even a fraction of the old
man's personality, the kid made his pedigree clear when he chose the
ring name Dustin Rhodes. After modest regional success in Texas and
Florida, Dustin headed north to the World Wrestling Federation just in
time to share in the winding down of the darkest, yellow polka-dotted
final days of his dad's career as a regularly active in-ring
competitor.

In a not so memorable episode of Superstars in late 1990, Dustin
donned a leather vest that would make J.R. Ewing cringe and took a
seat in the front row only to find himself on the wrong end of a beat
down from daddy Dusty's then arch-nemesis &quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted
DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. Despite upsetting DiBiase in 10-
minute challenge match on syndicated WWF programming, Dustin would not
be so lucky when he and Dusty teamed unsuccessfully against Virgil and
his boss at the 1991 Royal Rumble en route to being ousted from the
company.

Less than a month later, Dustin debuted on more comfortable turf: his
father's traditional stomping grounds in World Championship Wrestling.
Nicknamed &quot;The Natural,&quot; the younger Rhodes quickly won fans down
south largely by virtue of his last name, but also thanks to a quiet
charisma and basic but solid in-ring work.

Dustin would benefit greatly from being one of top babyface Sting's
allies in his super hot feud with the Dangerous Alliance and forming
championship tag teams with veterans Ricky Steamboat and Barry
Windham. Young Rhodes also met the future temporary love of his life,
falling spurs over ten gallon for Terri Boatwright, who failed to
recruit him as devious Alexandra York but got a diamond ring for her
efforts in real life.

By the beginning of 1993, Dustin's popularity had risen to the point
where he was selected to be WCW's number two man, winning the United
States title from Rick Rude. He would hold onto the U.S. title for the
better part of a year, fending off Rude and a host of others before
dropping the strap to a fellow young lion by the name of Steve Austin
who would drop a Port-o-potty on him four years later.

Unfortunately, Dustin followed up with a less than impressive 1994,
feuding with such luminaries as Bunkhouse Buck, actually trusting Arn
Anderson-yes, that Arn Anderson-as a tag team partner (who of course
turned on him) and ultimately needing dear old dad to come out of
retirement and bail his ass out.

Perhaps feeling like he had something to prove-or perhaps realizing
that nobody wanted to watch two guys punching either in between
tripping in a moving truck-Dustin made the ill-advised decision to
blade in his &quot;King of the Road&quot; match with Blacktop Bully at
Uncensored 1995, violating WCW's strict no blood (if your name isn't
Hulk Hogan or Ric Flair) policy. Having fallen out of favor with his
father since his marriage, Dustin found himself without a place to ply
his trade.

The only other game in town, the WWF, had no use for Dustin Rhodes,
but they did have use for......Goldust.

In perhaps the most dramatic character reinvention since Jim Carrey
tried to be a serious actor, former good ol' boy Dustin Rhodes pulled
a vanishing act and in his place emerged a gold-painted enigma in a
blonde wig and shimmering robe who quoted old Hollywood movies and
played psychological games with his opponents like sending Razor Ramon
flowers or giving Ahmed Johnson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

Nobody could have predicted how well Dustin would take to the
character, boldly pulling off a role that could have easily become a
joke in the hands of a less capable performer. Thriving on the venom
his controversial act drew from the crowd, Goldust would claim three
Intercontinental titles, climax a high octane feud with the legendary
Roddy Piper at Wrestlemania XII with a lame faux O.J. Simpson car
chase, and dare to step in the ring with the ever unstable Ultimate
Warrior.

A brief 1997 flirtation with playing Goldust &quot;straight&quot; as a babyface
complete with loving wife Terri (who had been managing her man as the
sultry Marlena) and cutesy daughter Dakota ended when Dustin ditched
the family man routine and took on Luna Vachon as his new valet,
determined to push the boundaries in the WWF's new, more mature, post-
Bret Hart days and make Goldust more controversial than ever.

Rifling through temporary costumes and personas as &quot;The Artist
Formerly Known As Goldust,&quot; one week &quot;The Bizarre One&quot; would don cone
&quot;breasts&quot; as &quot;Marilyndust&quot; parodying Marilyn Manson, the next he'd
squeeze his burgeoning girth into lingerie to mock WWF sexpot Sable.
On one edition of Raw, Goldust even stuffed a black and yellow polka
dotted singlet in a strange homage to his estranged father.

Following Wrestlemania XIV in 1998, the WWF again attempted to push
Dustin in another direction under his real name with an evangelical
gimmick, but the popularity of the Goldust character would not die. In
fact, the only person who could kill Goldust would be Dustin Runnels.

Rumor has it that during his 1999 run with the Blue Meanie as his
sidekick, Dustin pushed Vince McMahon to pay to get him breast
implants for the Goldust character. This outlandish request combined
with gradual receding of fan reaction and messy divorce proceedings
with Terri were enough to get Goldust the axe.

When former WWF writer Vince Russo took over WCW, he scuttled plans
for Dustin to return as a surreal character named Sev7n, unfortunate
for any fans jonesing for a white-faced Freddy Krueger knockoff on a
black horse (fun fact: according to Wikipedia, the gimmick got
scrapped because Turner Standards &amp; Practices thought Dustin would get
mistook for a child molester). Instead, Dustin patched things up with
his father and settled into a bland year and a half run using live
chickens to hit Terry Funk before WCW died a merciful death.

With WWF now the only game in town and Vince McMahon burying Dustin on-
air during the final edition of Nitro by mentioning the story about
the breast implants, it seemed like the curtain had fallen on the
artist truly formerly known as Goldust. However, since no bridge is
ever truly burned in wrestling, the robe and wig came out of the
closet (no pun intended) at the 2002 Royal Rumble and Goldust returned
to the WWF. While it initially seemed that the character remained as
stale as three years prior, a successful teaming with Booker T as a
comedy duo and later legitimate babyface tag team plus Dustin's
renewed commitment to his own fitness gave Goldust new life that he
would ride out through 2003 before being quietly released due to
budget cuts.

While Dustin would resurface in TNA and later Goldust would briefly
return to WWE in 2005 (both appearances neatly coinciding with Dusty
Rhodes' gaining backstage power at each organization), for all intents
and purposes the final bow had been taken.

Goldust took the flamboyant heel character made famous by the likes of
Gorgeous George and Adrian Street to the next level many never thought
it would reach. Dustin Runnels earns his spot as one of the 100 most
important wrestlers of the past three decades by taking the road less
traveled, breaking away from the shadow of a famous father and
creating an immortal character in sports entertainment history.
