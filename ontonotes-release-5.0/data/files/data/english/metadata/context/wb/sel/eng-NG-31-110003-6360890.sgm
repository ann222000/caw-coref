How-To Make Your Ezine Stand Out From The Masses
Copyright (c) 2007 Bill Platt
the Phantom Writers
http://thePhantomWriters.com

This morning, I was contemplating the question of how many ezines
(electronic magazines) were currently in circulation. So, I tried
to do a bit of detective work.

* Newsletter Access ( http://www.newsletteraccess.com/ ) has
nearly 10,000 ezines listed in their database.

* PubList.com shows 150k in their database.

* The ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) database has
so far registered more than one million periodicals, many of
those being in the electronic format. ( http://www.issn.org/ )

No matter which set of numbers you follow, there are a lot of
ezines competing with your ezine for the same set of readers.

With so much competition in the marketplace for ezine
subscribers, it is imperative for us to learn how to develop a
loyal following among our own subscribers. In this article, I
examine a three ezines that are excelling in the marketplace and
building a large and loyal following of readers. I will also look
at three reasons why these three e-zines are doing so well.

The Electronic Newsletters That We Will Review...

1. Travel by Vasrue Weekly E-Magazine
( http://travel.vasrue.com/newsletter/index.html )

2. Your Membership ( http://www.yourmembership.net/ )

3. SiteProNews ( http://www.sitepronews.com/ )

Original And Exclusive Content

All three of these electronic newsletters utilize original
content at one level or another.

* Travel by Vasrue uses only exclusive, original, travel content
in their E-Magazine.

* The Your Membership newsletter, owned by AEO Publishing, Inc.,
provides a section of their newsletter for webmasters to submit
websites for review, and then they print some of those reviews
for their readers to consider. They also allow individuals to
submit questions, and then they print the best answers submitted
by their readers.

* SiteProNews, owned by Jayde Online, Inc., utilizes a lot of
first-run, original content written by members of their staff,
including articles written by Jim Hedger and Mel Strocen. Some of
this content can be seen in other publications later, but you
will always see it in SiteProNews first.

Exclusive content allows your ezine to stand far above all of
your competitors. While free reprint articles (like this one) are
a good source of information, most of your competitors rely
solely on other people to create the content for their
newsletters.

For most readers, this is not a big deal, except when the
particular article used may have been read in competing ezines
previously.

Readers tend to favor ezines that utilize exclusive or first-run
content in their issues.

A Winning Formula

Successful ezines always have a specific format and formula for
their publications.

* Travel by Vasrue focuses on giving their readers specific
information that they can use to make good travel decisions. They
also provide specific information regarding a choice of vacation
options within the context of their currently discussed travel
destination.

* The Your Membership newsletter focuses on offering their
readers an opportunity to ask questions and to have those
questions answered by other readers who have the knowledge to
share.

* SiteProNews prefers to provide content that will point you to
third-party resources that are related to the current topic.

Once an ezine has found their winning formula, that formula will
become their trademark.

They Understand Their Readers

If you do not understand what your readers want from your
newsletter, you will never be able to develop a profitable
mailing list.

* Travel by Vasrue doesn't leave it to chance. They ask their
readers what destinations they would be interested to find
specific information. Then they deliver exactly what their
readers have asked to receive.

* The Your Membership newsletter is offered on a dozen or so
websites that cater specifically to the needs of webmasters who
are looking to develop a commercially viable website. While the
source of the subscription pretty much defines what their readers
want to see in the newsletter, the fact that they rely on the Q&amp;A
process to fill their issues helps them to select articles that
would be of real interest to their readers.

* SiteProNews is offered to the people who use Jayde Online's
many free webmaster tools. Their newsletter caters to the needs
of those commercial webmasters who are already utilizing their
free tools.

In Conclusion...

Successful ezines are those that are willing to cater to the
specific needs of their readers, and then they deliver their
information in a consistent format. Successful ezines are also
those that are willing to invest the extra time, effort and money
into creating one-of-a-kind, original content for their readers
to voraciously consume.

While those reprint articles are often very informative, I am
sure that you hate it when you see the same article appear in a
number of the ezines that you read. A once-in-a-while repeat
article is all well and good, but if one ezine is consistently
following in the footsteps of another ezine you read, then why
would you want to keep reading the second?

The Your Membership newsletter has shown us that utilizing mostly
reprint articles can prove successful, when you are willing to
mix some other kinds of exclusive content with the free reprint
articles. SiteProNews has shown us that you can be successful
when you are willing to mix original, first-run articles with
reprint articles.

By following the lead of those who have been successful before
you, you might just find that you can build your mailing list to
be a very profitable aspect of your overall enterprise. It is my
hope that this free reprint article has given you some food for
thought as to how to follow in the steps of those before you.
