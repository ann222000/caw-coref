DECOREX INTERNATIONAL
REACHING A DISTANT AUDIENCE

Decorex International - quite simply the best
interior design trade exhibition in the world
-celebrates its twentieth anniversary in 1998,
with a gala party, a ball, a celebrity reception
and, of course, the best show yet.

Nearly 20 % of Decorex International's visitors
travel from foreign countries all over the world
and, in 1997, over 100 professionals from South
East Asia attended the show. In recognition of
the exhibition's immense international
popularity, Decorex International is taking a
stand at The Asian International Gift Fair in
Singapore, from April 22nd to 25th, to promote
the show to buyers. Taking advantage of
fast-growing Far Eastern interest in Western
interior design, the stand will also feature
Decorex USA, the 7 - 10 June 1998 offshoot of
the UK parent exhibition, as well as Living
Design London, the UK's Spring show of top
interior design merchandise.

All three exhibitions concentrate on only the
very best interiors products, including furnishing
fabrics, furniture, wall and floor coverings,
lighting, garden furnishings and a whole host of
decorative accessories - prints, frames,
miniatures, mirrors, clocks, statuary,
jardinieres, planters, pedestals, fountains,
hand-carvings and mouldings, plaques, glass,
ceramics, tableware, linens, fenders,
fire-screens, pelmets, curtain poles, door
furniture, art and design books and paints in a
whole spectrum of colours. They have become
recognised as annual forums for top companies
to launch new collections and products to the
market and, at Decorex International 1997, over
300 new ranges were premiered.

Decorex International's Saturday opening,
introduced in 1996, has become a popular
feature of the event, allowing visitors to spend a
whole weekend at the exhibition. Both Living
Design London and Decorex USA open on
Sunday, offering busy professionals an
opportunity to see the shows, without losing
time from their working schedule. Entrance to
the three exhibitions is by catalogue only. A
special reduction is offered to visitors who bring
pre-completed registration cards.

For information on how to apply for registration
cards, visitors may call the Exhibition Hotline
on (0171) 833 3374 or pre-register online.
