Seeing as it has been slow around here I figured this might wake it up a
bit.
Seems that the 06 Viper is 7 10ths. slower and 9 mph slower than the
Corvette Z06 in the quarter mile. One place the Viper did beat the Corvette
was price. Viper cost approx 35K more.

These tests were not done at the same location or same time or by the same
drive but are a pretty good indication of what is to come.

Bud, drop in and say hello.

You know, along those lines the Duramax for 06 is getting a substantial
horsepower and torque increase.  Supposed to be the most powerful diesel in
productions for a light duty truck.

I had heard that but haven't seen any figures. The 610 foot lbs. of the
Cummins is well up there but is nowhere it's potential. Actually I find it a
bit of a pia when m/t, have to feather the pedal or the rears will turn on
dry pavement. On wet you have to be very light with it.

The last sentence is of major importance, driver skill is more essential in
the Viper than in the Vette.

My old Compaq gave up the ghost and money's been tighter than a old mizer's
wallet, so I've been offline for a while. My eldest bought a
motherboard/case and power supply for me and I wrangled a deal with a local
compter expert to build a Pent.III system.

Sorry, the Cushman's on hold till I get the LeBaron up and running again.
Darn trans went out. For now, my kid brother's staying with us and we're
driving his ( shudder!!!!) 89 Astro van.

Good to see you alive and kicking.  Things have been good here and the
old dodge is still going.  It must be related to the everready bunny,
268 K and purring.  Haven't been in here much myself as I have taking
up a new endevor, bow hunting.  Sunk an arrow into one Monday but
never found her after hours of searching.  Watching for buzzards now
so I can get my arrow back!

Have you gold plated the cushman yet?  I haven't done much bike
building the past year and the dodge d-50 trike is still on hold.  I
got into building a bee box making machine last fall.  Had to make it
all pneumatic/battery voltage controls so the Amish could use it.  It
works pretty good producing 200 boxes an hour but I am still modifying
it.

Stop in and chat once and awhile.  Questions get asked here that
pertain to dodges built long before my time.

See Denny!! Now the friggin' jackal's are attacking me. That's what I get

Guess they let the nursing home comedy team take their show on the road.
Picture those old farts together in Mikes truck fighting over the controls
for the heated seats. I can hear the conversation now. "Budd pass the
metamucil will ya" "Okay mac but ya have to share the prunes" Mike has his
own concerns. "We have been driveing for 15 minutes I gotta stop and go to

It was a good shot, right about the shoulder area.  Arrow half way in
so she isn't going to suffer too long.

I shot about 50 arrows a day for over 2 months getting ready.  I have

Size matters, but it's how many of the 50 were in the paper plate each day

It's an mild form of "Buck Fever" as is found among primitive cultures.
Aborigines, for example, will shake their boomerangs at 'Roos, when B.F.
hits them, instead of throwing the boomerang. Hence the source of the old
Austrailian hit song by Rolf Harris, "My Boomerang Won't Come Back".

In your case, a full blown case will result in you knocking then dropping
every arrow in your quiver and never take the shot.

At which time we will have to take a vote to see if you should be called
"Bunny Jr"

Actually a perfect side shot.  I figure I hit the shoulder blade and
then a rib to slow the arrow down that much.  It should have gone slam
through her not just half way.  What amazed me was that I never found
a drop of blood!  I have tracked many a deer in the past after
shooting them with a  shotgun and have found most.  I waited a full
1/2 hour before even leaving my tree stand so I wouldn't jump her too.
I could see where she ran for about 50 yds by the leaves and dirt
kicked up but then nothing.  I went back home and got the dogs to help
and they didn't pick up on her either.

I have a peep sight and 5 pins set for 10 - 50 yds.  In the 10 to 30
yd range I could put most through a quart jar lid, and at 40 - 50 a

seams that the field points fly a little truer than the broadheads.

I find that learning to judge the distances in the field while under
the influence of buck fever the tough part.  I got to get one soon as
muzzelloader season comes in on the 20th.   Believe it or not you can
kill 36 this year, and  4 counties don't have a limit!

&gt; a drop of blood!  I have tracked many a deer in the past after
&gt; shooting them with a  shotgun and have found most.  I waited a full
&gt; 1/2 hour before even leaving my tree stand so I wouldn't jump her too.
&gt; I could see where she ran for about 50 yds by the leaves and dirt
&gt; kicked up but then nothing.  I went back home and got the dogs to help
&gt; and they didn't pick up on her either.
">

Now that is curious. No Blood? It may have only pooled internally under the
lungs. Or a dull broadhead (they gotta be sharp enough to shave with as a
minimum) will cause the bleeding to stop too soon. There are many variables.
I do wish you had found it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; I shot about 50 arrows a day for over 2 months getting ready.  I have
&gt; &gt;&gt; no problems hitting a paper plate @ 50 yards.

&gt; &gt;Size matters, but it's how many of the 50 were in the paper plate each
day
&gt; &gt;that counts the most. My best grouping was 10 in a circle the size of a 2
&gt; &gt;lb. coffee can at 35 yards shooting intinctive (no sights) or stabilizers
&gt; &gt;(Bear Whitetail Hunter 60# recurve).

&gt; I have a peep sight and 5 pins set for 10 - 50 yds.  In the 10 to 30
&gt; yd range I could put most through a quart jar lid, and at 40 - 50 a
&gt; pie pan.  I am using carbon arrows as well.  I'm no expert but it
&gt; seams that the field points fly a little truer than the broadheads.
">

Standard broadheads literally "fly" like small wings at the 300+ mph your
arrows move. So much the old solid blade points could vary a shot by a foot
or more at 35 yards. That's enough to miss a the kill zone on a eastern
Whitetail.You may want to look into those fancy retractable blade style
heads or give your arrows a faster spin ( tightens up the spiral during
flight). or both, maybe.

I tried a peep a long time ago but being an instinct shooter, I didn't
adjust to it easily. I can see the benefit for some but it didn't work for
me. I have used pins and my hand draws to a very consistent position
naturally, but they didn't help my accuracy much.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I find that learning to judge the distances in the field while under
&gt; the influence of buck fever the tough part.  I got to get one soon as
&gt; muzzelloader season comes in on the 20th.   Believe it or not you can
&gt; kill 36 this year, and  4 counties don't have a limit!
">

36 Whitetail????? I'll bet they're getting stunted or diseased from
over-population. Makes you wish for that "machine gun" crossbow from the
movie "Van Helsing" (SP?) doesn't it?

&gt; &gt;&gt;  I find the adrenelin
&gt; &gt;&gt; flow a little higher shooting at deer than a hay bale.

&gt; &gt;It's an mild form of &quot;Buck Fever&quot; as is found among primitive cultures.
&gt; &gt;Aborigines, for example, will shake their boomerangs at 'Roos, when B.F.
&gt; &gt;hits them, instead of throwing the boomerang. Hence the source of the old
&gt; &gt;Austrailian hit song by Rolf Harris, &quot;My Boomerang Won't Come Back&quot;.

&gt; &gt;In your case, a full blown case will result in you knocking then dropping
&gt; &gt;every arrow in your quiver and never take the shot.

&gt; &gt;At which time we will have to take a vote to see if you should be called
&gt; &gt;&quot;Bunny Jr&quot;

&gt; I got caught spot lighing a bunny rabbit years ago but that is a whole
&gt; nother story.
">

I won't ask. What you and Denny do is your business . . . .

But as a side note: a friend back in CO told me of a time he took a new
bowhunter out hunting and the poor guy got B.F. so bad he pulled out every
arrow from his bow quiver and just dropped them on the ground. That would be
like a rifle hunter jacking every round out of his gun and never taking a
shot . . . .which also happens.

OK.  I was a senior in high school  and my sister was doing a science
fair project that required rabbit blood media.  So a freind was
driving my '64 Catalina through the fields at night with me on the
hood with the 12 gauge.  The neighbor called the cops and they arrived
at my house about the same time as I did with the dead rabbit!  After
some explaining the cop finally said "I can't arrest anyone for
working on a science fair project" and left.
