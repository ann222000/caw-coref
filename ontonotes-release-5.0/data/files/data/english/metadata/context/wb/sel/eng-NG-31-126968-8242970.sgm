Are We Failing Our Geniuses?
http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1653653,00.html

from above:

To some extent, complacency is built into the system. American schools
spend more than $8 billion a year educating the mentally retarded.
Spending on the gifted isn't even tabulated in some states, but by the
most generous calculation, we spend no more than $800 million on
gifted programs. But it can't make sense to spend 10 times as much to
try to bring low-achieving students to mere proficiency as we do to
nurture those with the greatest potential.

I don't know about that.  The gifted are probably quite capable of

to convince anyone that school is pointless and stupid.

that may be more a question of the quality of the educational
system ...
possibly geared towards the extremely disadvantage ... resulting
in one of the higher per capital spending but at the bottom of the
20 industrial nations in effectiveness (i.e. really gifted currently
can only benefit from doing it on their own ... since the majority of
the system is clearly not setup to benefit them)

so the other part is society being required to subsidize individuals
that contribute less to society than they use.

one aspect of this is old posts about census dept. estimating that
half the industrial jobs had to be subsidized to one degree or another
(the worker's economic contribution was less than they earned ... at
least to some amount)
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2004b.html#42 The SOB that helped IT jobs

move to India is dead!
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006f.html#44 The Pankian Metaphor
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006g.html#20 The Pankian Metaphor

or recent posts where the gao estimated that illegal alien economic
contribution was barely half of their cost to society (something in
society being required to make up the short fall)
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2007i.html#18 John W. Backus, 82, Fortran
developer, dies
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2007i.html#70 illegal aliens
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2007i.html#79 John W. Backus, 82, Fortran
developer, dies
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2007i.html#81 illegal aliens

so pre technology society ... society value was largely based on
available natural resources and/or ability to utilize those
resources .... extensive use of natural resources could be used to
compensate for differences between individual's total cost to society
(standard of living, etc) and their contribution to society. in
migration to technology society ... value significantly migrates to
technology and away from natural resources. The primary contributions
to technology society are the individuals with the skills to come up
with new ideas and inventions.

A large part of the whole public school system justification has been
based on making citizens more productive members of society (and
requiring less society subsidy to maintain them). One strategy is
attempting to minimize the subsidy that large portions of the
population requires. Another strategy is maximize the excess resources
available for subsidizing those members. In transition to technology
society, the &quot;excess resources&quot; are going to be new ideas and
inventions (subsidy requires shifting excess resources in one area to
other areas ... w/o excess resources ... the ability to &quot;subsidize&quot;
starts to disappear).

The numbers for the educational system seems to indicate that its
ability to produce productive members of society (i.e. able to exist w/
o subsidy) is declining while at the same time, the shift to
technology society is raising the requirements on what is required to
be productive (the bar is being raised on what is required to be
functionally literate as opposed to functionally illiterate).

In any case, with technology society, there would appear to be a shift
that society value becomes less based on the natural resources within
its borders (and/or the ability to utilize such natural resources) and
more based on the new ideas and inventions from the best and brightest
in the society.

What goes around comes around Barb. For instance, at the top end of the
UK educational tree, the state spends *very* large sums on university
and beyond for the most able students. While bitching all the time
about punitive socialist taxation, I was happily signing up high energy
physicists and mathematicians and chemists (as long as they knew VMS)
at *bargain* prices. There was no way a small business could pay for
the education that had been pumped into those guys. I got 'em cheap
because they were too smart, and maybe their arms were too long from
lugging lead blocks through the tunnels at CERN.

You will be pleased to learn that a few of them have crossed the pond
and are now making the US richer. What goes around, comes around.

It *might* have been a good thing to stretch the brightest at secondary
and primary school, but I doubt it would be as cost-effective as
ensuring the less able are self-sufficient all through life. Schools
are designed to churn out cannon fodder and supine consumers and
voters. What would happen to that finely tuned machine if you overtly
polluted it with bright students?

What really happens everywhere is that somehow the best students are
surreptitiously looked after by one or two great teachers quietly
bucking the system. I bet you can remember who your's were.

Sometimes the best students are mentored. Quite often they are
*not*. MENSA (an organization that requires an IQ of 140 to join)
is loaded with janitors and other folks who have jobs requiring

And they do avery good job of it to.

My IQ isn't 140, but I was always told I would never get past
something; high school, boot camp, and university. I graduated from
all of them. It wasn't the same people in each situation either.

So I would guess there are, probably over half of humanity, people
who don't want others to succeed.

No problem (at least according to the Canadian government) - just
bring in enough skilled immigrants that you don't have to fix the
educational system.

My theory is that the government has a lot in common with flying
saucer cults: the UFOlogists believe that we will be saved by
aliens from another planet, while the government believes that
we will be saved by aliens from another country.  The disquieting
common thread is that neither group believes that we have to
solve our problems ourselves.

Oh I agree. Not that anyone bright would admit to joining Mensa. ;-)
Maybe I was too subtle. The really bright kids are so much smarter than
all but a few of their teachers. The school systems I attended and
taught (briefly) in were not organised to make it easy for either.
It was prudent for both sets to act normal.
Like D.J. says in the post next door, there are a lot of people don't
want others to succeed. I think D.J. found a few of them teaching at
the schools he went to.
It *would* be really expensive to change that.

This week you wouldn't bother with ordinary school for bright kids, at
least those that can afford any old piece of junk computer to get on
the net. Which makes it even less cost effective to make schools do the
right thing by bright kids.

Anyway, like I said to Barb, once they get to uni, the system does
start looking after the bright ones.

It is tough on poor bright ones though. It must be worse in the US
where you have to pay a lot of your tuition up front.

That's not the problem.  The problem is spending school monies
on things that do not enhance the infrastructure of the school.
Hiring a limo service for each and every learning-challenged
kid diverts funds that might have bought books that could be

I do talk to other people, this is internet/Usenet afterall.

A number of people have told me they encounter jerks who did
everything they could to discourage them from learning to. From my,
albeit non-scientific research, there are people everywhere on this
planet who do their best to discourage others from doing much of
anything. I have no idea why there are peope who do that, maybe that
is how they get their jollies.

The small town I grew up in most everyone there kept telling
everyone to not go past high school. I guess they realized that
there were no jobs for educated people there, with the exception of
the town librarian. My parents went there around 5 years ago for my
mother's high school reunion. Many of the stores in town were
boarded up. I wasn't surprised at that result.

A funny one is when I was in the Navy. Twenty of us said we wanted
to be electronics techs. Only 6 of us got selected for that school.
I was one of the ones selected. Few said I would get selected, and
all of them said I would flunk out if Idid get selected to go to
that school. I graduated, some of those who got selected didn't.

Of course, it could have been my 'hay seed unedumacated' accent back
then.

]It *would* be really expensive to change that.

Toss the discouragers into prison. Soon, it will stop. Half-smiley.

]Anyway, like I said to Barb, once they get to uni, the system does
]start looking after the bright ones.

Some faculty encourage, some discourage. Some tell you that you are
a failure. Even when you aren't.

I told one faculty moron I had survived a hurricane at sea. I
figured I could survive a little homework. He huffed and puffed, but
I graduated anyway.

Other faculty encourged me.

]It is tough on poor bright ones though. It must be worse in the US
]where you have to pay a lot of your tuition up front.

The first time I went to university, the financial aid forms stated
they would deduct $800 dollars from my 'evaluated need for aid'
because I should have $800 put aside before I started classes.

I politely informed the financial aid office that if I could afford
to put aside that much money, I wouldn't need to go to university.
That particular financial aid person did work with me and I did get
aid. When I transferred, the first location was a community college
and only had associate degrees, to a 4-year university they made it
much harder to get anything.

The community college financial aid officer would do things like
tell me to read over several forms, fill out the one(s) that apply
to me, and he could get me aid if I qualified.

The ones after that presumed financial aid applicants could read
their minds and deduce what aid was available and request it in
writing. I found out later there is supposed to be a 3-ring notebook
of aid programs for students to look at. They are supposed to
mention it to all applicants. The ones after the community college
didn't.

There are aid programs for things like 'anyone over 6' tall', or
'take craft classes, design and make a quilt, and you can get $1,000
from a quilting group', etc. Some seem a little odd, but there are
evidently lots of small aid packages if a student looks around for
them.

Before I graduated, I didn't use financial aid all the time, they
stopped saying anyone should have money put aside. The forms were
federal.

True enough. But then if you are bright and your parents aren't, you

No.  Because if others do good things that they can't or don't, they
look bad in comparison; whether it's inability or laziness.  So they cut
down others and discourage others from making them look bad, stupid,
lazy, or ignorant.

It's a way of competing when you're outclassed.

Well, they make themselves look bad by telling others they cannot
succeed. So since they are in a lose-lose situation of partly their
own creation, they should stop.

Normal means average.
Mensa qualified .NE. member of Mensa
Admitting to Mensa membership .NE. Mensa membership.

There are a lot of situations where it is not to your advantage to
admit that you might be more intelligent than average, much less two
and a bit SDs over average.
Getting through primary and secondary school without getting belted
around the head and ears every goddamn day is one of them.

Now, would you care to reset that chip on your shoulder?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To some extent, complacency is built into the system. American schools
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;spend more than $8 billion a year educating the mentally retarded.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not just the mentally retarded.  IIRC, the figure here is 65% or 75%
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the school budget is for those who have been classified as special
&gt; &gt;&gt; needs.  Note that this does not include those who have a high IQ.
&gt; &gt;&gt; A lot of that spending is transportation and babysitting.

&gt; &gt;What goes around comes around Barb.

&gt; Perhaps.

&gt; &gt; For instance, at the top end of the
&gt; &gt;UK educational tree, the state spends *very* large sums on university
&gt; &gt;and beyond for the most able students. While bitching all the time
&gt; &gt;about punitive socialist taxation, I was happily signing up high energy
&gt; &gt;physicists and mathematicians and chemists (as long as they knew VMS)
&gt; &gt;at *bargain* prices. There was no way a small business could pay for
&gt; &gt;the education that had been pumped into those guys. I got 'em cheap
&gt; &gt;because they were too smart, and maybe their arms were too long from
&gt; &gt;lugging lead blocks through the tunnels at CERN.

&gt; &gt;You will be pleased to learn that a few of them have crossed the pond
&gt; &gt;and are now making the US richer. What goes around, comes around.

&gt; My library is now dumping all books written for boys.  I find this
&gt; very worrisome since those boys grow up to be our scientists and
&gt; engineers.

&gt; &gt;It *might* have been a good thing to stretch the brightest at secondary
&gt; &gt;and primary school, but I doubt it would be as cost-effective as
&gt; &gt;ensuring the less able are self-sufficient all through life. Schools
&gt; &gt;are designed to churn out cannon fodder and supine consumers and
&gt; &gt;voters. What would happen to that finely tuned machine if you overtly
&gt; &gt;polluted it with bright students?

&gt; What one teacher did in my class was pair me up with a kid who
&gt; had tons of trouble learning.  In one swell foop, she eliminated
&gt; the two extremes in the class.  The goal was to get this kid
&gt; to be able to pass his math; he did because I figured out how
&gt; he thought and then taught him based on his thinking patterns.
&gt; The parents objected when they learned I was teaching him.  I
&gt; never knew what happened to him because they took all their
&gt; kids out of the school the next year.

&gt; &gt;What really happens everywhere is that somehow the best students are
&gt; &gt;surreptitiously looked after by one or two great teachers quietly
&gt; &gt;bucking the system. I bet you can remember who your's were.

&gt; &gt;;-)

&gt; There may have been a couple in high school.  The elementary teachers
&gt; had problems with me.  In addition, it was a sin for a female to be
&gt; smart like I was; my mother was told to keep me away from material

I ran into that to in the 1950s. One of the public libraries
Carnegie had built for small towns. I don't remember a sign, but the
librarian did call my mother and ask if I had permission to read
more than 2 books per week. I looked at the shelves just outside the
kid's book room. Had space ships on the spine to show it was science
fiction. Some of the names may be familiar: Asimov, Heinlein, and
Andre Norton. Oh yeah, and things like 'Tom Swift and his Space
Station'. I had to get permission to read that 'awful stuff'.

My mother, tiring of the phone calls, told them I could read
anything unless it was about war or a medical book.

I read almost 200 books that summer.

Oddly, the situation in my public library was the opposite of what you
describe: older kids were given borrowing privileges for adult non-fiction,
but not for adult fiction.  There was a separate &quot;Young Adult&quot; (i.e.
pre-teen/early teen) fiction section for them.
