Why Is the Doctrine of the Trinity a Vital Belief for Christians to
Understand?
By Â Dr. John Ankerberg, Dr. John Weldon

When we speak of the Trinity, we must do so with caution and modesty, for,
as St. Augustine saith, &quot;Nowhere else are more dangerous errors made, or is
research more difficult, or discovery more fruitful.'&quot; (St. Thomas Aquinas,
Summa Theologica, ia q. xxi, 1272)

The biblical doctrine of the Trinity is vital to understand because it
concerns who God is, i.e., a proper realization of the nature of God as
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. To understand the Trinity is to understand God
as He has revealed Himself to be.

Why is this important? Because if we are to worship God &quot;in spirit and
truth&quot; (John 4:24), as Jesus commanded, we must know and worship the one
true God as He really is. To fail to do this is to fail to know and worship
God-and this cannot bring Him glory. Thus, those who reject the Trinity
invariably deny the nature of God.

Consider several examples of professedly Christian religions that forcefully
reject what the Bible teaches. By denying the biblical teaching on the
Trinity, Jehovah's Witnesses make Jesus merely a creation of Jehovah and the
Holy Spirit Jehovah's impersonal force. Thus, Jesus &quot;was actually a creature
of God&quot; who earned his own salvation and immortality1 and the Holy Spirit
&quot;is not a person at all but is God's invisible active force by means of
which God carries out his holy will and work.&quot;2

In rejecting the Trinity, Jehovah's Witnesses founder C. T. Russell
blasphemously stated that the God of Christianity &quot;is plainly not Jehovah
but the ancient deity, hoary with the iniquity of the ages-Baal, the Devil
Himself.&quot;3 Second Watchtower President Judge Rutherford declared in a
similar fashion, &quot;The doctrine of the Trinity is a false doctrine and is
promulgated by Satan for the purpose of defaming Jehovah's name&quot;-and for
keeping others from &quot;learning the truth of Jehovah and his Son, Jesus
Christ.&quot; Indeed, &quot;God-fearing persons.find it a bit difficult to love and
worship a complicated, freakish-looking three-headed God.&quot;4 Surely,
teachings that caricature God in this manner do not bring to Him honor and
glory.

In a similar fashion, Mormons maintain that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
are not immortal, but were individual spirit-men created by the sexual union
of their parent deities, each of whom then later evolved into Godhood.5
Mormonism thus rejects the ontological unity of the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit in teaching tritheism, or a belief in three separate Gods.

Indeed, Mormons are ultimately polytheists who reject the concept of one
true God. As a standard text on Mormon doctrine declares:

As pertaining to this universe, there are three Gods: the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost.. To us, speaking in the proper finite sense, these three are the
only Gods we worship. But in addition there is an infinite number of holy
personages, drawn from worlds without number, who have passed on to
exaltation [i.e., Godhood] and are thus gods.6

Mary Baker Eddy was the founder of Christian Science, another group that
claims to be truly Christian. Yet in her Science and Health with Key to the
Scriptures, the Bible of Christian Science, she writes:

The theory of three persons in one God (that is, a personal Trinity or
Tri-unity) suggests polytheism, rather than the one ever-present I Am.. The
name Elohim is in the plural, but this plurality of Spirit does not imply
more than one God, nor does it imply three persons in one.7

Victor Paul Wierwille, founder of The Way International, reveals additional
common consequences of rejection of the Trinity-a denial not only of the
Person of Jesus Christ but also of His atoning Work on the cross. Wierwille
argues as follows:

Through the years, the more and more I carefully researched God's Word for
knowledge, the less and less I found to substantiate a trinity. Even though
I had always accepted the idea of a three-in-one-God, I continually found
evidence in the Word of God which undermined a Christian trinity.. [Further]
If Jesus Christ is God.we have not yet been redeemed.. Our very
redemption.is dependent on Jesus Christ's being a man and not God.. So how
then did a trinitarian doctrine come about? It gradually evolved and gained
momentum in late 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries as pagans, who had converted to
Christianity, brought to Christianity some of their pagan beliefs and
practices. Trinitarianism then was confirmed at Nicaea in 325 by Church
bishops out of political expediency.8

In essence, the reason the Trinity is important to understand according to
its biblical and theological formulation is that failure to do so can lead
to heretical views about who God is. This in turn can lead to rejection of
the one true God and worship of a false God. But if the Bible is clear on
anything, it is clear that faith in and worship of a false God is powerless
to save people from their sins. Jesus Himself emphasized the importance of
having an accurate knowledge of God when he said, &quot;And this is eternal life,
that they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast
sent&quot; (John 17:3).

God warned Israel through the prophet Hosea, &quot;My people are destroyed from
lack of knowledge&quot; and &quot;You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior
except me&quot; (Hosea 4:6; 13:4). As their history so amply demonstrates, the
Israelites were spiritually ruined because they had rejected true knowledge
of God and had turned to false gods and idols. Unfortunately, in a similar
manner, those who deliberately reject the Trinity, knowing in advance what
the Bible teaches about it, only reveal their own lack of salvation (1
Corinthians 2:14). In other words, no one can consistently dishonor what the
Holy Spirit has revealed in Scripture as to the true nature of God and
logically claim to be a Christian.

Of course, prior knowledge of the Trinity, especially in its theological
formulation, is not necessary for a person to be saved. But once saved, it
is vital for Christians to know the true nature of the God who has so
graciously pardoned them. This explains why the Church has always recognized
the importance of a proper understanding of God and maintained that those
who reject the scriptural view of God, as long as they do so, cannot be
saved.

For example, in discussing the placing of a divine curse or anathema on
those who reject God, the Athanasian Creed begins and ends with the solemn
declaration that the catholic [i.e., universal] faith in the Trinity and the
Incarnation is the indispensable condition of salvation, and that those who
reject it will be lost forever. This anathema, in its natural historical
sense, is not merely a solemn warning against the great danger of heresy,
nor, on the other hand, does it demand, as a condition of salvation, a full
knowledge, and assent to, the logical statement of the doctrines set forth,
(this would condemn the great mass even of Christian believers); but it does
mean to exclude from heaven all who reject the divine truth therein taught.
It requires everyone who would be saved to believe in the only true and
living God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one in essence, three in persons,
and in one Jesus Christ, very God and very man in one person.9

As Vladimir Lossky once put boldly in The Mystical Theology of the Eastern
Church (1957, p. 66), &quot;Between the Trinity and Hell there lies no other
choice.&quot;
Thus, an examination of religions claiming to be Christian, who yet deny the
Trinity, invariably reveals that other key Christian doctrines, such as
salvation by grace through faith alone, are also rejected. In other words,
if one does not start with a proper respect for Scripture and its
understanding of God, it is unlikely one will get much else correct
biblically. This is exactly what we find in the world of the cults.

However, before we discuss what the Bible does teach about the Trinity, we
must also remember that this doctrine is something finite minds can never
fully comprehend. The Trinity may be logically defined, but this is partly
the problem because &quot;the infinite truth of the Godhead lies far beyond the
boundaries of logic, which deals only with finite truths and categories.&quot;10
In other words, as an infinite being, God can never be fully understood by
any finite person. If we can't understand something as basic as particle
physics, who would argue we should be able to rationally comprehend all that
the infinite God is?

As Dorothy L. Sayers once stated in Current Religious Thought (1957),
Why do you complain that the proposition God is three in one is obscure and
mystical and yet acquiesce meekly in the physicist's fundamental formula,
'two P minus PQ equals IH over two Pi where I equals the square root of
minus one' when you know quite well that the square root of minus one is
paradoxical and Pi is incalculable?

Consider that an ant could never comprehend all that a human being is, even
if it tried. Yet, if a human being could somehow become an ant, it might be
able to explain enough about what a human is so that the ant could gain
something of an understanding as to what a human is.

When we consider that God is, quite literally, infinitely removed from men,
the parallel suffers immeasurably. All we can truly understand about God is
what He has revealed to us in the Bible. And while this does give us a great
deal of accurate information, it obviously does not give us exhaustive
information that plumbs the depths of His infinity. Indeed, one of the
glories of eternal salvation (John 5:24; 6:47) will be that finite creatures
will forever learn wondrous things about the exhaustless glories and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why Is the Doctrine of the Trinity a Vital Belief for Christians to
&gt; Understand?
">

It is not.

What IS vital, is that Christians understand that &quot;trinity doctrine&quot; is
NOT IN the Bible!

--------
Jesus said: &quot;Unless you believe I am He you shall die in your sins.&quot;
John 8:24
Who is the &quot;He&quot; to whom He is referring?

Trinitarians would pervert these words of Jesus, and make His words
mean, &quot;unless you believe the doctrine of the trinity... you will die in
your sins.&quot;

The Trinitarians say:
&quot;This is unfortunate because if you do not know who
Jesus is (who He REALLY is), then your faith is not
on the true foundation. This is not a light matter.
When you change who Jesus is, you by necessity pervert
the Gospel message.&quot;

I agree... When you change who Jesus IS, then you have perverted the Gospel.

Now the Question is, &quot;Who is Jesus (really), and who is it that perverts
the Gospel message?&quot;

FIRST:

What the Bible Teaches, Who is Jesus?

A) What did the Law and Prophets say about Jesus?

Jesus is descendant of Eve, through Abraham, Gen. 3:15, 12:3, 18:18.

Born in the Line of David, Psalms 89:3-4,

Born of a virgin, Isa. 7:14,9:6-7,

Born in Bethlehem Micah 5:2,

A forerunner would precede Him. Mal. 3:1.

He would preach in Galilee. Isa. 9:1-2.

He would be a Prophet, a preacher of deliverance. Deu. 18:15, Isa. 61:1-3.

He would be meek, and rejected. Isa. 42:2, 53:3.

And, He would be ordained a Priest after the order [type or kind] of
Melchizedek. Psalms 110:4.

B) Who does Jesus say He Is?

In Matthew and John there are about 59 references to &quot;My Father.&quot;

He referred to God as &quot;My God&quot;:
&quot;And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi,
Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me? [KJV] Mark 15:34

&quot;Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my
Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my
Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. [KJV] John 20:17

He told John's messengers that He was the fulfillment of the prophecies,
&quot;he who is to come.&quot; John 7:19-23,

CONFESSIONS OF PETER AND MARTHA
&quot;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; Mat 16:16

&quot;Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever
liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?

&quot;She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the
Son of God, which should come into the world.&quot; John 11:25-27

Jesus did not correct Peter or Martha. Did Jesus teach the doctrine of
the trinity? No, there is no scripture of Jesus referring to himself as
a persona of a multiple personality being, or to His Father God as a
triune being.

C) Who did the Apostles say Jesus is?

John 1:1-3 [Greek]
3788 Â 2258 Â 1722 Â  Â  746 Â  Â  Â  Â 4314 Â  Â 3588 Â  2316
He Â  Â was Â  in Â  Â beginning Â  Â  with Â  Â *THE* Â God
John distinguished between God the Son and God the Father.
http://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/Greek_Index.htm

[KJV] John 20:28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.

&quot;Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to
God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all
authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies
under his feet.&quot; 1 Cor 15:24-25

&quot;For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man
Christ Jesus&quot; [KJV] I Timothy 2:5

&quot;And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of
sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.&quot; [KJV]
Hebrews 12:24

1 Cor 11:3 &quot;the head of Christ is God.&quot;

Did the Apostles teach that Jesus is a member of a 'triune being'? No,
there is no reference to Jesus as a persona of a multiple personality
being, or to His Father, or God, as a triune being.

GIVEN ALL AUTHORITY, ALL POWER
&quot;The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make
thine enemies thy footstool. The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength
out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.&quot; Ps 110:1-2 Mat
28:18, 1 Cor 15:24-28.

Since Jesus was given ALL Power and ALL Authority then He had the power
to heal and walk on water, AND to forgive sin.

Did Abraham, Moses, Isaiah or any Old Testament Prophet describe Jesus
as a &quot;persona of a triune being&quot;? No. Nowhere in the Old Testament is
God defined or described as a triune being.

In fact, Deu 6:4 defines the Lord, God. as One, not triune.

SECOND:

What Trinity Doctrine teaches
1) Who do the Trinitarians say Jesus is?
That Jesus is person of a multiple personality being.
That the Holy Spirit is a person of a multiple personality being.
That God the Father is a multiple personality being.

2) When did the doctrine of the trinity come into the Church? After
Ad325-388, and it has continued to be edited and modified, and there are
at least two major versions of it.

3) Who is it that &quot;changes who Jesus is&quot;?
The Trinitarians.

Pagan theology
A.D. 150 Justin Martyr, introduces Greek Philosophy.
A.D. 170 The word &quot;Trias&quot;, appears first in Christian literature.
A.D. 200 &quot;Trinitas&quot; is first introduced by Tertullian.
A.D. 260 Sabellius: &quot;Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three names for the
same God&quot;.
A.D. 325 &quot;Nicene Creed&quot; affirms Christ to be &quot;Very God of Very God&quot;.
A.D. 381 Council of Constantinople invents &quot;Three persons in One God&quot;.
A.D. 388 Emperor Theodosius threatens punishment to all who won't
worship the Trinity.

CONCLUSION
Who is it that &quot;changes who Jesus is&quot;?
Since the Old testament Law and prophets do not teach that Israel knew
or worshiped a triune god,
And,

Since Jesus did not state or reveal that He was a person of a triune god,

And,
Since the Apostles did not teach the First Century Church the doctrine
of a triune god,

And,
Since the Apostles did not include the doctrine of a triune god in the
New Testament,

Therefore,
it is those who teach the doctrine of a pagan three headed god who
change who they believe Jesus is.

WHAT DO WE NEED TO BELIEVE?
As Jesus said, &quot;unless you believe I am He,&quot; (John 8:24) &quot;you will die
in your sin.&quot;

The &quot;He&quot; Jesus claimed to be is the Son of God as foretold in prophecy.
He claimed to be the Son of God as depicted in the Law of Moses,
writings of David and Solomon, and in the Law and Prophets.

If we read the Law, books of wisdom and the prophets, and believe that
Jesus of Nazareth is that Son of God, then we do, in fact, believe that
He is &quot;He.&quot;

As Jesus told Martha, John 11:25-27) &quot;I am the resurrection, and the
life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.&quot;

Martha answered, &quot; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God,
which should come into the world.&quot; Martha did not exhibit any knowledge
of a triune being.

(In fact, triune gods were and are an abomination to the Jews.)

If we believe in this same Jesus, as confessed by Martha, as described
by the Old Testament, as described by the Apostles, then we have eternal
life.

Actually it is and I've been providing proof from the Bible as has numerous
other individuals using sola scriptura. And it's quite revealing, Glenn,
that you continue to &quot;snip&quot; those points and proofs from the Bible. It's
because you cannot refute Biblical truth yet choose to hold onto your
heresies even though your heresies (the same ones that have been held to by
heretics for centuries) have been thoroughly and completely refuted time and
time again (by Godly individuals for centuries). I will keep you in my
prayers.

P.S. -- For example, neither you nor any other heretic who deny the Biblical
teaching of the Trinity have been able to refute the following article by
Dr. Ankerberg and Dr. Weldon. Instead you and other heretics who deny the
Biblical teaching of the Trinity ignore it hoping it will go away. It will
not nor will the Biblical teaching of the Trinity.

What Does the Bible Reveal About the Trinity?
by Dr. John Ankerberg, Dr. John Weldon

PART 1

When we speak of the Trinity, we must do so with caution and modesty, for,
as St. Augustine saith, Â &quot;Nowhere else are more dangerous errors made, or is
research more difficult, or discovery more fruitful.&quot; -St. Thomas Aquinas,
Summa Theologies, ia q. xxi, 1272

All we ask you to understand is that Trinitarian theology was not derived
from pagan sources. It was derived from biblical passages where honest,
godly men said, &quot;Hey, 2 Peter says there is a Person called the Father, and
he's God. And Acts 5 says there is a Person called the Spirit, and he's God.
And John 1 says there's a Person called the Word and he's God.&quot; You've got
Three Persons, and Deuteronomy 6 says, &quot;There is only one God.&quot; Logical
conclusion: the Three Persons, somehow, are the One God. That's how
Trinitarian theology started. Not with the pagans. -Dr. Walter Martin,
responding to Dr. Robert Sabin, President of the Apostolic Bible Institute
of St. Paul, Minnesota, on &quot;The John Ankerberg Show&quot;

The biblical doctrine of the Trinity is vital to understand because it
concerns who God is, that is, a proper realization of the nature of God as
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. To understand the Trinity is to understand God
as He has revealed Himself to be.

Why is this important? Because if we are to worship God &quot;in spirit and in

PART 2

What is the Trinity?

God has revealed that He is three persons or centers of consciousness within
one Godhead. Because the concept cannot be fully comprehended does not mean
the doctrine cannot be accurately described or defined; however, precision
here requires some technicality. One good definition of the Trinity is
provided by noted church historian Philip Schaff:

God is one in three persons or hypostases [that is, distinct persons of the
same nature], each person expressing the whole fullness of the

It's &quot;sola scriptura&quot; which is latin for &quot;scripture only&quot; and the Trinity is
taught via sola scriptura. I've proven it that way as has numerous other
Christians. Dr. Ankerberg and Dr. Weldon have done it as well yet you are
unable to handle their articles on the subject so you would rather run away
and deny their excellent article which proves quite well the Biblical
doctrine of the Trinity.

A false accusation on your part. It's no wonder that you continually resort
to dishonesty to try to bolster your heresies since your heresies and all
heresies are satanic in origin. You are unable to be intellectually honest
about this. You are unable to be Biblically honest about this. So you
willingly embrace your heresies, been warned and corrected by Christians
about your heresies and dishonesty yet continue to espouse them. Therefore
by Biblical standards you are indeed a divisive person (e.g. - heretic) whom
we as Christians are to have nothing to do with. Goodbye, Glenn. I pray that
you will repent of your wicked false doctrines, your dishonest tactics and
one day come to accept Christ, the Biblical Jesus (God manifest in flesh,
the second person of the Trinity, the Alpha &amp; Omega, the divine Jesus)
instead of the false Jesus you espouse.

If you had bothered to read the articles, they contain the sola scriptura
evidence from the Bible which teaches the Trinity. But you run away from it
in cowardice. Typical. I pity you, my friend. You will suffer the

you.

Here's the article again...maybe you'll actually take the time to read it.

What Does the Bible Reveal About the Trinity?
by Dr. John Ankerberg, Dr. John Weldon

PART 1

When we speak of the Trinity, we must do so with caution and modesty, for,
as St. Augustine saith, Â &quot;Nowhere else are more dangerous errors made, or is
research more difficult, or discovery more fruitful.&quot; -St. Thomas Aquinas,
Summa Theologies, ia q. xxi, 1272

All we ask you to understand is that Trinitarian theology was not derived
from pagan sources. It was derived from biblical passages where honest,
godly men said, &quot;Hey, 2 Peter says there is a Person called the Father, and
he's God. And Acts 5 says there is a Person called the Spirit, and he's God.
And John 1 says there's a Person called the Word and he's God.&quot; You've got
Three Persons, and Deuteronomy 6 says, &quot;There is only one God.&quot; Logical
conclusion: the Three Persons, somehow, are the One God. That's how
Trinitarian theology started. Not with the pagans. -Dr. Walter Martin,
responding to Dr. Robert Sabin, President of the Apostolic Bible Institute
of St. Paul, Minnesota, on &quot;The John Ankerberg Show&quot;

The biblical doctrine of the Trinity is vital to understand because it
concerns who God is, that is, a proper realization of the nature of God as
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. To understand the Trinity is to understand God
as He has revealed Himself to be.

Why is this important? Because if we are to worship God &quot;in spirit and in
truth&quot; (John 4:24), as Jesus commanded, we must know and worship the one
true God as He really is. To fail to do this is to fail to know and worship
God-and this cannot bring Him glory. Thus, those who reject the Trinity by
definition deny the true nature of God.

Consider several examples of professedly Christian religions that forcefully
reject what the Bible teaches. By denying the biblical teaching on the
Trinity, Jehovah's Witnesses make Jesus merely a creation of Jehovah and the
Holy Spirit merely Jehovah's impersonal force. Thus, Jesus &quot;was actually a
creature of God&quot; who earned his own salvation and immortality 1 and the Holy
Spirit &quot;is not a person at all but is God's invisible active force by means
of which God carries out his holy will and work.&quot;2

In rejecting the Trinity, Jehovah's Witnesses founder C. T. Russell
blasphemously stated that the God of Christianity &quot;is plainly not Jehovah
but the ancient deity, hoary with the iniquity of the ages-Baal, the Devil
Himself.&quot;3 Second Watchtower president Judge Rutherford declared in a
similar fashion, &quot;The doctrine of the Trinity is a false doctrine and is
promulgated by Satan for the purpose of defaming Jehovah's name&quot; and for
keeping others from &quot;learning the truth of Jehovah and his Son, Jesus
Christ.&quot; Indeed, &quot;God-fearing persons find it a bit difficult to love and
worship a complicated, freakish-looking three-headed God.&quot;4 Surely teachings
that caricature God in this manner do not bring to Him honor and glory.

In a similar fashion, Mormons maintain that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
are not immortal, but were individual spirit-men created by the sexual union
of their parent deities, each of whom then later evolved into Godhood.5
Mormonism thus rejects the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by
teaching tritheism, or a belief in three separate Gods.

Indeed, Mormons are ultimately polytheists who reject the concept of one
true God. As a standard text of Mormon doctrine declares:

As pertaining to this universe, there are three Gods: the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost. To us, speaking in the proper finite sense, these three are the
only Gods we worship. But in addition there is an infinite number of holy
personages, drawn from worlds without number, who have passed on to
exaltation [that is, Godhood] and are thus gods.6

Mary Baker Eddy was the founder of Christian Science, another group that
claims to be truly Christian. Yet in her Science and Health with Key to the
Scriptures, the bible of Christian Science, she writes:

The theory of three persons in one God (that is, a personal Trinity or
Tri-unity) suggests polytheism, rather than the one ever-present I Am. The
name Elohim is in the plural, but this plurality of Spirit does not imply
more than one God, nor does it imply three persons in one.7

Victor Paul Wierwille, founder of The Way International, reveals additional
common consequences of rejection of the Trinity: a denial not only of the
person of Jesus Christ but also of His atoning Work on the cross. Wierwille
argues as follows:

Through the years, the more and more I carefully researched God's Word for
knowledge, the less and less I found to substantiate a trinity. Even though
I had always accepted the idea of a three-in-one-God, I continually found
evidence in the Word of God which undermined a Christian trinity. [Further]
If Jesus Christ is God we have not yet been redeemed. Our very redemption is
dependent on Jesus Christ's being a man and not God. So how then did a
trinitarian doctrine come about? It gradually evolved and gained momentum in
late 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries as pagans, who had converted to
Christianity, brought to Christianity some of their pagan beliefs and
practices. Trinitarianism then was confirmed at Nicaea in 325 by Church
bishops out of political expediency.8

In essence, the reason the Trinity is important to understand according to
its biblical and theological formulation is that failure to do so can lead
to heretical views about who God is. This in turn can lead to rejection of
the one true God and worship of a false god. But if the Bible is clear on
anything, it is clear that faith in and worship of a false god is powerless
to save people from their sins. Jesus Himself emphasized the importance of
having an accurate knowledge of God when He said, &quot;And this is eternal life,
that they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast
sent&quot; (John 17:3).

God warned Israel through the prophet Hosea, &quot;My people are destroyed from
lack of knowledge&quot; and &quot;You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior
except me&quot; (Hosea 4:6; 13:4). As their history so amply demonstrates, the
Israelites were spiritually ruined because they had rejected the true
knowledge of God and had turned to false gods and idols. Unfortunately, in a
similar manner, those who deliberately reject the Trinity, knowing in
advance what the Bible teaches about it, only reveal their own lack of
salvation (1 Cor. 2:14). In other words, no one can consistently dishonor
what the Holy Spirit has revealed in Scripture as to the true nature of God
and logically claim to be a Christian.

The answers to the following questions give evidence that when taken in
totality, the Bible teaches the doctrine of the Trinity:

1. Who does the Bible say is God?
The Father (Eph. 4:6)? Â Yes!
The Son (Titus 2:13; John 1:1,14; 20:28)? Â Yes!
The Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3-4)? Â Yes!
Or the one and only true God (Deut. 4:35)? Â Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit are all Jehovah God.

2. Who raised Jesus from the dead?
The Father (Romans 6:4)? Â Yes!
The Son (John 2:19-21; 10:17,18)? Â Yes!
The Holy Spirit (Romans 8:11)? Â Yes!
Or God (Acts 3:26, 13:30, 17:30,31; 1 Thess. 1:9,10; Heb. 13:20)? Â Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God were responsible for raising Jesus from the
dead.

3. Who saves man?
a. Who REGENERATES man?
The Father (1 Peter 1:3)? Â Yes!
The Son (John 5:21, 4:14)? Â Yes!
The Holy Spirit (John 3:6; Titus 3:5)? Â Yes!
Or God (1 John 3:9)? Â Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God are responsible for regenerating man.

b. Who JUSTIFIES man?
The Father (Jer. 23:6, cf. 2 Cor. 5:19)? Â Yes!
The Son (Romans 5:9, 10:4; 2 Cor. 5:19-21)? Â Yes!
The Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:11; Gal. 5:5)? Â Yes!
Or God (Romans 4:6, 9:33)? Â Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God are responsible for justifying man.

c. Who SANCTIFIES man?
The Father (Jude 1)? Â Yes!
The Son (Titus 2:14)? Â Yes!
The Holy Spirit (1 Peter 1:2)? Â Yes!
Or God (Exodus 31:13)? Â Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God are responsible for regenerating man.

d. Who propitiated God's just anger against man for his sins?
The Father (1 John 4:14; John 3:16, 17:5, 18:11)? Â Yes!
The Son (Matthew 26:28; John 1:29; 1 John 2:2)? Â Yes!
The Holy Spirit (Heb. 9:14)? Â Yes!
Or God (2 Cor. 5:1; Acts 20:28)? Â Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God had propitiated God's just anger against man for
his sins?

BIBLICAL RESULT: The Bible clearly teaches the doctrine of the Trinity.

Though some exalt human reason against the doctrine of the Trinity, saying
that it is &quot;unreasonable,&quot; people who submit their minds to God's Word must
conclude that it is unreasonable NOT to believe in it.

Dishonest claim! The Bible does NOT say &quot;the Father, the Son and the

That God the Father and His Spirit, and the Son of God work together
does not make them a triune being.

Man of old, the savage,

the eruption of the volcano

Man believed the lightning bolt,
for the crops - a blessing of rain,
the curse of flood lending starvation,
was spewed from heavenly gates.

Man believed he could calm divine wrath,
through sacrifice of a virgin pure,
though blood appeased him not,
how the quake continues to tremble the earth.

Man believed the sting of a bee,
the fangs of the serpent, the teeth of a bear
were all signs of divine things,
deities by the dozens, some invented in pairs.

Silly superstitions thrive to this day,

&gt; Why Is the Doctrine of the Trinity a Vital Belief for Christians to
&gt; Understand?
&gt; By Â Dr. John Ankerberg, Dr. John Weldon

&gt; When we speak of the Trinity, we must do so with caution and modesty, for,
&gt; as St. Augustine saith, &quot;Nowhere else are more dangerous errors made, or is
&gt; research more difficult, or discovery more fruitful.'&quot; (St. Thomas Aquinas,
&gt; Summa Theologica, ia q. xxi, 1272)

&gt; The biblical doctrine of the Trinity is vital to understand because it
&gt; concerns who God is, i.e., a proper realization of the nature of God as
&gt; Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. To understand the Trinity is to understand God
&gt; as He has revealed Himself to be.

&gt; Why is this important? Because if we are to worship God &quot;in spirit and
&gt; truth&quot; (John 4:24), as Jesus commanded, we must know and worship the one
&gt; true God as He really is. To fail to do this is to fail to know and worship
&gt; God-and this cannot bring Him glory. Thus, those who reject the Trinity
&gt; invariably deny the nature of God.

&gt; Consider several examples of professedly Christian religions that forcefully
&gt; reject what the Bible teaches. By denying the biblical teaching on the
&gt; Trinity, Jehovah's Witnesses make Jesus merely a creation of Jehovah and the
&gt; Holy Spirit Jehovah's impersonal force. Thus, Jesus &quot;was actually a creature
&gt; of God&quot; who earned his own salvation and immortality1 and the Holy Spirit
&gt; &quot;is not a person at all but is God's invisible active force by means of
&gt; which God carries out his holy will and work.&quot;2

&gt; In rejecting the Trinity, Jehovah's Witnesses founder C. T. Russell
&gt; blasphemously stated that the God of Christianity &quot;is plainly not Jehovah
&gt; but the ancient deity, hoary with the iniquity of the ages-Baal, the Devil
&gt; Himself.&quot;3 Second Watchtower President Judge Rutherford declared in a
&gt; similar fashion, &quot;The doctrine of the Trinity is a false doctrine and is
&gt; promulgated by Satan for the purpose of defaming Jehovah's name&quot;-and for
&gt; keeping others from &quot;learning the truth of Jehovah and his Son, Jesus
&gt; Christ.&quot; Indeed, &quot;God-fearing persons.find it a bit difficult to love and
&gt; worship a complicated, freakish-looking three-headed God.&quot;4 Surely,
&gt; teachings that caricature God in this manner do not bring to Him honor and
&gt; glory.

&gt; In a similar fashion, Mormons maintain that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
&gt; are not immortal, but were individual spirit-men created by the sexual union
&gt; of their parent deities, each of whom then later evolved into Godhood.5
&gt; Mormonism thus rejects the ontological unity of the Father, Son and Holy
&gt; Spirit in teaching tritheism, or a belief in three separate Gods.

&gt; Indeed, Mormons are ultimately polytheists who reject the concept of one
&gt; true God. As a standard text on Mormon doctrine declares:

&gt; As pertaining to this universe, there are three Gods: the Father, Son, and
&gt; Holy Ghost.. To us, speaking in the proper finite sense, these three are the
&gt; only Gods we worship. But in addition there is an infinite number of holy
&gt; personages, drawn from worlds without number, who have passed on to
&gt; exaltation [i.e., Godhood] and are thus gods.6

&gt; Mary Baker Eddy was the founder of Christian Science, another group that
&gt; claims to be truly Christian. Yet in her Science and Health with Key to the
&gt; Scriptures, the Bible of Christian Science, she writes:

&gt; The theory of three persons in one God (that is, a personal Trinity or
&gt; Tri-unity) suggests polytheism, rather than the one ever-present I Am.. The
&gt; name Elohim is in the plural, but this plurality of Spirit does not imply
&gt; more than one God, nor does it imply three persons in one.7

&gt; Victor Paul Wierwille, founder of The Way International, reveals additional
&gt; common consequences of rejection of the Trinity-a denial not only of the
&gt; Person of Jesus Christ but also of His atoning Work on the cross. Wierwille
&gt; argues as follows:

&gt; Through the years, the more and more I carefully researched God's Word for
&gt; knowledge, the less and less I found to substantiate a trinity. Even though
&gt; I had always accepted the idea of a three-in-one-God, I continually found
&gt; evidence in the Word of God which undermined a Christian trinity.. [Further]
&gt; If Jesus Christ is God.we have not yet been redeemed.. Our very
&gt; redemption.is dependent on Jesus Christ's being a man and not God.. So how
&gt; then did a trinitarian doctrine come about? It gradually evolved and gained
&gt; momentum in late 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries as pagans, who had converted to
&gt; Christianity, brought to Christianity some of their pagan beliefs and
&gt; practices. Trinitarianism then was confirmed at Nicaea in 325 by Church
&gt; bishops out of political expediency.8

&gt; In essence, the reason the Trinity is important to understand according to
&gt; its biblical and theological formulation is that failure to do so can lead
&gt; to heretical views about who God is. This in turn can lead to rejection of
&gt; the one true God and worship of a false God. But if the Bible is clear on
&gt; anything, it is clear that faith in and worship of a false God is powerless
&gt; to save people from their sins. Jesus Himself emphasized the importance of
&gt; having an accurate knowledge of God when he said, &quot;And this is eternal life,
&gt; that they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast
&gt; sent&quot; (John 17:3).

&gt; God warned Israel through the prophet Hosea, &quot;My people are destroyed from
&gt; lack of knowledge&quot; and &quot;You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior
&gt; except me&quot; (Hosea 4:6; 13:4). As their history so amply demonstrates, the
&gt; Israelites were spiritually ruined because they had rejected true knowledge
&gt; of God and had turned to false gods and idols. Unfortunately, in a similar
&gt; manner, those who deliberately reject the Trinity, knowing in advance what
&gt; the Bible teaches about it, only reveal their own lack of salvation (1
&gt; Corinthians 2:14). In other words, no one can consistently dishonor what the
&gt; Holy Spirit has revealed in Scripture as to the true nature of God and
&gt; logically claim to be a Christian.

&gt; Of course, prior knowledge of the Trinity, especially in its theological
&gt; formulation, is not necessary for a person to be saved. But once saved, it
&gt; is vital for Christians to know the true nature of the God who has so
&gt; graciously pardoned them. This explains why the Church has always recognized
&gt; the importance of a proper understanding of God and maintained that those
&gt; who reject the scriptural view of God, as long as they do so, cannot be
&gt; saved.

&gt; For example, in discussing the placing of a divine curse or anathema on
&gt; those who reject God, the Athanasian Creed begins and ends with the solemn
&gt; declaration that the catholic [i.e., universal] faith in the Trinity and the
&gt; Incarnation is the indispensable condition of salvation, and that those who
&gt; reject it will be lost forever. This anathema, in its natural historical
&gt; sense, is not merely a solemn warning against the great danger of heresy,
&gt; nor, on the other hand, does it demand, as a condition of salvation, a full
&gt; knowledge, and assent to, the logical statement of the doctrines set forth,
&gt; (this would condemn the great mass even of Christian believers); but it does
&gt; mean to exclude from heaven all who reject the divine truth therein taught.
&gt; It requires everyone who would be saved to believe in the only true and
&gt; living God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one in essence, three in persons,
&gt; and in one Jesus Christ, very God and very man in one person.9

&gt; As Vladimir Lossky once put boldly in The Mystical Theology of the Eastern
&gt; Church (1957, p. 66), &quot;Between the Trinity and Hell there lies no other
&gt; choice.&quot;
&gt; Thus, an examination of religions claiming to be Christian, who yet deny the
&gt; Trinity, invariably reveals that other key Christian doctrines, such as
&gt; salvation by grace through faith alone, are also rejected. In other words,
&gt; if one does not start with a proper respect for Scripture and its
&gt; understanding of God, it is unlikely one will get much else correct
&gt; biblically. This is exactly what we find in the world of the cults.

&gt; However, before we discuss what the Bible does teach about the Trinity, we
&gt; must also remember that this doctrine is something finite minds can never
&gt; fully comprehend. The Trinity may be logically defined, but this is partly
&gt; the problem because &quot;the infinite truth of the Godhead lies far beyond the
&gt; boundaries of logic, which deals only with finite truths and categories.&quot;10
&gt; In other words, as an infinite being, God can never be fully understood by
&gt; any finite person. If we can't understand something as basic as particle
&gt; physics, who would argue we should be able to rationally comprehend all that

&lt;snip unwanted personal opinion of paid professional&gt;

Carl,

Actually, you have not been providing proof from the Bible that the
doctrine of the Trinity is in the Bible. Â What you have been showing
is false doctrines placed in the Bibles by the editors of the Bibles
through the use of fallacies of accent and false translations.

&quot;Biblical&quot; is not a Scriptural word because it refers to the versions
of the word of God generated by men. Â No Bible is the word of God; but
Bibles do contain some of the word of God in those passages where the
word of God is correctly translated. Â They are called &quot;versions&quot;
because they are versions; versions written by different men at
different times with different motivations.

All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness that the man of God may be throughly (on the inside)
perfected unto all good works (right behavior). Â That is because holy
men of God spake as they Â by (hupo, under) holy spirit (no article in
the Greek so not the Holy Spirit) were borne. Â No version can make
that claim because the editors of the versions were not holy men of
God. Â If they were holy men of God (prophets) then there would not be
no deliberate falsifications of the Scriptures designed to promote
false doctrines.

If the editors of the different versions of the word of God were holy
men of God; why did they disagree so much in the different versions
about what the word of God says? Â Then, too, why did the editors of
later versions deliberately put in their versions what they knew to be
false in earlier versions?

I appreciate the work that the editors did; but I do not elevate their
work to that equal to that of one of God's prophets and from their
fruit I can tell that the editors were not prophets.

What you can prove from the Bibles I can disprove from the Greek
texts. Â It is a very simple thing to do because the errors have been
known for centuries and have been exposed thousands if not millions of
times by different people. Â The only Godly way that you can prove the
trinity is to show from the Hebrew and Greek that the doctrine
literally exists in the word of God. Â The best educated scholars say
that the doctrine of the trinity cannot be proved and that it is a
matter of faith. Â It is very unlikely that you cannot prove what they
cannot prove. Â Then men you quote are just men; not prophets of God
and at best hit and miss in their teachings just like every other man.

Biblical truth is a misnomer unless you define it as those times when
the passages are translated correctly. Â To use the word set &quot;Biblical
truth&quot; as applicable to 100% of the Bible is misleading because it is
not literally true to fact. Â On my website is a file that lists 5,000
variant readings in the different editions of the Greek text. Â How
many thousand variant readings are there in the English versions? Â To
be &quot;Biblical&quot; means that something must &quot;of the Bible&quot;. Â Since the
Bible is not accurate, Biblical is no proof of accuracy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are suffering from delusion so deeply that you don't comprehend that
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sols Scriptura&quot; mean NO COMMENTARY, INTERPRETATION OR EXPLANATION!!

&gt;It's &quot;sola scriptura&quot; which is latin for &quot;scripture only&quot; and the Trinity is
&gt;taught via sola scriptura. I've proven it that way as has numerous other
&gt;Christians. Dr. Ankerberg and Dr. Weldon have done it as well yet you are
&gt;unable to handle their articles on the subject so you would rather run away
&gt;and deny their excellent article which proves quite well the Biblical
&gt;doctrine of the Trinity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, what you and numerous individuals have done is preach trinity
&gt;&gt;&gt; doctrine, trinity definition and trinity perversion of God's Word, NOT
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sola Scriptura.

&gt;A false accusation on your part. It's no wonder that you continually resort
&gt;to dishonesty to try to bolster your heresies since your heresies and all
&gt;heresies are satanic in origin. You are unable to be intellectually honest
&gt;about this. You are unable to be Biblically honest about this. So you
&gt;willingly embrace your heresies, been warned and corrected by Christians
&gt;about your heresies and dishonesty yet continue to espouse them. Therefore
&gt;by Biblical standards you are indeed a divisive person (e.g. - heretic) whom
&gt;we as Christians are to have nothing to do with. Goodbye, Glenn. I pray that
&gt;you will repent of your wicked false doctrines, your dishonest tactics and
&gt;one day come to accept Christ, the Biblical Jesus (God manifest in flesh,
&gt;the second person of the Trinity, the Alpha &amp; Omega, the divine Jesus)
&gt;instead of the false Jesus you espouse.

&gt;&gt; If you have ANY _Scripture ONLY_ that CONTAINS Trinity doctrine, please
&gt;&gt; post it between these lines:

&gt;If you had bothered to read the articles, they contain the sola scriptura
&gt;evidence from the Bible which teaches the Trinity. But you run away from it
&gt;in cowardice. Typical. I pity you, my friend. You will suffer the
&gt;consequences of your heresies if you do no repent. I will be praying for

&lt;snip marketing strategies of paid professionals&gt;

Carl,

I am trying not to be offensive, but you are making yourself look
unChristian by manifesting such blind worship of the words of two
hired guns of a money making operation represented as a church of God.
I don't know either man and I am using those words only to get you to
stop and think about how you are presenting yourself as the blind
being led by the blind.

Let's look at a recap of posting histories. Â You make claims and
support your claims with the claims of other men. Â Glenn makes claims
and supports his claims with a mix of Scripture and claims of other
men. Â Me, being the most perfect of the three (and modest, too) make
claims and support those claims from the Sriptures. Â Who should a real
Christian pay the most attention to? Â Me, of course, then Glenn, then
you. Â Well actually they should ignore you, some of what Glenn says
and worship what I write as holy and true.

No! Â They should read the holy scriptures which are not found in any
version of the Bible. Â Even Interlinears require cross checking of
variant texts. Â You, as a Christian, should search the scriptures; not
versions of the Bible or the writings of men to find out what is true.
It is not an easy task, but it is a rewarding task from which you can
derive much pleasure from.

It's not about who knows the most Carl; it's about who serves the most
the best. Â You can continue to serve watered down wine with admixtures
that poison a person; or you can serve the wine Jesus served at the
wedding. Â The choice is yours.

&gt; as He has revealed Himself to be.
">

Yet another of your posts in which the first sentences of the quoted
passages are such presumptious and arrogant drivel that one gives up on
the entire passage immediately

The Trinity is about human perception of God

Not about the nature of God

And we've moved on since the days of Byzantium when the trinity doctrine
was forged

We even have flush toilets now

And down those is where most of the outdated sermons you seem so fond of
should be sent.

Move on Carl

Its 2007 now!

The attempt to place the responsibility on me for convincing you of the
truth of the Biblical doctrine of the Trinity that you already know, will
not work. I do not bear the guilt in relation to your beliefs; you do. I
know how the spin works; attempting to place the blame on others by claiming
they have not thoroughly convinced you of the truth of their position, which
you reject before the teaching is even presented. You are not the first to
adopt that approach, it is not a unique creation to you and you will not be
the last to use it. You have been given instruction and correction on
virtually every false and aberrant doctrine that you teach, so you know very
well what is the biblical position.

The question is not that you do not know the truth or have never had the
truth explained to you, but that you deliberately reject the truth that you
already know. If I would present an unassailable argument to you on every
point of dissent, it would be irrelevant to you. You have set yourself in a
place of absolute authority by which you reject any argument presented to
you even before it is presented, because you adopt the position that any
person who does not agree 100% with you on every point of doctrine or
religious belief, whether it be the most important or the most minute, are
completely wrong and are unable to rightly divide scripture. You have
established yourself as the criterion of truth, your self-presumed authority
rejecting the beliefs of anyone who is not taught by you or believes as you
claim. As you know, that is why I stated that you are unteachable. So, by
your own definition, I am a false teacher, so you would reject any argument
that I might present, no matter how cogent.

The truth of the Scripture is lost on you, because you think you know the
truth and reject the truth as a result of your continuing rebellion. From
whatever you are trying to escape, by running from that which reveals and
cuts to the heart of the deep issues in your life, you will not be allowed
to leave it behind. Nothing more is to be said, because the truth of
Scripture does not need a defense against you, and you do not require any
more truth to be explained to you in order to be accountable for your error.
You, sir are the proven Biblical heretic in this case and have been exposed
as such by countless Christians over the years. Your words of hatred,
slander and vitriol show that you lack the fruit of the Spirit and your
false doctrines oppose God's Word. From this point on you are simply a
bitter and arrogant little heretic whom is not worthy of my time and I
reject you according to scriptural guidelines. I firmly expect that you will
attempt to goad me with your usual sadistic flair, slander me and
misrepresent my position. You've been documented as doing so over the past
years and you continue to do so today. This proves conclusively that you
have a darkened and hardened heart and your rejection of God's Word and
essential Christian doctrine in favor of heresy proves conclusively at this
time you are self-condemned. And as long as you continue to hold to your
fake god and false doctrine you will continue to be self-condemned. The only
hope for you is that you renounce your heresies, accept orthodox Biblical
doctrine and repent of your evil ways. You have to accept Jesus Christ as
your Lord and Savior but the jesus you teach is a fraudulent one. I pity you
and will continue to pray for you however from now on, I will have nothing
to do with you.

May God bless and cleanse you before it is too late,

There is no &quot;biblical doctrine of the Trinity.&quot;

Carl, you are joking aren't you? Â If you aren't joking; what are you
smoking, or snorting, or shooting up, or inhaling, or drinking? Â Your
joking right? Â Please tell me you are joking or on drugs so I won't
think you have gone completely bonkers.

I gladly submit myself to men or women who rightly divide the word of
truth. Â You do not rightly divide the word of truth, so I do not
submit myself to your false doctrines.

What kind of ego would come up with &quot;The attempt to place the
responsibility on me for convincing you of the truth of the Biblical
doctrine of the Trinity that you already know, will not work.&quot; ? Â I
never placed any responsibility on you. Â Responsibility is delegated
to those who have the maturity, intellect, and stamina to handle the
responsibility. Â Why would I place responsibility on you when you have
proven yourself to be immature, lacking in knowledge of the
Scriptures, and without the stamina necessary to complete the task I
might assign you.

I don't want to know the doctrine of the trinity. Â I know it better
than you. Â Why would I blame you for not teaching me what you aren't
able to teach in the first place. Â Your ego is getting much too big.

Your ego is getting out of control. Â You said &quot;I do not bear the guilt
in relation to your beliefs; you do.&quot; Â Why would I blame you for what
I believe whern I have said repeatedly that you lack the abilities
necessary to teach?

Let's see what else you are trying to spin. Â You said

&quot;I know how the spin works; attempting to place the blame on others
by claiming they have not thoroughly convinced you of the truth of
their position, which you reject before the teaching is even
presented.&quot;

I know you know how spin works that what you are trying to do now; but
it won't work. Â But your statement does reveal something to me. Â You
wanna be a spinner like the big time spinners you quote but know you
cannot spin as good as them and feel guilty because you are not a good
spinner and post their professional spin material rather than you own
inadequate spin material.

I have not said the hogwash you said I said. Â I blame you for being
arrogant, and hateful, and ignorant of the Scriptures and for
worshipping man gods. Â I sure don't blame you for what I believe
because you lack the skills to teach me something to believe and
because you have a track record of being dishonest just as you being
in this post.

I have been studing the trinity doctrine for thirty years and know it
better than you do which is why I am able to counter every one of your
wrongly divided presentations with truth from the word of God. Â Oh,
you know the mumbo jumbo that you are supposed to parrott; but you do
not understand what's behind the mumbo jumbo or the ramifications of
the mumbo jumbo. Â When you post the same old posts ovcer and over
again; why would I waste my time reading them. Â When you post one of
your Joseph Smith posts and I see it is wrong; the next article by
your Joseph Smith will be ignored because he lost credability the
first time.

I don't care what they say. Â I want to know what you think because it
is you that I am trying to communciate with. Â Every time I try to
communicate with you, you repond with Pope so and so says so and so.

You are blowing smoke. Â I know the word of God because I study the
word of God rather than what men say about the word of God. Â I have
been careful to set myself under those men and women who really love
God and prove to me that they know God and know God's word by their
behavior and by rightly dividing the word of truth. Â I can tolerate
different teaching and preaching styles so long as the word of God is
rightly divided. Â But when they do what you do, tell me I have to
dance in the spiirt, be slain in the spirit, handle snakes, or believe
in a trinity - I walk away (or correct them). Â I do that because I can
because I know what the word of God says and do not care what men
think. Â I don't know all of the word, just a little bit; but a little
bit very well. Â I know its true because I learned it and then tested
it and it worked.

You are blowing smoke, trying to be intellectual and philosophical so
you can look like a spiritual big shot. Â What you are really doing is
showing your lack of spirituality and loyalty to the systems of the
world which are under the control of the god of this world who is
Satan.

You got potential, but waste it trying to be what God did not call you
to be. Â Why not just learn the word of God? Â Why not just love God's
people? Â That's &quot;Biblical&quot;.

You are wrong. Â You are trying to use natural man reason to handle a
spiritual matter. Â First of all, you have proven that you are not able
to explain truth to anyone. Â I know teenagers that know the word of
God better than you and who can teach it better than you. Â They don't
know the mumbo jumbo and the hokey pokey dance you do; but they know
and live the word of God.

You are wrong I do not reject truth. Â I reject your false
presentations of pseudo facts as truth. Â Truth comes from the rightly
divided word of God; not wrongly divided Bible which you offer. Â You
want to give me watered down poisonous wine. Â I want the wine that
Jesus served at the wedding and I can get it without your help.

Why would I reject truth I already know. Â That is silly. Â You see,
Carl, you don't know what truth is. Â Look it up. Â It is not defined as
what Carl says something is.

Your last sentence gives you away. Â It tells any spiritual man or
woman what you are really all about. Â You desire to present
unassailable arguments and that is nothing but raw Â ego talking. Â You
want to be contentious, full of strife, and debate. Â I don't. Â All I
want to do is learn and do the word of God and love God, the Lord
Jesus Christ, and God's people. Â I'm not here to argue or debate you.
Debating is a sin. Â Look it up.

You have set yourself in a

Is that all you care about? Â Showing people how big and Â intellectual
you are is not what being a Christian is all about. Â You don't care
about truth. Â You care about winning arguments, about contention and
strife, and ebate. Â You just wannabe a big shot that people will
worship they way you worship your men gods. Â You were led down the
wrong path by false teachers as you prove every time you post one of
their articles. Â So I can empathize with you; but cannot absolve you
of your responsibility to worship and serve the one true God His way.

I am not unteachable. Â I learn very well from real teachers and from
personal study and since I have holy spirit in me it is possible to
learn that way, too. Thee is only one criterion for truth for me and
that is the word of God; not wrongly divided Bibles; but the word of
God which you cannot relate to because you don't know what it is. It's
not the Bible, although the Bible contains some of the word of God.
Actually, it makes reference to all of it; but twists the word of God
into the doctrines of men. Â I will be posting something on that soon.

Just because you are a false teacher does not mean that I can't learn
from you. Â False teachers show me what not to learn and reveal the
secrets behind their false doctrines; not knowing that they are doing
so.

Carl, you are the one who has made himself unteachable. Â You have to
believe what your bosses tell you to believe; money and power is at
stake. Â I don't have to worry about that because my boss spent time on
a stake.

&gt;The attempt to place the responsibility on me for convincing you of the

&gt;you reject before the teaching is even presented. You are not the first to
&gt;adopt that approach, it is not a unique creation to you and you will not be
&gt;the last to use it. You have been given instruction and correction on
&gt;virtually every false and aberrant doctrine that you teach, so you know very
&gt;well what is the biblical position.
">

Carl, you are joking aren't you? Â If you aren't joking; what are you
smoking, or snorting, or shooting up, or inhaling, or drinking? Â Your
joking right? Â Please tell me you are joking or on drugs so I won't
think you have gone completely bonkers.

I gladly submit myself to men or women who rightly divide the word of
truth. Â You do not rightly divide the word of truth, so I do not
submit myself to your false doctrines.

What kind of ego would come up with &quot;The attempt to place the
responsibility on me for convincing you of the truth of the Biblical
doctrine of the Trinity that you already know, will not work.&quot; ? Â I
never placed any responsibility on you. Â Responsibility is delegated
to those who have the maturity, intellect, and stamina to handle the
responsibility. Â Why would I place responsibility on you when you have
proven yourself to be immature, lacking in knowledge of the
Scriptures, and without the stamina necessary to complete the task I
might assign you.

I don't want to know the doctrine of the trinity. Â I know it better
than you. Â Why would I blame you for not teaching me what you aren't
able to teach in the first place. Â Your ego is getting much too big.

Your ego is getting out of control. Â You said &quot;I do not bear the guilt
in relation to your beliefs; you do.&quot; Â Why would I blame you for what
I believe whern I have said repeatedly that you lack the abilities
necessary to teach?

Let's see what else you are trying to spin. Â You said

&quot;I know how the spin works; attempting to place the blame on others
by claiming they have not thoroughly convinced you of the truth of
their position, which you reject before the teaching is even
presented.&quot;

I know you know how spin works that what you are trying to do now; but
it won't work. Â But your statement does reveal something to me. Â You
wanna be a spinner like the big time spinners you quote but know you
cannot spin as good as them and feel guilty because you are not a good
spinner and post their professional spin material rather than you own
inadequate spin material.

I have not said the hogwash you said I said. Â I blame you for being
arrogant, and hateful, and ignorant of the Scriptures and for
worshipping man gods. Â I sure don't blame you for what I believe
because you lack the skills to teach me something to believe and
because you have a track record of being dishonest just as you being
in this post.

I have been studing the trinity doctrine for thirty years and know it
better than you do which is why I am able to counter every one of your
wrongly divided presentations with truth from the word of God. Â Oh,
you know the mumbo jumbo that you are supposed to parrott; but you do
not understand what's behind the mumbo jumbo or the ramifications of
the mumbo jumbo. Â When you post the same old posts ovcer and over
again; why would I waste my time reading them. Â When you post one of
your Joseph Smith posts and I see it is wrong; the next article by
your Joseph Smith will be ignored because he lost credability the
first time.

I don't care what they say. Â I want to know what you think because it
is you that I am trying to communciate with. Â Every time I try to
communicate with you, you repond with Pope so and so says so and so.

You are blowing smoke. Â I know the word of God because I study the
word of God rather than what men say about the word of God. Â I have
been careful to set myself under those men and women who really love
God and prove to me that they know God and know God's word by their
behavior and by rightly dividing the word of truth. Â I can tolerate
different teaching and preaching styles so long as the word of God is
rightly divided. Â But when they do what you do, tell me I have to
dance in the spiirt, be slain in the spirit, handle snakes, or believe
in a trinity - I walk away (or correct them). Â I do that because I can
because I know what the word of God says and do not care what men

Documented lies and heresies from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; Sowle

August 11, 2007

&quot;Fact. Â You quoted a section of Scripture which deals with turning a person
over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh. Â Hence, you were preaching
that Glenn should be killed. Â The reason the person was to be turned over to
Satan was because he lusted after his fathers wife. Â Hence, since you were
talking about Glenn and citing those verses about Glenn you accusded [sic]
Glenn of sex with his fathers wife and declared Glenn worthy of death.&quot;
[Fiction. Actually a smear attempt by &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; Reference the entry
entitled &quot;A series showing intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;&quot; which explains in detail how &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is attempting to mislead.]

&quot;Carl McCasky [sic] has proven himself to be a deceiver on numerous
occassions [sic]. Â But this time in his attempt to deceive readers in his
post titled &quot;There is no Biblical fellowship with someone who worships a
different God&quot;, Carl went way to far.&quot; [Please refer to the entry entitled
&quot;A series showing intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;&quot; which
shows that the entry &quot;Bible Bob&quot; refers to was started by a person known on
Usenet as Â®andy and that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has recognized and admitted this fact
yet intentionally chooses to misrepresent it. Also it is interesting that
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; has started undertaking the misspelling of my name. It's not the
easiest one to remember how it is spelled so I will give him the benefit of
a doubt since his spelling is not perfect.]

&quot;He [Carl] accused Glenn of committing fornication with his own mother, his
father's wife.&quot; [This is a fabrication by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; in a repeat of the
attempt he made before. Please refer to the entry entitled &quot;A series showing
intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;&quot; to see again why this is
a false accusation.]

&quot;Here is what Carl wrote:

I and other Christians have rejected Glenn's heresies and even though he has
been corrected by many Christians he still refuses to correct his errors
which leads we Christians to have nothing further to do with him (Romans
16:17; 1 Cor. 5:4-13;...&quot; [Please note &quot;Bible Bob&quot; neglected to present my
COMPLETE quote. Again please refer to the entry entitled &quot;A series showing
intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;&quot; and note that he leaves
off several passages I cite, the common theme being instructions to
Christians to have nothing to do with heretics and their heresies. &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; is resorting to misquoting and taking the partial quote out of context
to try to slander me.]

&quot;Carl demands that Christians deliver Glenn to Satan for the destruction of
the flesh. Â Why? Â According to the context it is because Glenn had sex with
his father's wife.

What kind of &quot;Christian&quot; would make such a charge against another man? Would
any of you men charge another man with screwing his own mother? That is not
a &quot;man&quot; thing to do because normal men do not even think that way. Â And I
can't think of one woman who would do such a thing either.&quot; [I never made
any such demand. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; had to prooftext and take out all the other
Bible passages I cited where the common theme making my point is the
instruction to Christians not to have anything to do with heretics and their
heresies. The fact that he refuses to include the remaining passages shows a
marked lack of honesty and a serious intent of malice on his part.]

&quot;Carl owes Glenn and all of us an apology. Â For Carl to demand Glenn's death
at the hand of Satan for fornication with his own mother is not an exercise
of free speech. Â It is a demon exercising Carl.&quot; [Since I never made any
such demand and since &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is misrepresenting what I posted, I do not
owe Glenn an apology. Actually for this evil exercise in deception from
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; he needs to beg for forgiveness.]

&quot;You, yourself, Carl McCasky [sic], believe that works are necessary for
salvation and you are the Baptist Methodist cult I was specifically talking
about.&quot; [Another misrepresentation by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; since I do not nor ever
have believed that works are necessary for salvation. If anyone cares to
check, please do a Google search for my posts concerning salvation and you
will see that I espouse the Biblical teaching that salvation is by faith in
Jesus Christ as one's Lord and Savior and it is by God's grace that we
receive that salvation.]

August 10, 2007

After pointing out that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; really only cares about himself, &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; responds with &quot;Nah, I care about rescuing you from the consequences
[sic] of sin.&quot; [Interesting wording. Is &quot;Bible Bob&quot; implying that he can
rescue me from the consequences of sin? Sure seems that way. But that's
something only Jesus Christ did for us when He was crucified for our sins.
Could this be a Freudian slip on &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part?]

Also on July 10, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; posted the following to me:

&quot;Showing your true colors again, I see. Â Telling the big lies and sticking
to them in your best Third Reich style. Â You learned Hitler's Goebbels &quot;tell
the big lie and stick to it well.&quot; Â Now that you have that under your belt,
maybe you can find to study the word of God.&quot;

Then two paragraphs later he demands:

&quot;Prove one of your malicious slanderous claims, Carl. Â You can't. Â If you
could you would have posted the documentation fifty times.&quot;

[Reasonable individuals would consider accusing someone of being in the
&quot;Third Reich&quot; (a Nazi reference) is being quite malicious and slanderous as
well.]

---

August 10, 2007

&quot;You [Carl] are about as &quot;spiritual&quot; as a three year old; except the three
year old wouldn't be evil like you [Carl].&quot; [And &quot;Bible Bob&quot; doesn't
consider calling someone else evil not a malicious act when it is clearly
not true? I know I am sinful because I am not perfect but I am not evil.
Just another smear tactic by &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;When did I call a cult children of God?&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; referred to Jehovah's
Witnesses and their parent organization as &quot;children of God&quot; on multiple
occasions. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; referred to Mormons and their parent organization as
&quot;children of God&quot; on multiple occasions.]

&quot;Face it Carl, you are a hate monger and a messenger of Satan sent by Satan
to harm the children of God that you chose to speak evil of.&quot; [More
malicious slander from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; Sowle.]

August 9, 2007

&quot;Carl, you are joking aren't you? Â If you aren't joking; what are you
smoking, or snorting, or shooting up, or inhaling, or drinking? Â Your joking
right? Â Please tell me you are joking or on drugs so I won't think you have
gone completely bonkers.&quot; [And right off, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; begins with the ad
hominem.]

&quot;What kind of ego would come up with &quot;The attempt to place the
responsibility on me for convincing you of the truth of the Biblical
doctrine of the Trinity that you already know, will not work.&quot; ? Â I never
placed any responsibility on you. Â Responsibility is delegated to those who
have the maturity, intellect, and stamina to handle the responsibility. Â Why
would I place responsibility on you when you have proven yourself to be
immature, lacking in knowledge of the Scriptures, and without the stamina
necessary to complete the task I might assign you.&quot; [Continuing in the same
post, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; continues with his ad hominem and commits his first act of
attempted deception. On several occasions, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; demanded I prove his
errors and prove where he has lied. I did so at first yet all he could do
was respond with variations of &quot;you didn't prove anything.&quot; Therefore when
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; claims &quot;I never placed any responsibility on you&quot; he is lying.]

&quot;I have not said the hogwash you said I said.&quot; [Well, the &quot;hogwash&quot;
appropriately enough, is documented in this text file and further examples
can be seen through a simple Google search on Usenet newsgroups. Again
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; is attempting to deceive.]

&quot;I blame you for being arrogant, and hateful, and ignorant of the Scriptures
and for worshipping man gods.&quot; [More slander and attempted deception from
&quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;I have been studing [sic] the trinity doctrine for thirty years and know it
better than you do which is why I am able to counter every one of your
wrongly divided presentations with truth from the word of God.&quot; [Actually
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; has only countered with prooftexting, erroneous definitions,
errors in Greek translations and grammar (some he made up himself that no
Greek scholars use) and intentional misrepresentations. He has denied many
essential doctrines of Biblical Christianity including, the Trinity, the
deity of Christ, salvation by grace via faith in Jesus and others. After
researching &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s history on Usenet I discovered that many
Christians corrected his errors yet &quot;Bible Bob&quot; countered with falsehoods
and false teachings. &quot;Bible Bob&quot;, as documented in this text file as well as
Usenet has been refuted numerous times yet pretends they never happened.
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; is in denial.]

&quot;When you post one of your Joseph Smith posts and I see it is wrong; the
next article by your Joseph Smith will be ignored because he lost
credibility [sic] the first time.&quot; [I never posted any article by &quot;Joseph
Smith.&quot; &quot;Bible Bob&quot; may be confusing an author I did reference to the
founder of the Mormon church.]

&quot;Every time I try to communicate with you, you repond [sic] with Pope so and
so says so and so.&quot; [Again a clear and intentional misrepresentation on
&quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part. I initially felt it appropriate to respond to him
directly but he kept claiming that my knowledge wasn't up to his level so I
deferred to folks like John Ankerberg, John
