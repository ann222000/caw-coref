*Cummins Signs Memorandum of Understanding to Form Diesel Engine Joint
Venture in Vietnam*

NEW YORK, Sep 28, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) --

Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) today announced that it has signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with Vietnam Motors Industry Corp. (Vinamotor) to create a
50-50 joint venture to produce on-highway diesel engines in Vietnam.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was reached Sept. 21 in Hanoi by
Cummins Chairman and CEO Tim Solso and Nguyen Van Khoa, Chairman of
Vinamotor.

The agreement was commemorated today at a signing ceremony in New York City
in the presence of Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of the Socialist Republic
of Vietnam. Chairman Nguyen represented Vinamotor and Steve Chapman, Group
Vice President - Emerging Markets and Businesses represented Cummins.

Vinamotor, a government-owned company, is the largest commercial vehicle
producer in Vietnam, which currently has no local engine production. The MOU
outlines the parameters of the joint venture, which is contingent on the
satisfactory results of a feasibility study, which Cummins expects to be
completed in January 2008.

Financial terms of the deal have not been set and no timetable for
completing the joint venture agreement has been established.

Under the terms of the MOU, the joint venture would take a phased approach
to producing Cummins-designed engines in Vietnam: Initially, engine kits
will be imported for assembly and distribution in Vietnam with local
components ultimately being used in production as the supply base in Vietnam
develops.

&quot;Vietnam is one of the fast-growing economies in Asia, and this deal would
position Cummins to capitalize on that growth,&quot; said Solso. &quot;Cummins has a
history of working well with local partners, as our success in China and
India has shown, and we are excited about the prospects of teaming with
Vinamotor to bring Cummins' engine technology to Vietnam.&quot;
