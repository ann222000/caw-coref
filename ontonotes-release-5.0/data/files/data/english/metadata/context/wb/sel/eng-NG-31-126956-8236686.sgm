&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; NEVER let a woman lead.... NEVER!!! That goes for everything, not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; just kissing.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; NEVER!!!!!!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; NEVER!!!!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It will KILL her attraction to you. Period.

&gt; &gt;&gt; really? i had a woman once tell me that a guy like me needs a woman
&gt; &gt;&gt; to be in control. of course she was a big tease and thought it was
&gt; &gt;&gt; funny to promise to have sex with you and then stop talking to you
&gt; &gt;&gt; for no reason.

&gt; &gt; lies, no one would ever have sex with you. You should have known that.
&gt; &gt; Don't be so naive to believe that she would have actually fucked you.
&gt; &gt; Come on now robbie, don't ruin the gimmick by actually saying you
&gt; &gt; almost got laid.

&gt; Judging by the responses he elicits, he &quot;ruins&quot; his gimmick all of the
&gt; time.

&gt; Final verdict: Robert &quot;robby&quot; Stickler is a worked shoot - he's a
&gt; legitimate misfit, but smart enough to know that playing up his
&gt; ignorance will get him attention.

At least he has a gimmick. What's your excuse for being an asshole?
