Burkini Swimsuit Covers All Angles for Muslim Women

What do you get when you cross Australian beach culture with a desire to
remain clothed in a way acceptable to Muslim women? If you're designer Aheda
Zanetti, you get what she says is the world's first two-piece Islamic
swimsuit,
the burkini.

While other Islamic swimsuits exist, Zanetti says her light-weight, head-to-
ankle costumes are the first to be streamlined down to a two-piece suit
incorporating a head covering.

With Australian beaches full of girls in skimpy bikinis and revealing one-
pieces, there was a &quot;hole in the market that needed to be filled&quot; for more
modest beachwear, she said. &quot;A lot of girls were missing out, a lot of women
were missing out, on a lot of sporting activities, including swimming,&quot;
Zanetti
said.

&quot;There was nothing really suitable for them to wear if they wanted to
participate in sports. And if they did participate in sports with a veil, or
whatever they wanted to wear, there really wasn't something suitable. The
fabric
was not right, the construction wasn't right.&quot;

Zanetti is something of an accidental designer. Trained as a hairdresser,
she
has never worn a burqa, the restrictive all-encompassing gown worn by women
in
more conservative Muslim cultures from which her full-body swimsuits take
their
name.

And she never wore a veil until she began designing sportswear. But the
39-year-old mother of four realized that there would be a market for Islamic
sportswear when she saw her hijab- wearing niece play netball.

&quot;And when I was looking at her playing sports with a two-piece veil and a
skivvy [long-sleeved, high-necked shirt] and the pants and then her netball
jersey on top and then her skirt, I thought, `Oh my god, there must be
something
better than this,&quot;' she said.

Lebanon-born Zanetti at first created a crop top which incorporated a veil
into a modest shirt. She later moved into other sportswear items, including
the
swimwear, all the while keeping to her motto: &quot;Modesty is No1.&quot;

Her company Ahiida in Sydney's Punchbowl now receives hundreds of requests
from around the country and overseas for the quick-drying, polyester
burkinis
which cost between A$160 (HK$979.34) and A$200.

The product has not been without controversy in Australia, where riots
erupted
on Sydney's Cronulla Beach in December 2005 when young white mobs attacked
Middle Eastern youths in an attempt to &quot;reclaim&quot; the beach.

&quot;Like today I got an e-mail from a guy saying, `Muslim women are hot, why
can't you just get them to wear the normal bikinis so we can appreciate them
more?' Or things like that.&quot;

She has also been attacked by fellow Muslims describing her outfits as a
disgrace. &quot;I've had people put the burkinis in pornos and really disgraced
it.
But you know what? I don't take much notice of it, &quot; she said.

The Cronulla riots prompted widespread debate about the extent of latent
racism in the multi-ethnic nation.

The burkini has become a part of the solution. Under a government program,
more young Muslims are being trained to become volunteer surf lifesavers to
patrol the country's beaches.

As Surf Life Saving Australia celebrates its centenary this year, Zanetti is
producing burkinis in red and yellow - the traditional colors of the iconic
lifesavers.

Twenty-year-old Mecca Laalaa would not have trained to become a surf
lifesaver
were it not for the burkini. &quot;My clothing and what I wear swimming stopped
me
from being involved in water activities,&quot; she said. &quot;The burkini means
there's
really nothing stopping me now.&quot;
