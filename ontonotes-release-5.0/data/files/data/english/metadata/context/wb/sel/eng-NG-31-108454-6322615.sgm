Iran and the failed US Iraq policy
By Henry C K Liu

(See also Fleeing self-destruction is common sense
and Looking to Syria for help)

Notwithstanding the long Iran-Iraq War that began in 1980 and ended
with a stalemate in 1988, Tehran's chief security concern since the
fall of the shah in 1979 has not been with Iraq, but with belligerent
US intentions toward the Islamic Republic itself.

The view persists in Persian Tehran, as indeed it does also in Arab
Damascus, Riyadh, and even Cairo, as well as in the
capitals of all the Persian Gulf states, that after Iraq their
separate countries, for different reasons, with or without nuclear-
weapons ambitions, are destined to be targets on the US hit list to
complete its agenda of imposing democracy in the entire region.
Accordingly, Tehran can be expected to prepare for defending itself
from possible militarized hostilities from either the US itself or
its proxy regime in Iraq.

This view is based not on Iranian or Arab paranoia, but on official
US policy declaration. On November 6, 2003, less than eight months
after the invasion of Iraq, addressing the National Endowment for
Democracy, a neo-conservative organization founded during the era of
the late US president Ronald Reagan, President George W Bush, fresh
from "catastrophic success" in war, sought to justify the predictably
endless and unsustainably high cost in lives and money of the
invasion and occupation of Iraq by setting out the argument for that
war no longer in terms of defense against a security threat to the US
homeland, but as part of a proactive "global democratic revolution".

After failing to find weapons of mass destruction in postwar Iraq
despite exhaustive search, the blood and money Bush was expending in
that occupied land were being justified by the noble-sounding aim of
promoting democracy in tribal Arab societies and in the Persian
Islamic Republic, notwithstanding that Iran's democratically elected
prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, had been deposed in 1953 by the
US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to install the autocratic
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as shah to keep Iranian oil in Western hands.

Bush predicted that successful implantation of a democratic
government in Iraq would energize a global democratic revolution that
would sweep away what the United States alleged to be "tyrannies from
Cuba to North Korea". Specifically, Bush proclaimed a new "forward
strategy" for advancing freedom in the Middle East, declaring that
"six decades of excusing and accommodating dictatorships there on the
part of the US did nothing to make us safe, because stability cannot
be purchased at liberty's expense". Even after the rout suffered by
the Republicans in last November's mid-term congressional elections
when the disastrous US occupation of Iraq had been a major campaign
issue, Bush continues to argue not only that US troops should not be
withdrawn, but that a new troop surge should be sent until democracy
has been established in the region, which ironically confirmed the
fact that the war itself did not foster democracy. Democracy has to
be enforced at gunpoint after the war.

Thus there are survival incentives in all capitals in Middle East and
the GCC states (Gulf Cooperation Council for the Arab states Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) and
in Iran to ensure that US regime-change policy does not succeed and
that this geopolitical cancer called "democracy" be arrested within
Iraq by insurgence therapy before it spreads throughout a region of
Arab tribal societies and a Persian civilization that dates back to
1500 BC.

For Iran, a stabilized Iraq under US control would act as a proxy
belligerent against it, relieving the United States from hesitation
over the exorbitantly high direct cost of military action against a
zealous enemy in the form of the Islamic Republic of Iran with a
population of 70 million, substantial oil wealth and a strategic
location controlling Persian Gulf tanker traffic through the Strait
of Hormuz. Iran has not forgotten the US tilt toward Iraq in the
eight-year Iran-Iraq War that began in 1980 in which more than a
million combatants died and countless more were wounded. It was the
longest war in modern history, where weapons were supplied to Iraq by
France and by both Cold War nemeses the USSR and the US, while Iran
was supplied by Israel, its mortal enemy, to prolong the war to bleed
both combatants.

Tehran knows that in a war with the US, there would be help from
unexpected sources to keep Iran fighting for years to wear down, if
not defeat, the United States, whose domestic politics cannot sustain
a long limited war.

Iranian involvement in the Middle East
Middle East involvement by the Islamic Republic of Iran began in 1982
when Israel invaded Lebanon, prompting Iran, despite its by-then
three-year-old war with Iraq, to deploy its Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps to the Bekaa Valley to help the Lebanese Muslims fight
against the Israel invasion, and to counter US support for Israeli
aggression.

In July that year, operatives from the US-backed Lebanese Christian
forces kidnapped four Iranian diplomats, including the commander of
the Revolutionary Guards in the Bekaa Valley and the Iranian charge
d'affaires. That triggered a decade of retaliatory kidnappings in
which dozens of Westerners were taken hostage by a network of
resistance cells. The first hostage was David Dodge, a US citizen who
was the acting president of the American University in Beirut. US
officials alleged that operatives from the Iranian-backed Shi'ite
group Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, were behind most of the kidnappings.

In April 1983, a suicide bomber rammed a pickup truck loaded with
explosives into the US Embassy in Beirut. Seventeen US diplomats were
among the 63 people killed, eight of whom were CIA operatives,
including chief Middle East analyst Robert C Ames and station chief
Kenneth Haas. The Reagan administration again blamed Hezbollah, which
it suspected was receiving financial and logistical support from Iran
with assistance from Syria.

In September 1983, a truck bomb again exploded outside the US Embassy
annex in Beirut, killing 24 people, two of whom were US military
personnel. According to a 1999 US State Department report on
terrorist organizations, elements of Hezbollah were "known or
suspected to have been involved" in the bombing, notwithstanding the
oxymoronic nature of the words "known" and "suspected".

In October 1984, a suicide bomber detonated a truck full of
explosives at a US Marine Corps barracks at Beirut International
Airport, killing 241 marines and wounding more than 100 others. The
soldiers were part of a contingent of 1,800 marines that had been
sent to help separate warring Lebanese factions. The incident led to
the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon.

In Frontline Public Broadcasting Service interview conducted days
after September 11, 2001, former secretary of defense Caspar
Weinberger said that the US still lacked "actual knowledge of who did
the bombing" of the marine barracks, but it suspected Hezbollah on
deduction from motive.

In the same interview, Robert C MacFarlane, national security adviser
to Reagan from 1983-85, told of an internal dilemma over the
appropriate US response: "In 1984, it was essentially the same
disagreement [within the administration] ... over the use of force,
and its impact on alienating moderate Muslim states. That led to
paralysis in response to the attack on the embassy annex. Secretary
[of state George] Shultz favored a very strong response with the 6th
Fleet, and secretary Weinberger simply opposed it."

In an attempt to end the Lebanese hostage crisis, US officials who
believed that Iran-backed operatives of Hezbollah were responsible
for the kidnappings devised a covert plan. Iran was desperately
running out of military supplies in its war with Iraq, and Congress
had banned the sale of US arms to countries that it said sponsored
terrorism, which included Iran. President Reagan was advised that a
bargain could be struck: secret arms sales to Iran in exchange for
hostages back to the US.

The plan, when it was revealed to the public, was decried as a
failure and anathema to standing US policy of refusing to negotiate
with terrorists. In August 1985, the first consignment of ndreds more
were sent the following month, fully paid for in cash by Iran. Three
hostages were released as a result of the arms-for-hostages deal.

Since the funds from the arms sales to Iran were secretly and
illegally funneled to the US-backed Contras fighting to overthrow the
Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, the episode came to be known as the
"Iran-Contra affair". It would become the biggest crisis in Reagan's
presidency, with details fully documented in the "Final Report of the
Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters".

In the same Frontline interview, Robert Oakley, former US State
Department coordinator for counter-terrorism during the 1980s, said
of the Beirut Embassy bombing: "It was primarily the Iranians; the
Syrians were sort of a secondary player, if you will, a facilitator
more than a principal. The Iranians wanted to drive us out of
Lebanon. The Iranians also wanted to create a Hezbollah party, that
is, a party based on the Shi'ite Islamic movement in Lebanon, which
would be their tool for Islamizing Lebanon, hopefully turning it into
an Islamic state similar to Iran ... We began to apply a series of
pressures to states supporting terrorism. One was Iraq, and they
stopped."

In response to suspected Iranian involvement in causing US casualties
in Lebanon, the US tilted toward Iraq. Donald Rumsfeld, as Reagan's
special envoy, was photographed on December 20, 1983, shaking hands
with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein on the official visit.

Declassified National Security Document 26 records that after further
high-level policy review, Reagan issued National Security Decision
Directive (NSDD) 114 dated November 26, 1983, concerning specific US
policy toward the Iran-Iraq War. The directive reflected the
administration's priorities: calling for heightened regional military
cooperation to defend oil facilities and measures to improve US
military capabilities in the Persian Gulf, and directing the
secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff to take appropriate measures to respond to tensions in the
area. It stated: "Because of the real and psychological impact of a
curtailment in the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf on the
international economic system, we must assure our readiness to deal
promptly with actions aimed at disrupting that traffic."

The document did not mention chemical, biological or nuclear weapons
or Iraqi possession of them.

Document 28 records that soon thereafter, Rumsfeld (who had served in
various positions in the administrations of presidents Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford, including as Ford's defense secretary, and at this
time headed the multinational pharmaceutical company G D Searle &amp; Co)
was dispatched to the Middle East as a presidential envoy. Rumsfeld's
December 1983 tour of regional capitals included Baghdad, where he
was to establish "direct contact between an envoy of president Reagan
and president Saddam Hussein", while emphasizing his personal "close
relationship" with the US president.

Document 31 records that Rumsfeld met with Saddam, and the two
discussed regional issues of mutual interest, shared enmity toward
Iran and Syria, and US efforts to find alternative routes to
transport Iraqi oil - its facilities in the Persian Gulf had been
shut down by Iran, and Iran's ally Syria had cut off a pipeline that
transported Iraqi oil through its territory. Rumsfeld made no
reference to concerns for nuclear or chemical weapons, according to
detailed notes on the meeting. The US re-established diplomatic
relations with Iraq four years into the Iran-Iraq War, in November
1984, which had been severed 17 years earlier after the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war

Yet less than two decades later, Iraq was invaded in March 2003 in a
new war orchestrated by Rumsfeld, again as secretary of defense, on
the ground, among others, that it was a terrorist-sponsoring state in
possession of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons
that had been openly used during the Iran-Iraq War.

Iran views Iraq as first line of defense
From the perspective of Iran being the next target in the US agenda
of transformation by regime change, Tehran logically regards a US-
occupied Iraq as a first line of defense and thus will try to prevent
the United States from establishing effective control there. Iran
thus will work to keep Washington tied down in a no-win, no-exit
situation in Iraq through close support for Iraq's majority Shi'ite
constituent. As US hostility toward Iran escalates toward military
action, Tehran can be expected to step up its effort to shape Iraqi
Shi'ite strategy and policy alternatives regarding the future
political landscape in Iraq and its role in the region.

Iran will take every opportunity to prevent the US from stabilizing
the sectarian violence in Iraq and from influencing Iraqi foreign
policy into renewed hostility toward Iran. Toward this end, Iran will
seek to keep Washington in a no-win situation of not being able to
withdraw its troops quickly and also not being able to stay in Iraq
for as long as needed to impose "democracy" without paying an
unbearably high cost. In the end, under this strategy, the US will be
bled so weak that its capacity to influence political developments in
the region, much less to reach the fantasy goal of advancing US
national interest via the imposition of democracy through regime
change, will be sharply curtained, if not by an unsustainable overtax
of its military resources, at least by an inevitable loss of will
through fatigue in divisive domestic politics. The path to this
scenario is to fan and escalate sectarian violence in US-occupied
Iraq through Iran's spiritual influence on Iraq's large Shi'ite
constituency.

It is, however, a risky strategy for Tehran. Overt Iranian
intervention in southern Iraq provides credibility to Washington's
accusation of Iranian meddling in Iraq's internal affairs. Such an
accusation, if proved, would justify even more hostile US pressure
against Iran and neutralize international reservation about a US
military attack on it. This is especially true if US plans for troop
withdrawal from the current quagmire in Iraq is hampered by Iranian
intervention to frustrate US strategy of shifting from military to
political control of Iraq.

Further, as a legacy of British "divide and rule" strategy after the
fall of the Ottoman Dominion, Iraq's Shi'ite population has been
scattered into many separate communities of varied secular interests.
Iraq's diverse Shi'ite population is far from ideologically
homogenous, divided into many overlapping factions that speak with
often competing voices, at times tribal, at other times schismatic,
and at still other times nationalistic and pan-Arab. The different
Iraqi Shi'ite factions do not automatically obey orders from Tehran
with the same degree of unquestioned compliance. Many Iraqi Shi'ites
regard Najaf in Iraq, not Qom in Iran, as the more authentic seat of
Shi'ite exegetic scholarship, theological authority and secular
influence.

The fall of Saddam's Sunni-dominated, secular, pan-Arab Ba'athist
regime in Iraq causes fundamental reverberations in Iranian domestic
theocratic politics as well as regional geopolitics in the context of
centuries-old Persian-Arab nationalistic conflict.

Ba'athist Iraq strengthened Shi'ite solidarity
Ironically, when the Iraqi Ba'ath Party under Saddam Hussein,
supported by secular Sunnis, moved to suppress the intrusion of
religion into politics by dismantling the Shi'ite clergy in the seats
of theological learning in Iraq, it unwittingly strengthened the
claim of the Iranian Shi'ite ecclesiastic elite as true defenders of
the faith and holy theological guardians, thus enhancing the
doctrinal relevance and leadership of Qom in the greater Shi'ite world.

During the years of Ba'ath Party rule, many Iraqi Shi'ite leaders
were forced to take refuge in Iran, making it natural for Iran to
claim ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's doctrine of Islamic statism as
orthodox Shi'ism rather than the traditional "quietist" school, which
believes in a separation between religion and politics and between
ecclesiastical and political authority. Quietism was discredited by
reality on the ground as a suicidal theology.

Both opportunity and problems for Iran
With a majority Shi'ite government in place in postwar Iraq as a
result of US-imposed democracy, Najaf, together with Karbala, can be
expected to regain their theological significance at the expense of
Qom, but only if Iraqi Shi'ism adjusts its "quietism". Yet the Iraqi
Shi'ite community, now with a new taste of political power, is
unlikely to take kindly to Iranian dictates in either theology or
secular politics.

When Iraq fell under the control of British imperialism in 1915,
millennium-old Persian influence was systematically purged with new
Arabic nationality laws prohibiting non-Arab foreigners except
Britons to hold high government office. An Iraq under US neo-
imperialistic control can be expected to be equally unwelcoming of
Iranian political influence under the cover of religious union.

Any clumsy Iranian attempt to assert coercive geopolitical leadership
in Shi'ite Iraq could cause a backlash and damage the spiritual
prestige and theological influence of Tehran and Qom in Shi'ite
communities in the wider Arab world, alienating the very elements
Iran aims to rally against the US infidel.

A confident and secure Shi'ite-dominated secular government in Iraq
leads naturally to policy and doctrinal cleavages not only between
Iraq and Iran, but also in Iran's own unique Islamic theocratic
system, where both spiritual influence and political legitimacy are
derived from militant religious orthodoxy. Tehran and Qom stand
integrated through the velayate faqih principle, which rules through
a clerical jurisprudence in which the top cleric is the spiritual
leader of the Islamic state, in a reverse form of Caesaropapism - the
concept of combining the power of secular government with, or making
it supreme to, the spiritual authority of the Christian Church.

An alternative and influential source of religious authority beyond
Tehran's control could seriously test the doctrinal basis of Iran's
theocratic regime founded on a decidedly narrow interpretation of
Shi'ite theology made valid by Western imperialistic abuse. The
spiritual rebirth of Najaf will not only challenge Qom and give Arabs
a bigger say in the greater Shi'ite world from Lebanon to Yemen, but
will also raise considerable theological support for those forces
within the Persian power structure that question the continuing
prudence of centralizing religious-political authority in the hands
of the faqih (leader or just jurist) and a small group of
ecclesiastic allies in the Guardian Council, the judiciary and
security apparatus, and the Expediency Council. As Western cultural
and economic imperialism recedes from the region, the flame of
Islamic fundamentalism will flicker from a loss of fuel.

The political evolution of post-Saddam Iraq is emerging as an
important factor that affects factional rivalries within the Iranian
power structure. Elements in Iranian domestic politics justify
geopolitical solidarity with Arab Shi'ite forces in Iraq's emerging
post-Ba'athist polity by pointing to a more threatening prospect of
Iraqi Shi'ites being co-opted by an anti-Iran US agenda in Iraq. This
agenda includes the imposition of a US version of a pro-West moderate
Muslim Arab state in Iraq that is schismatically hostile to Iran.

In the name of enhancing democracy, renewed US support can be
expected for the Iraq-based anti-Tehran Mujahideen-e Khalq
organization, a socialist opposition movement that turned against the
revolutionary Islamic government in Iran after its influence was
markedly curtailed in the new theocratic power structure. After
having first bombed its bases inside Iraq in an effort to keep Iran
neutral during the US invasion in March 2003, the US now sees renewed
support for the Mujahideen-e Khalq organization as a useful
bargaining chip in its dealing with Iran.

Iran also aims to resist the establishment of permanent US military
bases in Iraq, US control of Iraq's oil wealth for anti-Iran
geopolitical purposes, and the expansion of US military facilities in
the small, rich Arab Gulf states of Shi'ite Bahrain and Sunni Qatar
to encircle Iran through an elaborate network of security alliances.
Under such a scenario, Iran needs to keep all the friends and allies
it can find. It provides justification for Tehran to encourage
Shi'ite forces to use their majority power in the new Iraqi polity to
ensure a pro-Iran posture while convincing Sunni Arabs that sectarian
violence is not Iranian policy.

Wolfowitz' miscalculation
Former US deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz, widely
identified as the infamous architect of the ill-fated US war on Iraq,
put forth the view before the invasion that Iraqis are preferable to
Saudis as US allies because Iraqis are secularists rather than
fundamentalists and "overwhelmingly Shi'a, which is different from
the fundamentalist Sunni Wahhabis of the [Arabian] Peninsula, and
they don't bring the sensitivity of having the holy cities of Islam
being on their territory", such as Mecca.

Wolfowitz and his fellow neo-con policymakers misguidedly discounted
the confrontational passion of extremist Shi'ite fundamentalist
forces of the Iraqi shrine cities of Najaf and Karbala and perilously
underestimated the havoc their militia could cause.

SCIRI - Iran's problematic ally in Iraq
Tehran has a powerful ally among Iraqi Shi'ites, notably the Badr
Brigade of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq
(SCIRI), a large, influential Shi'ite political organization formerly
based in Iran that regularly mounted military and logistical
resistance operations in Iraq during Saddam's long rule.

Tehran has also been heavily engaged in training and maintaining the
al-Hakim tribe and the well-established Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK) and the Islamist Da'wa Party. Ironically, as the SCIRI
solidifies its dominance in secular Iraqi politics, Tehran's theo-
geopolitical hold on it can be expected to slacken, because the SCIRI
will have to maintain a balance between cross-border religious
sectarian solidarity, Arab nationalism and even pan-Arabism, a
movement Iran has no interest in supporting any more than Israel.

Tehran's reliance on the SCIRI to shape Iraqi politics in favor of
Iran incurs the price of enhancing Iraqi Shi'ite influence in Iranian
domestic theocratic politics and encourages reform of Shi'ite dogma.
Those moderates in Tehran who counsel caution on evangelistic
diplomacy worry about an uncontrollable anti-Iran backlash in Iraqi
politics resulting from domestic and foreign-policy consequences of
Iranian manipulation of Iraq's large Shi'ite community for narrow
geopolitical ends. They seek to protect Qom's place as the highest
authority of Shi'ism by avoiding meddling in Iraq's internal secular
affairs. The dilemma is that Qom's theology is not separable from
secular politics and its religious orthodoxy requires Iran to
interfere in internal Iraqi secular affairs.

Iranian moderates also hope that Saddam's fall has removed an
obstacle for Iran to normalize state-to-state relations with the
Sunni GCC states by assuring that the Shi'ite majority in Iraqi
society is not necessarily a security threat to Sunni interests but
merely a part of the country's historical reality. The partition of
the Middle East by Western imperialist powers imposed political
boundaries that ignored historical and existing religious and ethnic
compositions, leaving multi-ethnic sovereign states in the region in
the post-colonial world, which Iran has no interest in disturbing. In
essence, the biggest victim of Saddam's fall in the long run will be
pan-Arabism, a movement that is viewed by the US, Iran and Israel as
a common enemy, for different reasons. The failure of other Arab
states to come to Saddam's aid was a strategic error that will set
back pan-Arabism for another century.

Iranian moderates and pragmatists point to the redeployment of US
troops from Saudi Arabia to Qatar in April 2003 as evidence that
Washington has been forced to moderate hostile intentions of
targeting Iran, albeit the main reason was to neutralize al-Qaeda
grievance on US troops stationed in Saudi Arabia, which had been used
as a justification for terrorist attacks on the US. They further
argue that encouragement should be given to those in the US ready to
include Iran in discussions on collective security arrangements in
the vital Gulf sub-region.

Iranian moderates argue that Tehran should maintain its steady course
of detente with the West and take advantage of the new situation in
Iraq to underline its readiness to cooperate and enter into deeper
dialogue with the United States as well as the European Union about
the future shape of the Gulf security framework. They see an extended
role for Iran in helping to reduce sources of tension in the Gulf as
in its national interest, as Iran will better fulfill its natural
role as a major power in the region without reactive Western
hostility generated by aggressive exertion on the part of Iran.

Post-Iraq war balance of power
The regional balance of power has shifted as a consequence of the US
war on Iraq. The US has unwittingly delivered an unintended gift to
Tehran by fulfilling Iran's strategic goals in its eight-year war
with Iraq: the removal of not just Saddam, but also of the secular,
pan-Arab Ba'athist regime. However, the continuing tensions between
Washington and Tehran have transformed the removal of the Ba'athist
regime as a Trojan horse populated with poisonous Shi'ite schism with
which Tehran must now contend.

Tehran has been active in encouraging an aggressive Iraqi Shi'ite
posture toward the Sunni minority in the sectarian composition of the
new Iraqi government by insisting on majority-rule democracy balanced
by only sharply curtailed minority rights, aided by the naive US
occupation's ill-considered purge of Ba'athists, the one effective
force against Islamic fundamentalism. In fact the combined pressure
from the rise of Shi'ite power and the collapse of secular Sunni
Ba'athism open a huge window for the revival of Sunni Wahhabism.

In February, the new head of al-Qaeda in Iraq, the self-proclaimed
emir of the Islamic State of Iraq, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, issued a
statement welcoming the surge of more US troops into Iraq and looking
forward eagerly to a US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. An
Islamic State of Iraq was proclaimed last year after the death of the
leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

The Associated Press reported that Iraqi Brigadier-General Qassim al-
Moussawi, spokesman on Baghdad security operations, claimed that
Baghdadi was captured on March 10 in a raid in Abu Ghraib on the
western outskirts of Baghdad. US officials had no confirmation of the
capture, since Baghdadi is a phantom character known only by a tape-
recording of a voice bearing his name.

Even the capture of Osama bin Laden himself will not spell the end of
the cell structure of al-Qaeda. The US "war on terrorism", instead of
igniting a "proactive democratic revolution", has transformed a
secular Ba'athist regime in Iraq into an al-Qaeda Islamic state
within US-occupied Iraq.

Neo-conservatives in Washington consider Ba'athist pan-Arabism
strategically more lethal than Islamic fundamentalism, a view shared
by Israel. Islamic extremism is a double-edged sword: it breeds
terrorism while it motivates anti-terror alliances even among strange
bedfellows. Pan-Arabism, if it should ever come to pass, will create
a new super-bloc that will change the entire political landscape of
the world and present insurmountable problems for the US-Israel
alliance. On the other side, Iran also aims to encourage Iraqi
nationalism against US occupation without undue support for pan-Arabism.

The history of Islamic expansion via Arab conquests was driven by
evangelical zeal, not by Arab imperialism. Victorious Arabs did not
impose political regime changes in their conquered lands as long as
the conquered population accepted Islam. After Persia was defeated by
the Arab armies, it transformed into an Islamic nation by purging its
Zoroastrian roots, but kept its unique civilization and political
culture. It is a classic example of "blowback", as extremist Iranian
Islamic geopolitics came back centuries later to haunt secular Arab
states by pushing them toward Iranian-style Islamic republicanism.

Shi'ite intra-sectarian conflict
Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, age about 76, is the leading cleric at
Najaf, shrine city of holy figure Ali bin Abi Talib, who was a cousin
and son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed. Sistani, born in Mashhad,
Iran, came to Najaf (population 585,600 in 2003) in 1952 at age 22
and settled permanently. Sistani hangs on to the "quietism" that had
been eclipsed by the activist theocratic theory of clerical rule or
the holy "guardianship of the jurisprudent" of the late ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran, which fueled the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, top cleric at Najaf, a respected scholar of
Islamic economics and banking, and a fervent defender of the ideas of
Iran's Khomeini and the Islamic Revolution, was killed by Saddam
Hussein's regime in 1980. During Saddam's hanging late last year,
cries of "Long live Muhammad Baqir Sadr!" were heard being chanted by
some of the Shi'ite executioners. Muhammad Baqir's nephew, Muhammad
Sadiq al-Sadr, founder of the Sadr movement, was assassinated in 1999
by order of Saddam's elder son Uday. Sistani then emerged as the most
senior ayatollah in Najaf, his political stature ironically enhanced
by the very theocratic theory he opposes.

Muqtada al-Sadr, 33-year-old son of the martyred Muhammad Sadiq al-
Sadr and son-in-law of the martyred Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, is
Sistani's foremost rival in Najaf. After his father's martyrdom,
Muqtada went underground to organize the desperately poor Shi'ites of
Najaf and nearby Kufa, and the Shi'ite slums of eastern Baghdad,
renamed Sadr City from Saddam City, home to some 3 million zealous
believers. The Sadr movement claims that only the militant rulings of
Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr may be followed, contrary to orthodox
mainstream Usuli Shi'ism forbidding the faithful to follow the
rulings of a deceased jurisprudent. The nationalistic Sadr movement
is opposed to immigrant Iranian clerics like Sistani assuming
theological authority in Iraq. Yet Muqtada is too young to claim such
authority despite being responsive to popular political passion.

After US troops entered Najaf on April 8, 2003, Sistani was reported
to have made an oral proclamation urging Shi'ites not to resist
invading US forces, a statement eagerly distorted by Wolfowitz as the
"first pro-American fatwa", a legal pronouncement in Islam made by a
mufti, a scholar capable of issuing judgments on Islamic law
(sharia). Later, Wolfowitz' fantasy was shattered when Sistani
proclaimed that Iraq must be ruled "by the best of its children",
which presumably meant Shi'ites.

Sheikh Muhammad al-Fartusi and two other clerics were sent by Sistani
to Baghdad to preach the Friday-prayer sermon at al-Hikma Mosque on
April 21, 2003. The sermon said in part that the United States could
not impose a "democracy" on Iraq that allowed freedom of individual
speech but denied Iraqis the collective right to shape their own
government. When US occupation forces arrested Fartusi, it caused a
public protest of 5,000 Shi'ite followers.

The Sadr movement is made up of poverty-stricken slum dwellers
sizzling with residual anger from having been systematically
brutalized by Ba'ath Party security forces. The militia wing of this
movement is known as the Mehdi Army, estimated as of early 2004 to
consist of about 500-1,000 trained combatants along with another
5,000-6,000 active participants. On April 10, 2003, a US-backed
London-based rival ayatollah, Abd al-Majid al-Khoei, who was working
with US Special Forces, was flown into Najaf from a decade-long exile
in London, and was beaten and stabbed to death by a Sadrist mob that
then surrounded the houses of Sistani and Ayatollah Said al-Hakim,
nephew of Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, leader of the SCIRI, demanding
that these two "foreigners" leave Najaf immediately. The attempted
ecclesiastical coup was thawed only when 1,500 Shi'ite tribesmen came
in from the countryside near Iran to protect Sistani and Hakim.

The return of the Mahdi, the 12th Imam in occultation, is part of
Shi'ite eschatology. Muqtada al-Sadr claims that the United States is
aware of the impending reappearance of the Mahdi, and the US invasion
is an effort to seize and kill the Mahdi. Muqtada's name is chanted
by supporters at rallies to imply that he is the "son of the Mahdi".
Muqtada asserts that the Mehdi Army, unlike other secular militias,
"belongs to the Mahdi", thus it is beyond his authority to disband
it, as required by secular politics.

Muqtada, who is idolized in Sadr City, views fellow Shi'ite Sistani
as morally spineless for failing to adjust his "quietism" even to
resist the profane policies of Saddam's secular Ba'ath Party, as
Sistani is now failing actively to resist crusading US occupation.
Muqtada views expatriate politicians and clerics now returning to
Iraq under US sponsorship in the same light, including Ahmad Chalabi
and members of the secular-leaning Iraqi National Congress (INC),
formed under the tutelage of the CIA to form a postwar puppet regime.
The Sadr movement wants an Islamic republic in Iraq, albeit
independent from Iran, run by patriotic devotees who bravely risked
death to stay in the troubled homeland to keep the resistance going
for decades, not cowards who fled the country to curry favor from
infidel Western imperialism. The Sadr movement also repelled an
attempt to infiltrate Sadr City by the rival Tehran-based Shi'ite
Badr Brigade of the SCIRI.

US occupation plays into Iran strategy
Yet despite all the sectarian divides, one aim unites all Iraqi
Shi'ite clerics: they all want the US out of Iraq soon if not
immediately. This aim conflicts with Iran's tactical objective of
keeping the US tied down in Iraq.

A successful US withdrawal from Iraq would free up military resources
and restore US political will to focus on Iran. On the other hand, a
hopelessly deteriorating quagmire in Iraq may force to US to seek an
alternative path to victory by widening the war with an attack on
Iran, or instigate an internal coup by supporting Iranian dissident
groups. Thus Iran's strategy for Iraq is neither US withdrawal nor
escalation, just a slow bleed to drive home the awareness of
superpower impotency to the whole world.

Ironically, the US views such tactics as supportive of its aim to
stay in Iraq with reduced cost in terms of troop casualties to
realize an impossible dream of a democratic Middle East. As long as
incidents of violence and death decline in number from an
unacceptable peak, the war party in the US can claim progress while
falling into a long-term trap of strategic defeat. It was a trap the
US hawks fell into in Vietnam, in which North Vietnam led the US high
command into deluding itself that it was making statistical progress
from previous low points while marching steadily toward final defeat.

The US has yet to learn that it is not possible for a superpower to
win a local war unless it also wins the peace within 90 days. After
that, "cut and run" is the only sensible strategy. Political
objectives are not automatically served by a rudderless military
victory. Alexander the Great defeated the numerically larger Persian
army but failed to conquer Persia even with the imposition of mixed
marriages between his Greek commanders and women of Persian royalty.
In fact, Persia changed Alexander more than he changed Persia. The
key problem with the US "war on terrorism" is its projected long time
frame. Patriotic adrenaline has a very short life span in a
democracy, particularly in the US political culture, where attention-
deficit syndrome rules.

The SCIRI is an offshoot of the revolutionary Da'wa al-Islamiyya
Party founded in the late 1950s. Baqir al-Hakim was forced abroad to
Tehran in 1982 by Saddam's persecution of key Da'wa figures. The
SCIRI has a paramilitary wing of some 15,000 armed fighters, trained
by Iran's Revolutionary Guards and commanded by Baqir's brother, Abd
al-Aziz al-Hakim, who has succeeded his assassinated brother as head
of the SCIRI. The Hakims are close to Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
successor to Khomeini as Supreme Leader in Iran.

The SCIRI cooperated with the CIA and participated in forming the INC
and was rewarded with 15 of 65 seats on the provisional Governing
Council formed at the Iraqi opposition meetings in London in December
2002, three months before the US invasion of Iraq. Key SCIRI figures
also attended US State Department planning meetings on overthrowing
Saddam, and made press statements about their negotiations with the
office of then secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld about a role for
the Badr Brigade to fight alongside US troops during the invasion.
Since the Bush administration had earlier labeled SCIRI's backers in
Iran as part of the "axis of evil", Rumsfeld's open and ready
willingness to cooperate with the allegedly evil Iran against Iraq, a
former US ally and war enemy of Iran, was mind-boggling in its cynicism.

US apprehension over SCIRI-Iran ties
Beginning in January 2003, belated US apprehension over the danger of
Iranian influence in a "democratic" Iraq caused the Bush
administration to break abruptly with the SCIRI. US National Security
Council official Zalmay Khalilzad coordinated with the office of Vice
President Dick Cheney to dilute SCIRI influence within the puppet
INC, chaired by exiled alleged charlatan bank fraud Ahmad Chalabi,
hailed as the "George Washington of Iraq" by his US neo-con backers,
to the embarrassment of students of US history.

The INC chairman provided much of the fabricated intelligence to
support the US pre-conclusion to invade Iraq, holding himself up as
"the force of democracy" with the help of the media power of the
Washington Post, predicting that US invaders would be welcomed by
liberated Iraqi masses with hugs and flowers. Despite massive US
funding, the INC might have been received in Washington and London as
the enlightened savior of an evil nation, but it had no real
spiritual influence or political followers in Iraq as it was composed
of returned exiles who had been absent from Iraq for decades.

After the collapse of organized Iraqi defense, US forces were greeted
with rocket-propelled grenades and roadside bomb from relentless
insurgent attackers. In the December 2005 Iraqi elections, the INC
failed to win a single seat in Parliament.

In meetings in Turkey with anti-Saddam opposition groups in late
January 2003, less than two months before the invasion, Khalilzad
made known to the INC that the US intended to have Iraq administered
after the "regime change" by a US proconsul, instead of working
through an Iraqi provisional government dominated by Shi'ites, until
an elective regime more to US liking could be devised.

Feeling betrayed by a dramatic anti-Shi'ite turn in US policy, SCIRI
leader Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim immediately denounced the plan of a
postwar US administration as equivalent to a US colonial occupation,
and threatened that the Badr Brigade would attack US troops if they
overstayed their welcome. The US warned Iran not to allow Badr
Brigade forces into Iraq during the US invasion that began on March
20, 2003. Yet by April 17, two weeks before Bush gave his speech in
front of a huge "Mission Accomplished" sign aboard the USS Abraham
Lincoln on May 1, Badr Brigade gunmen gained control of the town of
Baquba near the Iranian border, and the Badr Brigade allowed SCIRI
cleric Sayyid Abbas to occupy the mayor's mansion in Kut. When US
marines attempted to intercede, a crowd of 1,200 townspeople
gathered, chanting slogans against INC leader Chalabi, calling for a
Shi'ite-controlled Islamic state for Iraq, and an end to US occupation.

Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim, deputy head of the SCIRI, returned to Iraq from
Iran on April 16, 2003, arriving at Kut to roaring cheers to prepare
the way for his older brother Baqir's triumphant return. In a press
interview, the younger Hakim pledged that the SCIRI would work with
other parties in the new Iraq. In Kut on April 18, Abd al-Aziz said
in an interview with Iranian television: "We will first opt for a
national political system, but eventually the Iraqi people will seek
an Islamic republic system." He added that the will of Shi'ites for
an Islamic system would prevail in democratic elections, since they
were 60% of the population. In one sentence, he aptly explained why
the US opted for proconsular rule: to prevent Shi'ite control of Iraq.

On the same day, Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, still in Tehran, called on
Shi'ites to converge on the shrine city of Karbala four days later,
on April 22, "to oppose a US-led interim administration and defend
Iraq's independence". SCIRI spokesman Abu Islam al-Saqir said, "To
the Iraqi people, US domination is no better than the dictatorship of
the ousted brutal regime of Saddam Hussein."

US proconsular rule in Iraq
The post of US proconsul, given the benign title of director of
reconstruction and humanitarian assistance for Iraq, was first filled
in late January 2003, two months before the invasion, by retired US
General Jay Garner, who had in 1990-91 had successfully conducted
Gulf War operations in northern Iraq with the cooperation of the
Iraqi Kurds. Garner was president of an arms company that provided
crucial technical support to missile systems vital to the US invasion
of the country. Garner's arms-dealer background caused concerns at
the United Nations and aid agencies already opposed to US
administration of Iraq outside UN authority.

On April 20, 2003, 11 days after Saddam's statue was torn down in
central Baghdad, Garner, already waiting in Kuwait, went to Baghdad
with his small team. Garner was officially relieved by the White
House 16 days later, not for his arms-dealership background, but for
disagreement over who should be allowed to run Iraq. He told
Frontline in an interview last August 11 that he was a lame duck the
day he got to Iraq. Garner wanted early elections, 90 days after the
fall of Baghdad, to produce a new government of local politicians,
not returned expatriates, to run the severely damaged country and
manage its oil assets, while the White House was concerned with
Iranian influence on a democratically elected Shi'ite majority as a
result of the mindless US de-Ba'athization policy.

Garner was replaced on May 6, 2003, by Paul Bremer, State Department
veteran and expert in crisis management. During two weeks of
transition, Garner tried in vain to water down the de-Ba'athization
order from Washington and to reconstitute the disbanded Iraqi army.
Bremer, a hard-driving official by any standard, came to Iraq with
specific orders to purge thoroughly the Ba'ath Party, a position
adamantly insisted upon by Israel-leaning neo-conservatives in the
Bush administration.

Bremer stayed as proconsul for 13 months, until July 28, 2004, and
managed to delay general elections until December 2005, providing
time for the US to try against hope to create a balance of forces in
new Iraqi electoral politics. The result was an anemic Iraqi
government with insufficient mandate to govern effectively, with no
effective police force or nationwide security capability, not even in
the capital itself. The government survives only at the mercy of the
Sadr movement. Bremer, whom critics hold responsible for many of the
problems in Iraq today, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom
by President Bush on December 14, 2004.

Da'wa Party
Despite having sired the SCIRI, the Da'wa al-Islamiyya Party itself
remains a separate organization, with a commitment to Islamic
government. It has London, Tehran and Iraq-based factions, of which
only the London representatives have been willing to talk to US
authorities.

Many in the Iraqi Da'wa Party are loyal to Lebanese Grand Ayatollah
Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, who was born and educated in Najaf and
sought refuge in Lebanon in 1965. Hezbollah in Lebanon, with which
Fadlallah is not directly affiliated, has threatened violence against
US troops in Iraq. Other than its Tehran branch, Da'wa, like the Sadr
movement, is oriented toward indigenous Iraqi politics according to
the theories of Islamic government advocated by the late Muhammad
Baqir al-Sadr.

Even moderate Da'wa leader Ibrahim al-Jaafari refused to cooperate
with the US military administration, boycotting the US-sponsored
leadership meeting near Nasiriyah on April 16, 2003, presided over by
US proconsul General Garner. Da'wa organized a demonstration on April
15 at Nasiriyah to protest, with thousands of demonstrators chanting:
"No, no Saddam! No, no United States!" and "Yes, yes for Freedom!
Yes, Yes for Islam", pitting Saddam against freedom and the US
against Islam. Placards of "No one represents us in the conference"
were clearly seen on television worldwide.

On April 19, Jaafari sent a letter to a meeting of countries
neighboring Iraq, calling for the immediate establishment of a
secular technocratic provisional government, suggesting that Da'wa
was less theocratically oriented than other Shi'ite factions. Among
the Da'wa leaders in Nasiriyah was newly returned former exile
Muhammad Bakr al-Nasri, a prominent cleric, said to be the party's
philosophical guide. Da'wa Party officials were apprehensive that
they would be marginalized politically by the stronger paramilitary
capabilities of the SCIRI and the more aggressive Sadr movement.

Tehran sees a potentially powerful ally among Iraqi Shi'ites, notably
the SCIRI. The late Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim had long advocated an
Islamic republic for Iraq. Many had compared his return to Iraq to
that of Khomeini's return to Iran. If Khomeini could overthrow the
CIA-installed shah in Iran, it would be a cinch for Hakim to topple
the puppet Iraqi provisional government set up by the US. In the days
following the war, the Hakim tribe quickly established itself as the
largest and best-organized faction in the Iraqi Shi'ite majority.

Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim
The rising influence of the Hakim tribe soon caused alarm in
Washington because of its strong links to Iran.

While Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim had repeatedly rejected religious
extremism, he also denounced the notion of any foreign-installed
government ruling Iraq's fractious masses. On his return to Iraq,
Baqir denounced US-led occupation forces and demanded their
withdrawal from Iraq to allow Iraqis to establish their own
government in an Islamic republic. Muhammad Baqir was assassinated on
August 29, 2003, at age 64. Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim, brother of the
assassinated ayatollah, joined the US-backed Iraqi Governing Council,
symbolizing the willingness of some factions of the SCIRI to work
with the US occupation.

Young Shi'ites, many from Baghdad's poor Sadr City slums, are engaged
in a power struggle with the more moderate Shi'ites among the urban
middle class to grab control from both the Hakim tribe and senior
cleric Sistani. Muqtada al-Sadr is among Sistani's most important
rivals in Najaf. Tehran has been heavily engaged in training and
maintaining both the Hakim militia and the Sadr Brigade.

The Iraqi Kurds
The late ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim of the SCIRI had warm
relations with the Kurdish movements in Iraq since his father, grand
ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim, spiritual leader of the Shi'ite world from
1955 until his death in 1970, gave a fatwa forbidding the Iraqi army
to fight against the Kurds in Iraq.

A mutual agreement was signed between the SCIRI and the Kurdish
Democratic Party (KDP) headed by Masood Barzani, which seeks an
independent state for Kurds in northern Iraq. A similar agreement was
signed with the PUK headed by Jalal Talabani, an offshoot of the KDP.
In 1996, the KDP collaborated with Saddam's Iraqi army in an attempt
to destroy the PUK, which was supported by Iran.

In 1992, during a meeting in Vienna, Barzani and Talabani concurred
with the CIA's newly created INC to set up bases in Iraqi Kurdistan
and build a liberation army composed of returned exiled and defector
Iraqis. The Kurdish parties allowed the INC to open an office in
Salahaddin, 32 kilometers north of the Kurdish regional capital
Irbil, and began beaming propaganda radio broadcasts into government-
administered Iraq, gathering intelligence from Iraqi military
deserters and building up the region's own army. The aim was to
establish a new regime in northern Iraq that would dovetail with
Washington's interests in the region.

After the 1991 Gulf War, the US organized no-fly zones in Iraq, north
of the 36th parallel and south of the 32nd parallel. In April 1994,
two US Air Force (USAF) F-15 aircraft, operating in the no-fly zone
to keep Saddam from intervening in the continuing civil war between
the PUK, backed by Iran, and the KDP, backed by Baghdad, shot down
two US Army helicopters after misidentifying them as Iraqi. This
incident, with its high death toll, highlighted dramatically the
complexities in dealing with Iraq in the aftermath of the Gulf War.

In September 1996, the KDP requested help from Saddam, who sent
40,000 troops, demonstrating that he was not deterred by US warning
against using military force in northern Iraq. In an announcement of
incoherent logic, William Perry, US president Bill Clinton's defense
secretary, made clear that while no significant US interests were
involved in the Kurdish factional conflict, maintaining stability in
the region as a whole was vital to US security and there would be a
US reaction. On September 2-3, US aircraft attacked Iraqi fixed
surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites and air-defense control facilities
in the south because, Perry explained, the US saw the principal
threat from Iraq to be against Kuwait.

The Saudis were increasingly unhappy about the suffering of the Iraqi
people after the Gulf War, which made it a fertile ground for
breeding al-Qaeda recruits. They were also unhappy about US military
presence in the Sunni kingdom, the prime cause of al-Qaeda terrorism.
Riyadh declined to allow the USAF to fly strike missions on Iraq from
Saudi bases. Unable to find bases in the region but determined to do
"something" to show Saddam he could not attack the Kurds with
impunity, the US and Britain settled for pushing the northern
boundary of the southern no-fly zone to the 33rd parallel, just south
of Baghdad, and launching 44 cruise missiles at Iraqi air-defense
targets in the newly expanded zone on September 3-4, 1996.

In a Frontline interview by Elizabeth Farnsworth on September 13,
1996, Perry said: "The larger strategic interest [is] the threat that
Iraq poses to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia." Responding to Farnsworth's
query that Iraqi troops were invading in the north, not moving south,
Perry said:
The complication from the political point of view is that they were
invited by the KDP, which is the Kurdish unit in that area. The KDP
is one and the PUK is the other Kurdish faction. They've been
fighting with each other. And the KDP thought that they were going to
be able to gain an advantage with fighting Iraqi troops on their
side. I think that was a strategic blunder on their part. They think
they can manipulate the Iraqis, and they'll find that they're too
powerful and too ruthless to be manipulated. But in any event, they
have made that move, and that has complicated quite a bit the actions
that we could take ...

We do not get involved in the military conflict, and we do not send
the troops in unless we see a vital national interest involved. And
our vital national interest [in Iraq is in] the south, not in the
north ...

I think he [Saddam] has laudable objectives. One of them certainly is
to regain control of northern Iraq, which he has not had for the last
five years. Another one is to assert his military ascendency in the
area to give him a free hand to move into the south either through
coercive power or through actual military - actual military power ...

Our objectives, first of all are protecting our vital strategic
interest, which means protecting our friends and allies in the
region, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia. Secondly, keeping the
free flow of oil from the Gulf, which is a vital national interest to
the United States and indeed to the whole industrial world. Those are
the two primary vital national interests.
Farnsworth then asked: "In attacking Saddam Hussein for doing
something which he says was aimed at countering Iran [which supports
the PUK], are we likely to be seen as helping further Iranian
interests in the Middle East?"

Perry responded: "The PUK has received very limited support from
Iran, including some shelling across the border, including perhaps a
hundred or so trainees in the army. This is correct. And this, I
believe, Saddam Hussein has used as a rationale for doing something
he wanted to do anyway, but there is no comparison between what the
Iranians did in support of the PUK, where there are a hundred or so
trainers versus the 40,000 troops and the 300 tanks which Saddam
Hussein sent in.

"His goal, it seems to me quite clearly, immediate goal, is to regain
control of northern Iraq. And one of the greatest - one of the groups
that will suffer the most in this [is] the KDP, which is the group
that invited him in the first place. But that's a lesson they have
yet to learn."

Perry went to the region in September 1996 to build Kurdish support
for a US-backed strike against Saddam. The plan was opposed by Saudi
Arabia, which saw Saddam as an effective factor in containing Shi'ite
influence, and by Turkey, which did not want to encourage Kurdish
separatism in Turkey.

On September 9, the day after his return home, Perry was again
interviewed by Jim Lehrer of Frontline, who asked that in view of the
fact that the Kuwaitis delayed 24 hours before accepting 3,500 US
troops, and the Saudis saying they never would have allowed such
troops into their country, and the Turks having refused to allow US
planes to fly out of Turkish bases on missions over Iraq, was the
Gulf War coalition falling apart? Perry denied that the coalition was
falling apart, adding that "the message to Saddam Hussein is if you
threaten our vital national-security interests, you will be facing
military action from the United States".

Brian Knowlton of the International Herald Tribune reported on
September 9 from Washington that president Clinton conceded that he
could do little about the fighting in northern Iraq but to implore
the warring Kurdish factions to return to the negotiating table,
since US-supported peace talks had broken down earlier in the summer.

"I would still like to do more to help the Kurds," Clinton was quoted
as saying, "but frankly, if you want the fighting to be ended, the
leaders of the various factions are going to have to be willing to go
back to the peace table and talk it through." He said Washington's
ability to control events in Iraq was "limited".

The US made it clear that it was not prepared to intervene directly
in the fighting, which Perry described as a civil war between Kurds.
Clinton appealed to the two chief Kurdish factions to avoid "any
cavalier killing of civilians and others who are not combatants in
this". He did not say what aid might be provided to members of the US-
backed opposition group that was now on the run.

The Iraqi military's capture of Arbil smashed the CIA-financed
operation intended to destabilize the government of Saddam Hussein,
trapped 200 members of the INC there, and led to the execution of
opponents of Saddam.

Former Saddam-era deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz, brought before
the Iraqi High Tribunal to testify against six defendants accused of
genocide in the 1988 campaign against Iraqi Kurds that included the
use of poison gas, instead denied that the Saddam Hussein government
had carried out any such attacks. Aziz insisted that Iraq did not
have the chemical weapons necessary for the alleged gas attacks that
killed 5,600 Kurds in northern Iraq, instead fingering Iran and the
PUK as the culprits.

Tehran was known to have been continually supporting the PUK, whose
founder and secretary general, Jalal Talabani, was elected president
of Iraq on April 6, 2005. The formerly Iran-based SCIRI found it
expedient to compromise with an emerging Iran-supported Kurdish
leadership to strengthen its hand in the post-Saddam power structure.

US befriends Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim
Last December 4 Bush, under pressure to calm sectarian violence in
Iraq, met with the head of SCIRI, Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim, for the
second time and applauded his "commitment to a unity government" for
Iraq.

The president said: "Part of unifying Iraq is for the elected leaders
and society leaders to reject the extremists that are trying to stop
the advance of this young democracy. I appreciated very much his ...
strong position against the murder of innocent life." Bush added:
"This is a man whose family suffered unbelievable violence at the
hands of the dictator, Saddam Hussein. He lost nearly 60 family
members, and yet rather than being bitter, he's involved with helping
the new government succeed." What Bush did not say was that many of
the killings were carried out with US approval.

At the end of the 1991 Gulf War, president George H W Bush urged
Iraqis to topple the Ba'ath regime, but the US did not back the
Shi'ite uprising that ensued in southern Iraq. Fear of Iranian
influence over Iraqi Shi'ites through the SCIRI was a decisive factor
in the US decision not to support the uprising.

In the December 2005 elections, Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim emerged as the
head of the Unified Iraqi Coalition (UIC) that won 128 of 275 seats
in the Council of Representatives. The UIC includes the Islamic Da'wa
Party, the Islamic Virtue Party, the Centrist Coalition Party, the
Badr Organization, the SCIRI, the Turkmen Islamic Union of Iraq, the
Justice and Equality Assembly, the Iraqi Democratic Movement, the
Movement of Hezbollah in Iraq, the Turkmen Loyalty Movement, the Saed
Al Shuhada Islamic Movement, Al Shabak Democratic Gathering, the
Malhan Al Mkoter-Mr, the Islamic Da'wa Party-Iraq Organization, the
Reform and Building Meeting, Al Sadriah Advertising, the Justice
Community, and the Iraq Ahrar.

As head of both the UIC and SCIRI, Hakim went to Tehran on February 5
to meet with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and
Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani. Iranian
agencies reported that Khamenei told Hakim that Iranian policy is "to
support the Iraqi government", and the unity of all Iraqis will
remove the need for the continued presence in Iraq of foreign troops.

"The presence of occupiers ... is one of the main reasons for
insecurity in Iraq," Khamenei said.

Hakim said after meeting with Larijani that Iran-US talks on Iraq
"are undoubtedly very important and Iraqi authorities want this".
Islamic Republic News Agency reported him saying that "political
haggling [between Iran and the US] will benefit the entire region".
Hakim said Iraqi authorities are engaged in "very extensive activity"
to assure the release of Iranian diplomats arrested by US forces in
Irbil on January 11. He also met with Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mahmud Hashemi-Shahrudi, who said: "The Americans must release
Iranian diplomats as soon as possible without any excuses."

Ibrahim al-Jaafari - pro-Iran prime minister of Iraq
On April 7, 2005, the Iraqi National Assembly appointed Ibrahim al-
Jaafari Iraq's first full-term postwar prime minister.

Iraq's new interim government had been trumpeted by the Bush
administration as a close friend and a model for democracy in the
region. In contrast, Bush had called Iran part of an "axis of evil"
and dismissed its elections as frauds and its government as
illegitimate. So the US administration was less than pleased when the
first Iraqi prime minister, Jaafari, before he was replaced by Nuri
Kamel Mohammed Hassan al-Maliki, deputy leader of the Islamic Da'wa
Party and deputy leader of the De-Ba'athification Commission of the
Iraqi Interim Government, led eight high-powered cabinet ministers to
pay a visibly friendly visit to Tehran in July 2005. Upon arrival in
Tehran on a Saturday, Jaafari visited the mausoleum of the founder of
the Islamic Republic, the late Imam Khomeini and paid tribute to him
by laying a wreath on his tomb. On the following Monday, Jaafari and
his delegation met with the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution,
Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei.

Jaafari's July 2005 visit to Iran was a blow to the Bush
administration's strategic vision, but a sweet triumph for Shi'ite
theocracy. In the dark days of 1982, Tehran was asylum of choice for
Iraqi Shi'ite expatriates who had been forced to flee Saddam
Hussein's death decree against them to a country with which Iraq was
then at war. Ayatollah Khomeini, the newly installed theocrat of
Iran, pressured the Iraqi expatriates to form an umbrella
organization, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq
(SCIRI), which he hoped would eventually take over Iraq. Among its
members were Jaafari and Hakim. On January 30, 2005, Khomeini's
vision became reality, courtesy of the Bush administration, when the
Supreme Council and the Da'wa Party won the Iraqi elections.

Jaafari, a Da'wa Party leader working for an Islamic republic in
Iraq, had been in exile in Tehran from 1980 to 1989. A physician
trained at Mosul, the reserved and hesitant Jaafari, studied Shi'ite
law and theology as an auditor at the seminaries of Qom. His party,
Da'wa, was the home of the SCIRI but in 1984 split with it to
maintain its autonomy.

Although neo-conservatives such as Paul Wolfowitz maintained before
the Iraq war that Iraqis are more secular and less interested in an
Islamic state than Iranians, in fact the theocratic ideas of Khomeini
of Iran had had a deep impact among Iraqi Shi'ites. In the December
2005 elections, Iraqi Shi'ites put the Khomeini-influenced SCIRI in
control of seven of the nine southern provinces, along with Baghdad
itself.

Jaafari's government did not control the center-north or west of the
country and could not pump oil from Kirkuk because of Sunni sabotage.
The Rumaila oilfield in the south lacks refining capability. Iraq
does not have a deepwater port on the Persian Gulf and needs to
replace inland "ports" such as Amman because of poor security. An
initiative toward the east could resolve many of these problems,
strengthening the Shi'ites against the Sunni guerrillas economically
and militarily and so saving the new government.

Iran-Iraq relations had not been good since the mid-1950s when Iraq
was ruled by a British-installed constitutional monarchy with a
fanatically pro-West, anti-communist prime minister in the person of
Nuri al-Said. The CIA had put Mohammad Reza Shah back on the throne
in 1953, deposing the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad
Mossadegh, who had angered the US when he nationalized the Iranian
oil industry.

Ironically, when the shah came to power, he kept Iranian oil
nationalized, using oil revenue to solidify his own power. In 1955,
Said and the shah both signed on enthusiastically to the anti-
communist Baghdad Pact, a US-sponsored collective security agreement
against the Soviet Union and Arab nationalist Gamal Abdel Nasser of
Egypt. Nationalist reaction against the pact led to a secular
populist revolution that overthrew the Iraqi monarchy in 1958, with
Said's corpse dragged in the street by angry mobs. Iraq eventually
came under the control of the pan-Arabic Ba'ath Party.

Another populist revolution overthrew the shah of Iran in 1979,
installing a theocratic government led by Khomeini. Iran-Iraq
relations reached their nadir, as Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party and
Khomeini's Revolutionary Guards fought to a stalemate in horrible war
not seen since World War I. Jaafari's 2005 visit was partly designed
to erase the bitter legacies of that war.

Iraq's Eastern Policy has religious overtones. Upon arrival in Iran
on a Saturday, Jaafari immediately made a ceremonial visit to, and
laid a wreath at, the tomb of ayatollah Khomeini. In a meeting with
Ali Khamenei on the following Monday, Tehran Times reported, Jaafari
"called the late Imam Khomeini the key to the victory of the Islamic
Revolution", adding, "We hope to eliminate the dark pages Saddam
caused in Iran-Iraq ties and open a new chapter in brotherly ties
between the two nations."

Iran generously rewarded Jaafari by offering to pay for three
pipelines that would stretch across the southern border of the two
countries. Under the deal, Iraq would ship 150,000 barrels a day of
light crude to Iran to be refined, and Iran would ship back processed
petroleum, kerosene and gasoline.

In addition, Iran agreed to supply electricity to Iraq, sell it
200,000 tons of wheat and allow the use of Iranian ports to transship
goods to Iraq, plus $1 billion in foreign aid. All this generosity
looked to Washington like influence-peddling.

Khamenei called for the preservation of the territorial integrity of
Iraq and stepping up cooperation in policing the borders of the two
countries. The previous week, Iraqi Defense Minister Saadoun Dulaimi
had made a preparatory trip to Tehran, exploring the possibility of
military cooperation between the two countries. At one point the two
had appeared to have reached an agreement that Iran would help train
Iraqi troops which immediately sent the neo-cons in Washington going
ballistic.

Immediate enormous pressure was applied on Jaafari to back off this
plan. The Iraqi government abandoned it, on the grounds that an
international agreement had already specified that out-of-country
training of Iraqi troops in the region should be done in Jordan. But
the Iraqi government did give Tehran assurances that it would not
allow Iraqi territory to be used in any attack on Iran, without
mentioning that the only likely attacker was the US.

Iranian leaders pressed Jaafari on the continued presence in Iraq of
the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian terrorist organization with
ties to the Pentagon, the Israeli lobby, and hawks in the US
Congress. The Hussein regime had used the MEK to destabilize Iran.
Jaafari promised that the MEK had been disarmed and would not be
allowed to conduct terrorist raids from Iraqi soil.

Iraqi Sunnis resist Iranian influence
The warming relations between Tehran and Baghdad greatly alarms
Iraq's Sunni Muslims. They know that Iranian offers of help in
training Iraqi security officers, and Iranian professions of support
for a united, peaceful Iraq are code for the suppression by Shi'ite
troops and militias of the Sunni Arab guerrilla movement.

Many Iraqi Sunnis believe that the Sunni Arabs are the true
indigenous majority, but that millions of illegal Iranian emigrants
masquerading as Iraqi Shi'ites have flooded into the country, skewing
vote totals in the recent elections. This belief makes them
especially suspicious of Shi'ite politicians cozying up to the
ayatollahs in Tehran. A recent British Broadcasting Corp documentary
reported that the Sunnis of Fallujah despise Iraqi Shi'ites even more
than they do the US mercenaries, in part because they view them as
Persians. A recent CNN report detailed the ongoing struggle between
the CIA and the new Shi'ite-run Iraqi intelligence units for control
of the Iraqi security apparatus.

US faces political defeat by Iran
Although the US maintains a facade of welcoming good relations
between Iraq and Iran, the State Department, the Central Intelligence
Agency, and hawks in the Bush White House all hold deep grudges
against the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is their prime target for
regime change and transformation. The fiasco of the Iraq war renders
the option of toppling the ayatollahs an impossible dream.

Iran is well positioned to score geopolitical advantage in Iraqi
politics, buoyed by high petroleum profits. Tehran's long alliance
with Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, now president of Iraq, gives Iran
Kurdish support. Bush has removed from power Iran's most powerful and
dangerous regional enemy in the person of Saddam Hussein, and the
secular, pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, something Iran was unable to do
even after eight years of bloody war, with the result that Shi'ites
came to power through elections in Iraq, giving Iran a firm ally that
will enhance its reach into the Middle East through Hezbollah, its
other ally Lebanon. By invading Iraq, the US faces geopolitical
defeat not only in Iraq, but in Iran and Lebanon as well.

At the end of the Cold War, neo-conservatives advocated the use of
overwhelming military superpower to spread democracy around the
world. In 1992, Paul Wolfowitz prepared a Defense Policy Guidance
Document that called for the use of US forces in a preemptive and, if
necessary, unilateral approach to achieve a "new American century".
Presidents George H W Bush and Bill Clinton adopted instead the
traditional, pragmatic strategy of containment toward Iraq.

In 1996, Richard Perle, Douglas Feith and others of the Institute for
Advanced Strategic and Political Studies argued forcefully for the
removal of Saddam by force. In 1998, the Project for a New American
Century (PNAC), chaired by William Kristol, sent a letter to
president Clinton again asking him to remove Saddam by force. The
letter was signed by 18 individuals, including Donald Rumsfeld,
Perle, Elliott Abrams, Richard Armitage, John Bolton, Wolfowitz, and
others who later became the primary advisers to President George W Bush.

In the 1990 January/February issue of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza
Rice stated that a Republican foreign policy would "mobilize whatever
resources necessary" to remove Saddam. In September 2000, the PNAC
put forth a document called "Rebuilding American Defenses: Strategy,
Forces and Resources for a New Century". This document serves as the
basis for the post-September 2001 foreign policy of President Bush.

Nine days after the events of September 11, 2001, the PNAC sent a
letter to Bush urging him "to remove Saddam Hussein from power" as a
part of any war on terrorism. It is the height of irony that the "New
American Century" heralds the triumph of radical Islamic theocracy in
the Middle East.

Nuri al-Maliki - new Iraqi prime minister
In the December 2005 parliamentary elections, the UIC plurality
nominated Jaafari as prime minister, but opposition from minority
Sunni and Kurdish factions prevented him from forming a coalition
government. On April 22, 2006, President Jalal Talabani, Kurdish
leader of the PUK, who himself had been elected president on April 7,
2005, by the newly elected National Assembly, removed Jaafari and
replaced him with Nuri Kamel Mohammed Hassan al-Maliki.

The ongoing quagmire in Iraq has foreclosed the ability of Bush
administration hawks to carry out their long-held dream of executing
a regime change in Iran, or even of forcing it to end its nuclear
ambitions. To the Iranian leadership, the lesson of Iraq was not that
it had nuclear ambitions, but that it did not actually have nuclear
capability, which would have provided an effective deterrent against
US attack.

Of the three governments of Bush's "axis of evil", Baghdad
represented "one down, two to go". Yet the whole world can see that
US approach to Pyongyang abruptly changed from dictatorial
intransigence to flexible negotiation after the North Korean nuclear
test. The US is in no position to invade Iran with ground troops both
because of an already overtaxed army and depleted political capital
to absorb high battle casualties. More critically, the US now needs
the help of Iran to disengage from a guerrilla war that it cannot win
and from which it cannot run. The price of imposing democracy in Iraq
may well be an Islamic republic of Iraq with a special relationship
with Iran, similar to the way the US and the UK are bound by a
special relationship cemented by two world wars.

US officials announced in late February that they had agreed to hold
the highest-level contact with the Iranian authorities in more than
two years as part of an international meeting on Iraq. The second of
these discussions, scheduled for early April, is expected to include
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her Iranian and Syrian
counterparts. The first meeting took place in Baghdad this month.

The announcement from Baghdad and confirmed by Washington that the US
would take part in two sets of meetings among Iraq and its neighbors,
including Syria and Iran, was a shift in Bush's avoidance of high-
level contacts with the governments in Damascus and Tehran as a
principle of "moral clarity". Last December, the Iraq Study Group, a
high-level bipartisan commission, had urged direct, unconditional
talks with Iran and Syria, which Bush immediately rejected and
instead embarked on the more confrontational approach.

"I would note that the Iraqi government has invited Syria and Iran to
attend both of these regional meetings," Rice told a Senate panel on
February 27, in discussing the talks, which were to include Britain,
Russia, and a host of international organizations and Middle Eastern
countries.

Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari called anticipated US face-to-
face contact with Iran and Syria, two countries that the Bush
administration has accused of destabilizing Iraq, "very significant",
adding, "Iraq is becoming a divisive issue in the region. Iraq can be
helpful to its neighbors also. It can provide a platform for them to
work out their differences."

Separating Iran nuclear issue from Iraq issue
Bush administration officials characterize as a separate issue from
Iraq Iran's nuclear program, which Washington insists is aimed at
developing nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran denies.

Cheney said in February that "all options are still on the table" for
Washington to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, a comment
that heightened concern that the administration was considering
attacking Iran's nuclear sites. One senior US administration official
was reported to have said that while some Bush officials have
advocated looking for ways to talk to Iran and Syria, they did not
want to appear to be talking to either country from a position of
weakness. By ratcheting up the confrontational talk, the
administration official said, the US was in more of a driver's seat.

"We became convinced that the Iranians were not taking us seriously,"
said Philip D Zelikow, who until December was the top aide to Rice.
"So we've done some things to get them to take us seriously, so now
we can try diplomacy."

Yet this appears to be for US domestic consumption, where tough talk
is part of the US macho culture. Most professional diplomats from
participating governments scheduled to attend the March and April
meetings know that the US is in fact coming to the talks from a
position of weakness because the record of US superpower behavior
since the end of the Cold War has always been no talks except as a
last resort.

The ill-fated US adventure in Iraq has made Iran a clear winner.
Iraqi Shi'ite leaders know they need Iranian support to contain the
Sunni insurgents and to restore Iraq's shattered economy. The US has
failed to achieve either of these basic objectives of stability after
more than three years of occupation primarily because being self-
absorbed with its own superior "moral values" prevents it from
acquiring any real understanding of the political dynamics and
sectarian culture of the region to be an effective player in the game.

The Iraq fiasco shows that the age of superpower hegemony and
invincibility is over. The 21st century is an age when a few thousand
insurgents with a clear purpose backed by handfuls of AK-47s and
grenade launchers can defeat by attrition a superior occupying army
with unmatched and high-tech killing power. The flaw of the US
strategy of regime change is that the new regime can be more
problematic than the one it replaces.
