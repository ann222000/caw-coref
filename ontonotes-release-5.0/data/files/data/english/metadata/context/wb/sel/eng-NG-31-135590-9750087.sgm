Hello,
I'm lost.
Can some one go to the following site and click on the right-hand menu
option named, Geneology.
It is a Javascript link and will NOT do anything when my friend (who
is running Vista) clicks on it.

http://home.ptd.net/~ajs10

I'm not a Vista users and am not sure what I need to do to get it to
function under his Operating System.
Can you tell me if it functions for you Vista folks and, if so, what
settings I have tell my friend to make on his system (and or Browser -
IE7) to get it to work.
Thank you.

Doesn't do anything for me either, I use Firefox with the NoScript add-

There are a number of reasons why it may not work, the obvious being
that javascript is disabled (IE calls it &quot;active scripting&quot; which bars
all scripts, not just javascript).

It may also be because you have HTML comment delimiters in your script
element.  Browsers will tolerate an opening &lt;!-- as the very first non-
whitespace characters in a script element, but not later.

But there is absolutely no reason to use them at all, particularly if
you think you are using XHTML.  Remove *all* HTML comment delimiters
from your script.  It is also a good idea to put all script resources
in an external file.

I'd also suggest that you change the link from:

&lt;A HREF=&quot;javascript:Check()&quot;&gt;Geneology&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

to:

&lt;a href=&quot;usefulPage.html&quot; onclick=&quot;return Check();&quot;&gt;Geneology&lt;/a&gt;

The Check() function should probably always return false.  Users with
javascript disabled will go to the usefulPage.html, which should have
advice that javascript must be enabled and maybe how to do it.

Incidentally, your DOCTYPE is XHTML 1.0 Strict, yet:

1. Your page isn't valid XHTML 1.0

2. You are serving it as text/HTML, which is just as well
given 1. above

3. IE doesn't understand XML, so even if you fix 1 and 2,
about 70% of visitors won't be able to user your site

Thanks Rob.
Lots of good suggestions.
I've gotten it to work by lowering the Security setting in IE7.
Basically set it up the way I've used XP for many years.
As for the code, well....yeah!
I threw it together but I should have known better than to use such a
mess for a test!
I've already cleaned it up some.
Thanks again.

NoScript lets me select which sites can run scripts - urchintracker,

One of the reasons might be, that one doesn't want his surfing behaviour
being stored and analyzed by third parties. Or one doesn't want annoying
advertisments hiding the traces of useful information on webpages.

Makes sense. I think I might install it, although I'd set it to allow
scripting by default, and only disable it on specific sites.

The analyzing by third parties is a bit &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; if you ask
me. Nobody's doing any analyzing out there. The only thing the ad
companies do is track anonymous statistical data. They want to know the
percentage of visitors that click on their ad. Or if you end up buying
something because you clicked on an ad, they'd like to know which site
was hosting the ad (so that they can figure out which were the best
places to advertise). This whole paranoia about being tracked is a bit
ridiculous if you ask me.

As for blocking ads, if we all did that then those websites we love to
visit (Yahoo, Facebook, Myspace, Youtube, MSN, etc etc) would either (a)
cease to exist, or (b) start charging us to use the sites.

The only reason the web made it to popularity beyond what it was in 1994
is because sites like Yahoo figured out they could put advertising on
the page. If they hadn't figured that out, we'd still be finding the web
a very boring place and Usenet would be the biggest traffic driver on
the Internet. Notice how all the major porn sites charge $$$ to see the
content? That's because they find it hard to get advertisers who want to
be associated with them. The ones that are free are the ones that use
advertising, and the ads are for the other porn sites which aren't free.

I sound like I work for an ad company, but no, I just understand the
economics of the web and wrote a paper on it, so had to do some
research. I spoke to some of the web advertisers and they told me
they're not interested in individuals, they just want statistical data
that helps them put their ads in the right places to make them more
effective.

Sure. That's why amazon bombs you with recommendations, and Google Ads
sometimes seem - though out of context with the visited page - somehow
match your interests. And if you use Google Ads, Google will tell you,
when you abuse the system by clicking on ads too often. And these are
just &quot;visible&quot; observations.

No need for (b), since there are enough gullible people (like you, I
might add) out there. One might ask, why big companies are interested in
paying billions for shares of one of the mentioned websites. Just
because of showing ads? Or showing ads tailored to your interests? Then,
where does this data come from? Have you ever read all the terms of use
of those websites?
But then: People turning their inside out on pages like myspace or
facebook will hardly be concerned by cookies tracking their behavior.

And how do those ads get in the right place? They are of course

How silly of me to think that I could have a contrary opinion and debate
a subject intelligently on here without being attacked.

I don't see how not wanting to be spammed by spammer scum who troll
forums and newsgroups for email addresses can be compared to, or has
anything at all to do with, not believing the conspiracy theory that all
advertising on the web is secretly spying on you and compiling personal
data about you. It's also hardly an offensive opinion to think that
without all that web advertising we'd be stuck in the mid 90's with our
web content.

So how is that opinion connected to my not wanting to publicly announce
my real name and real email address on a public searchable forum for all
spammers to see and add to their spam list? I already get enough spam,
don't we all, and see no reason to add to it.

You can, you just can't do it with Thomas. I think you replied to the
wrong person, as your problem is with Thomas. My email address that I
post with is worthless to anybody. You can't email me on it. Well, you
can if you use AOL to send it. The only reason it is even open to AOL
email is because of a mailing list I was on and it came from an AOL
member. I am not on that list anymore and I never get on AOL to check
that email so it isn't a big issue.

Most people that complain about munged addresses fall into one of three
categories:

1) Spammers
2) People who want something to whine about
3) People who want to reply outside a public view so there opinion
isn't open to be corrected, debated or contradicted.

Sometimes, Thomas makes me wonder if he is a member of all three groups.

Giganews and Comcast both actively encourage address munging as an
anti-spam measure.

Maybe you should try finding a document that isn't 9 years old to back
up an antiquated claim. The only person around here that complains about
email addresses on a regular basis is you. No, I don't think you fall
into category 4, category 2 &amp;3 have been proven to be true in the past,
and possibly category 1, but not category 4.

If category 4 was you, you would complain about mine as well since you
can't email it. I have asked you in the past what the difference was and
you have never answered me, that I can recall or find.

&quot;Oh, but it is a valid mailbox&quot;... Bah humbug.

The best way to defeat spam is not to receive it, period. The best way
to not receive it is to not give out the address. The email address in
the FAQ gets 30 spams a day. The comcast address that is not listed
anywhere gets, maybe, 1 a month.

On a technical group, you should be prepared to use your normal name,
the one you would expect to be introduced by in civil life.

You should also enable a normal person to E-mail you.

There is, contrary to the brutalist view, no need to put your own E-mail
address in a form convenient to spammers (though it's some while since
I've seen a significant amount of spam aimed at a recently-used Reply-To
address).

But any address that you publish should be one that you have a right, or
permission, to use,  whether to receive mail or as a spam-dump.

You should not use any other address that might belong to anyone else,
currently or in the future; that is wildly inconsiderate, and contrary
to the policy of the better ISPs.  Neither should you use a domain
without authority to do so; domain owners may not want to handle your
spam.

&quot;spam-me.com&quot; exists, though it is in need of renewal - therefore, even
if you have permission to use it, that may not last.  You could consider
buying it.

Remember not to argue with the local sociological defective; it is a
waste of public resources.  A single refutation suffices.

Very true.  May I remind you on this occasion, though, that although it is
not an address in the aforementioned sense, that applies to message IDs as
well.  The message ID should be unique over a reasonably long period of time
(recommended are two years, see [son-of-]RFC 1036, section 2.1.5/5.3).
Clearly that can only have a chance of being accomplished if the Message-ID
header has a domain part with a domain name that you own or that the owner
of the news server (which has to set the header if not already present)
owns; the use of the `invalid' TLD for that purpose is inappropriate, too,
as that TLD belongs to both no-one and everyone, and is intended for local
testing purposes and documentation examples only (see RFC 2606, section 2).

&gt;&gt; It may also be because you have HTML comment delimiters in your script

&gt;&gt; But there is absolutely no reason to use them at all, particularly if
&gt;&gt; you think you are using XHTML.  Remove *all* HTML comment delimiters
&gt;&gt; from your script.  It is also a good idea to put all script resources
&gt;&gt; in an external file.

&gt; I'm interested in this bit - I tend to comment freely so what is the
&gt; now-accepted way to add comments?
">

It was *never* accepted coding style to use markup comments as script
comments.  As Rob has pointed out, you have been relying on a proprietary
feature which has never been safe on the Web.  (In case you wonder, examples
in specifications are never normative.)

Since there is no working user agent that requires those pseudo-comments in
order to prevent the code from being displayed (in a nutshell: UAs should
never display `head' element content as if it were in the document body in
the first place; HTML 3.2 standardized the `script' element, and HTML 2.0
was marked obsolete; in HTML, the content model of the `script' element is
CDATA, not PCDATA), and they can do harm (it's a non-standard feature of UAs
or script engines to ignore them; in XHTML, the content model of the
`script' element is PCDATA, not CDATA), you can safely remove them in old
*HTML* documents and omit them in new ones.

As for XHTML, there is only one possibility of a comment requirement within
the `script' element content, and that is if you want to serve so-called
HTML-compatible XHTML as text/html to UAs that don't support XHTML, and as
application/xhtml+xml to UAs that do (that would be relying on
error-correction, though, which in itself is error-prone), and your script
code contains one or more of `&lt;', `&gt;', and `&amp;':

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
// &lt;![CDATA[

// script code goes here

// ]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

However, as Rob also has pointed out, the alternative is to refer to
external script resources.  While that is recommended by the W3C (XHTML 1.0
Appendix C, section 4), I don't think it should be considered a general
recommendation.  Another script resource not only separates script code and
the elements it is working on, which complicates maintenance, but also
requires another HTTP connection which is overkill, if it is only a small
script (for fitting values of &quot;small&quot;).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I also wonder why you feel it is a bad idea to serve XHTML as HTML.
">

See for example:
http://www.spartanicus.utvinternet.ie/no-xhtml.htm
http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml

However, note that the necessity to use `&lt;!--//--&gt;&lt;![CDATA[//&gt;&lt;!--' and
`//--&gt;&lt;!]]&gt;' that Ian mentions is based on the assumption that there were
working user agents out there that would not support the `script' element.
But as I have pointed out before and on numerous other occasions, that
notion is outdated now as it already was when this advisory was created/
last modified.  I consider pointing that out to Ian via private e-mail.

Moreover, you did not, it seems, consider the definition, immediately

You should also consider, above that, the definition of &quot;authoring

&gt; To be honest, that site only confirms that serving it as HTML is the

XHTML can *not* be &quot;served as HTML&quot;; despite all (misguided) efforts of
XHTML 1.0 Appendix C, the two markup languages are inherently incompatible.
(The final opportunity I saw for making them compatible was busted shortly
ago when someone pointed out to me that elements with empty content model
MUST NOT have end tags in HTML.)  Incidentally, XHTML Basic/1.1 and
XHTML+MathML SHOULD NOT be served as text/html; I think, I would hope, that
a lesson had been learned there.

The results only confirm that there are many user agents out there that
*may* have sufficient error-correction to display XHTML *1.0* documents
properly in that case anyway.  However, I seriously doubt this is a Good
Thing in the long-term.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but I would love to see an alternative provided it actually works!

Here it comes: HTML 4.01.  As the advisories point out, as UAs do not look
at the DOCTYPE declaration, when serving XHTML as text/html you lose all
benefits that XHTML has to offer, and even gain disadvantages as compared to
properly served markup.

The point of my advice was not for you to use Google Groups (for posting)

DejaNews archive) would probably provide more material for research.  And
JFTR: That is actually one of the small number of benefits over conventional
Usenet access that makes me not to dismiss it entirely.  In that sense, I
have to disagree with your setting the X-No-Archive header: It does not hurt
Google at all, it hurts people who want to do extensive Usenet research but
can't afford to have their own Usenet archive.  Solutions you may provide in
your postings will hardly be found.

It *seems* to work.  Jumping to conclusions is the main problem with this
approach.  Some tests in a handful of user agents (if that was even done)
mean nothing.

&gt; &gt; (The final opportunity I saw for making them compatible was busted
&gt; &gt; shortly ago when someone pointed out to me that elements with empty
&gt; &gt; content model MUST NOT have end tags in HTML.)

&gt; True - and this would most certainly prevent HTML being served as
&gt; XHTML. However, serving XHTML as HTML appears to work fine with empty
&gt; content model tags that do have a closing tag.

As I said, that relies on *erroneous* *error-correction*.  `&lt;br /&gt;' equals
`&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;' in HTML.

&gt; I really do get puzzled by this issue and would very much like it to
&gt; be resolved - as I am sure we all do! It really is time we either had
&gt; a working version of XHTML that genuinely works *or* a decent update
&gt; of HTML 4.x that addresses the issues relevant to modern web pages.

Agreed.  For example, I would not mind if this particular SHORTTAG feature
was explicitly disabled in the next revision of HTML 4.01.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Here it comes: HTML 4.01.  As the advisories point out, as UAs do not look
&gt;&gt; at the DOCTYPE declaration, when serving XHTML as text/html you lose all
&gt;&gt; benefits that XHTML has to offer, and even gain disadvantages as compared to
&gt;&gt; properly served markup.

&gt; I absolutely agree - though I use XHTML for development reasons rather
&gt; than anything else. It is simply easier to correct and validate.
">

I doubt that.  For example, Eclipse WST have a decent HTML editor that allow
you to build the document just by clicking, and show you almost instantly
where your markup is invalid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Like yourself though, I admit that nine times out of ten I will start a
&gt; page by coding it in HTML 4.01 and convert to XHTML later - and often
&gt; back again to HTML 4.01 before I put the page live.
">

But I don't do that, it would be quite foolish.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Really, that's the reason I'd love to see the current shambles sorted out.
">

There really are no shambles once you made the informed design decision to
use every language where it is fitted for best.  For me, XHTML does not come
in before I'm building a XHTML-specific test case, use MathML client-side,
or develop on Plone (my job requires that).  Even SVG is no sufficient
reason to use XHTML, as SVG can be included as external resource in HTML
documents with the `object' element.
