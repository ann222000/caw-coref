Been not good PUG wise in recent days, whats the stranger things which
has happened in instances which you didn't put up with, or stuck with
and watched the wipes happen?

One run of ZF, a rogue:

Pick pocketed all mobs before the sap. Tank told him to stop. He got
mouthy. Tank left.

Unluckily rogue continued. He seemed to think his role was to solo/
tank a mob, and started shouting HEALME lots, and running out of Line
of Sight, losing the heal and dying. On being told he was a shit
rogue, he told me I should learn to play a rogue (being a 45 priest).
When told I have a 70 rogue, he seemed to think I didn't. At that
point I left...

Tank comes in Mechanar, and starts pulling mobs. Then pulling mobs.
Ok, so due to my mistake, growl  was on on the hunter, so I had to rez
it twice before noticing. But I was out of mana, as was the Warlock
beside me, but this guy kept on pulling before we could mana up....
Still pulling mobs.On asking him to stop, he said that we had
obviously not done raids. Well, yes. But on raids, there is redundancy
of on DMG providers on trash... So walked.

Rogues are not always the worse, I seem to have trouble with paladins
and the concept of a single tank too.... Yet demanding heals when they
steal the aggro from the tank...

Any other tales... I have heard friends leave pugs when the immortal
phrase is said:

&quot;Man, I am so drunk right now&quot;

So what was the big deal with him pick pocketing before sapping?  As
long as hes not getting caught then let him do his thing I say.
Unless he was taking the time to pick pocket every single mob in a
pull before sapping, then hes just severely slowing down the group.
And as for trying to solo mobs in an instance, you shoud have just
booted him and replaced him instead of quitting the group.  Unless of
course, he was the group leader, then you're screwed.

I like when the tank moves, but he definantly should have waited and
let people who needed mana catch up.  I've been in groups where the
tank would not move on to the next pull unless everyone was at full
health and mana.  And I mean every pull.  As a warlock, I don't drink
often.  If I am above 50% I don't even bother unless we are about to
pull a boss.  As a result, I don't carry around much water.  I buy a
stack and it lasts me for weeks.  But this warrior would just not move
until I had mana.  Dark pact FTW.  I tanked WC with my druid this past
weekend.  First time tanking for a group.  Only 1 death at the very
end.  WC really isn't all that hard though.  But after every pull I
looked at health and mana bars, waited to see if anyone stopped to
drink, then moved on.  We steamrolled that instance.

I don't like quitting groups.  I prefer to replace people holding the
group back.  I almost quit 1 group because of another warlock in the
group that didn't understand the concept of seduce a target but don't
attack it or seduce will break.  He spent half the instance dotting
the target I was seducing, and the other half dotting the target he
was supposed to seduce.  We had a tank who spent the whole time
whining that there was no CC because the warlocks sucked, nevermind
the fact that I spent all my time trying to reapply the seduce broken
by his paladin AoE or the other warlocks dots.

My main is a rogue. IMHO, the rogues main job is DPS beside the tank.
Crowd control is a secondary function for the rogue. Usually I have
this worked out with the healers before combat starts:
1 - main healer concentrate on the tank
2 - If there is a secondary healer, secondary can throw a heal on me
IF they have mana to spare. Again the tank comes first.
3 - Any healer that gets aggro, call for help and I'll take care of
it. Healers should feel free to heal me when I'm saving their silly
butts....

usually in instances we are using some kind of voice comms, (Skype,
Ventrilo, etc) so communication is quick.

Rogue can always pop smoke and disengage if needed (subject to
cooldown, of course). I always carry plenty of food and bandages to
keep my health up between fights. The rogue is probably the most
expendable member of the group. If the tank dies, group is likely to
wipe. If the healers die, group is likely to wipe. If the rogue
dies....eh......
If a rogue seems to be spending time doing pickpockets, ask
why...could be he's low on flash and blinding powder and scavenging
for more.....

Sorry, got confused, thought your rogue was 70 and your priest 45?

In any case, so long as the tank is not dying, why was there a problem? A
knowledgeable tank with decent gear really helps to move an instance along.
The tank needs to build up his rage anyway, so when he grabs the mobs and
sunders (if a warrior) you can be drinking away.

Stealing aggro from the tank is not that difficult, think of all the times
you have been attacked just for healing! True tanks are better at taking
damage than giving it. While most tank classes have some means of grabbing
aggro back, it is perfectly normal for dps classes to get whaled on every
once in awhile. The trick is for the dps class to know when to disengage,
and for the tank to know how to regain aggro. I rarely spend large amounts
of mana on healing dps classes, instead I bubble them, and use bandages. A
renew once in awhile also helps.

Nothing like a buzz to make you want to kick butt in WoW. As a shadow
priestess, I can solo for quite awhile. If, however, some pug wants me to

Because pickpocketing can be resisted, and it will immediately aggro
all surrounding mobs instantly on the rogue.  If he can vanish out of
it, great, but why put the rest of the group in jeopardy for a few silver?

If the tank's not dying. If everything goes well. If the tank knows exactly
how capable THIS healer is. And those DPSers needing heals from time to
time. Some more often than others. rougues mor than locks. One careless wipe
costing all the time saved from fast pulls. And some.

Let the tank tell DPS when damage may start. Let the healer tell the tank
when healing is ready.

Sometimes, a rogue can tank, but it was not the case here, according to you
explanation.

I was in Shattered Halls with my rogue. There are big groups of mobs that
require some crowd control. One sapped, on sheeped, and I was asked to take
care of a caster mob. Stunlock, gouge and kick to interrupt spells, if the
rogue &quot;tank&quot; a caster, it can be done without a heal.

Evasion and tank can be possible, too, but not for long. And I'm not
categorical here, since I never really tried it in a dungeon.

Answered your own question there.

I mean who would complain about a PP before a Sap? Why would a tank
leave in those circumstances? Indeed the fact you assumed this was the
problem shows how little what happens is done.

And especially this...

He PP the star marked mob. Then the skull. Then the square. Then the
other. _Then_ goes back and saps the star. He didn't even PP the sap
mob last...

Oh yes, not a leaving offense, but marking casters for frost

I guess what is extra nasty is when the group just ignores all the

all ignored. I guess those are the big indicators that your PUG is not

Low on money. As for low on flash and blinding powder or indeed
poisons at beginning of instance is something which shouldn't happen.
Ok, so blinding is not vended but I've never once blinded in an
instance myself, I see it as a soloing ability, but would be
interested as to why any rogue needed more than a couple of blinds in
a instance...

As I said before, I'm also a 70 rogue, and instance like you. Target
the tanks target and start the dmg. Feint to lessen aggro if threat
too high. Sap to start if people need it.. Like any normal rogue would
do...

Sorry I was referring to palas there, not a DPS class :)

In effect the 2nd pala seemed to be kind of tanking (think it was
Stockades so an early instance, maybe he didn't know instances or

I loved the twin shadow priests with Vampiric Embrace run of SM.One
priest dropped from Shadowform twice in order to heal the tank (bad

&gt; &gt; was out of line. Why in heck NOT pickpocket, so long as sap gets done?

&gt; Because pickpocketing can be resisted, and it will immediately aggro
&gt; all surrounding mobs instantly on the rogue.  If he can vanish out of
&gt; it, great, but why put the rest of the group in jeopardy for a few silver?

Not only that, I've never found any better loot form pickpocketing
elites than from pickpocketing normals... In which case why risk a
wipe, or at least do it until lose vanish...

Indeed, its about being selfish... I can understand the rage issue,
ie: you fight to get more and want to keep going.

But the mana issue works in opposite direction...

Its not even as it couldn't have worked if given time to mana up every
three pulls, once started. Its ignoring two empty bars and off to pull
some more...

&gt; &gt; Unluckily rogue continued. He seemed to think his role was to solo/

&gt; &gt; of Sight, losing the heal and dying.

&gt; Sometimes, a rogue can tank, but it was not the case here, according to you
&gt; explanation.

&gt; I was in Shattered Halls with my rogue. There are big groups of mobs that
&gt; require some crowd control. One sapped, on sheeped, and I was asked to take
&gt; care of a caster mob. Stunlock, gouge and kick to interrupt spells, if the
&gt; rogue &quot;tank&quot; a caster, it can be done without a heal.

&gt; Evasion and tank can be possible, too, but not for long. And I'm not
&gt; categorical here, since I never really tried it in a dungeon.

Lol, I love &quot;tanking&quot; casters... I don't consider it tanking though,

Same here.  My rogue has gone back and pp'd the elites in some
old world dungeons when I was bored (really makes you feel roguish),
and figured I'd have been better off just pp'ing and killing sappers in
the HFP mine near HH.  At least they drop junkboxes a lot more often,
and I can always use more maiden's anguish :-).

I sap, and pickpocket after - if I get a resist I vanish. Never pickpocket
with vanish on cooldown.
Oh and sometimes if we're on a roll, I'll pickpocket a mob or two after the
tank has charged. Remember you can do it even if the target is in combat
now, and with autoloot it takes no time at all.

Throwing a blind on a mob that's gone for a healer buys the tank 10
seconds to get it back under control. But you are right, it's a
fairly rare thing to use in an instance.

A rogue pickpocketing in an instance is just wasting time. I might

I've a &quot;blind spot&quot; when it comes to blind. When I've used it before,
it barely gives me a couple of seconds and I'm likely to die anyway,
evasion and vanish gone and two mobs on, with no potions... So I throw
a blind...

However, thinking about it, I probably have poisons ticking on the mob
which breaks the blind right away... Ah, sussed it... Blind the add
which you aren't dmg... Sounds like a plan...

I haven't played mine for a while (level 64 and resting) but my &quot;coming
out of stealth&quot; skills like sap and cheap shot are both macros which
pickpocket and hit in a single button press. get vast quantities of
various useful ingredients and have to watch bag space.

Bad one for me this weekend.  Had my hunter out, because a mostly-guild
group needed an extra hand in that level bracket.  I had my turtle out,
and was helping CC with 1 in the trap and another on the turtle.  He can
keep a mob tied up for just about as long as need be, as long as he gets
the occasional heal.  Does he get the occasional heal?  Of course not!
It's because of him that this mob is not chewing on the priest's bones,
but does he care?

Tank pulls mob round a corner so that there is no way at all that I can
get line of sight without agroing the next group.  At least he realised
the error when I spent the fight yelling in /p to get the mob where I
can see it (well what else could I do?).  I find it infuriating playing
as a hunter in an instance because, as a class that has severe
limitations (line of sight, dead zone), so few players seem to
understand how to play the game in a way that allows the hunter to be
effective.  Don't tank a mob half way down the stairs.  Don't tank the
mob just round the corner.  If the pet is keeping the mob off the
healer, give it a heal.

If I'm sapping, I usually Pickpocket the sap target.  In instances, I
always set the tank as my focus, and then have a macro that targets my
focus's target.  If I've sapped, I'll usually end up pickpocketing
whichever mob I hit first, as I usually open with a cheap shot and have
that set up on a macro that automatically PP's first.  I wish there was
some way to set up a secondary focus, so that I could set that for the
healer in order to quickly target anything going after them.  Oh well,
I'm sure if I think about it I can come up with some way to have a one
button healer assist, but I've been up all night right now and don't
really want to think about it.

Well, I don't think  it's really all *that* likely that the healer is
going to be targeting whatever mob is attacking them.  Not at first.
Whether or not they're being beaten on doesn't change the fact that
they still need to be keeping the tank alive.  Who they're targeting
is going to depend a bit on how they've got things set up.  When I'm
healing I'm usually targeting the main enemy so I can see it's casting
bar and can get an idea of what's coming up that I need to heal
through.  Then I use the clique add-on so I can cast whatever heal I
want on whoever just by clicking a certain way on their portraits.
And if a mob comes towards me, I might use fade, or if I'm far enough
away from the front, psychic scream, neither of which requires me to
target the mob heading my way.  If the healer isn't using any
add-on's, they're probably going to have the tank as their target, so
there won't really be any way to find out what mob is attacking them
even if you could have two focuses.
