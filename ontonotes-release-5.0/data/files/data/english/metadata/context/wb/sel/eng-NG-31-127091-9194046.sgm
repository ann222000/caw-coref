This letter appeared in my hometown newspaper this morning.  I like the
first part, but towards the end the writer whimps out, but it appears that
his grandson was run-over and killed, so I'll cut him some slack.   I sent
off a quick  comment, but comments  are moderated due to a couple dipshits
regular posters and you never know when (or if they make it).   I'm sort of
ambiguous about leashes on kids myself as I said I my note , but since
parents don't feel any need to control their heathen,  the rest of us would
appreciate leashing.

Why not harness, leash small children?

Recently I was at a flag football game to watch my 7-year-old grandson
Jeremy play. Nearby was the mother of a player on my grandson's team. She
had a child with her who looked about 2 years old. I could tell that this
lady was very intelligent because she had a very well-designed harness with
leash on the little one.

But I was disturbed by a couple of comments I heard from people later
that day. One said the lady was guilty of child abuse. Another stated she
was &quot;treating her kid no better than a dog.&quot; I thought to myself, where are
these people's minds? At least the lady is treating her child as well as a
dog!

When we have our dogs out in public, we have a collar-harness and
leash on them. These devices serve to keep them under control and from
running off and being lost or killed by a motor vehicle. Should we not be
just as concerned, and even more so, about the safety of our small children?
These devices do no harm to the dogs or the kids. It's very puzzling to me
how anyone could not see this as a good thing.

We have seat belt laws for our safety. Maybe it would be a good idea
to have a law requiring young children to be in a harness and on a leash
when out in public? I firmly believe such laws would greatly reduce the
number of lost and kidnapped kids. Every year, hundreds of small children
are killed in this country because they ran out into traffic. I wonder how
many of those parents will spend the rest of their lives wishing they had
had some way of holding those little ones back from the danger. I am haunted
every day by a deadly close call that happened when my grandson was 18
months old, and I could not run fast enough to catch him. I see the whole
incident in my mind, even now, just as clearly as if it happened yesterday.

Um, it said it was a &quot;close call.&quot; Besides, the same(?) grandson is
now 7, not 18 months.

Umm, clearly the kid WASN'T killed, yet gramps is &quot;haunted every day&quot;
by something that ALMOST happened, but didn't. Gramps needs some help,
but he is right about leasing runts. Should be required for the little
nightmares, just like dogs.

i can't remember who said it or where, but the gist was &quot;on the leash,
he's alive.  off the leash, he's road kill.&quot; and yes, she was
referring to a kid.

if it keeps the kid from running out in the street and getting
squashed, i'm all for it.

&lt;Snip for bandwidth's sake&gt;

My brother was born in 1958.  When he was old enough to walk with us
(as opposed to being carried around), my mother put a harness and
leash on him.  She always knew where he was when we were out and
about, and she was always within range of effective discipline.  I
can't remember a single person ever criticizing her for leashing him.
When he was old enough to mind her, she took off the harness and
leash, and he heeled quite nicely.  (Sorry, couldnt' resist. &lt;Grin&gt;)

He's alive and well today, and (moderately) well adjusted.  I can't
see that being leashed hurt him the least little bit.  It didn't seem
to stifle his creativity any; he's a wood sculptor and furniture-
builder.

I remember having a discussion in college with people reminiscing about
having been leashed. One guy mentioned that he was leashed to a
clothesline (remember those?) so he could run back and forth as he
pleased. It sounds like a good plan with a hyperactive k1d with energy
to burn.

This talk was at an engineering school, so you must judge for yourself
if ending up an engineer is an o.k. fate or not.  ;-)

My brother is a year older than yours, and my mom tied a rope around his
waist many times.  She says the second the car door opened he'd be off like
a shot, and she got tired of trying to chase him down.   If anyone was
bothered by it, she apparently didn't care.
My brother's alive and well also.
