Hey guys. Just got this idea of making a tiger strike kick sin.

tiger strike - maxed

dragon talon (the multiple kicks skill) - maxed

claw mastery - maxed (so that she can have enough ar to hit stuff for
charge ups)

I intend for her to use 2 claws. Bartucs maybe so she can have enough
skills add on to her dragon talon. I have enough shaels for both claws
so her ias won't be a problem. Besides a couple of points in BoS
should give her really hot ias, right?

Next skill to put points in would be that double blocking one. I heard
with dual claws blocking, the sin can even block elemental attacks??
That's really useful. But should I max it? I was thinking no. What
with the add on to skills gear I will be wearing, I figure 5 points in
it maybe? And the rest of my skills can go into the shadow master and
cloak of darkness skills.

Here's her strategy. When running around facing the usual mob, she
would have kick on left click and her shadow mastery skills on right
click. Cast BoS and shadow master in town. Out there, cast darkness
and combine that with my super fast kicks. I have nothing to fear from
missile attacks too if i have the cloak of darkness. Should I invest a
few points in mind blast too?

Anyway, when it is boss time, she goes into left click tiger strike
and right click kicking mode. Charge up and kick. Yep. Sounds good.

Of course, I will not be expecting to use this char for ubers. Or
duels. This is purely a pvm sin for the sake of having fun. All
comments and advice welcomed.

You can do this and mainly use Tiger Strike for charge up
against bosses. However, I doubt the effectiveness. And also,
spending 39 skill points just to get a few 'heavy punches'
against bosses seems quite expensive. For these 39 skill points,
you can have near maxed LS/DS which give you okay lightning
attacks plus awesome AoE attack that can kill 500 cows once you
have finished kicking a couple of them.

Furthermore, kicksins aim for quite different gears from
claw-sins. Boots is priminary focus for kicksin, while for
claw-sin it is her claws. If you wear a pair of plastic boots,
it doesn't matter what charge-up you have, 20% or 20k% bonus,
you'll still be delivering pitiful kick damage as finishing
move. Their AR/To-Hit may come from different sources as well.

Most kicksins out there don't bother with claw attacks. They
only kick, well, lay traps as well. The reason to use DT is that
this level 1 skill, when maxed, gives tremendous AR and damage
boost while allowing you to attack extremely fast. Couple this
skill with a pair of right boots and loads of Crushing Blows, a
kicksin can handle UT just like the best zealots out there (I'd
say just meagerly inferior to Smiter, but she has elemental
attacks in LS/DS, she can solo everywhere.)

You have to think about her gears at this point so that you know
whether she'll have enough resists to use BoS in Hell or Fade.
If you are going to kick, best main (left) claw will be a
'strength runeword' Talon-type claw preferably with appropriate
mods, whilst Bartucs on the secondary (right).

Only one point in Weapon Block (as prerequisite.) You will see
drastic diminishing return after a few skill points, and your
gears typically will push you beyond that. You're right that
Assassin's Weapon Block may block most elemental (generally
those thrown at you, some stationary ones like firewall can't be
blocked) and all physical (including Smite) attacks.

Only one point in Mind Blast. You use it to buy time, not to
kill anything. For a melee Assassin, Dragon Flight, either from
skill investment or from gears, is also a must.

When I was playing my kicksin last season, I didn't even bother
with Clock of Shadow. I simply DF to the most annoying guys and
kicked the crap out of them. Nevertheless, CoS is an awesome
skill, which blinds them as well as lowers their defense.
However, bear in mind it is not 100% fool proof. I'm not sure,
but I don't think it will blind Champs/Bosses, which may mean
Gloam bosses/champs can still shoot the crap out of you with
their lightnings, and that MS/Cursed Dark Rogue boss can still
kill you in a couple volleys.

Kicksin, if geared up and played right, is one of the most
suitable Uber killers as well as fearsome duelers.

I made a kicksin last season and she was so much fun to play
with. She could go to places my smiter dared not. She was so
stylish while fighting, and so sexy when she was hit.

Take a look at http://strategy.diabloii.net/news.php?id=538 for
more information, if you haven't already yet.

I think a Jade Talon is also pretty good as a secondary claw if you
MUST use 2 claws. Weapon/Shield is more common but 2 claws look pretty
stylish.
