I've always noticed the smoke from steam locos takes on several
different appearances: white, black, heavy plumes, puffs, sometimes
nearly invisible. What causes the variations?

Growing up, our house was heated with lump coal. Depending on how long
the coal had been in the stove, the smoke pattern went from a steady
black plume, to nearly invisible: never puffs, and never ever white.

In a recent thread here, I read that some locos had a blower for the
fire box. Would that explain some of the patterns?

Was there ever a steam loco that used pulverized coal, like power plants
use?

Exhaust steam from the pistons is routed up the stack  to draw air
through the fire and through the flues.  That's what the puffs are.
New coal, and too much coal, makes for black smoke. Black is unburned
carbon.  Very wasteful, hated by management.  A well-tended fire makes
no smoke.  White smoke isn't smoke, it's steam condensing in the
cooler air.  Invisible smoke and no puffs is when there isn't smoke
and there isn't steam because the locomotive is drifting, that is,
coasting with the throttle shut off.  A blower sends a steady stream
of steam up the stack to make draft.  It's used when the train is
standing in station or when steam is being made up before a run.

I recall reading about a locomotive that used powdered coal.  It was
run by either the Norfolk and Western or by the C&amp;O, but I'll be
darned if I can remember anything else about it.  Prhaps it was the
turbine-electric one called Big John, or Jawn Henry, or something
llike that.  Someone here will know and will flame me, no doubt.

Thank you for the response. I had heard that steam was injected through
the firebox, but that never made much sense to me--even with very dry
steam. However, routing the steam from he pistons, through the smoke
stack makes sense.

I haven't found reference to it using powdered coal, yet, but I wouldn't
be surprised. What a beast!

The more I learn about steam locomotives, the more intriguing they are.

Black smoke means the amount of fuel and the draft aren't well
matched.  Too much fuel, either for an oil burner or a coal burner,
makes black smoke.  For a coal burner, so does too much draft; it
will literally pull the unburnt coal off the grates and out the
stack.

The other cause of black smoke is when an oil burner is &quot;sanded
out&quot;.  Every so often the fireman of an oil burner will throw 10
lbs or so of sand into the firebox and let the draft pull it thru
the tubes, which sandblasts the soot off the tubes, resulting in
a plume of black smoke.  Coal burners don't need to do this because
there's enough unburnable cinders in the coal to keep the tubes
clean.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; carbon.  Very wasteful, hated by management.  A well-tended fire makes

Well, not really.  A well tended fire will make a sort of grey haze.
It's different from no smoke at all.  Note too that with a coal
burner it's essentially impossible to avoid making some smoke when
starting when the engineer has the reverse down in the corner.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  White smoke isn't smoke, it's steam condensing in the

">

If it's great billows of white &quot;smoke&quot;, it's steam condensing.  If
it's a thin white smoke, it means your fire has gone out (this is
fairly easy to do with an oil burner; pretty uncommon with a coal
burning engine).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Right - you wouldn't normally use the blower when the train is
actually moving.  Because of that, the blower wouldn't typically
affect the smoke's appearance, altho an oil burner will smoke a
bit if you stop &amp; forget to turn the blower on (this will also
tend to fill the cab with smoke, so one usually remembers pretty
quickly).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I think that was the C&amp;O turbines.  The ACE 4000 was intended to
burn powdered coal too, but that never went anywhere.  I think in
general, tho, powdered coal wouldn't work for a steam locomotive
because of the very high draft and short combustion chamber.  You
really need a watertube boiler to use powdered coal.

This is an extremely complex issue, and the sound and appearance of the
exhaust of a steam locomotive can tell you a great deal about how the
locomotive is being handled.  Most of my personal observations are on
European manually fired coal burning locomotives, while north american
practice tended to favour mechanical stokers for coal firing, or oil
burning.

In a steam locomotive, the exhuast steam from the cylinders is directed
into a blast pipe, which forces a jet of steam at high speed through a
nozzle in the smoke box up the chimney, creating a partial vacuum in the
smoke box, and hence drawing air through the firebox and boiler tubes.
This has the effect of increasing the air flow through the firebox.  In
general, this will cause the fire to burn hotter and faster, but if
there is too much draft on a coal fire, it will lift coal off the grate,
and unburned coal will end up coming out the chimney (not a good thing).

It is the job of the fireman to maintain the right fire for the duty the
locomotive is performing.  If the locomotive is to be working hard, for
example a long uphill climb, he will want to build up a large fire, with
lots of coal on it, so that with the strong exhaust from the cylinders,
it will burn very hot and raise steam at a high rate.  On the other
hand, if the locomotive is working very lightly, or coasting, for
example downhill, or coming to stop at a station, he wants there to be a
light fire, to reduce the coal consumption rate.  As well as the blast
from the exhaust steam drawing air through, the fireman can control the
airflow through the grate with the dampers and opening the firehole door
(on a manual fired locomotive, this is where he puts the coal in).  If,
however, the combustion rate of the fire is reduced by reducing the air
flow rate, the fire will burn rich, and soot particles will form in the
combustion products (not the same as unburned raw fuel).

So, consider a locomotive powering a train.  The harder the locomotive
is working, which is controlled by the reverser setting the rate at
which steam is admitted to the cylinders, and to a certain extent by the
regulator, the more steam is being used, and the stronger the exhaust
blast.  The steam that is exhausted through the blastpipe will condense
into water as it cools in the atmosphere above the locomotive.  This is
what gives the white colouration.  A locomotive that is working hard,
with a good fireman, will have efficient combustion, so no particulates
forming in the exhaust and no uburned fuel being drawn through the
boiler.  There will always be some non-combustible materials in the
exhaust, though, so the exhaust will be mostly condensing steam, and
will apear white, and come in brusts corresponding to the opening of the
exhuast ports on the cylinders.  On a 2 cylinder locomotive this means 4
exhaust beats per revolution of the driving wheels.

A locomotive that is coasting steadily (ie not one that has just turned
off the power), will produce no exhaust as no steam is being drawn from
the boiler.  The only thing coming out the chimney will be combustion
products.  If the fire is well tended, this will be a thin, slightly
grey colour, and will make very little noise.

If you consider a locomotive that has been working hard, but just stops,
for example it comes over the summit of a long climb, or reaches a
station part way up a climb, in turning off the power, you remove the
draft from the blastpipe, thus reducing the airflow through the fire.
You also don't need much steam now, so you want the fire to burn slowly.
But you have a large fire built up (especially if you are about to
resume a climb, and will need a big fire again), so you will end up with
rich combustion.  This leads to quite a dark grey exhaust because of
signficant particulate formation in the exhuast.

The mode to consider is one where the locomotive is being handled badly,
and steam is being demanded while the fire is too light.  This will lead
to a strong draft, and with too light a fire, the fire will be lifted,
and you will end up with chunks of coal coming out the chimney, leading
to a heavy black exhuast.

In general, a well handled locomotive will never produce a black
exhuast, because the fireman will be anticipating the demands, and will
have the fire in the right condition for the demands the driver will be
placing on it.

When O. Winston Link was given permission to photograph &quot;The Last Steam
Railroad in America,&quot; they only asked him not to photograph a poorly-fired
locomotive because that was embarrrassing to management.  He had a problem
on the Norfolk and Western's &quot;Creeper&quot; line because it was uphill with a
station at the top, so he made an exception.  Color photographs of the line
show huge clouds of black smoke coming from the engine.  Link usually
photographed in black and white and only at night, so you don't usually see
the black smoke.  The famous picture of Old Maude in Green Cove shows a lot
of black smoke.  These were highly-skilled crews dealing with steep grades.
The Creeper line averaged only 10 mph by the way.  Today, on the same run
with a bicycle, you can about that well on the downhill parts, anyway.  I'll
have to reread the book to find out the exact combinations they did not want
photographed.

C.R.H. Simpson wrote, &quot;Pulverized coal has had a fairly large
application, particularly in Germany where the A.E.G. Locomotive Works
and Henshel &amp; Son developed and produced the necessary equipment.
These experiments were largely influenced by the desire to use brown
coal for locomotive purposes, which fuel did not readily lend itself
to any other method of firing.&quot; (&quot;The Concise Encyclopedia of World
Railway Locomotives&quot;, ed. by P. Ransome-Wallis, 1959)

He then said that the advantage of using this cheap fuel was more than
offset by the exceedingly dirty exhaust (including much unburned
fuel), slag deposits inside the boiler, and other troubles.

This is not such a problem in a stationary boiler, which can burn
pulverized coal in a huge combustion chamber with a gentle draft. That
enables much of the ash to settle to the floor. Downstream dust
collectors can pick up the rest. A locomotive has no space for any of
this. Its combustion chamber is tiny, the draft is intense, and gas
velocity is high. These are poor conditions for burning pulverized
coal.

I've never heard of any U.S. experiments in that direction. After WW2
the C&amp;O tested steam turbine locomotives with electric drive, but the
boilers were conventional. A few years later the N&amp;W attempted a more
radical turbo-electric, using a 600 psi boiler with an automatic chain
grate stoker (no pulverized fuel).

Both designs were flops.

One of the things that I find pretty amazing about the firing crew on the

http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/p/m/36ed6b/

Why is this more amazing to me than steam locomotive firing not producing
black smoke?

1. The fireman can't see much of anything, and even taking a look at the
stack requires that he leaves his controls to peek out the side (which the
current fireman does do on a regular basis).  Machinery blocks the view of
pretty much everything (both engineer and fireman), so load demands are
very hard to anticipate.

2. This isn't something that is like a railroad line that can be
anticipated when approching a grade and all that, which an experienced
crew could do.  Instead, they work by hand signals from the man on the
ground, not knowing exactly what he is going to ask for (because they
can't see anything useful, see point 1).

3. Locomotives generally have gradual changes to demand and speed.  This
is not the case for the steam crane.  Instead, its needs can go from full
blast to almost nothing almost instantly when the guy on the ground says
to stop lifting.  Just as suddenly, they can go from nothing to full
speed.

4. Let's face it, other than one ex-Southern Pacific employee, none of the
people working on this operating museum display have ever operated a beast
like this on a regular basis.

Indeed, it is hard to find examples of steam locomotives being worked in
commercial service by crews who have the experience with both the
locomotive and route to really know how to get the best from their
machines.  I have just returned from a visit to the Harz narrow gauge
network in Germany.  This survived until the early 90s as a 100% steam
opperation under the communist regime.  It has dieselised some of its
passenger services and (I suspect) all of its freight, but retains a very
significant ammount of steam haulage.  It is a steeply graded system (up
to 1 in 25 at places), and it is truelly impressive to see the machines
handled like that.  The only time I saw smoke that was opaque at all (not
steam condensate) was when slowing for a request stop part way through a
climb - the crew do not know whether they will have to stop so keep the
fire going full on, but have to shut off the power to allow them to stop
if necessary.  Even then, it was not big black clouds, more of a dark
brown/grey.

&gt;&gt; Was there ever a steam loco that used pulverized coal, like power

&gt;&gt; use?

&gt; C.R.H. Simpson wrote, &quot;Pulverized coal has had a fairly large
&gt; application, particularly in Germany where the A.E.G. Locomotive Works
&gt; and Henshel &amp; Son developed and produced the necessary equipment.
&gt; These experiments were largely influenced by the desire to use brown
&gt; coal for locomotive purposes, which fuel did not readily lend itself
&gt; to any other method of firing.&quot; (&quot;The Concise Encyclopedia of World
&gt; Railway Locomotives&quot;, ed. by P. Ransome-Wallis, 1959)

&gt; He then said that the advantage of using this cheap fuel was more than
&gt; offset by the exceedingly dirty exhaust (including much unburned
&gt; fuel), slag deposits inside the boiler, and other troubles.

&gt; This is not such a problem in a stationary boiler, which can burn
&gt; pulverized coal in a huge combustion chamber with a gentle draft. That
&gt; enables much of the ash to settle to the floor. Downstream dust
&gt; collectors can pick up the rest. A locomotive has no space for any of
&gt; this. Its combustion chamber is tiny, the draft is intense, and gas
&gt; velocity is high. These are poor conditions for burning pulverized
&gt; coal.

&gt; I've never heard of any U.S. experiments in that direction.
">

The Texas &amp; Pacific converted G-1-b 2-10-2 No. 524 to burn lignite (brown
coal) in 1923.  The color of this fuel earned the loco the nick-name &quot;snuff
dipper&quot;.  The loco was given a huge stack and a large blower was mounted on
the side of the sealed firebox to create the necessary draft.  The loco made
thick, black smoke and was only operated at night to minimize public
criticism.  The crew would be blacker that coal miners at the end of a run.
It was not successful, and the 524 was converted back to burning oil in
1927.  Geezer

I think it's probably the same as your home furnace.  If coal were pure
carbon and combustion were perfect the result would be carbon dioxide, an
invisible gas (to our eyes, but somewhat opaque to infrared radiation, hence
the &quot;greenhouse&quot; effect).  The blackest part of black coal smoke is probably
unburned carbon, like lamp black.  When bituminous coal is cold, it will not
burn very well, and a lot of the carbon will go as soot.  After it is
heated, the volatile parts are &quot;cooked off&quot;, making the residue coke, or
nearly pure carbon which when hot enough and with enough air will produce
mostly colorless carbon dioxide when it is burned.  The &quot;modern&quot; steam
locomotive discharged the exhaust steam up the stack to cause a suction
which brought air in through the grate to burn the coal.  Under heavy load,
or when starting, the draft could be strong enough to carry unburnt coal
into the smoke box.  Steel netting in the smoke box prevented the larger
pieces from going up the stack, but the netting often had holes in it.

Put briefly, the color of the smoke depends on the load on the engine and
the skill of the fireman and the engineman.  The latter sets the valve
cutoff and throuttle positions, which at any speed and load have a lot to do
with how well the boiler performs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Growing up, our house was heated with lump coal. Depending on how long

If any American railroad ever tried pulverized coal it did not take on.  I
think there was some use of it in some European countries.  It might be
dangerous to pulverize the coal before putting it in the tender.

Interesting questions.  My answers are just from the top of my head.

It's almost essential, when fireing an oil fired engine, to be

oil fired engines almost always have a light on the stack, so the
fireman can see the smoke at night.

This is actually easier to deal with.  The demand on the crane is
short, the fireman can simply let his pressure fall by 10 or 20lbs
and catch up a few minutes later.  With a locomotive, if you fall
behind you're likely to be playing low-water games trying to get
caught up, because the engineer is likely to keep working it for
many miles.

After a quick check of my books, neither the Jawn, the 3 C&amp;O turbines,
nor the Pennsy's direct-drive turbine used pulverized coal.

I think what we're all probably thinking of was the UP's experiment
using pulverized coal as fuel for a gas turbine electric, which
was a failure since the abrasiveness of the cinders ate away the
turbine blades.

This web site talks about it a bit (about 2/3rds down the page).

That's true if it is being correctly fired.  I've also seen it when it was
being used to train crews, and it can certainly make black smoke with
someone who has never operated it before.

Except that coal is not pure carbon.  There are some hydrocarbons in
there, some coal contains significant ammounts of suphur and there are

I can't speak for UK practice, but in the US, coal is pulverized
(milled) at the generating station, immediately before being injected
or blown into the furnace.

Processing at the mine can include a number of processes, including
crushing and grading, resulting in the transportation of coal of a
more or less uniform size, but this results in individual pieces
measured in inches, not a fine powder.

But like I said, with a skilled fireman an oil burner shouldn't
make black smoke.  With a coal burner, sometimes it's unavoidable,
simply because you can't just turn down the fire by moving a valve.

It is possible, with powdered coal, to get the right proportions of
coal floating in the air to make an explosive mixture (this is true
of almost any combustible powder, as is occasionally demonstrated
when a grain silo blows up).  Because of this, I think it's almost
always normal practice to crush coal in reasonable proximity to
where it's going to be used.

I got to visit a nearby coal-fired power plant. The pulverizers were
only a few horizontal feet from the furnace; and one or two floors above
the furnace. The furnace was two or more stories tall. I don't remember
at what level the coal was injected.
