I have applied to the Community Startup program through ODSP for an
air conditioner, as many on here have talked about.  Rather than
address my request through Community Startup, ODSP turned it over to
Ontario Works and their Discretionary Benefit program.  Since my
doctor did not prescribe the air conditioner for asthma, the OW
people denied my request.  I have 10 days to apply for an internal
review, which I will do, although I am not sure whether the request
for the internal review should go to ODSP or OW.

If I am being considered under &quot;Discretionary Benefits&quot; then why is
the fact that I don't have asthma relevant?  If one has to have
asthma to get an air conditioner, then that is a criterion, and the
decision is no longer discretionary.  I do suffer from
hyperhidrosis, which is excess sweating, which may or may not be the
result of 20-25 years of diabetes.  But why is an OW case worker
deciding that the doctor is wrong when saying I need an air
conditioner for hyperhidroses, but right when saying I need an air
conditioner for asthma?

At any rate, I have reapplied to ODSP, this time stating
specifically, that I am applying to the Community Startup Program.
I will also request an internal review of the OW decision.  Does
anyone have any experience with OW &quot;Discretionary Benefits?&quot;

I asked my caseworker why the air conditioner request went to OW and
discretionary benefits, and not to the Community Startup.  My worker
told me that she didn't know about Community Startup paying for air
conditioners, even though in a previous call with me she told me
that Community Startup has a 799.00 limit for air conditioners!  I
suggested to her that my request was funnelled to OW because they
knew it would not pass OW &quot;Discretionary Benefits&quot; because my
doctor's note says that I have hyperhidrosis and not asthma.  I then
asked her why it was that she was not trying to help me get the air
conditioner.  I told her that I believe it is her job to make sure
that I get all the benefits to which I am entitled.  I told her that
she was obfuscating and hiding the existence of certain benefits
from me and that in doing this, she was not doing her job.  After
all, what is the point of ODSP offering benefits, when in fact they
do not offer these benefits and clients have to track them down and
fight for them.

My worker told me she was going to hang up the phone and I told her
I wanted to speak to her supervisor.  She told me she had to do
something and she would call me back in 5 minutes.  Famous last
words.  I don't know what I am going to say to her the next time we
have to talk.

But to come to the point, does anyone know about differences between
OW &quot;Discretionary Benefits&quot; and ODSP &quot;Community Startup?&quot;  Do you
have to have asthma to get the air conditioner through Community
Startup?  I asked my worker this and she responded that she couldn't
answer me because that would constitute making a &quot;decision.&quot;  And so
I have to go through a formal process to find out something that she
could easily have told me on the phone...

RM:

I do believe you have missed the major point on applying for your air
conditioner.

What medical condition you have does not enter into the picture.  That
is strictly between you and your doctor!

If you did not follow the steps outlined then expect to be denied.
Without the support of your doctor you will never qualify.

The basic difference between OW and ODSP in this area is who
administers the program.  OW is administered by your local government
(regional or municipal depending on structure) and ODSP is
administered by the province.  ODSP will cover total costs of approved
items while OW will only cover 50%.

If your doctor has completed and signed the Mandatory Special Needs
Benefit Form stating that you require an Air Conditioner for health
treatment needs then ODSP MUST provide the unit.  If you do not have a
completed MSN Benefit form then there is no sense requesting an
Internal Review as you have not qualified.

Please again go to the Pages section of the group - click on Pages in
the top right hand side of this page - and read the page on MSN
Beneifts.

Realto,
Depends on where you live if you'll get the air conditioner under
&quot;discretionary benefit&quot;.  Some regions including mine do not fund
ANYTHING under this ... they are bare bones, so our ODSP has
usually been a bit more willing to fund some of these things.  I'd
try MSN under a physician's prescription.

What on earth is the purpose of this statement?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; is strictly between you and your doctor!
">

Great.  I have checked the page to which you referred me.  MSN is
not the program to which I was applying.  I believe I read somewhere
in one of the articles here that somebody applied to Community
Startup for air conditioner funding and they were awarded up to
799.00.  I checked this with two workers at ODSP in Brantford who
told me that this was true and that all I needed was a note from a
doctor or an extended nurse, and two estimates and that there was no
form to fill in. I specifically asked if there was a form and I was
told no. This was the procedure that I followed and but my
application did not go to Community Startup.  It went to OW and
their &quot;Discretionary Benefit&quot; program, whatever that is.  I have
reapplied, with the same information, but this time I have
specifically stated that I am applying to Community Startup and I am
relying for my authority on what two ODSP workers told me.

I checked the MSN page that you suggested and the method outlined
there seems to be an alternate path by which I can receive air
conditioner funding.  If my current course is unsuccessful then I
will give it a shot.

However, although the explanation at the top of the page was clear,
it does not seem to have been written by an ODSP representative.
And, since Policy Directive 9.12 makes no mention of air conditioner
funding, there is no information there that I can appeal to, either
in an application, an internal review, or an SBT hearing.  Perhaps
the person who wrote that page could tell my where they got this
information from so that may use it as authority in an appeal if
need be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I have the support of my doctor.  I believe that I stated this at
the outset in my original correspondence on this matter.

Who outlined the steps given on this page?  Was it you?  Is this why
you seem annoyed that I have sought the funding through an alternate
course?  Has anyone actually used these steps to successfully obtain
an air conditioner?  Where did this information come from?  Has
anybody reading this actually received the funding for an air
conditioner through Community Startup?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; items while OW will only cover 50%.
">

None of it is at all relevant to the issue under discussion.  What I
would like to know is why my application to Community Startup was
sent to OW.  My ODSP worker told me that this is the only way she
knows how to pursue air conditioner funding, even after discussing
funding from Community Startup the previous day.

Interestingly enough, I asked the Ontario Works rep, when I talked
to her on the phone, if it was the legal mandate of ODSP client
service reps to help clients maximize access to ODSP resources.  She
told me that the job of ODSP Client Service Workers is to ascertain
need.  This is a careful way of saying that the workers are not
necessarily there to help the clients maximize their access to the
system.  And yet I submit that this is contradicted by the preamble
of the Policy Directives.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Internal Review as you have not qualified.
">

Certainly there is a reason to request an internal review.  The
grounds for my first internal review request will be that my request
for an air conditioner is ultra vires to OW authority, and that the
existence of their asthma criterion takes the Discretionary Benefit
decision clearly beyond the discretionary.  Furthermore, the ODSP
Policy Directives preamble states quite clearly that in matters of
discretion, the benefit of the doubt should always go to the client.
But whether OW decision makers are bound by this preamble is not
clear to me.

In any case, I have already submitted a second request for the air
conditioner via Community Startup and I have cited two workers as
authorities for this method.  If they deny me on this second
request, then I will submit another demand for an internal review,
and I will launch a third application for an air conditioner under
the MSN Benefit, as you suggest.

Whoever wrote the MSN information on the Fireside page, I would
appreciate very much knowing the source of that information so if he
or she is reading this, could you please let me know where you
learned about this and whether you know anyone for whom this method
has actually worked?

It seems from reading the MSN policy directive that they should also
be paying for my toenail maintenance at the chiropodist.  I get my
toenails clipped and feet monitored every six weeks (because of
long-standing diabetes) and it cost me 25 bucks each time.  An ODSP
worker assured me that no funding was available to pay for this, but
I think that MSN just might cover it.

And while this doesn't relate to my problem, I would really like to
know what people think about the quality of support they are
receiving from Client Service Reps at ODSP.

Do some of them simply not understand what programs are available?

Are they under pressure by management, (and the liberal party), to
hold costs down?

Are some of them simply lazy and want to do as little work as possible?

As I talked about in another article, if it can be proved that the
ODSP Client Service's Rep's mandate is to help clients maximize
their access to ODSP programs, then the simple fact that clients are
never provided with Special Diet Applications at the beginning of
their ODSP claim period can be shown to be simple and systemic
negligence.  And since s. 7 of the Public Authority Act has been
struck down, there is no longer a 6 month limitation on claims
against public authorities, and legal action is much easier to
initiate.  In fact, when s. 7 was struck down, it was predicted by
some that there might be a flood of lawsuits, especially against the
police, but this apparently has not happened.

Furthermore, it has been held in Superior Court (and currently under
Supreme Court review) that malice is no longer a necessary element
in making out cases of negligence against police officers so I am
curious as to whether this also applies to public authorities
working out of ODSP offices.  Are there any lawyers familiar with
administrative law that read these pages?

And speaking of which, I am curious as to what people feel about the
quality of legal representation available at their local Community
Legal Clinic.  I worked at one in Toronto for a couple of summers
and where I was, everybody was interested in doing as little work as
possible, and going home as early as possible.  But I am not saying
that this is the norm.

Starting salary for lawyers at these clinics is 52K/year and that is
appalling for somebody with that level of education.  In fact, I
think that somebody in this group said that the starting salary of
ODSP Client Service Reps was 52K and they only need a high school
education...

I don't know what MSN is, but I will google to find out.  Two

As stated many time in this forum and other places ODSP agents are not
always the most reliable source of information.  All too often they
only regurgitate what someone else has purportetdly told them to say.

Community Start Up Benefits may be used to acquire an Air Conditioner
in certain circumstances when moving - possibly such as your old
accomodatons had Airconditioning and your new accomodations do not -
but there is no provisioning for such.  Those who did acquire a unit
this way should consider themselves lucky.  Airconditioning is still
considered a 'luxury' item unless it is required for medical reasons.
This benefit may also be availabe to access funds to replace a worn
out A/C unit that was prescribed for health reasons.

One major problem is that seldom all of the background information is
provided as to how the benefit was accessed by those who did
successfully access the benefit.  This is not intentional as often the
recipient will not be told exactly how or why they qualified.  Again
the old adage &quot;Ignorance is Bliss&quot; can be very handy when denying
others.

ODSP is the payor of last resort!
The mandate of ODSP is to allow the provincial government to provide
some form of funding to Disabled Ontarians when no one else will!  So
much for our caring government, but then we all know that anyway
right.  No One Else means just that, no one - not parents, children,
spouse, charity group, other governmental agency or even an other
country.  As some of the items covered under Community Start-Up
Benefits and Mandatory Special Needs are also covered in part by OW
policies ODSP will direct the claim to OW for first payment.  It is
then up to the recipient to press ODSP for the balance of what the
recipient is entitled to, that is if the recipient is informed enough
to know that they can do this.

The information currently on the CSUB Page of the group web site was
provided by myself.  All of the supporting documentation where the
information was gleaned is also listed on the page if you bothered to
read the entire page.  We and others have successfully followed this
method to access funds that our workers have told us we were not
entitled to.  You are correct in your statement that ODSP agents are
not there to help us receive what we are entitled to but to ensure
that we don't get too much of the government's money.

I am not sure that all of this is true.  I believe that the mandate
as specified in the Directive Preamble puts the onus on ODSP to
bring all available information forward to the clients and their
refusal to do this puts them in breach of the law.

If I bothered to read it?  Why do you have to be so rude?

Of course I read the entire page.  And nowhere in any of documents
you cited are the words &quot;air conditioner&quot; listed.  If I go into an
appeal and they ask me where I learned that I could get an air
conditioner using this process, and I answer that I learned it from
from anonymous persons on an activist web-page, the hearing is going
to be over right then and there.  And the decision won't be in my
favour.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&quot;We and others?&quot; Sorry but that doesn't help me appeal a refusal,
does it?  I would like to see, in black and white, that ODSP
interprets &quot;surgical supplies&quot; so as to include air conditioners,
because, quite frankly, that defies common sense.  Has anyone seen
any documentation to this effect that one can use in an appeal?  I
am not stating that the information is incorrect, only that I wish
to see it in black and white so that I can effectively defend an appeal.

Furthermore, I would like to point out that you have implied that
those who claim that one can get an air conditioner through
Community Startup, including people posting in this forum, don't
know what they are talking about.  Is that what you are saying?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That may be the activist, knee-jerk, understanding of things. And
that may be how things have devolved. But I submit that the law
states that this should not be the case.  It is disingenuous for the
government to say that they offer a particular service, such as
&quot;Special Diet Supplements&quot;, when in fact they are not _offering_
such a service.  This, and other information, should be given to the
claimant at the outset of the process.

I too have experienced this insidious practice of having my requests
for mandatory special necessities referred to OW.
I am not eligible for Ontario Works which is why I receive ODSP.  That
is a no brainer.
Isn't the Provincial government supposed to protect the privacy of
it's beneficiaries?
Why do they send files with personal information about my income and
health care needs to my local government?
Obviously they are not responsible to pay for my disability related
items...they are the ones that referred me to ODSP.

Hope this helps.  I have a great caseworker who exhausted all avenues
at her disposal. No air conditioner. So I wrote to Mr. LaFrenier's
office explaining that during last years long hot spell I'd had to go
to hospital several times and included the costs, ulitmately,  to the
province. Within about 2 weeks I received a letter saying that my
local office (90km distant) would notify me, which they did, in
writing. They followed up with a phone call, telling me to just submit
all cost surrounding purchase of air conditioner, including taxes,
along with verification from my doctor of my need. I was told $700 was
the ceiling amount. I submitted the info as requested and lo and
behold a cheque arrived for the amount submitted. If one buys a window
type, keep in mind they are heavy and have to be removed for the
winter. Because of this I bo't one on casters, and had to have the
ends adapted to fit my windows, as there is an intake and exhaust
hose. I included the cost of having someone do this for me and this
wasn't questioned. My submission came to just under $700.  With our
high temps this year, no more trips to the hospital.

Hi Realto - I think you have touched upon the essence of the problems with
ODSP.   They should write their Directives in plain English.  If
air-conditioners have been approved, insert that information into the
appropriate Directive.  They should make it easy for a recipient to access
needs and information and do away with ambiguous computer-generated letters
which serve to confuse the issues at hand. ODSP should train their CSRs to
know the legislation and Directives.  (McMaster University study 'The New
Framework for Service Delivery and its Impact on Working Conditions and
Client Services' is an eye opener in that regard.)   ODSP should be made
accountable to their stakeholders with regards to bullying or put downs.
Perhaps video of one-on-one interviews could be put in place to 'protect'
the rights of the disabled.

It's difficult for the Fireside site to always quote what is and what is not
allowed under certain Directives, because that information is withheld from
the recipients in the first place.  No two municipalities interpret ODSP in
the same way - although they should.  So it becomes a 'hit and miss'
situation - what has worked in the past might not work in the future.
Stonewalling on the part of ODSP is another great tactic not to come up with
pertinent information to help a client.  These silences allow for further
gaps in the system and we are left speechless.  It's hard to put the picture
back together because we become demoralized, lose our focus and eventually
give up trying to fight the system.

In my opinion I have observed the same thing in a Community Legal Clinic.
For instance, if one gets suspended by ODSP, the Community Legal Clinic's
advice is to comply to whatever ODSP asks you for, no matter how unfair or
intrusive it is.  Once you've complied by revealing all to ODSP, you are no
longer under suspendion.  Case closed - some advice!

Because you have very clear insights into the problems with ODSP, I think it
would be great if you could put your concerns in writing to the The
Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario and the Ontario Ombudsman.
Wouldn't it be great if a breakthrough were to occur.  Then I think there
wouldn't be so much confusion, fear and discontent amongst the disabled
community of Ontario.

All the best - Bette

Ontario Works sent me a letter stating that my application for an
air conditioner had failed and they advised me that I had 10 days to
appeal.  This is the letter I will give them tomorrow, and I will
give a copy as well to the local ODSP office.

Dear Ontario Works Caseworker,

RE: your letter of July 24, 2007

I am trustee for my brother, xxxxxxxxx, and I speak on his behalf,
as well as my own, in this letter.  With respect, I do not recognize
your decision in your letter of July 24, 2007, and as such, any
request for an internal review is moot.  I did not apply to Ontario
Works for an air conditioner.  I did not apply to the Discretionary
Benefits Program for an air conditioner.

My application for an air conditioner was made to the Community
Startup Program through ODSP. Furthermore, I did not authorize or
even know about the communication of personal information about
myself or my brother to your office by ODSP.  When ODSP passed you
my file, without my permission or knowledge, they violated ss.
42.(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy
Act, R.S.O. 1990

42.(1) An institution shall not disclose personal information in its
custody or under its control except.
(b) where the person to whom the information relates has identified
that information in particular and consented to its disclosure;

Neither my brother, nor myself, are Ontario Works recipients.  We
did not apply to Ontario Works for funding and we resent the
inference that we did. I demand that you remove any references to
any supposed requests for funding from either myself or my brother
from your files.

Yours truly,

xxxxxxxxxxxxx

I am almost positive I am going to be suing these people in small
claims court for negligence.

Here's the letter I am giving ODSP tomorrow:

Aug 1, 2007

Client Services
ODSP

Dear Client Services Rep,

Please find attached a letter addressed to Ontario Works Case Worker
xxxxxxxxxxx.  The letter speaks for itself.

I did not apply to Ontario Works for an air conditioner.  Ontario
Works only gives air conditioners to people suffering from asthma.
I suffer from hyperhidrosis and this was stated clearly in the note
I gave you from my doctor.  Since you had that note you should have
known that no air conditioner could be obtained through Ontario
Works.  Moreover, you did not inform me that my application was
going to be sent to Ontario Works and I did not authorize any of my,
or my brother's, private information, to be released to Ontario
Works and your release of this information was done in clear
violation of the law, as detailed in the attached letter to Ontario
Works.

The summer is drawing to an end and I do not have an air
conditioner.  I was informed by both a desk worker and xxxxxxxx
xxxxx, that the way to obtain an air conditioner was through
Community Startup.  I asked yyyyyyyyy what the best strategy was to
obtain an air conditioner and she refused to answer me.  I asked her
if an application to the Community Startup Program would be likely
to yield an air conditioner, and again, she refused to answer me,
stating that I was asking her for a “decision.”  Since she does not
have the authority to give me a such a decision, I clearly was not
asking her for a decision.  I asked for her help in accessing the
services that ODSP claims to be “offering” clients and she flatly
refused to help me.

I have found out through other sources, no thanks to anyone in your
office, that an air conditioner can be had through an application to
Mandatory Special Necessities.  I will obtain MSN forms from your
office while I drop off this letter.  I will be seeing my doctor
again in early September during which time I will ask him to fill
out the Mandatory Special Necessities Benefit form.  Since ODSP has
not given me a decision regarding my application to Community
Startup the application process is still open and unless you are
prepared to fund an air conditioner through Community Startup, my
application for an air conditioner will not be complete until I have
had a chance to ask my doctor to fill out my MSN forms.

The preamble to the ODSP Policy Directives states:

“Staff will provide clients with clear and up-to-date information
about ODSP, as well as other community services that may be
available, in order to assist people with disabilities to live, work
and participate in their communities.”

Your duty is clearly spelled out in the preamble to your Policy
Directives.  Your duty is to “assist people with disabilities.”

Turning my application for air conditioning over to Ontario Works,
when you either knew, or most certainly should have known, that my
application would fail, is irresponsible, negligent, and a waste of
time.  And with both my brother's and my own health at risk, you are
acting recklessly,  irresponsibly and illegally by ignoring your own
Ministry's stated mandate and guidelines.

Yours truly,

sdafasdfadf
