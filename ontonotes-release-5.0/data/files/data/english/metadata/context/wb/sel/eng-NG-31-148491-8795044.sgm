Stephen,

Put me down for 1 short and 1 jersey XL not XXL as I am losing weight!

Thanks.

Kevin

All,
If anybody is planning to order a Large, I have a large that I would like to exchange for an XL. You could have the Large immediately if you order an XL for me. Only been worn 1x and hand washed.
I'd love to wear my CFC kit, but my bulging muscles (also known as a spare tire) don't quite fit anymore.
Brent

$45.00 for SS Jerseys, $42.00 for Sleeveless Jerseys and $48.00 for Shorts $55.00 for Bibs.  We must order ten of any one item to get started.  We will need a 50% deposit which can be a check made out to HCBC.

Stephen, I need a med. shirt and short. Also, if any women need a medium shirt my sister has one new and unused. She needs a snall. So, maybe we can work something out. Brad
