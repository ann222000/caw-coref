On another space oriented forum I noted:

"It took 20 years to increase the resolution by a factor or 10 over
Viking with the Mars Global Surveyor mission. But only 10 years to
increase the resolution over that of MGS by a factor of 10 with Mars
Reconnassance Orbiter.
Could we increase the resolution over MRO by another factor of 10 to,
gulp, 3 cm per pixel in only 5 years this time?"

Funny though, that rather off-the-cuff estimate of mine is close to
what is possible.
To resolve 3 cm in the optical from say a 300 km orbit would require a
6 meter mirror. The James Webb Space Telescope will have a 6.5 meter
mirror and is scheduled for launch in 2013. But it was originally
scheduled for launch in 2011:

James Webb Space Telescope.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope

So going by this rate, it'll be 3mm/pixel 2.5 years after that, and
300 microns 1.25 years after that, and ...
Hmm, in less than a decade then we should be able to resolve microbes
from space.

Admittedly though, the JWST is a 4 billion dollar mission. Also it
uses a beryllium metal mirror for infrared astronomy only. The
beryllium makes the mirror lightweight but it is unclear if you can
achieve the much more stringent smoothness requirements at optical
wavelengths with a metal mirror.
As for the data storage and transmission of the large files for such
high resolution images, data storage capacity and costs are doubling
and halving each year, respectively:

"Currently, NAND chips double in memory density every year. The
cutting-edge 4-gigabit chips of 2005, for example, will soon be
dethroned by 8-gigabit chips. (Memory chips are measured in gigabits,
or Gb, but consumer electronics manufacturers talk about how many
gigabytes, or GB, are in their products. Eight gigabits make a
gigabyte, so one 8Gb chip is the equivalent of 1GB.)
"Another driving factor in the uptake of the technology is cost: NAND
drops in price about 35 to 45 percent a year, due in part--again--to
Moore's Law and in part to the fact that many companies are bringing on
new factories."
http://news.com.com/Bye-bye+hard+drive,+hello+flash/2100-1006_3-60058...

MRO uses the type of flash memory chips discussed here.

Also, interestingly NASA had planned a laser communication orbiter for
Mars for launch in 2010 before it was canceled:

Mars Telecommunications Orbiter: Interplanetary Broadband.

This would have allowed data transmission rates of a hundred times
greater than what is currently available.

It was the great cost overruns overruns that led to cancelling of the
Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, and great cost overruns also
threatened JWST as well.
That the costs for computer technology are dropping exponentially with
capacity increasing exponentially is no doubt fueled by the free market
in this sphere.
Conversely, that launch costs are staying static is no doubt because
the launches are controlled by large governments. When private
companies become the primary financer and purveyor of launches, the
launch costs will also drop dramatically.

Wow, from this it looks like it's going to be orbitting at the L2
Lagrangian Point, which would mean that it is stationary with respect to
the Earth and the Sun, and it will be behind the Earth on the night side
of the planet at all times, 1.5 million km's out. If it's behind the
Earth, wouldn't it automatically be shielded from the Sun's rays? Or is
the Earth's shadow not big enough out there?

Life is likely to cause an atmosphere out of chemical equilibrium.
For example on Earth free oxygen is unstable without life and would
eventually combine into rocks.

Mars is slightly out equilibrium with the presence of methane

Well, that's for sure, but I don't think it's going to be sitting
smack-dab in the centre of the Lagrangian point. I think it's actually
expected to "orbit" the point.

Also the Moon is 384 thousand km out, whereas the Lagrangian point is
1.5 million km out, so it's almost exactly 4 times further away than the
Moon. I don't think it's going to be a huge perturbation, and it will
likely be damped out by the orbiting motion.

&gt; Moon. I don't think it's going to be a huge perturbation, and it will

Another craft alread in the L2 position used a sunshade--continuously
shaded from the Sun, Earth, and Moon by the spacecraft to allow lower

Length of Earth's shadow (umbra) is about 1,400,000 km.

The math is easy: you need the size of the Sun, the distance to the
Earth, the size of the Earth, and the distance to L2. But it gets
complicated... The red arrows that point inward and the blue arrows that
point outward mean that the point is semistable. You can orbit around
the L2 (or L1 or L3) when the orbit is in a plane perpendicular to the
line between the Sun and Earth. The size of that orbit determines
whether the satellite sees the Sun.

(The Wikipedia article on Lagrange points is probably also worth
reading. I'm an expert because I read it. ;-)

L2 is too far out for Earth to block the Sun completely.  There is some
blockage, which helps make the L2 region a good place for infrared
telescopes, but solar power is still practical there if you oversize

Actually, since the distance of L2 is about 0.01au and the Earth's

It is very likely less than for Earth's atmosphere which gives a best

Actually you should check this calculation. I'm informed via email of
a mistake I made in calculating resolution on a different topic. I
didn't convert from degrees to radians.
Let me try that again. The formula for resolution is the Rayleigh
criterion:

Angular resolution.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution#Explanation

sin(θ) = 1.22λ/D

Now for the angle θ small and in *radians*, sin(θ) is approximately
equal to θ, and θ is approximately equal to the ratio of the distance
to be resolved divided by the distance to the object. A .5 arcsec angle
is .5/(60*60) = 1/7200 degrees. Converting to radians this is
(2π/360)/7200 radians. Then this is about the ratio of the resolvable
distance to the distance to the body. At 300,000 m then the resolvable
distance would be 300,000 times this or .73 m, 73 cm.
But note this is assuming the atmospheric dispersion puts the same
limit on resolution looking down as with looking up. As I said there is
some question about this. And in the case for Mars the atmospheric
dispersion limits should also be much less.

&gt; &gt;&gt;    Thanks Bob.

&gt; &gt; Actually you should check this calculation. I'm informed via email of
&gt; &gt;a mistake I made in calculating resolution on a different topic. I
&gt; &gt;didn't convert from degrees to radians.
&gt; &gt; Let me try that again. The formula for resolution is the Rayleigh
&gt; &gt;criterion:

&gt; &gt;Angular resolution.
&gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution#Explanation

&gt; &gt; sin(=CE=B8) =3D 1.22=CE=BB/D

&gt; &gt; Now for the angle =CE=B8 small and in *radians*, sin(=CE=B8) is approximat=
&gt; &gt;ely
&gt; &gt;equal to =CE=B8, and =CE=B8 is approximately equal to the ratio of the dist=
&gt; &gt;ance
&gt; &gt;to be resolved divided by the distance to the object. A .5 arcsec angle
&gt; &gt;is .5/(60*60) =3D 1/7200 degrees. Converting to radians this is
&gt; &gt;(2=CF=80/360)/7200 radians. Then this is about the ratio of the resolvable
&gt; &gt;distance to the distance to the body. At 300,000 m then the resolvable
&gt; &gt;distance would be 300,000 times this or .73 m, 73 cm.
&gt; &gt; But note this is assuming the atmospheric dispersion puts the same
&gt; &gt;limit on resolution looking down as with looking up.

&gt; Where do you see ***anything*** having to do with atmospheric
&gt; dispersion in the above.

When I was giving the resolution a mirror about Mars could achieve I
was assuming it would give diffraction limited performance. Sam raised
the question about the additional limits imposed by atmospheric
scattering.
On Earth for telescopes looking up, this puts a limit on the
resolution a scope can achieve no matter what its size. The number I've
seen quoted was the best you could do would be no better than that of a
20" scope regardless of the telescope size(!)
Large ground based telescopes without methods to counteract this such
as adaptive optics can only detect fainter objects not achieve better
resolution.
However, I've seen mentioned this doesn't happen for a satellite
looking down to the surface. In that case resolution limits imposed by
the atmosphere wouldn't apply for satellites imaging the surface.
There was some discussion on this topic on this thread:

Spy satellites for astronomy.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  It is very likely less than for Earth's atmosphere which gives a best
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; resolution of .5 arcsec even from the best sites. A .5 arcsec
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; resolution at 300 km would correspond to a resolution of 11 cm on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ground. In Mars thinner atmosphere, the results would probably be much
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; better than this.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  However, I've seen some references that suggest the effects of air
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scattering is much less pronounced looking down, as with spy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; satellites, than when looking up, as with telescopes.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  In any case adaptive optics could probably bring the seeing close to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the diffraction limit anyway.

The sentence you wrote above, following the discussion of resolution
limits, says "this is assuming the atmospheric dispersion puts the same
limit on resolution looking down as with looking up.".  Well, no, if
"this" refers to the text quoted then *this* is assuming nothing of the
sort.  That's all.

None, since orbital resolution is not how
you resolve microbes.
The only thing sattelites are going to
determine is the dust concentration in
the Martian atmoshere.
