Does will have a 31 day gestation period. Hopefully you do not have your buck
with the doe. Separate them if they are together as both babies and the buck
could be in danger. At 29 days place a nest box in the cage. The nest box
should be about 1-2 inches wider and longer then the doe. Sides should be high
enough the babies won't roll out....mine are six inches high. Provide an
absorbant bottom material (I use ground corn cob available in most pet stores).
I then give the doe a big handful of hay for her to build a comfortable nest.
She will begin to pull hair, usually within 12-24 hours of delivering the kits
(babies). If she doesn't have the babies within 48 to 72 hours of pulling hair
she will need a shot of oxytocin (I reccomend a trip to the vet for this). For
more information and a great guide book on rabbits, join the ARBA.

&gt; to the lady asking about justation for her rabbit, it can vary either 30

"/> or 31 days depending on the time of day she was breed.also if she is p.g.
her nipples will start to swell and become full,and she will begin to pull
her fur around her nipples. if you need more inf. email us at

Gestation for a rabbit is 28 to 32 days. Typically, 30 days. It is not easy
to tell if a rabbit is pregnant by looking at them. They must be palpated but
someone knowledgable. I suggest if you think she may be pregnant, put a wooden
or metal box with hay or straw in it and sit back and wait. If it has been
over 32 days since she was exposed to a buck and she still appears to be bigger
than normal I suggest you take her to a vet for a check up. She may have a
hairball or tumor, both of which are life threatening.

Please tell me she hasn't been living with a buck. If so she could be carrying
multiple pregnancies from multiple breedings and the liklihood of the kits
surviving is slim.

Males and females SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO LIVE TOGETHER unless one is
neutered.

If I can be of further help, E-Mail RABIT ... @aol.com
