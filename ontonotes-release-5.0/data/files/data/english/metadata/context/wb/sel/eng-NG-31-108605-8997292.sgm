&quot;Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people,
who have a right, from the frame of their nature, to knowledge, as their
great Creator, who does nothing in vain, has given them understandings, and
a desire to know; but besides this, they have a right, an indisputable,
unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind
of knowledge; I mean, of the characters and conduct of their rulers.&quot;

Mike's Truth Is Stronger Than Allies' Fiction
By Brian Reade

It was not just the most brilliant Oscar acceptance speech ever given
but the first Great Truth of the 21st Century.

&quot;We live in fictitious times, where we have fictitious election
results that elect a fictitious president.

&quot;We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for
fictitious reasons.&quot;

When Michael Moore delivered those words in March he outraged not just
the scalpel-riven multi-millionaires in the Los Angeles audience but
self-styled patriots on both sides of the Atlantic.

Our Boys are about to go to war, they said, and all this dirty commie
bastard can do is abuse the freedoms they are ready to die for.

But their words simply backed up Moore's belief that we were choking
in a smog of fabrication. Ask Rob Kelly, whose son Andrew was the
youngest soldier killed in Iraq. Back then he believed the fiction was
fact. Now he is incandescent over a young life laid down for a lie.

And now that the truth unravels, the smokescreen grows thicker. New
fiction is produced to distract attention away from the fiction which
killed, and still kills, so many.

Our government invents a row with the BBC to stop us finding out the
true extent of their lies. We hear of dodgy dossiers and dubious
intelligence aimed at kidding us we could be wiped out in 45 minutes.

Tony Blair shifts around like a cornered thief claiming it wasn't
Weapons of Mass Destruction that threatened us after all, but Weapons
of Mass Destruction Programmes. Programmes being more abstract, and
thus easier to &quot;find&quot;.

Meanwhile the poisonous concoction spreads around the world.
Washington claims it was fed made-up British intelligence about Iraq
obtaining uranium from Niger.

In Iraq Arnold Schwarzenegger, plugging his latest piece of celluloid
fantasy, tells US troops that The Terminator is merely an invention
but &quot;you guys are the true terminators.&quot;

And as they whoop and holler, the families of 5,000 murdered Iraqi
citizens still wail and holler over their loved ones, obscenely
terminated for fictitious reasons. George Bush flies into Africa to
establish a strategic foot-hold in the next great untapped oil-field.

He looks into a building where Alabama-bound slaves were once held in
shackles, talks about our collective shame, yet fails to realise he is
holding innocent men in shackles in Guantanamo Bay.

The most powerful man on Earth calls on all human beings to solve
poverty in Africa, where half the people live on less than a dollar a
day, yet fails to acknowledge he has just spent $ 40 billion fighting
a war for bogus reasons.

As for Tony Blair, he counts the days when he can slip out of the
firing line and head with Cherie to Cliff Richard's Barbados mansion,
where this merry band of Christians will no doubt hold hands and thank
the Lord for their own world of peace and plenty.

Take a bow, Michael Moore. You were spot-on. And nobody realises that
more than we British. How ironic that on the day the Foreign Affairs
Committee released its non-findings on the great fictional war,
Collins Dictionary declared that the word &quot;bollocks&quot; was now an
acceptable part of our language.

It has been for many months, folks. Especially at the highest level.

Wouldn't it be interesting to see what George Bush could write,
impromptu, on his own with no ghost writers, about the principles of
American democracy?

I think the product would clearly show the level of his knowledge and
character.

What a great post!

My congratulations on publically expressing the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.

I might add that Michael Moore was not alone. When the Americansd
invited us to join in the war , the Canadian public said, &quot;If the UN
inspectors say there are no weapons of mass destruction, forget it!&quot;

I and many like me here in Canada saw our contracts with American
companies cancelled to &quot;punish&quot; us for refusing to join The Great Grab
For Oil. It was worth every penny to have clean hearts and hands.

Today, our Canadian boys are in Afghanistan, fighting on two fronts -
the Taliban with their roadside bombs and the Americans with their
friendly fire. Never have I been prouder to have become a Canadian
citizen and to have left all that Blair- and Bush-inspired  bullshit
behind.

This story tells it all:

Soldier tells of twin's birthday death in Iraq

By Patrick Phelvin, Daily Telegraph.
Last Updated: 2:02am BST 01/08/2007

A British soldier who held his dying twin's hand for 10 hours after he
was mortally wounded in a bomb attack in Basra has spoken in detail
about his twin brother's final hours and his determination to return
to Iraq.

Cpl John Rigby died on June 22 while serving in 4th Battalion The
Rifles. He had suffered a serious head wound while manning the turret
of an armoured Bulldog troop carrier.

His twin brother, Will, who served in the same regiment, was awoken at
7am on what was the brothers' joint birthday. He was rushed to John's
side and made several calls to update the twins' father, Doug, during
his brother's final hours.

&quot;It's a day I will never forget, no matter how much I would like to,&quot;
Will told Radio 4's Today programme.

&quot;I was woken by my platoon commander at 7am, he had been out on an
operation with my brother. He just told me that John had been hit by a
roadside bomb and that he sustained a head injury and that he was
breathing.

&quot;I packed a few things and went straight to the battalion headquarters
to be addressed by the colonel and the doctor who dealt with John at
the scene.

&quot;I was flown almost immediately to the field hospital in Basra where I
was briefed by numerous doctors who told me of John's increasingly
worsening condition and then I spent the next 10 hours with John,
talking to John and being with him.

&quot;I am certain that he could hear what I was saying. I was joined by a
couple of colleagues, close friends of mine, and John's, and we sat
there reminiscing. It sounds quite strange but we were having a few
jokes and I'm sure John was with us at that time.&quot;

Cpl Rigby said medical staff made it clear to him that his brother was
not going to survive

&quot;Once I was shown the CAT scans there was no need for words, what I
saw I understood straight away, even with my limited medical
experience I knew it was only a matter of time before John was going
to leave us,&quot; he said.

&quot;It was our joint 24th birthday. It's a great comfort to me to have
been by John's bedside when he passed away. I came into this world
with John and 24 years to the day it brings me great comfort, and
upsets me a great deal, that I was there when he passed away.&quot;

But he said he was determined to continue his career in the Army and
return to Iraq if required to do so.

&quot;It became apparent to me and John when we arrived in Iraq the good
that British soldiers are doing,&quot; he said. &quot;People back home are not
so knowledgeable about that but as a soldier on the ground we are
making a difference, however slowly and surely that may be.

&quot;I have a job to do, I'm still a serving soldier and so I go where
they say. When I feel ready I feel that I shall go back.&quot;

His father, Doug, said he had a premonition of Army staff arriving at
their home in Rye, East Sussex, bearing bad news.

&quot;Two Army personnel arrived at our gates. In an odd sort of way I had
been expecting it, I can't explain why,&quot; he said.

&quot;We came in and drank tea, I smoked more than I should have done in a
state of complete bewilderment.

&quot;Will was able to phone me from the field hospital and give me
half-hourly updates about John's condition, which, although painful,
was very helpful because I felt very connected to what was going on at
the bedside.

&quot;He was an absolutely cracking bloke, as a son he was very special.&quot;

Mr Rigby said despite John's death he supported Will's decision to
continue serving in the armed forces, adding: &quot;We are steeled to the
possibility of John going back. When he is fit enough and ready enough
we will support him.&quot;

It's a tale that brought tears to my eyes. Losing your buddy is tough
enough; to lose your twin must be utterly devastating - esopecially on
the day that you both should both be celebrating your 24th birthday!

Yet the people who organized all this slaughter are happily sitting
home congratulating themselves on a good job well done and checking
the holiday brochures for a bit of peace and quiet in some resort, far
away from the war.

Will any of them ever appear in front of a War Crimes Commission
Tribunal?

Will pigs fly?

To quote Cicero for the nth time:

Politicians are not born; they're excreted.

Mr. Hines, you should explore the idea of creating a blog.

There is no downside to it.   Much new talent is getting exposure this
way today, and some get offers from publishers.

Just imagine, no more rejection letters from publishers.   That
alone...

Give up hawkishness, it's not going well...

Come on, sailor, we know that you love the pen almost as much as the
