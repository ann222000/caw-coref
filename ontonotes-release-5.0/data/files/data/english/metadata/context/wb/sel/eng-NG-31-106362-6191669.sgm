Rescued boy was forced to call his captor 'Dad'

It was a simple message, posted on the internet by what seemed to be
just another well-wisher who had followed the agonising hunt for the
missing schoolboy Shawn Hornbeck.

"How long are you planing (sic) to look for your son?" it inquired of
the boy's parents, signing off as Shawn Devlin of Kirkwood, Missouri.

Only yesterday, as Shawn, 15, was reunited with his family after an
extraordinary kidnap ordeal that lasted for four years, did it emerge
that the message, left on the family's website in December 2005, may
have been a cryptic cry for help from the boy himself. He was using the
surname of his captor, Michael Devlin, who forced the boy to call him
"Dad".

The 41-year-old pizza parlour manager was in custody yesterday, charged
with kidnap, after Shawn and a second boy who was snatched off the
streets last week were found at his home, in the St Louis suburb of
Kirkwood.

"It's just mind-boggling that it was that easy to hide someone in plain
sight," said Shawn's stepfather, Craig Akers, last night. "This has
been going on for four years and he's been here under our noses all
this time."

Both boys appeared well, but psychologists speculated that Shawn -
who disappeared while riding his bicycle to a friend's house in 2002,
when he was 11 - may have developed Stockholm Syndrome, a condition
in which hostages fall under the spell of their captors.

He had passed up numerous opportunities to make his getaway, it
emerged, including being allowed out to ride his bicycle in the street
outside Devlin's apartment, and trips to the shops. He told neighbours
that Devlin was his father and, when they asked about his mother's
whereabouts, became emotional and told them that she had died in a car
crash.

He spotted the "missing" posters and photographs of himself that had
been stuck to benches outside local grocery stores, along with a
computer-created image of what he might look like now, having spent
more than a quarter of his young life away from his family.

"There have been some instances where he has been aware of the efforts
going on to find him. The only comment I've heard from him so far is
that the age-progressed photo was an insult," Mr Akers revealed.

His face had been plastered in the windows of local shops and
businesses, his photograph thrust before television cameras at every
opportunity by parents who never gave up hope that he was alive.

Yet for four years, no one in the neighbourhood where he was being
held, a 30-minute drive from his family home, made the connection.

Shawn was home-schooled by Devlin but was allowed out and was "always
riding his bike and stuff," said Shavonne Butler, who lived next door
to Devlin. "He had friends in the neighbourhood," she added.

William Romer, the landlord who in January 2005 bought the complex
where Devlin lived, said he had been into the apartment only once and
was aware that a boy was living there. "He said it was his son sleeping
in back on the couch," said Mr Romer yesterday, describing Devlin as
pleasant and "kind of a plain guy".

Shawn was found after police went to the address on Friday night
looking for a second local boy, Ben Ownby, 13, who was snatched on his
way home from school on Monday. A young witness to Monday's attack had
given police a precise description of a white van seen speeding away
from the scene, ultimately leading them to Devlin's address.

An FBI spokesman said: "When our agents entered the apartment, young
Ben looked up and said, 'Are you going to take me home?' The other boy
said 'I'm Shawn Hornbeck'. After that, it was quite euphoric."

"This is probably the best day of our lives," said Mr Akers yesterday,
surrounded by signs from well-wishers that read "Miracles do happen"
and "We've missed you Shawn."

When he and the boy's mother were reunited with their child, there
"really weren't any words," he said. "There's a spilt second of shock -
the last time we saw him he was 11 years old. It kind of throws you
just for a second but once I saw his face it was 'Oh my God, that's my
son.' It was just a group hug, kisses, we told him we loved him, we
told him that he's home now."

Standing beside a composed and smiling Shawn, who is darker-haired and
several inches taller than the day he disappeared, he added that the
family had never given up hope. Mrs Akers said: "Shawn is a miracle
right here. I still feel like I'm in a dream, only now it's a good
dream, it's not the nightmare we have been living for the last four
years."
