*Guerrillas in southern Iraq set off a roadside bomb as a US convoy
went by on Monday, killing two US soldiers and wounding a third. Another
US soldier was killed, and one wounded, on Tuesday in a helicopter
accident.

*Another car bomb went off in Baghdad on Tuesday, outside the HQ of
the Iraqi police cooperating with the US, killing one policeman and
wounding 13 others.

*Some 500,000 Iraqis came out on Tuesday for the funeral of Ayatollah
Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim. As I mentioned, his brother Abdul Aziz angrily
called on US troops immediately to exit from Iraq so that Iraqis could
attend to their own security. It is quite remarkable to hear this from
someone serving in the American-appointed Interim Governing Council.
This is what radicals like Muqtada al-Sadr had been saying! Some in the
crowds chanted against the US, blaming it for failing to provide
security.

*The Badr Corps militia, about 10,000 - 15,000 strong, which has
surreptitiously retained its weaponry, is now patrolling in Najaf and
has sworn revenge on "al-Qaeda" and on "the Baath." Crowds in Najaf
chanted for slain Shiite leader Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim's nephew, Ammar,
"Revenge, revenge, O Ammar!" according to AFP. The worrisome thing is
that al-Qaeda and the Baath are both largely Sunni organizations, and
there is danger of random reprisals against Sunnis. The same source says
5,000 marched in Basra, including supporters of the Supreme Council for
Islamic Revolution in Iraq and members of the al-Da`wa Party. (The small
crowd is an index of al-Hakim's relative lack of popularity in Basra).

*I don't usually cover what is in the major US newspapers because
those are easily googled. But it is worth noting that reports out
Tuesday indicate that the US simply cannot maintain its current troop
level of 140,000 in Iraq beyond next spring, and that it would take 5
years and billions to raise two new divisions of the US military.
Likewise the LA Times brought into sharp question the idea that very
much of the violence in Iraq is being committed by outsiders, saying
most is homegrown. I think it appeals to the US to blame al-Qaeda for it
because it is embarrassing to admit that millions of Iraqis hate the US
presence, which they see as an occupation, and that thousands of them
are willing to take direct action against it. I think the Bush team is
just going to have to bite the bullet and bring in the United Nations.
This would mean that the French and Russians would get some of the oil
business that Cheney wanted to throw to Halliburton, but, well, you
can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs. Even with economic
inducements, which the Bush administration has been chintzy about
offering, it will be hard to convince other governments that they ought
to send their young men into what looks increasingly like a quagmire.

*AFP says that unknown persons set fire to banners outside the Great
Saddam Mosque in Tikrit that had expressed condolences on Ayatollah
al-Hakim's death. This action is, again, likely to be the work of Saddam
loyalists or Sunni Arab nationalists who saw al-Hakim as a
collaborationist. By the way, I don't use the phrase "Saddam loyalist"
to refer to "dead-enders." I think Sunni Arab nationalism and antipathy
to the US presence is a widespread movement and that it likely has a
vigorous future before it even if Saddam is killed.

*Abdel Salam al-Kubaisi [Kobeissi], leader of the Council of Sunni
Clergymen, has accused some Shiites according to AFP "of launching an
"ethnic cleansing" campaign in Najaf and the other holy city of Karbala
[saying that the Shiites] "have taken over the al-Hamza mosque, our only
one in Najaf, and the Hassan bin Ali mosque, our only one in Karbala."
Kubaisi admitted that he had earlier had some contact with Shiite
radical Muqtada al-Sadr, but said that Muqtada had changed after his
early June visit to Iran. On his return, Muqtada promoted usurpation of
Sunni religious properties by Shiites. (Muqtada's followers in Basra
invaded the offices overseeing Sunni properties in that city, stealing
the records, presumably to facilitate stealing the properties).
Al-Kubaisi blamed Iran for discouraging Sunni-Shiite socializing, and
for urging that Sunnis be excluded from Shiite ceremonies honoring the
Imams, at buildings called Husayniyyas. He praised the moderate stances
of Shiite Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani. (Sistani has issued a fatwa
forbidding the usurpation of Sunni property). Al-Kubaisi said that
Sunnis have responded calmly to these provocations, not out of
cowardice, but out of a sense that now is the time to preserve calm. He
bitterly denounced Muqtada al-Sadr for implying that Sunni Muslims were
behind the Najaf mosque bombing, and said that he couldn't rule out the
possibility that the Sadrists themselves committed it. Al-Kubaisi had
earlier been accused of funneling large amounts of money from Saudi
Arabia to Muqtada al-Sadr. If this charge were ever true, the
relationship appears to have broken down after Muqtada's visit to Iran
in June. Al-Zaman carries the AFP story, but puts an incredibly positive
and optimistic spin on it, leading with al-Kubaisi's belief that the
Najaf bombing will not provoke a religious civil war in Iraq, because of
the moderate character of the clerical leadership of the two
communities. I looked the original up, and could hardly believe it was
the same article. Al-Bazzaz, the owner of al-Zaman, is close to several
figures in the American-appointed Interim Governing Council.

Al-Zaman did report al-Kubaisi's bitter reproach of the Interim
Governing Council for appointing Shiites to head the Ministry of Pious
Endowments (which oversees mosques), and to oversee the country's
seminaries. He said the two men chosen lacked the credentials for these
tasks. Earlier in the summer, I was told by a US observer in the region
that al-Kubaisi was being considered as minister of Pious Endowments,
but I think this appointment would have been seen as a slap in the face
by the majority Shiites. So some of this speech may be pique.

*Helena Cobban has more comments today on my posting about the build
up to the Iraq war. As far as I can tell, the difference between us is
that I am not a complete pacifist. I prefer peace, and think every
effort should be made to maintain it. But I also do believe in
collective security (remember that I am an idiosyncratic Baha'i). So I
think the UN Security Council has the authority to authorize military
intervention in places like Bosnia and Afghanistan. The UNSC has a clear
duty to authorize such intervention where a state has committed
aggression on another. I personally think it also ought to intervene to
stop ongoing or incipient genocides of the sort Saddam was waging
against the Marsh Arabs. Saddam was a serial aggressor on a mass scale
inside and outside his country, and probably responsible for hundreds of
thousands murdered. He was in material breach of large numbers of UNSC
resolutions. I think the Iraq war could have been justified on grounds
of international law, and if the US had gotten a Security Council
Resolution I would have actively supported the endeavor. I don't think
the war was essentially wrong; I think it was procedurally wrong. And,
the unilateralism that undermined the moral authority of the US in Iraq
also left it bereft of needed international resources for establishing
security and for rebuilding. It is turning into a disaster because it
wasn't done right. For the record, I lived in Beirut off and on between
fall of 1975 and spring of 1979, and saw lots of death and destruction,
and have a fair idea what war is. I don't like it. For one thing, mortar
shells going off nearby make you nervous and give you a headache even
when they don't maim or kill you. But war isn't always unjustified or
always a bad thing in the big picture. D-Day was a blessing for the
people of Europe, and for the world.
