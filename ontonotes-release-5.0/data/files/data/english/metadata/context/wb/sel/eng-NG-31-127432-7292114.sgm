Skopje airports, statues and the Bible
A new dish of Macedonian salad

by Evangelos Kofos

(This is an edited version of an op. ed. published in the Athens daily
"Kathimerini", 3 February 2007)

The renaming of the airports of Skopje and Ohrid to "Alexander the
Great" and "St. Paul", respectively, has triggered an emotional
reaction among a segment of the Greek public. Some reacted scornfully
considering this initiative by FYROM's authorities as rather "absurd",
a gift to cartoonists. Others felt annoyed by the falsification and
appropriation of what they considered as their cherished Greek
Macedonian identity and cultural heritage. These feelings were
accentuated by the fact that over the past few years statues of
Alexander the Great have been erected in certain towns of the
neighbouring country (Shtip, Prilep), as well as at the news that a
series of new monuments are in line to commemorate king Philip II,
Alexander's father, and even the Macedonian born philosopher,
Aristotle, Alexander's tutor. Following an unmistakable public
expression of dissatisfaction by Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis as
well as Deputy Ministers I. Valinakis and E. Stylianides, the once
stagnant issue over FYROM's state name between Athens and Skopje has
resurfaced.

It would be clumsy and trivial to start a dialogue over a hint of
jitteriness of certain nationalistic circles in FYROM. More important
is for the Greek public to comprehend and deliberate over the reasons
of this "provocative" action – as assessed by the EU Enlargement
Commissioner Olli Rehn.

Certain sceptics contend that this provocation is nothing more than an
addendum to a costless—for Skopje—diplomatic bargaining deal, to be
bartered at some future date for Athens' "capitulation" on the name
issue. This is hardly the case. The causes are deep-seated and linked
directly to a long-going process in FYROM, especially after its
declaration as an independent country in 1991: they aim at reshaping
and expanding the historical myth of the ethnogenesis of the
"Macedonian nation".

The traditional theory, shaped in former Yugoslavia since the 1940s,
placed the onset of the identity of the Macedonian Slavs—the
Makedonci—to the descent of the early Slav tribes to Macedonia (6th
century AD). The historical dogma, currently taking shape in FYROM,
backtracks the origins of this modern Slav Macedonian nation a full
millennium to include the ancient Macedonians (5th century BC). This
revisionist historical dogma, is not limited to encroaching upon the
identity of a Hellenic people of the classical times. It aims at
expanding the boundaries of the historical "taktovina" (fatherland) of
the "Makedonci" to include wide regions of Greece and Bulgaria. It is
well known, that for decades the classrooms and school textbooks of
history in FYROM have been adorned with maps portraying Macedonia's
"geographic and ethnic", i.e. Slavic boundaries extending all the way
to Mount Olympus and Chalkidiki, in Greek Macedonia as well as to the
Pirin district of Bulgaria. Now, by claiming the patrimony of the
Ancient Macedonians, the boundaries of "Greater Macedonia" assume a
much wider historical and cultural dimension in time.

This "improved", triplex revision, redefining the fatherland's
identity, the time span of the ethnogenesis process of its people, and
the historical heritage of land and peoples, consists of two equally
important dimensions: First, it provides the emerged Macedonian
independent state with enlarged "ancestral" lands (regardless of the
fact that these lands are integral parts of Greece and Bulgaria).
Second, it enriches the Makedonski nation with a plethora of renowned
historical figures and events. The expanded historical pantheon seeks
to include Alexander the Great, King Philip II, Aristotle, (4th
century BC), and the first European Christians who accepted the
preaching of St. Paul during his visit to the Macedonian cities of
Philippi, Thessaloniki, and Beroea, (lst century AD). Similarly,
medieval historical figures fall pray to the ongoing "macedonization"
process. Among them, a recent addition to the list of eminent
"ancestors", is the Byzantine Emperor Basil II, the "Macedonian"
(known also as "Basil the Bulgar- Slayer"), along with the other
"Macedonian", though of a different lineage, Czar Samuel, Emperor of
the Bulgarians (10th century AD).

This undertaking, however, does not aim to serve historical accuracy.
Instead, it aspires to the formation of a libro d'oro, a respectable
passport for the country's eventual entry into the European Union of
27.

Let's now address the timely issue of what appears a sudden "epidemic"
manifesting itself through the erection of monuments, the renaming of
streets, airports, etc., with names of Ancient Greek historical
origin. Judging by the recent publications in the European press,
dozens of foreign correspondents are invited to FYROM, where besides
the generous hospitality they can enjoy, they receive a satisfactory
dose of brainwashing about this novel ethnogenetic doctrine.

The reasons behind the renaming of the Ohrid airport to St. Paul were
less—if at all—discernible to the Greeks. No one, of course, is
contending for the identity of the Apostle, hence the proclamation
made by Skopje that the name change pays homage to the 'Apostle of the
Nations.' Behind this act, however, remain hardly hidden dimensions of
the continuous expansion of our neighbours' historical doctrine.

Over the last years, the historical assertions of "Republika
Makedonija" portray the "Macedonskii taktovina" as a country of the
Bible, and, specifically, as the first European territory where
Christian churches were established. It is mentioned in the Acts of
the Apostles that while at Troja, Paul witnessed a vision of a
Macedonian calling him to come to Macedonia and help his people. He
responded, crossed Chryssopoli (present day Kavala) and before
arriving in Athens and Corinth preached Christ's teachings to the
cities of Philippi, Thessaloniki and Beroea, where he became accepted
by "Judaeans" and "Greeks" alike. (New Testament, Acts, chapters 16,
paras 9,12 and 17, para. 4).

Therefore, the name of the Ohrid airport is not so "innocent" after
all. Nor can it be considered as an expression of Christian
devoutness, in a region mostly surrounded by a Muslim/Albanian
population. Notwithstanding that Paul never set foot on the lands of
the modern FYROM, the state propagandists in Skopje, by giving the
Apostle's name to the Ohrid airport, attempt to convey two messages:
First, that St. Paul's mission is a cherished religious and cultural
component of "their" nation's patrimony, thus justifying its
appropriation for the promotion of their tourist industry. Second, in
an indirect way, it provides attractive elements to propagate,
shamelessly, their territorial fantasies over the Greek Macedonian
regions, visited by St. Paul. Claiming Philippi, Thessaloniki and
Beroea as sections of their homeland from the first century AD (that
is, five centuries prior to the gradual descent of Slavic tribes
towards the south), they aim in what is now a classic equation: If
Paul was invited by a vision of a Macedonian to preach the Christian
faith in three Macedonian cities, and if Skopje has a constitutional
monopoly over the unscathed Macedonian name, then the territory, the
citizens and the history of Macedonia through the ages, belong
exclusively to them...

In a few words, this is precisely the message conveyed by this new
dish of "salade Macedoine". And, in an indirect way, it reveals the
core to the long-standing name dispute between Greece and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

*****

Article 7 of the Interim Accord between Greece and FYROM (1995) states
the following: "If either Party believes one or more symbols
constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used
by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention
of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate
corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to
do so."

The Greek people, in general, and our Macedonians, in particular, wish
to know the steps taken by the Greek government toward FYROM, and,
more importantly, how the latter responded. Yet, irrespective of the
response, it would be worthwhile to place it in the Greek delegation's
files when the EU embarks on accession talks with Greece's northern
neighbour.
