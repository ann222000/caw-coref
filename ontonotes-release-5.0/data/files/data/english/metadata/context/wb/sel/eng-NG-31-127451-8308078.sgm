All I get from these jerks and fascists is personal attacks, explaining that
I need to &quot;study science&quot;, when I am a Mechanical Engineer, inducted into
national honor society for high grade point at U of Utah (Tau Beta Pi)
having studied Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, 4 courses in Thermodynamics,
Electrical Engineering, Partial Differential Equations, Physics, Kinematics,
Strength of Materials, Fluid Dynamics, Incompressible Flow, Computer
Programming (Fortran), majored in Biology at UNC-G and BYU, took Comparative
Vertebrate Anatomy, Genetics, to name a few, also am a Medical Technologist,
with 4 years of experience in Parasitology in United States Army,
Hematology, Blood Banking, Virology, Bacteriology, Chemistry, Urinalysis,
was emergency night lab tech at Lumberton General Hospital, NC whiled
working during the day at Ft. Bragg as a Spec 5, doing Parasitic exams of
Viet Nam returnees, while serving as Elder's President of the 3rd Quorum,
Raleigh Stake, after receiving my first vision. So I have studied more
science than these liars and smear merchants ever dreamed of. It is obvious
evolution cannot be subjected to the scientific method, for life cannot be
created in the lab, fool. We have to accept on faith on their insistence
that this occurred billions of years ago through a random process, which Sir
Isaac Newton rejected as a valid explanation for the existence of the Solar
System, much less a Mitochondrion, or more, a cell, not to speak of
organisms. Evolutionism is a fairy tale for grownups. Spontaneous Generation
is false, even over billions of years. These say that making the same
mistake (water flowing uphill, contradicting the 2nd Law of Thermo) over
billions of years will violate that law. A definition of insanity, making
the same mistake over and over again, expecting a different result. Insane!
Reprobate mind. Grow up, fools and blind. Repent ye! Repent ye, I command
you, having authority, for I am an eyewitness there is a God, for I was
caught up to the third heaven where I beheld for myself, and I lie not, I
beheld such glory that the human imagination cannot imagine it.

If you have &quot;studied&quot; science, and still do not understand the basic

Here's a quiz for you then.
Give me an ensemble where water flows uphill, violating the second law
of thermodynamics, but not violating Newtonian mechanics. Obviously
water does not fall up, so if it violated both then what you said
would be stupid and obviously you are anything but stupid.

been a diploma mill. I have no degrees in any subject but I do know the
_basics_ of science at least. You do not, no matter about how many degrees
you brag. Go figure.

But hey, go ahead and keep doing our work for us. To show that morontheists
are totally full of it we only need to point at you, no work on our side
needed at all.

I verely say onto you, my lost servant, Art Bulla, that thy formal
education shall not give ye the authority; the records of thy
education are not enough to face my records which are many, very many.
As being descendant of the dark designers of the piramids, I am
endowed with the holy priesthood of eternal knoledge and thou are
nothing, nothing!

So repent and come back to thy master who still awaits for you up in
the hill for your shadow and with open arms.  Come my ignorant servant
and thou shall not be destroyed and melted in the abyss of hell along
with the liars of the great and abominable coorporation near the
mountais once belonging to the greater civilization.

For I tell unto you, that inasmuch ye shall follow thy master, ye
shall obtain knowledge, knowledge which shall lead you the eternal and
everlasting truth; that I am the greatest and wisest one of all.

After uttering such wise words, the Master retreated to the meditation
state and received more revelation; revelation which shall be given to
the lost servant Bulla in its due time; for an ignorant servant is not
worthy of the conveying of  knowledge as it is a waste of the master's
eternal and precious time.

Amen.

False. Evolution makes predictions - and if they failed then evolution
would be falsified.
For example evolution predicts that if you look at the molecular
details of two creatures you think are closely related (on gross
anatomical grounds ) - say Orang utangs and humans - that they would
resemble each other more closely than say Orangs and frogs or humans
and frogs.
And guess what! Evolution passes that observational test.
If things had been created individually by magic there would be no
reason why humans should resemble Orangs more than they resemble birds
or frogs or whatever.
If they have evolved from common ancestors then they would resemble
each other more closely when they have a more common ancestor - which
is exactly what we observe.

&gt;&gt; &gt; And guess what! Evolution passes that observational test.
&gt;&gt; &gt; If things had been created individually by magic there would be no
&gt;&gt; &gt; reason why humans should resemble Orangs more than they resemble birds
&gt;&gt; &gt; or frogs or whatever.
&gt;&gt; &gt; If they have evolved from common ancestors then they would resemble
&gt;&gt; &gt; each other more closely when they have a more common ancestor - which
&gt;&gt; &gt; is exactly what we observe.

&gt;&gt; Just because orangutans and humans have some physical resemblance doesn't
&gt;&gt; make evolution true. That's a ridiculous jump to conclusions. Humans and
&gt;&gt; orangutans each have their own distinctive set of traits and
&gt;&gt; characteristics
&gt;&gt; that set them apart from each other. By your logic there might be some
&gt;&gt; human
&gt;&gt; being out there with the gene information for orangutan. Why hasn't there
&gt;&gt; been in human history any human that was part orangutan?

&gt; You don't seem to understand the concept of COMMON ANCESTOR. Once you
&gt; do, you'll be able to answer that question yourself.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  for life cannot be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; created in the lab, fool.

&gt;&gt; &gt; non sequitur
&gt;&gt; &gt; Also &quot;life hasn't been created in the Lab yet.&quot; Doesn't mean it will
&gt;&gt; &gt; never happen or cannot ever happen.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; We have to accept on faith on their insistence
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that this occurred billions of years ago through a random process,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sir
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Isaac Newton rejected as a valid explanation for the existence of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Solar
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; System, much less a Mitochondrion, or more, a cell, not to speak of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; organisms.

&gt;&gt; &gt; See - someone who understood the science would never say things like
&gt;&gt; &gt; this.
&gt;&gt; &gt; What you just wrote is strong evidence that you dont know what
&gt;&gt; &gt; evolution is or what it says.
&gt;&gt; &gt; That evidence trumps any bragging about your alleged education.

&gt;&gt; Evolution is a random process that happened over a billion of years.
&gt;&gt; Typical
&gt;&gt; Darwinist always changing the facts to suit his beliefs.

&gt; Evolution is not a random process. It is the ability to survive long
&gt; enough to reproduce. That's not random. The only random process takes
&gt; place in the genes.

Evolution states that molecules in the primordial soup by accident formed
the first living cell. That was a random process. Scientists are continuing
to figuring out just how complex a cell is making evolution's explanation
less and less plausible except for die hard fanatical atheists such as
yourself and the others on this newsgroup. Once organism reproduce,
according to the theory of evolution, there has to be a way to evolve to the
next level, to develop new bodily traits, in other words to increase in
genetic information. This according to the theory happens by mutation and
natural selection. Mutation as we have explained only disrupts and deforms
information if there is any effect at all. Natural selection only selects
from preexisting traits and cannot add new information. This whole process
is so random that it is impossible to expect that complex life forms like
plants, animals, and humans could be derived from such a process.

Aaron, you keep claiming that &quot;we have explained&quot; stuff,
but you really don't do anything more than make assertions.
Then, when this is pointed out to you, you either ignore
this, or go off and make more assertions.

Here's an example of you doing this with me twice:

===
Aaron Kim:
I addressed this question before. The bacteria already
had the capability to eat nylon. There was no new change.

RetroProphet:
I see an assertion -- but where's the science
to back it up, Aaron?

You did not present any science when you made the
assertion previously:

&quot;Typical atheist evolutionist deliberately trying
to confuse the subject with more esoteric crap.
You speculate that bacteria grew the ability to
eat rayon. Scientists lie like you do. What has to
be the case is that the bacteria already had the
ability to eat rayon and it was through natural
selection that this bacteria existed.&quot;

If the bacteria was &quot;created&quot; with the ability to
digest nylon, how did natural selection preserve
this ability through all the years that no nylon
existed anywhere on Earth for it to eat?

Aaron Kim:
&lt;nothing to say&gt;

===

Aaron, talk scientifically or sit down already.

Present, finally, a precise DNA-level explanation
that supports your assertion that the &quot;Nylon Bug&quot;
&quot;already&quot; had the capability to eat nylon, disproving
the explanation that it was the result of a fortuitous
frame-shift mutation.

Perhaps your assertion is correct, but science isn't
built on assertions -- it's not like theology.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would be falsified.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; For example evolution predicts that if you look at the molecular
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; details of two creatures you think are closely related (on gross
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; anatomical grounds ) - say Orang utangs and humans - that they would

water better then another one, and it will dominate one that can't.
What the molecule is has an element of randomness to it, but how it
thrives (or not) is completely explicable and relative to it's
environment. When the environment changes, the ones with the traits
best suited for the new environment will survive. The ones that aren't
suited to it can't. There's nothing random about this. Get over the

Stop lying.  what you describe is abiogenesis, which is seperate from

And you lie about abiogenesis. No one states that random chemicals
formed the first cells, but rather that amino acids (which we have

protein that could replicate itself. Cells were a long way off when

&gt;is so random that it is impossible to expect that complex life forms like
&gt;plants, animals, and humans could be derived from such a process.

&gt; &gt; If things had been created individually by magic there would be no

&gt; &gt; If they have evolved from common ancestors then they would resemble
&gt; &gt; each other more closely when they have a more common ancestor - which
&gt; &gt; is exactly what we observe.

&gt; Just because orangutans and humans have some physical resemblance doesn't

Thats right it doesn't.
However if you have two creatures with a recent common ancestor then
they would tend to look alike.

It's just one piece of evidence.

Evolution is not a random process - it is directed by whether or not
things survive to reproduce.
(Natural selection.)
Just as farmers choose which animals to breed to improve stock
characteristics.
They choose the animals that grow fastest and have the tastiest meat
and the best resistance to disease etc.
That is another non - random selection process.

&gt; &gt; Evolution is not a random process. It is the ability to survive long
&gt; &gt; enough to reproduce. That's not random. The only random process takes
&gt; &gt; place in the genes.

&gt; Evolution states that molecules in the primordial soup by accident formed
&gt; the first living cell.
">

No - you are mistaken.
Evolution is the process by which living things change over time - it
works because there is a process of INHERITANCE -(offspring acquire
the characteristics of their parents)  and because there is VARIATION
(mixing and mutation) and there is SELECTION - the weak or unfit tend
to die without leaving offspring.
Given these things you cant STOP things from evolving!

Now how did the first organism arise?
No one knows for sure, but we know a few things
All living things are made of the same types of molecules - proteins,
DNA and RNA, sugars, fats .
Essentially all life is made of C,H,N,O,P,Ca,S  - all elements that
are common and react naturally with each other.
These molecules (or at least their component parts) can form
spontaneously by chemical reactions from water, methane etc.
Long ago the earth had no free oxygen so as these pre life molecules
formed they could accumulate and interact.

With enough time and the right sort of environment - perhaps catalyzed
by clay minerals or in some other way we dont understand yet the first
self replicating chemical systems arose - once that happened then
Evolution kicks in.

Once evolution is operating then organisms can reach any level of
diversity and complexity.

&gt; It's not a personal attack to point out that you're clearly a
&gt; delusional loon.
">

Usually when you're losing an argument is when you start to rely personal
attacks which is what you and the other Darwinists have been doing. The
science is against you and favors intelligent design.

(&quot;Reclaiming Science from Darwinism&quot; by Kenneth Poppe)

Though some nonbelievers may dismiss faith diplomatically,
others say straight out what the rest believe-&quot;Take your religious fables
and your other superstitions and go join the rest of the Flat Earth
Society.&quot; But their turf is slipping away. Debates in boardrooms,
legislatures, and courtrooms are being less and less favorable to evolution,
and even people in coffeehouses, teacher lounges, and business gatherings
are less inclined to hold their tongues when Darwinists pontificate.

The Rise of a New Alternative

In large measure this change is coming about because of a revolution that
began to get the general public's attention toward the end of the twentieth
century. A group of scientists and mathematicians arose to challenge natural
evolution in a new way. They were not invoking the names of deities, and
they were using few or no quotations from religious or holy writings.
Furthermore, these were not spiritual leaders who had learned to incorporate
a touch of science into their rhetoric. They were professors and researchers
with impeccable academic credentials and impressive scientific achievements
who worked with formulas, specimens, charts, and glassware. These
thought-provoking individuals did not seek to dismantle sub theories
pertaining to origins, such as the big bang, primordial soup, or survival of
the fittest. Instead, they were challenging the scientific community with
new concepts such as irreducible complexity, universal probability bound,
and complex specified information-&quot;unreligious sounding&quot; concepts that
forcefully explained how the blind luck so indispensable in Darwinism could
never do the impossible. Though they were working outside the monopoly of
mainstream science and were frequently ostracized by it, from PhDs to people
on the street, they were still turning heads. The reason? To borrow a
political phrase, their logic &quot;resonated&quot; with the general population in a
way Darwinism never had. These new spokespersons eventually coalesced under
the banner of the word design, and going into the twenty-first century, the
phrase intelligent design became the most recognized and repeated
identifier. Regardless of their backgrounds, the arguments by these
dissenters to Darwinism were, and still are, basically the same. In contrast
to the above summary of evolution, the key concepts of Design could be
stated thus:* The processes and phenomena currently operating within the
universe and on Earth are insufficient to produce themselves. No amount of
natural evolutionary theory can account for the complexity and compatibility
that are continually observed by science. Therefore, there must be a guiding
intelligence repeatedly involved in creating the complexity, but not
subjected to it. Such complexity must always be the result of intended
information because there is a mathematical limit to what blind luck can
accomplish. The strength of these words becomes more evident when we see how
Design has helped level the playing field. Now people in state and national
legislatures, governor's mansions, courts of law, and school boardrooms are
calling for the academic honesty to at least allow theories challenging
natural evolution to be taught as well.' Design's superior appeal is not
evident just from the many high profile governmental initiatives promoting
it, but also from the surging grassroots approval of people who study it. By
comparison, Darwinism's influence is waning as further probes beneath the
attractive artificial turf * Throughout this book, I use Design (capital D)
to refer to theories of origins that propose the involvement of a guiding
intelligence. t See chapter 14 for some comments on key legal cases.

Apostles of &quot;blind luck&quot; continue to hit only infertile soil. Additional
evidence of the failure of Darwinism is that in debates or response papers
over Design, strict evolutionists increasingly look like people backed into
a corner, resorting more and more to name-calling, irrational statements,
and temper flashes rather than scientific rebuttal.
