Hi,

Anyone knows how to localize Seamonkey *globally* for all users?
Apparently there's no way to build it like Firefox, that is, using the --
enable-gui-locale=ab_CD option. On the other hand, when I open the
fr_FR.xpi file as user, Seamonkey only gets localized for that one single
user.

cheers,

Niki

I know. But there's no option there to change the GUI locale to fr system-
wide.

There's some localized builds of Seamonkey and language packs here:

Thanks, but I know that. I want to rebuild Seamonkey from source to build
only the browser. Which I've succeeded to do so far.

Now the question is: how do you install, say, the fr_FR*.xpi language
plugin *and enable it by default for all users, system-wide*??? That! is
the question.

Apparently, there's no way to do that. And I'm beginning to get a bit
nervous about that, because I've spent the best part of a sunny day
trying to localize an app that can't handle localization in a normal way.
mozilla.org has thousands of pages, most of them crammed with useless
information. As far as I can gather, users are not expected to build any
mozilla app from source.

*sigh*

If you install the xpi package as root it will go to
/usr/lib/seamonkey-1.x.x and will be available for all users : system-wide

Well, if these are users yet to be created, perhaps you could put an
appropriate set of files in /etc/skel.

Just get Firefox.  Mozilla has already done that for you.
