Hi There

I see guys sometimes wearing Garb. bags when doing cardio,  does the
extra sweating help?
Is there any benefit whatsoever?

Thanks   Liam

It will make you sweat more, but you'll just drink it back later.  The
only purpose would be to make weight for a weigh-in.  Generally
speaking, you want to minimize, not maximize, water loss via sweating
during exercise.

I'm 52, have been working out regularly for the last 7 years.  I've
always sweated more than anyone I know.  When I'm through with the
elliptical machine (after about 45 minutes, with at least 30 of those
minutes being in the 115-125 bpm range) my shirt is a soaking rag.  I
have to go change it to continue with any machines or stretching I
might want.

I fill up a small Aqua Blue water bottle before I start, and don't
drink any until after I'm about 14 minutes into my workout.  From
there on, I drink one swig every 5 minutes.

I'm curious Opinions as to whether I should cut back the intensity so
I don't sweat so much.

Think nothing of it.  Sweat is not a measure of intensity, or fitness,
or health, or age, or gender, or anything other than your genetic
makeup regarding how active your sweat glands are--one of your parents
probably sweats a lot under exertion, too.  I know people who seem to
do little more than "glow" no matter how hard they're working, and
others who start dripping only a couple of minutes into a warmup.

Do think more of drinking more water during your workouts!  You might
be shocked if you knew just how many ounces you sweat out during your
workouts, and dehydration can sneak up on you.  It is never a good
thing.

I really wish you would not change the subject of a thread.  If you
want to start a new topic, post a new thread, not a "follow
up" (response).  By changing the subject, the nature of the original
thread might be "lost", depending on how a person's newsreader
presents the thread.

Indicating your HR tells us little.  What is more important is your
%maxHR.  I would __not__ assume that your maxHR is 168 (220 - 52) and
therefore 115-125 is 68-74% MHR.  But if that is what you assume, that
is not very strenuous exercise for the majority of your session.  What
is (%M)HR for the other 15 minutes?

By the way, I am not suggesting that you exercise more strenuously.
If the exercise feels strenuous at that HR, either your MHR estimate
is too high, or there are other conditions that cause you to perceive
strenuous exercise.  At any rate, you are doing the right thing if you
are "listening to your body".  I am simply making the point that
telling us your HR tells us little.

I was afraid Steve's comments might evoke this kind of undue concern.

Each person sweats more or less according to his/her individual
needs.  Obese people tend to sweat more than "usual", even at low
HRs.  I would be concerned about the amount of sweat only if it is one
of many symptoms that could indicate another problem.  For example, if
you also felt dizzy.  Otherwise, there is no reason to cut back.  I
begin to sweat just thinking about exercise -- or so it seems.

What I hope Steve meant to say is:  it is unwise to increase sweating
artificial, specifically by raising body heat.  Excessive sweating
does put extra demands on the body.  For example, you lose
electrolytes at a higher rate.  And of course you dehydrate at a
higher rate.

To that end, if you do sweat a lot, you might need to replenish water
at faster pace than "normal".  You might also need to replenish
electrolytes at a faster pace.  What is "normal"?  No one really
knows.  But there are some guidelines that experts tout.  I'm not sure
I remember them correctly off-hand; something like 1 pint of fluid for
every hour of strenuous exercise, and consider drinking an electrolyte-
enhanced fluid or otherwise replenishing electrolytes if you exercise
strenuously for much more than 1 hour.

One way to gauge your water needs is to weigh yourself before and
after exercise.  If you see a substantial change, it is due to water
loss, and you should hydrate more during exercise.  Of course, weigh
yourself nude or in the same dry clothes.  Otherwise, you are simply
weighing all the water that your clothes soaked up.

And during exercise, follow this simple guideline:  do not wait until
you are thirsty to drink.

Smelly sweat might be indicative of a problem.  Usually clothes and
sweat smell badly due to bacteria building-up.  (Certain foods can
also affect body odor.)  I choose clothes that wick sweat away from
the body.

This is true.  At least my palms don't sweat.  Some people have their
sweat glands removed or reduced by surgery.  Problem is, their palms
sweat.  Not a good trade off in my book.

Ok, what I usually do is take a swig or two of water before I start.
Then like I said usually 2 after about 15 minutes, then 5 minutes
until I'm through with the elliptical.  When I move to the weight
machines, I'm drinking more.  Maybe I'm trying to make up?  I don't
know.

It does seem to me, however, that I don't work out as intensely as
quickly if I drink more water earlier on in my workout.  Seems I read
in a fitness book about drinking 1/4 cup of water after 15 minutes
(which is about what I do).  But maybe this is outdated?

Of course, the flip side is the story I read recently about a woman
runner who drank way too much water, collapsed, and died.

Try this.  Got a scale handy?  Weigh yourself just before your workout,
and again just after your workout.  Nude, so it's just you, not
sweat-laden clothes.  The difference in your weights is the amount of
water you sweated out during your workout, that you didn't offset by
drinking.  That's how much more you should be drinking to avoid
dehydration.

That's because she was running a lot, and she needed electrolytes along
with the water.  Electrolytes are what makes your sweat salty, and
they're also what helps your heart and muscles function.  Electrolytes
(mostly potassium and sodium) need replenishing at some point, too,
otherwise bad things happen.  But you don't need to worry about that,
you're just doing your regular workouts.  Anything under 90 minutes or
so, you're fine with just water.

For your purposes, it's just water.   The amount of fat loss from a

Depends on how long and hard the workout is.  Most folks work out for
anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes.  They don't need to eat extra food
afterward, and in fact if the goal is fat loss, this can be
counterproductive because one may snack in more calories than were
burned out.  Folks who are training for a competitive event often eat
something both before and after, but then they are training longer and
harder than the rest of us.  They are careful about what that extra
food is, too.

Aren't some foods burned off faster, though?  For instance, I'd read
long ago in Prevention Magazine about the Peanut Butter Diet.
Something about the ingredients lend themselves to speeding up the
metabolism, or something.  So my routine is usually this:  drive home
from work, eat dinner, rest for about an hour, drive to gym.  By the
time I get there it's about 8:15.  I do the elliptical for about 45
minutes, then do the weight machines for about 30 minutes, then
stretch for about another 30.  I drive home and eat an Eggo whole
wheat waffle toasted, and put some Laura Scudders natural peanut
butter in it, fold it up and eat it like a sandwich.  I know the
peanut butter has 210 calories, and the waffle about 50, but wouldn't
my body be burning some of this off after having gone through the
above mentioned workout?

&gt; long ago in Prevention Magazine about the Peanut Butter Diet.
&gt; Something about the ingredients lend themselves to speeding up the
&gt; metabolism, or something.  So my routine is usually this:  drive home
&gt; from work, eat dinner, rest for about an hour, drive to gym.  By the
&gt; time I get there it's about 8:15.  I do the elliptical for about 45
&gt; minutes, then do the weight machines for about 30 minutes, then
&gt; stretch for about another 30.  I drive home and eat an Eggo whole
&gt; wheat waffle toasted, and put some Laura Scudders natural peanut
&gt; butter in it, fold it up and eat it like a sandwich.  I know the
&gt; peanut butter has 210 calories, and the waffle about 50, but wouldn't
&gt; my body be burning some of this off after having gone through the
&gt; above mentioned workout?

There's no consensus on this point.  Basically it's always calories in
versus calories out.  That's not to say that some foods can't help, of
course, e.g., I (and many others) find healthy fats very satisfying and
therefore helpful in reducing total calories.  There's also some
evidence to suggest that certain kinds of exercise on an empty stomach
might help facilitate fat burning but, again, there's no universal
agreement on this point.  Personally, I have found going through most of
my day without much in the way of food works very well for me.  See
http://www.warriordiet.com for more on this approach, or Google
"intermittent fasting" for more reading.

Staying well hydrated is good for long-term health and weight, so it's
important to put back any water you sweat off during exercise.
