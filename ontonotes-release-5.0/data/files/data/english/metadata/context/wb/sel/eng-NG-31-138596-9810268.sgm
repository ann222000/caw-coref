Dear Clement:

Thanks for the correction and clarifications!

Two key statements in your well argued response are:

&quot;So far, it is the Northern part that has  been handed over. The Western and
Southern parts, aptly called the &quot;Bakassi  Zone&quot; is scheduled to be handed
over in June 2008.

Stop telling Nigerians what is not the  truth! It is not a done deal until
June 2008.&quot;--Clement  Ikpatt

Even though I am not a lawyer, I have always considered that a deal is done
when the two parties in a transaction or dispute
sign on the dotted lines in the presence of one or more witnesses. The next
phase after signing an agreement is the implementation of the agreement. One
party in an agreement cannot unilaterally  decide to alter any item in the
agreement during the implementation phase without the consent of the other
party.

What the Senate appears to be urging the FGN to do is to renege on an
international agreement that has been duly signed by a former legitimate  government
of Nigeria led by President Obasanjo. I think it is wishful thinking  on our
part as Nigerians to expect that the Cameroonians will simply roll over  and
accept any amendments to the Green Tree Agreement, considering that the
amendments we would seek concern the 'juiciest' portion of land that was in
contention before the agreement.

Let us pray that we do not have a war in our region of the world again
either about Bakassi or any other matter. The war over Bakassi will not be  limited
to fighting the Republic of Cameroon, as Nigeria will also be fighting
against the world's public opinion as represented by the UN and other  multilateral
institutions and the selfish interests of some other nations  including the
USA, Britain, France, Germany and a host of others.

The Nigerian Armed Forces might need less than one week to subdue the
Cameroonian army, but I seriously doubt if we have enough military muscle to  defeat
Cameroon if it is heavily backed by the world's only superpower--the USA  and
other developed nations.

Saddam Hussein invaded tiny Kuwait based on the logic that the mighty Iraq
army was invincible. We all know what happened subsequently! I pray that the
FGN  does not make the same mistake. I doubt if it will for the following
reasons:

1) Declaration of war against another sovereign nation is a  prerogative of
the President NOT the Senate.

2) President Yar'adua is unlikely to declare war against the Republic of
Cameroon as long as the latter does not encroach on Nigerian territory beyond
what is allowed in the Green Tree Agreement.

Thank you.

Bye,

Ola

Dr. Kassim:

What you excerpted is by Hon. Essien Ayi representing Akpabuyo  federal
constituency in the House of Reps. Hon. Ayi is not Sen. Ewa  Henshaw.

I know Essien Ayi. We schooled together. I am not suprised by his  reaction.
And he, like most Nigerians, have this erroneous impression that  Bakassi is
completely in the hands of Cameroon. That is NOT true.

So far, it is the Northern part that has been handed  over. The Western and
Southern parts, aptly called the &quot;Bakassi Zone&quot; is  scheduled to be handed over
in June 2008.

The NPF is maintaining security in that Bakassi  Zone; Nigeria National
Elections were held in that Bakassi Zone; Nigeria  continues to drill crude oil in
that zone.

You don't do those things if Cameroon is in control,  do you?

Stop telling Nigerians what is not the truth! It is  not a done deal until
June 2008.

So, what we talking about here? Nigeria must hold on to that  which we still
have. Playing the &quot;it is a done deal&quot; card, which is a complete  UNTRUTH, is a
deliberate scheme to confuse Nigerians... and I dare say lie to  Nigerians.

The Senate rightly urged the Fed's to suspend further  implementation of the
Agreement.

Essien Ayi is talking complete rubbish! An Obasanjo lackey that  he is, what
else can be expected of him? Afterall, the Bakassi people are  supposed to be
relocated into his constituency.Essien Ayi is talking complete rubbish! An
Obasanjo lackey thatEssien Ayi is talking complete rubbish! An Obasanjo lackey

money coming int

Nigerians in Bakassi have never told you they don't want to go to  war.
Repeatedly, over the phone, in newspaper articles, in all  correspondences, they
emphatically say they are prepared to die than become  Cameroonians or have
their land taken away from them. So, what are talking  about?

The Nigeria Army fights. They are better rated than the Cameroon  Army. And
can trounce Cameroon, invading up to Yaounde in one single  week. The Military
is paid to fight. And they are not complaining to anyone  that they are afraid
of fighting while protecting the Bakassi people.

And, this war spin is completely baseless. There will be no war.  I believe
the Cameroonians are not stupid. They have tried several times  without
success. What is different now that will make them succeed? Squat  Noth'n!

WORTH REPEATING:

An excerpt from an interview with Ewa Henshaw--House rep for the  Bakassi
District

&quot;ST: So are you now  supporting the government's position that there is no
going back on the  ceding of Bakassi to Cameroun?
Ayi: You see, what do you  want the government to do? It is the question of
crying over split milk. The  issue now is that Bakassi is in Cameroun and
you're crying over it, what do  you expect the government to do? A  former
government went to New York, signed a joint agreement in the presence  of the United
Nations, came back and handed over. They even came to Calabar  and perform the
handing over ceremony, which the former President Obasanjo  did. So what is
the best thing to do now? Are they saying that we should go  to war? Because the
only way you can bring back  Bakassi is through war and I'm not sure is this
country is ready to go to  war. It was a bad decision taken by the government
but the harm has already  been done, so there is no way you can repair that
harm except unless Nigeria  is ready to go to war and we are not ready to for
any war because the moment  the war comes it is the people of Bakassi and
Calabar that will suffer,  other people will not feel the pinch of it. What we're
saying is that the  Federal Government should do everything possible to give out
enough funds to  enable us resettle. &quot;-- Ewa Henshaw, House Rep-Bakassi
District.

My Comments:

The keywords, ideas and phrases are:

***ceding Bakassi was a bad decision;

***trying to get it back by any means is like crying over  split milk.

***Nigerians, especially thiose from Bakassi and Calabar  are not ready to go
to war
for obvious reasons---they will be the ones to suffer the  most.

***FGN should provide enough funds in recurrent and  capital locations to
ensure that resettlement
is smooth and comfortable for those who are being  relocated.

Now we need to ask how many of the Internet war mongers  who want Bakassi to
remain in Nigeria at whatever cost are willing to serve  or allow their own
children to be conscripted into the Nigerian armed  forces if and when the FGN
decides to go to war to recover  Bakassi from the Republc of Cameroon.

The ceding of Bakassi is a done deal!

Bye,

Ola

Hon Essien Ekpenyong Ayi represents Calabar  South/Akpaboyu/Hon Essien
Ekpenyong Ayi represents Calabar  South/Akpaboyu/&lt;WBR&gt;Bekwarra Federal Constituency
of Cross Rivers  State. The contentious Bakassi area is party of his
constituency. Ayi,  in this interview, says the emerging debate over the peninsula is a

ST: What would say about the raging  controversy over the Bakassi peninsular?

Ayi: Sometimes in 2002 I moved a motion,  upon which the House of
Representatives resolved that Nigeria should  not cede Bakassi until the constitutional
matter, the constitutional  issue of it is addressed. The Federal Government
went ahead and handed  over. So what the Senate is doing is not a new thing. The
House of  Representatives has done it before (but) the resolution of the
House  was not taken into consideration. The former president went ahead and
ceded the place, so what is the thing now? Our own now is not the
constitutionality of whole issue, what is my priority now is the  resettlement. Because the
former president has promised us that the  people are going to be resettled as
soon as possible but people are  still moving, nothing has been done. So, my
own issue or what is my  priority is the issue of resettlement. The place has
already been  ceded, so I don't know how they can retrieve it unless we go to
war,  and I'm not ready for any war. The only way you can retrieve Bakassi  now
after the handing over is through war, and I don't think this  country is
ready for any war. So, it is a case of crying over split  milk. The issue has
already been done, the harm has already been done,  the mistake has already been
done, the National Assembly was not  consulted, even the agreement has not
been given to us in the National  Assembly. So it has been ceded, what do we do?
My own cry is on the  resettlement, the government should do everything to
give us enough  fund to resettle the people and that's my own submission and not
about  the constitutionality of it. Because the only way you can take back
Bakassi is through war.
ST: So are you now supporting the government's  position that there is no
going back on the ceding of Bakassi to  Cameroun?
Ayi: You see, what do you want the government to  do? It is the question of
crying over split milk. The issue now is  that Bakassi is in Cameroun and
you're crying over it, what do you  expect the government to do? A former
government went to New York,  signed a joint agreement in the presence of the United
Nations, came  back and handed over. They even came to Calabar and perform the
handing over ceremony, which the former President Obasanjo did. So  what is
the best thing to do now? Are they saying that we should go to  war? Because the
only way you can bring back Bakassi is through war  and I'm not sure is this
country is ready to go to war. It was a bad  decision taken by the government
but the harm has already been done,  so there is no way you can repair that
harm except unless Nigeria is  ready to go to war and we are not ready to for
any war because the  moment the war comes it is the people of Bakassi and
Calabar that will  suffer, other people will not feel the pinch of it. What we're
saying  is that the Federal Government should do everything possible to give
out enough funds to enable us resettle. There are two options for the  people,
they can choose to remain in Bakassi as a Nigerian in Cameroun  or you come
over and resettle. They have set up resettlement committee  for those who are
interested to come back everything has been done,  the resettlement work has
commenced, a law has been made in the Cross  River State, which has created
another area for the people that are  coming back. So what are they talking about?
ST: Part of the contention is that the issue of  Bakassi is a constitutional
one. Will you now push for the amendment  of the constitution to expunge
Bakassi from the  constitution?
Ayi: There is nothing like review of the  constitution. Bakassi still exists
in Cross River State. The boundary  has been adjusted. Bakassi still exists in
Cross River State, there is  no constitutional review. You see Bakassi has
its own shares from the  federation account, though there is nothing like
constitutional  review, a new site has been located for those coming back, the
headquarters of Bakassi is now in Ikham, so what is the constitutional  amendment
for? Bakassi still exists and has been receiving allocations  from the
federation account as a local government in Nigeria.
ST: How have your people in Bakassi received the  handover?
Ayi: Bakassi has been handed over in a colourful  ceremony. I was there when
Bayo Ojo came to hand over Bakassi, he was  then the Attorney General of the
Federation. The former Governor of  Cross River state, Donald Duke was there,
the former Governor of Akwa  Ibom State, Victor Attah was there at the handing
over. Bayo Ojo  represented the president and handed over at Archibong town
where the  flag of Nigeria was lowered and the flag of Cameroun was raised.
Representatives of the United Nations were all there at the handing  over, so
what are they talking about again? It was handed over and  after that there was a
Bakassi handing over parade in Calabar, where  the former President Obasanjo
came, so why are they saying there was  no handing over? There was handing
over and I was there.
The people knew that the place has been handed  over. They knew, some of them
were there. What the government said if  you don't want to remain there we're
going to find a new site and  resettle you. What I'm saying is that
government should do that so  that those people who have opted out to come back to
Nigeria should be  resettled

We're not asking for war, but…—Ewa-Henshaw

Written by  Abdul-Rahman Abubakar
Sunday, 02 December 2007

Senator Bassey Ewa-Henshaw represents Cross River  South in the Senate.
Recently he moved a motion to reverse the ceding  of Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon.
Why did he do that? How would he  respond to talks about hidden motives in
his motion? Henshaw speaks to  Sunday Trust.
ST: What prompted you to move  a motion against ceding of Bakassi to Cameroon
at this point in  time?

Ewa-Henshaw: The truth is that the people of Bakassi are  represented by me
in the Senate, to that extent I am their  representative. Since they were moved
from their ancestral lands, they  were promised by the Federal Government of
Nigeria that they were  going to be properly resettled in another location. Up
to this moment  that I am talking to you that pledge has not been fulfilled.
I believe  that our constitution requires that the primary purpose of
government  is security and well being of the people. To that extent the  government
has not been fair to the people of Bakassi.
First of all the process of ceding Bakassi was  faulty. Section 12 of the
1999 Constitution requires that the National  Assembly should ratify any
convention. If you read it carefully, it  says no treaty between the federation and
any other country shall have  the force of law except to the extent to which any
such treaty has  been enacted into law by the National Assembly. Therefore,
in the  first place the process through which Bakassi was ceded was wrong. On
top of that the promise that was made by the government to the people  before
relocating them has not been forthcoming.
The area that was proposed for them at Ikan in  Akpabio Local Government Area
of Cross Rivers State, no enough  discussion has taken place to ensure that
the people are properly  assimilated and resettled. Before they were taken to
the place there  are people who are originally living there already, so there
is now  the question of who gets what in terms of sharing of public offices.
That has resulted to the last local government election not to hold in  that
area. Elections were held in all the other 17 local governments  in the state,
except in Bakassi. So there is a problem there.
ST: You were a senator at the time former President  Olusegun Obasanjo ceded
the area to Cameroon, why didn't you take any  action at that time?
Ewa-Henshaw: The first motion I raised on Bakassi  Peninsula was in 2004. One
of the key prayers that were adopted by the  Senate at that time was that the
chairman of the Nigeria-Cameroon  Mixed Commission should come and brief the
Senate about what was going  on. That did not happen.
ST: Is it true that some of you senators at that  time refused to say
anything for fear of losing re-election ticket  from your party?
Ewa-Henshaw: I want to assure you that is not true.  I already told you that
the first motion I moved on Bakassi was in  2004 and all that we know about
the agreement is what we have  downloaded it from the internet. If it had been
placed before us we  would have taken a proper look at it and decided what to
do. I don't  think anybody is afraid of any other person, we are operating a
constitutional democracy, we represent people and ultimately it is  those
people that decide whether or not we return to the Senate.
ST: But don't you think that moving this motion few  days after Cameroonian
soldiers were attacked in the area could be  taken that Nigeria is behind the
attack?
Ewa-Henshaw:  No I don't think so. Part of the so called Greentree  Agreement
signed by former President Obasanjo and his Cameroonian  counterpart was that
the entire Bakassi area should be demilitarized.  No military presence is
supposed to be in that area for the next five  years. And I remember that after
ceding the place on August 14, 2006  on the 21 st of that month,  former
President Obasanjo held a peace parade in Calabar Stadium to  mark the withdrawal of
Nigerian Soldiers from the Peninsula. In the  first place the fact that
Cameroonian soldiers were attacked and  killed by whoever, I don't know who they
are, but the fact that  Cameroonian were killed in that peninsula implies that
the  Cameroonians themselves have violated that Greentree agreement which  they
signed with former President Obasanjo. This is because they are  not supposed
to have any military presence there either.
ST: President Obasanjo has brought out a letter to  prove that he actually
sought for Senate ratification on the Bakassi  issue. Did you see the letter?
Ewa-Henshaw: I don't remember seeing any letter  from President Obasanjo. And
I also do not remember if any such letter  was read on the floor of the
Senate by the former Senate President. I  read to you section 12 of the
constitution and it emphasizes that any  treaty cannot have the force of law except if it
has been enacted into  law by the National Assembly. Now we have had other
treaties and  international conventions. When they are sent to the National
Assembly  for ratification, they are sent in the form of bills for passage into
law. So the issue of sending a letter by former President Obasanjo  even if the
letter was sent cannot amount to proper procedure of  seeking Senate
ratification of the treaty. Because a bill ought to  have been drafted attached with
the treaty and sent to the National  Assembly for passage into law. We don't
pass letters into law and we  don't act on letters we act on bills.
ST: Now that the motion has been adopted, how would  you pursue its
implementation?
Ewa-Henshaw: Well we are just hoping, because  President Umaru Yar'Adua from
day one has been very emphatic on his  resolve to operate within the rule of
law. What the Senate has done is  to bring to the attention of Mr. President
that the ceding of Bakassi  Peninsula to Cameroon was not constitutionally done.
It is now left to  the president who has said he wants to operate strictly
within the  ambit of the rule of law, to take steps, first of all to
appropriately  present the treaty before the National Assembly in the form that it is
supposed to be presented. The National Assembly will now debate it and  see
whether it is in the interest of the Nigerian nation for that area  of the country
to be ceded, and take appropriate decision on it as  contained in the
constitution.
ST: Don't you think this motion can place the  president under undue pressure
considering the fact that he inherited  the problem?
Ewa-Henshaw: Government is a continuous process; it  does not end with the
tenure of President Obasanjo. It is the same  Nigerian government and the
constitution that we are operating has not  been changed. I know that in the United
States of America, the  president cannot override the decision of Congress. If
he takes a  decision and the Congress says no, he is obliged to abide by the
decision of congress. So we are operating a constitutional democracy,  it is
not strange in the world there are other examples. Nigeria is  not the first
country to have had a judgment passed against it by the  International Court of
Justice (ICJ).
ST: Some people see this position of the Senate as  beating the drums of war.
Ewa-Henshaw: Nobody is beating the drum of war. All  that we need to do is
that we are a constitutional democracy and we  must operate and function in
accordance with our constitution. Nobody  wants to go to war, nobody likes war I
don't even see any possibility  of war here. We have tried as much as possible
to be friendly with the  Cameroonians and other African nations for that
matter. So the issue  of war does not even arise, but we need to be sure that
whatever we do  is constitutional and that we protect the interest and dignity of
the  Nigerian nation and the people.
ST: So as the representative of the people of  Bakassi, what is you desire
for the area?
Ewa-Henshaw: My hope is that we can still take a  look at what has been done
in the past. It is not for me to decide  whether the area should be ceded or
not, it is a matter for the entire  Nigerian people. The people of Bakassi had
always insisted that they  are Efik people and that they are Nigerians.
Therefore they wish to  remain Nigerians. Bakassi is there ancestral home. It is
unfortunate  that in the 21 st century we are  still being affected by colonial
vestiges that dealt with us centuries  ago. We are still suffering from
colonial problems in this day and age  because that ICJ judgment was based purely on
colonial manipulations.  In an independent African environment decisions are
still being taken  by colonial powers under colonial rules and regulations. By
UN  convention they are entitled to their rights and freedom. What they  would
have done is to go there and find out what the people want. All  these
options were put but none of them were looked at seriously. I  think Nigeria has a
duty to try and maintain peace with our neighbors,  I don't have any quarrel
with that. But I am not so sure that we  should do it to such as an extent that
it will touch on the interest  of the Nigerian people. Some people have been
displaced from that  place since last year; they have not been compensated or
resettled. So  I think the first thing the government must do now is to make
funds  available for that. The so-called Greentree Agreement should also be
brought before the National Assembly for proper scrutiny.

December 2007
Alhaji Sadiq Diggi is the Director General of the  National Boundary
Commission (NBC) and a Member/Secretary of the  Cameroun-Nigeria Mixed Commission. In
this interview, Diggi speaks on  what Nigeria gains from Bakassi handover to
Cameroun, among other  issues.
ST: Recently, the Senate voided the  handing of Bakassi to Cameroun, what is
NBC's opinion on the  issue?Diggi: The National Boundary Commission, you know,
is an organ  of the Federal Government. I serve at the secretariat of the
Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission and I am a member/secretary of the
commission. As far as we are concerned, we are going to continue with  the assignment
given to us and right now as I am talking to you, I  wish to let you know that
the members of the Joint Technical Team,  comprising Nigerian officials,
Cameroonian officials and the United  Nations officials are now in Adamawa state,
trying to delineate the  boundary as defined by the ICJ. In addition to this,
United Nations  has decided to assist us with a helicopter for operations. So,
nothing  has affected our work and we will continue our program as scheduled.
ST: When is your work scheduled end?
Diggi: Well, so far we have been able to delineate  over 500 kilometres. We
are now in Adamawa state and delineation will  continue up till Cross Rivers
state where the land boundary ends. We  expect to finish in 2009. Why I said
2009 is that somewhere along the  line, Cameroonian villages are still falling
into Nigeria and likewise  our own villages are also falling into Cameroon. It
is only now that  this is coming into limelight because these are small
villages that do  not exist on the map. To us we feel that we have done a tremendous
job  for this country. I say this because earlier on, Cameroun asked the
court to define the boundary from Lake Chad up to the sea and in the  process of
doing that, you found that in Adamawa state alone, we have  been able to gain,
minimum 60 square kilometres of additional land  which was not available
before to Nigeria and in fact when you move to  Taraba state, we have been able to
gain 75 kilometres, and by the time  you add the small number of square
kilometres, we have been able to  gain minimum of about 90 square kilometres
additional land into  Nigeria. Then going down into the sea, yes, I agree that we
left  Bakassi, but if you look into the whole history of this issue of  Bakassi,
you will find that where we come from, we lost because of  many reasons. The
reasons are that, there is something that we call  Cairo Declaration. In 1964
when the African heads of state realised  that they had started experiencing
international border problems with  their neighbours, they all came together and
decided to demarcate the  boundary on the agreement that everybody would
respect the colonial  boundaries. So, if we are expected to respect the colonial
boundaries,  Nigeria and Cameroun at that instance are defined by the 1913
treaties. The 1913 treaty made mention of one river called Akwanyati.  The treaty
says that even if River Akwanyati changes its course, for  one reason or the
other, Bakassi belonged to German. Unfortunately  until 1992 when I became the
Director of International Boundaries, all  the Nigerian maps were indicating
Bakassi into Cameroun and  unfortunately, when you go into some of the records
which we have,  some of the research that were carried out by many important
personalities in Nigeria, they continue to reflect Bakassi as  belonging to
Cameroon. There are so many other reasons why the court  decided to give
Bakassi to Cameroun. But Cameroon was trying to claim  all our oil wells. Imagine
Nigeria losing all the oil wells! But the  court did not agree and as far as we
are concerned, we feel it is a  plus to Nigeria because almost 95 percent of
Nigerians depend on oil.  On the Bakassi side, we were trying to claim what we
call  'effectivity.' This means that Nigerians had been living in the  Bakassi
peninsula for so many years. Unfortunately, the court did not  see it that
way. The court depended on the documents and the treaties  that were agreed upon
by the colonial masters.
Going back to your question of where we stand,  immediately after the
judgement, the former administration made  available N1.17 billion to the
presidential task force so that those  people that want to come back to Nigeria can be
resettled and we have  been able to provide social amenities in about five or
six towns. What  I mean here is secondary schools, rural health centres, police
and  immigration posts, boreholes have been provided for these communities
and many of them are coming back. But it is not compulsory to come  back; if
they want to come back fine, if they want to stay you must  respect Cameroonian
rules. That is how we have been operating. Still  on the issue of the Bakassi,
since the handing over, the two  governments actually appointed another
subcommittee which we call  observer personnel, made of Nigerians, Cameroonians and
United  Nations. These observers visit the Bakassi community every two months
to find out how Cameroon is treating the Bakassi people.
ST: What is going on right now in  Bakassi?
Diggi: What is going on is that each time they go  there, the situation is
peaceful. That is what has been going on to  the best of our knowledge untill
recently when we had this incident of  Cameroonian soldiers being killed by
people we do not know of. The  area that they were killed, it is part of the areas
Nigeria ceded, we  do not have our policemen there, we do not have our
soldiers there, we  do not have any of our administrators there where the killing
took  place.
ST: But how are the communities in Bakassi faring?
Diggi: I said N1.17 billion had been spent earlier  and the present
administration of Umaru Yar'Adua added the sum of N926  million for the construction of
bridges that will connect the villages  to the rest of Nigeria and also the
digging of a canal so that it can  ease the movement of canoes in that area and
speed boat and also some  laterite roads to be constructed. Coming down to
Bakassi area, the sum  of N1 billion was made available but this time around,
not to National  Boundary Commission, not to the presidential committee but to
the  former administration of Bakassi people for the resettlement of the
people.
ST: Are you talking about the Cross Rivers state  government?
Diggi: Yes, the Cross Rivers state government and I  believe it is doing
everything possible to get the people resettled  but you may need to find out more
from the Cross Rivers state  government. Yesterday (on Thursday), the
president during our briefing  with him promised that he will do everything possible
to make sure  that the Bakassi people are well integrated into the rest of the
Nigeria. He will also ask the National Assembly to try to ratify the
agreement that was earlier sent to the lawmakers because it had been  sent to them
by the previous administration and we hope that the  National Assembly will
soon ratify it.

Written by  Musa Simon Reef
Sunday, 02 December 2007

When the Senate, penultimate Thursday, voted to  void the transfer of the
oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon on  August 14 last year by former
President Olusegun Obasanjo, it did not  bargain for the deluge of reactions that
trailed its decision. If the  Senate's intention was to create a distraction from
its renovation and  budget controversies, it probably succeeded. But at the
same time the  attempt by the Senate to revisit the Bakassi issue paints the
senators  as war mongers. With their action coming on the heels of the killing
of some Cameroonian soldiers by suspected Niger-Delta militants, not a  few
Nigerians interpreted the nullification of Bakassi handover as a  declaration of
war by the lawmakers.
In canceling the transfer of the oil rich area, the  Senate had hinged its
decision to the alleged violation of Section  12(1) of the Constitution in the
refusal of Obasanjo to involve the  National Assembly in the process leading to
the signing of the  Greentree Agreement between Obasanjo and his Cameroonian
counter part,  President Paul Biya, on the ceding of Bakassi.
On Wednesday, Obasanjo denied claims by the Senate  that he acted alone in
the transfer of Bakassi. The former president  said he actually sent a letter to
the National Assembly where he  requested them to ratify the agreement, so as
to resolve legal  quandary. Speaking through his Special Assistant on Media,
Mr. Adeoba  Ojekunle, Obasanjo said, &quot;The last Senate and House of
Representatives  under the leaderships of Senator Ken Nnamani, Hon. Aminu Bello Masari
were duly served the Greentree Agreement between Nigeria and Cameroun  on the
ceding of Bakassi Territory to Cameroun for ratification by the  National
Assembly.&quot;
The mover of the motion for the voiding of Bakassi  transfer by the Senate,
Bassey Ewa-Henshaw, told Sunday Trust that  since Nigeria is under a democratic
era, the only organ recognised by  the Nigerian Constitution to ratify the
decision of ceding the  disputed land was the National Assembly. When asked if
he ever  remembered seeing a letter from the president requesting for
ratification, Ewa-Henshaw said: &quot;I don't remember seeing any letter  from President
Obasanjo…. even if the letter was sent, this cannot  amount to proper procedure
of seeking Senate ratification of the  treaty. Because a bill ought to have
been drafted attached with the  treaty and sent to the National Assembly for
passage into law. We  don't pass letters into law and we don't act on letters we
act on  bills.&quot;
It is not only Ewa-Henshaw who could not recall  seeing a letter from
Obasanjo requesting for the ratification of  Nigeria's acceptance to abide by the
verdict of the International  Court of Justice that ceded Bakassi to Cameroon.
Former Senate  President, Ken Nnamani said he could not say for sure if he
received  such a letter. &quot;I cannot say if we receive such a letter or not, but
that can be checked at the office of the clerk of the National  Assembly,&quot;
Nnamani said.
The Chairman of the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed  Commission, Prince Bola Ajibola,
after a meeting with President  Yar'Adua on Thursday in Abuja, advised the
Senate to do the right  thing by &quot;domesticating the decision of the ICJ without
further  delay&quot;.
Ajibola said that the listing of Bakassi in the  Constitution of Nigeria is
irrelevant in the face of the ICJ verdict.  He exonerated Obasanjo and noted
the former president &quot;acted promptly  by sending a letter to the President of
the Senate as well as the  Speaker of the House of Representatives and other
relevant agencies to  act on accordingly. It was a matter for the Senate to have
ratified.  Not doing that was not the problem of the then president…. The
problem  is the internal problem of Nigeria and it is not relevant to the  ruling.
We cannot approbate and reprobate at the same time.&quot;
Ajibola warned on the dangers of revisiting the  ceding of Bakassi, stressing
that, &quot;If we do this, the world is  watching us. From the beginning, we had
always brought the matter to  the National Assembly. The world would always
expect us to do the  right thing. The world is watching us if we fail to abide by
the  decision of the ICJ.&quot;
He dismissed as unrealistic calls by some Nigerians  that the Federal
Government should listen to the Senate and voids the  agreement. &quot;There is nothing
that will stop that assignment (ceding of  Bakassi to Cameroon). The Senate is
aware of the fact that it had  failed to do what it ought to have done and it
(the Senate) will do it  now. The president did what he ought to have done and
that burden of  ratification is the end of it,&quot; Ajibola said.
Professor Auwalu Yadudu, a constitutional lawyer,  faulted the manner in
which the ceding of Bakassi was carried out by  Obasanjo. Yadudu who was a legal
adviser to General Sani Abacha told  Sunday Trust that Nigeria started on a
wrong footing, following a  declaration by Obasanjo that Nigeria would abide by
the decision of  the court.
&quot;If the former president had said he reserved his  position and that he was
not going along with it or he had to consult  with the necessary organs of the
state, the Senate and others, then  the situation would have been different,&quot;
Yadudu said.
But as it stands, Yadudu said, the nation would  have to consider the
sacrifice of going against the ICJ Judgment and  the far-reaching implications on its
status as a regional power and  its integrity to abide by treaties willingly
entered into. The legal  scholar maintained that Nigeria may choose to ignore
the judgment of  the ICJ and risk being cast in bad light or resolve to abide
by the  verdict so as not to send wrong signals to the international
community.
General Victor Malu, former Army Chief of Staff is  angry at the enormous
monetary cost incurred by the Richard  Akinjide-led legal team that prosecuted
the Bakassi issue at the ICJ.  Malu explained that since Akinjide has been
representing Nigeria at  the ICJ, he was in the best position to advise government
on what to  do.
&quot;If you have been representing Nigeria on the  Bakassi issue for these
numbers of years and you saw the case was a  hopeless case, why didn't you advise
the government then to withdraw  the case? You will only need to go to the book
to know how much  Nigeria spent on the Bakassi issue,&quot; Malu said.
Hon. Essien Ayi, representing Calabar  South/Akpaboyu/Hon. Essien Ayi,
representing Calabar  South/Akpaboyu/&lt;WBR&gt;Bekwarra Federal Constituency told Sunday
Trust  that what the Senate did by voiding the ceding of Bakassi to Cameroon
amounted to an open invitation to war. He expressed fears that any  attempt to
repudiate the transfer of the peninsula to
&quot;The place has already been ceded, so I don't know  how they can retrieve it,
unless we go to war, and I am not ready for  any war. The only way you can
retrieve Bakassi now after the handing  over is through war, and I don't think
this country is ready for any  war. So, it is a case of crying over spilt milk.
The issue has already  been done, the harm has already been done,&quot; Ayi said.
What should be of importance, the lawmaker said,  should be the resettlement
of the people of Bakassi who have agreed to  relocate to Nigeria. He dismissed
calls by Ewa-Henshaw that the issue  should be revisited. Ayi warned that for
the avoidance of outbreak of  hostilities, the issue should not be reviewed
and the Federal  Government should face the challenge of resettling Bakassi
people who  are willing to resettle in Nigeria.
Lagos Lawyer, Bamidele Aturu, described the  decision of the Senate to void
the transfer of Bakassi as a dangerous  trend that should not be contemplated.
In a statement he made  available to Sunday Trust, Aturu maintained that if
Nigeria was  determined to reclaim Bakassi, what should be done is setting
machinery in motion that would encourage the Bakassi to mount pressure  on UN to
conduct a plebiscite to determine where they want to belong
&quot;The option chosen by the Senate is likely to lead  to needless war that
would hurt everyone but those fanning it. I urge  the working people in both
Nigeria and Cameroon to resist any  invitation to shed blood on account of a matter
that can be solved  amicably. They must recognise that none of the
pot-bellied senators  would be drafted. The patriotism displayed by the Senate on this
issue  is to all intents and purposes false. We do not need to go to war on
this matter,&quot; Aturu said.
Director General of the National Boundary  Commission, NBC, Alhaji Sadiq
Diggi, said on Friday that Nigeria has  benefited from the ICJ verdict and that no
amount of opposition would  stop the transfer of Bakassi to Cameroun which is
a fait accompli.  Speaking to Sunday Trust, Diggi said that the ICJ verdict
was a good  omen to the country.
According to the NBC boss, &quot;in Adamawa state alone,  we have been able to
gain, minimum 60 square kilometres of additional  land which was not available
before in Nigeria and in fact when you  move to Taraba state, we have been able
to gain 75 square kilometres,  and by the time you add the small number of
square kilometres, we have  been able to gain minimum of about 90 square
kilometres additional  land into Nigeria.&quot;
Diggi said that President Yar'Adua has given his  commitment towards ensuring
the full integration of Bakassi people  into the Nigerian society.
A Daily Trust online poll on whether the Federal  Government should reclaim
the Bakassi peninsula indicates that 119 out  of 154 respondents were
favourably disposed to the nullification of  the transfer. This represents 77.3 per
cent of the total respondents  were in favour of the Senate's action.
With the Federal Government declaring last week  that it has no intention of
reviewing the Greentree Agreement that  ceded Bakassi to Cameroun, some
Nigerians are asking what options are  there left for the Senate to force the
Yar'Adua government undertake a  review of an agreement that was signed on June 12,
2006 in new York by  Obasanjo and Biya. Will Yar'Adua buckle under the
pressure of the  lawmakers or will the president send the Greentree Treaty to the
National Assembly for ratification?

Dear Clement:

Thanks for the correction and clarifications!

Two key statements in your well argued response are:

&quot;So far, it is the Northern part that has  been handed over. The Western and
Southern parts, aptly called the &quot;Bakassi  Zone&quot; is scheduled to be handed
over in June 2008.

Stop telling Nigerians what is not the  truth! It is not a done deal until
June 2008.&quot;--Clement  Ikpatt

Even though I am not a lawyer, I have always considered that a deal is done
when the two parties in a transaction or dispute
sign on the dotted lines in the presence of one or more witnesses. The next
phase after signing an agreement is the implementation of the agreement. One
party in an agreement cannot unilaterally  decide to alter any item in the
agreement during the implementation phase without the consent of the other
party.

What the Senate appears to be urging the FGN to do is to renege on an
international agreement that has been duly signed by a former legitimate  government
of Nigeria led by President Obasanjo. I think it is wishful thinking  on our
part as Nigerians to expect that the Cameroonians will simply roll over  and
accept any amendments to the Green Tree Agreement, considering that the
amendments we would seek concern the 'juiciest' portion of land that was in
contention before the agreement.

Let us pray that we do not have a war in our region of the world again
either about Bakassi or any other matter. The war over Bakassi will not be  limited
to fighting the Republic of Cameroon, as Nigeria will also be fighting
against the world's public opinion as represented by the UN and other  multilateral
institutions and the selfish interests of some other nations  including the
USA, Britain, France, Germany and a host of others.

The Nigerian Armed Forces might need less than one week to subdue the
Cameroonian army, but I seriously doubt if we have enough military muscle to  defeat
Cameroon if it is heavily backed by the world's only superpower--the USA  and
other developed nations.

Saddam Hussein invaded tiny Kuwait based on the logic that the mighty Iraq
army was invincible. We all know what happened subsequently! I pray that the
FGN  does not make the same mistake. I doubt if it will for the following
reasons:

1) Declaration of war against another sovereign nation is a  prerogative of
the President NOT the Senate.

2) President Yar'adua is unlikely to declare war against the Republic of
Cameroon as long as the latter does not encroach on Nigerian territory beyond
what is allowed in the Green Tree Agreement.

Thank you.

Bye,

Ola

Dr. Kassim:

What you excerpted is by Hon. Essien Ayi representing Akpabuyo  federal
constituency in the House of Reps. Hon. Ayi is not Sen. Ewa  Henshaw.

I know Essien Ayi. We schooled together. I am not suprised by his  reaction.
And he, like most Nigerians, have this erroneous impression that  Bakassi is
completely in the hands of Cameroon. That is NOT true.

So far, it is the Northern part that has been handed  over. The Western and
Southern parts, aptly called the &quot;Bakassi Zone&quot; is  scheduled to be handed over
in June 2008.

The NPF is maintaining security in that Bakassi  Zone; Nigeria National
Elections were held in that Bakassi Zone; Nigeria  continues to drill crude oil in
that zone.

You don't do those things if Cameroon is in control,  do you?

Stop telling Nigerians what is not the truth! It is  not a done deal until
June 2008.

So, what we talking about here? Nigeria must hold on to that  which we still
have. Playing the &quot;it is a done deal&quot; card, which is a complete  UNTRUTH, is a
deliberate scheme to confuse Nigerians... and I dare say lie to  Nigerians.

The Senate rightly urged the Fed's to suspend further  implementation of the
Agreement.

Essien Ayi is talking complete rubbish! An Obasanjo lackey that  he is, what
else can be expected of him? Afterall, the Bakassi people are  supposed to be
relocated into his constituency.Essien Ayi is talking complete rubbish! An
Obasanjo lackey thatEssien Ayi is talking complete rubbish! An Obasanjo lackey

money coming int

Nigerians in Bakassi have never told you they don't want to go to  war.
Repeatedly, over the phone, in newspaper articles, in all  correspondences, they
emphatically say they are prepared to die than become  Cameroonians or have
their land taken away from them. So, what are talking  about?

The Nigeria Army fights. They are better rated than the Cameroon  Army. And
can trounce Cameroon, invading up to Yaounde in one single  week. The Military
is paid to fight. And they are not complaining to anyone  that they are afraid
of fighting while protecting the Bakassi people.

And, this war spin is completely baseless. There will be no war.  I believe
the Cameroonians are not stupid. They have tried several times  without
success. What is different now that will make them succeed? Squat  Noth'n!

WORTH REPEATING:

An excerpt from an interview with Ewa Henshaw--House rep for the  Bakassi
District

&quot;ST: So are you now  supporting the government's position that there is no
going back on the  ceding of Bakassi to Cameroun?
Ayi: You see, what do you  want the government to do? It is the question of
crying over split milk. The  issue now is that Bakassi is in Cameroun and
you're crying over it, what do  you expect the government to do? A  former
government went to New York, signed a joint agreement in the presence  of the United
Nations, came back and handed over. They even came to Calabar  and perform the
handing over ceremony, which the former President Obasanjo  did. So what is
the best thing to do now? Are they saying that we should go  to war? Because the
only way you can bring back  Bakassi is through war and I'm not sure is this
country is ready to go to  war. It was a bad decision taken by the government
but the harm has already  been done, so there is no way you can repair that
harm except unless Nigeria  is ready to go to war and we are not ready to for
any war because the moment  the war comes it is the people of Bakassi and
Calabar that will suffer,  other people will not feel the pinch of it. What we're
saying is that the  Federal Government should do everything possible to give out
enough funds to  enable us resettle. &quot;-- Ewa Henshaw, House Rep-Bakassi
District.

My Comments:

The keywords, ideas and phrases are:

***ceding Bakassi was a bad decision;

***trying to get it back by any means is like crying over  split milk.

***Nigerians, especially thiose from Bakassi and Calabar  are not ready to go
to war
for obvious reasons---they will be the ones to suffer the  most.

***FGN should provide enough funds in recurrent and  capital locations to
ensure that resettlement
is smooth and comfortable for those who are being  relocated.

Now we need to ask how many of the Internet war mongers  who want Bakassi to
remain in Nigeria at whatever cost are willing to serve  or allow their own
children to be conscripted into the Nigerian armed  forces if and when the FGN
decides to go to war to recover  Bakassi from the Republc of Cameroon.

The ceding of Bakassi is a done deal!

Bye,

Ola

Hon Essien Ekpenyong Ayi represents Calabar  South/Akpaboyu/Hon Essien
Ekpenyong Ayi represents Calabar  South/Akpaboyu/&lt;WBR&gt;Bekwarra Federal Constituency
of Cross Rivers  State. The contentious Bakassi area is party of his
constituency. Ayi,  in this interview, says the emerging debate over the peninsula is a

ST: What would say about the raging  controversy over the Bakassi peninsular?

Ayi: Sometimes in 2002 I moved a motion,  upon which the House of
Representatives resolved that Nigeria should  not cede Bakassi until the constitutional
matter, the constitutional  issue of it is addressed. The Federal Government
went ahead and handed  over. So what the Senate is doing is not a new thing. The
House of  Representatives has done it before (but) the resolution of the
House  was not taken into consideration. The former president went ahead and
ceded the place, so what is the thing now? Our own now is not the
constitutionality of whole issue, what is my priority now is the  resettlement. Because the
former president has promised us that the  people are going to be resettled as
soon as possible but people are  still moving, nothing has been done. So, my
own issue or what is my  priority is the issue of resettlement. The place has
already been  ceded, so I don't know how they can retrieve it unless we go to
war,  and I'm not ready for any war. The only way you can retrieve Bakassi  now
after the handing over is through war, and I don't think this  country is
ready for any war. So, it is a case of crying over split  milk. The issue has
already been done, the harm has already been done,  the mistake has already been
done, the National Assembly was not  consulted, even the agreement has not
been given to us in the National  Assembly. So it has been ceded, what do we do?
My own cry is on the  resettlement, the government should do everything to
give us enough  fund to resettle the people and that's my own submission and not
about  the constitutionality of it. Because the only way you can take back
Bakassi is through war.
ST: So are you now supporting the government's  position that there is no
going back on the ceding of Bakassi to  Cameroun?
Ayi: You see, what do you want the government to  do? It is the question of
crying over split milk. The issue now is  that Bakassi is in Cameroun and
you're crying over it, what do you  expect the government to do? A former
government went to New York,  signed a joint agreement in the presence of the United
Nations, came  back and handed over. They even came to Calabar and perform the
handing over ceremony, which the former President Obasanjo did. So  what is
the best thing to do now? Are they saying that we should go to  war? Because the
only way you can bring back Bakassi is through war  and I'm not sure is this
country is ready to go to war. It was a bad  decision taken by the government
but the harm has already been done,  so there is no way you can repair that
harm except unless Nigeria is  ready to go to war and we are not ready to for
any war because the  moment the war comes it is the people of Bakassi and
Calabar that will  suffer, other people will not feel the pinch of it. What we're
saying  is that the Federal Government should do everything possible to give
out enough funds to enable us resettle. There are two options for the  people,
they can choose to remain in Bakassi as a Nigerian in Cameroun  or you come
over and resettle. They have set up resettlement committee  for those who are
interested to come back everything has been done,  the resettlement work has
commenced, a law has been made in the Cross  River State, which has created
another area for the people that are  coming back. So what are they talking about?
ST: Part of the contention is that the issue of  Bakassi is a constitutional
one. Will you now push for the amendment  of the constitution to expunge
Bakassi from the  constitution?
Ayi: There is nothing like review of the  constitution. Bakassi still exists
in Cross River State. The boundary  has been adjusted. Bakassi still exists in
Cross River State, there is  no constitutional review. You see Bakassi has
its own shares from the  federation account, though there is nothing like
constitutional  review, a new site has been located for those coming back, the
headquarters of Bakassi is now in Ikham, so what is the constitutional  amendment
for? Bakassi still exists and has been receiving allocations  from the
federation account as a local government in Nigeria.
ST: How have your people in Bakassi received the  handover?
Ayi: Bakassi has been handed over in a colourful  ceremony. I was there when
Bayo Ojo came to hand over Bakassi, he was  then the Attorney General of the
Federation. The former Governor of  Cross River state, Donald Duke was there,
the former Governor of Akwa  Ibom State, Victor Attah was there at the handing
over. Bayo Ojo  represented the president and handed over at Archibong town
where the  flag of Nigeria was lowered and the flag of Cameroun was raised.
Representatives of the United Nations were all there at the handing  over, so
what are they talking about again? It was handed over and  after that there was a
Bakassi handing over parade in Calabar, where  the former President Obasanjo
came, so why are they saying there was  no handing over? There was handing
over and I was there.
The people knew that the place has been handed  over. They knew, some of them
were there. What the government said if  you don't want to remain there we're
going to find a new site and  resettle you. What I'm saying is that
government should do that so  that those people who have opted out to come back to
Nigeria should be  resettled

We're not asking for war, but…—Ewa-Henshaw

Written by  Abdul-Rahman Abubakar
Sunday, 02 December 2007

Senator Bassey Ewa-Henshaw represents Cross River  South in the Senate.
Recently he moved a motion to reverse the ceding  of Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon.
Why did he do that? How would he  respond to talks about hidden motives in
his motion? Henshaw speaks to  Sunday Trust.
ST: What prompted you to move  a motion against ceding of Bakassi to Cameroon
at this point in  time?

Ewa-Henshaw: The truth is that the people of Bakassi are  represented by me
in the Senate, to that extent I am their  representative. Since they were moved
from their ancestral lands, they  were promised by the Federal Government of
Nigeria that they were  going to be properly resettled in another location. Up
to this moment  that I am talking to you that pledge has not been fulfilled.
I believe  that our constitution requires that the primary purpose of
government  is security and well being of the people. To that extent the  government
has not been fair to the people of Bakassi.
First of all the process of ceding Bakassi was  faulty. Section 12 of the
1999 Constitution requires that the National  Assembly should ratify any
convention. If you read it carefully, it  says no treaty between the federation and
any other country shall have           the force of law except to the extent to
which any such treaty has  been enacted into law by the National Assembly.
Therefore, in the  first place the process through which Bakassi was ceded was
wrong. On  top of that the promise that was made by the government to the people
before relocating them has not been forthcoming.
The area that was proposed for them at Ikan in  Akpabio Local Government Area
of Cross Rivers State, no enough  discussion has taken place to ensure that
the people are properly  assimilated and resettled. Before they were taken to
the place there  are people who are originally living there already, so there
is now  the question of who gets what in terms of sharing of public offices.
That has resulted to the last local government election not to hold in  that
area. Elections were held in all the other 17 local governments  in the state,
except in Bakassi. So there is a problem there.
ST: You were a senator at the time former President  Olusegun Obasanjo ceded
the area to Cameroon, why didn't you take any  action at that time?
Ewa-Henshaw: The first motion I raised on Bakassi  Peninsula was in 2004. One
of the key prayers that were adopted by the  Senate at that time was that the
chairman of the Nigeria-Cameroon  Mixed Commission should come and brief the
Senate about what was going  on. That did not happen.
ST: Is it true that some of you senators at that  time refused to say
anything for fear of losing re-election ticket  from your party?
Ewa-Henshaw: I want to assure you that is not true.  I already told you that
the first motion I moved on Bakassi was in  2004 and all that we know about
the agreement is what we have  downloaded it from the internet. If it had been
placed before us we  would have taken a proper look at it and decided what to
do. I don't  think anybody is afraid of any other person, we are operating a
constitutional democracy, we represent people and ultimately it is  those
people that decide whether or not we return to the Senate.
ST: But don't you think that moving this motion few  days after Cameroonian
soldiers were attacked in the area could be  taken that Nigeria is behind the
attack?
Ewa-Henshaw:  No I don't think so. Part of the so called Greentree  Agreement
signed by former President Obasanjo and his Cameroonian  counterpart was that
the entire Bakassi area should be demilitarized.  No military presence is
supposed to be in that area for the next five  years. And I remember that after
ceding the place on August 14, 2006  on the 21 st of that month,  former
President Obasanjo held a peace parade in Calabar Stadium to  mark the withdrawal of
Nigerian Soldiers from the Peninsula. In the  first place the fact that
Cameroonian soldiers were attacked and  killed by whoever, I don't know who they
are, but the fact that  Cameroonian were killed in that peninsula implies that
the  Cameroonians themselves have violated that Greentree agreement which  they
signed with former President Obasanjo. This is because they are  not supposed
to have any military presence there either.
ST: President Obasanjo has brought out a letter to  prove that he actually
sought for Senate ratification on the Bakassi  issue. Did you see the letter?
Ewa-Henshaw: I don't remember seeing any letter  from President Obasanjo. And
I also do not remember if any such letter  was read on the floor of the
Senate by the former Senate President. I  read to you section 12 of the
constitution and it emphasizes that any  treaty cannot have the force of law except if it
has been enacted into  law by the National Assembly. Now we have had other
treaties and  international conventions. When they are sent to the National
Assembly  for ratification, they are sent in the form of bills for passage into
law. So the issue of sending a letter by former President Obasanjo  even if the
letter was sent cannot amount to proper procedure of  seeking Senate
ratification of the treaty. Because a bill ought to  have been drafted attached with
the treaty and sent to the National  Assembly for passage into law. We don't
pass letters into law and we  don't act on letters we act on bills.
ST: Now that the motion has been adopted, how would  you pursue its
implementation?
Ewa-Henshaw: Well we are just hoping, because  President Umaru Yar'Adua from
day one has been very emphatic on his  resolve to operate within the rule of
law. What the Senate has done is  to bring to the attention of Mr. President
that the ceding of Bakassi  Peninsula to Cameroon was not constitutionally done.
It is now left to  the president who has said he wants to operate strictly
within the  ambit of the rule of law, to take steps, first of all to
appropriately  present the treaty before the National Assembly in the form that it is
supposed to be presented. The National Assembly will now debate it and  see
whether it is in the interest of the Nigerian nation for that area  of the country
to be ceded, and take appropriate decision on it as  contained in the
constitution.
ST: Don't you think this motion can place the  president under undue pressure
considering the fact that he inherited  the problem?
Ewa-Henshaw: Government is a continuous process; it  does not end with the
tenure of President Obasanjo. It is the same  Nigerian government and the
constitution that we are operating has not  been changed. I know that in the United
States of America, the  president cannot override the decision of Congress. If
he takes a  decision and the Congress says no, he is obliged to abide by the
decision of congress. So we are operating a constitutional democracy,  it is
not strange in the world there are other examples. Nigeria is  not the first
country to have had a judgment passed against it by the  International Court of
Justice (ICJ).
ST: Some people see this position of the Senate as  beating the drums of war.
Ewa-Henshaw: Nobody is beating the drum of war. All  that we need to do is
that we are a constitutional democracy and we  must operate and function in
accordance with our constitution. Nobody  wants to go to war, nobody likes war I
don't even see any possibility  of war here. We have tried as much as possible
to be friendly with the  Cameroonians and other African nations for that
matter. So the issue  of war does not even arise, but we need to be sure that
whatever we do  is constitutional and that we protect the interest and dignity of
the  Nigerian nation and the people.
ST: So as the representative of the people of  Bakassi, what is you desire
for the area?
Ewa-Henshaw: My hope is that we can still take a  look at what has been done
in the past. It is not for me to decide  whether the area should be ceded or
not, it is a matter for the entire  Nigerian people. The people of Bakassi had
always insisted that they  are Efik people and that they are Nigerians.
Therefore they wish to  remain Nigerians. Bakassi is there ancestral home. It is
unfortunate  that in the 21 st century we are  still being affected by colonial
vestiges that dealt with us centuries  ago. We are still suffering from
colonial problems in this day and age  because that ICJ judgment was based purely on
colonial manipulations.  In an independent African environment decisions are
still being taken  by colonial powers under colonial rules and regulations. By
UN  convention they are entitled to their rights and freedom. What they  would
have done is to go there and find out what the people want. All  these
options were put but none of them were looked at seriously. I  think Nigeria has a
duty to try and maintain peace with our neighbors,  I don't have any quarrel
with that. But I am not so sure that we  should do it to such as an extent that
it will touch on the interest  of the Nigerian people. Some people have been
displaced from that  place since last year; they have not been compensated or
resettled. So  I think the first thing the government must do now is to make
funds  available for that. The so-called Greentree Agreement should also be
brought before the National Assembly for proper scrutiny.

December 2007
Alhaji Sadiq Diggi is the Director General of the  National Boundary
Commission (NBC) and a Member/Secretary of the  Cameroun-Nigeria Mixed Commission. In
this interview, Diggi speaks on  what Nigeria gains from Bakassi handover to
Cameroun, among other  issues.
ST: Recently, the Senate voided the  handing of Bakassi to Cameroun, what is
NBC's opinion on the  issue?Diggi: The National Boundary Commission, you know,
is an organ  of the Federal Government. I serve at the secretariat of the
Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission and I am a member/secretary of the
commission. As far as we are concerned, we are going to continue with  the assignment
given to us and right now as I am talking to you, I  wish to let you know that
the members of the Joint Technical Team,  comprising Nigerian officials,
Cameroonian officials and the United  Nations officials are now in Adamawa state,
trying to delineate the  boundary as defined by the ICJ. In addition to this,
United Nations  has decided to assist us with a helicopter for operations. So,
nothing  has affected our work and we will continue our program as scheduled.
ST: When is your work scheduled end?
Diggi: Well, so far we have been able to delineate  over 500 kilometres. We
are now in Adamawa state and delineation will  continue up till Cross Rivers
state where the land boundary ends. We  expect to finish in 2009. Why I said
2009 is that somewhere along the  line, Cameroonian villages are still falling
into Nigeria and likewise  our own villages are also falling into Cameroon. It
is only now that  this is coming into limelight because these are small
villages that do  not exist on the map. To us we feel that we have done a tremendous
job  for this country. I say this because earlier on, Cameroun asked the
court to define the boundary from Lake Chad up to the sea and in the  process of
doing that, you found that in Adamawa state alone, we have  been able to gain,
minimum 60 square kilometres of additional land  which was not available
before to Nigeria and in fact when you move to  Taraba state, we have been able to
gain 75 kilometres, and by the time  you add the small number of square
kilometres, we have been able to  gain minimum of about 90 square kilometres
additional land into  Nigeria. Then going down into the sea, yes, I agree that we
left  Bakassi, but if you look into the whole history of this issue of  Bakassi,
you will find that where we come from, we lost because of  many reasons. The
reasons are that, there is something that we call  Cairo Declaration. In 1964
when the African heads of state realised  that they had started experiencing
international border problems with  their neighbours, they all came together and
decided to demarcate the  boundary on the agreement that everybody would
respect the colonial  boundaries. So, if we are expected to respect the colonial
boundaries,  Nigeria and Cameroun at that instance are defined by the 1913
treaties. The 1913 treaty made mention of one river called Akwanyati.  The treaty
says that even if River Akwanyati changes its course, for  one reason or the
other, Bakassi belonged to German. Unfortunately  until 1992 when I became the
Director of International Boundaries, all  the Nigerian maps were indicating
Bakassi into Cameroun and  unfortunately, when you go into some of the records
which we have,  some of the research that were carried out by many important
personalities in Nigeria, they continue to reflect Bakassi as  belonging to
Cameroon. There are so many other reasons why the court  decided to give
Bakassi to Cameroun. But Cameroon was trying to claim  all our oil wells. Imagine
Nigeria losing all the oil wells! But the  court did not agree and as far as we
are concerned, we feel it is a  plus to Nigeria because almost 95 percent of
Nigerians depend on oil.  On the Bakassi side, we were trying to claim what we
call  'effectivity.' This means that Nigerians had been living in the  Bakassi
peninsula for so many years. Unfortunately, the court did not  see it that
way. The court depended on the documents and the treaties  that were agreed upon
by the colonial masters.
Going back to your question of where we stand,  immediately after the
judgement, the former administration made  available N1.17 billion to the
presidential task force so that those  people that want to come back to Nigeria can be
resettled and we have  been able to provide social amenities in about five or
six towns. What  I mean here is secondary schools, rural health centres, police
and  immigration posts, boreholes have been provided for these communities
and many of them are coming back. But it is not compulsory to come  back; if
they want to come back fine, if they want to stay you must  respect Cameroonian
rules. That is how we have been operating. Still  on the issue of the Bakassi,
since the handing over, the two  governments actually appointed another
subcommittee which we call  observer personnel, made of Nigerians, Cameroonians and
United  Nations. These observers visit the Bakassi community every two months
to find out how Cameroon is treating the Bakassi people.
ST: What is going on right now in  Bakassi?
Diggi: What is going on is that each time they go  there, the situation is
peaceful. That is what has been going on to  the best of our knowledge untill
recently when we had this incident of  Cameroonian soldiers being killed by
people we do not know of. The  area that they were killed, it is part of the areas
Nigeria ceded, we  do not have our policemen there, we do not have our
soldiers there, we  do not have any of our administrators there where the killing
took  place.
ST: But how are the communities in Bakassi faring?
Diggi: I said N1.17 billion had been spent earlier  and the present
administration of Umaru Yar'Adua added the sum of N926  million for the construction of
bridges that will connect the villages  to the rest of Nigeria and also the
digging of a canal so that it can  ease the movement of canoes in that area and
speed boat and also some  laterite roads to be constructed. Coming down to
Bakassi area, the sum  of N1 billion was made available but this time around,
not to National  Boundary Commission, not to the presidential committee but to
the  former administration of Bakassi people for the resettlement of the
people.
ST: Are you talking about the Cross Rivers state  government?
Diggi: Yes, the Cross Rivers state government and I  believe it is doing
everything possible to get the people resettled  but you may need to find out more
from the Cross Rivers state  government. Yesterday (on Thursday), the
president during our briefing  with him promised that he will do everything possible
to make sure  that the Bakassi people are well integrated into the rest of the
Nigeria. He will also ask the National Assembly to try to ratify the
agreement that was earlier sent to the lawmakers because it had been  sent to them
by the previous administration and we hope that the  National Assembly will
soon ratify it.

Sunday, 02 December 2007

When the Senate, penultimate Thursday, voted to  void the transfer of the
oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon on  August 14 last year by former
President Olusegun Obasanjo, it did not  bargain for the deluge of reactions that
trailed its decision. If the  Senate's intention was to create a distraction from
its renovation and  budget controversies, it probably succeeded. But at the
same time the  attempt by the Senate to revisit the Bakassi issue paints the
senators  as war mongers. With their action coming on the heels of the killing
of some Cameroonian soldiers by suspected Niger-Delta militants, not a  few
Nigerians interpreted the nullification of Bakassi handover as a  declaration of
war by the lawmakers.
In canceling the transfer of the oil rich area, the  Senate had hinged its
decision to the alleged violation of Section  12(1) of the Constitution in the
refusal of Obasanjo to involve the  National Assembly in the process leading to
the signing of the  Greentree Agreement between Obasanjo and his Cameroonian
counter part,  President Paul Biya, on the ceding of Bakassi.
On Wednesday, Obasanjo denied claims by the Senate  that he acted alone in
the transfer of Bakassi. The former president  said he actually sent a letter to
the National Assembly where he  requested them to ratify the agreement, so as
to resolve legal  quandary. Speaking through his Special Assistant on Media,
Mr. Adeoba  Ojekunle, Obasanjo said, &quot;The last Senate and House of
Representatives  under the leaderships of Senator Ken Nnamani, Hon. Aminu Bello Masari
were duly served the Greentree Agreement between Nigeria and Cameroun  on the
ceding of Bakassi Territory to Cameroun for ratification by the  National
Assembly.&quot;
The mover of the motion for the voiding of Bakassi  transfer by the Senate,
Bassey Ewa-Henshaw, told Sunday Trust that  since Nigeria is under a democratic
era, the only organ recognised by  the Nigerian Constitution to ratify the
decision of ceding the  disputed land was the National Assembly. When asked if
he ever  remembered seeing a letter from the president requesting for
ratification, Ewa-Henshaw said: &quot;I don't remember seeing any letter  from President
Obasanjo…. even if the letter was sent, this cannot  amount to proper procedure
of seeking Senate ratification of the  treaty. Because a bill ought to have
been drafted attached with the  treaty and sent to the National Assembly for
passage into law. We  don't pass letters into law and we don't act on letters we
act on  bills.&quot;
It is not only Ewa-Henshaw who could not recall  seeing a letter from
Obasanjo requesting for the ratification of  Nigeria's acceptance to abide by the
verdict of the International  Court of Justice that ceded Bakassi to Cameroon.
Former Senate  President, Ken Nnamani said he could not say for sure if he
received  such a letter. &quot;I cannot say if we receive such a letter or not, but
that can be checked at the office of the clerk of the National  Assembly,&quot;
Nnamani said.
The Chairman of the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed  Commission, Prince Bola Ajibola,
after a meeting with President  Yar'Adua on Thursday in Abuja, advised the
Senate to do the right  thing by &quot;domesticating the decision of the ICJ without
further  delay&quot;.
Ajibola said that the listing of Bakassi in the  Constitution of Nigeria is
irrelevant in the face of the ICJ verdict.  He exonerated Obasanjo and noted
the former president &quot;acted promptly  by sending a letter to the President of
the Senate as well as the  Speaker of the House of Representatives and other
relevant agencies to  act on accordingly. It was a matter for the Senate to have
ratified.  Not doing that was not the problem of the then president…. The
problem  is the internal problem of Nigeria and it is not relevant to the  ruling.
We cannot approbate and reprobate at the same time.&quot;
Ajibola warned on the dangers of revisiting the  ceding of Bakassi, stressing
that, &quot;If we do this, the world is  watching us. From the beginning, we had
always brought the matter to  the National Assembly. The world would always
expect us to do the  right thing. The world is watching us if we fail to abide by
the  decision of the ICJ.&quot;
He dismissed as unrealistic calls by some Nigerians  that the Federal
Government should listen to the Senate and voids the  agreement. &quot;There is nothing
that will stop that assignment (ceding of  Bakassi to Cameroon). The Senate is
aware of the fact that it had  failed to do what it ought to have done and it
(the Senate) will do it  now. The president did what he ought to have done and
that burden of  ratification is the end of it,&quot; Ajibola said.
Professor Auwalu Yadudu, a constitutional lawyer,  faulted the manner in
which the ceding of Bakassi was carried out by  Obasanjo. Yadudu who was a legal
adviser to General Sani Abacha told  Sunday Trust that Nigeria started on a
wrong footing, following a  declaration by Obasanjo that Nigeria would abide by
the decision of  the court.
&quot;If the former president had said he reserved his  position and that he was
not going along with it or he had to consult  with the necessary organs of the
state, the Senate and others, then  the situation would have been different,&quot;
Yadudu said.
But as it stands, Yadudu said, the nation would  have to consider the
sacrifice of going against the ICJ Judgment and  the far-reaching implications on its
status as a regional power and  its integrity to abide by treaties willingly
entered into. The legal  scholar maintained that Nigeria may choose to ignore
the judgment of  the ICJ and risk being cast in bad light or resolve to abide
by the  verdict so as not to send wrong signals to the international
community.
General Victor Malu, former Army Chief of Staff is  angry at the enormous
monetary cost incurred by the Richard  Akinjide-led legal team that prosecuted
the Bakassi issue at the ICJ.  Malu explained that since Akinjide has been
representing Nigeria at  the ICJ, he was in the best position to advise government
on what to  do.
&quot;If you have been representing Nigeria on the  Bakassi issue for these
numbers of years and you saw the case was a  hopeless case, why didn't you advise
the government then to withdraw  the case? You will only need to go to the book
to know how much  Nigeria spent on the Bakassi issue,&quot; Malu said.
Hon. Essien Ayi, representing Calabar  South/Akpaboyu/Hon. Essien Ayi,
representing Calabar  South/Akpaboyu/&lt;WBR&gt;Bekwarra Federal Constituency told Sunday
Trust  that what the Senate did by voiding the ceding of Bakassi to Cameroon
amounted to an open invitation to war. He expressed fears that any  attempt to
repudiate the transfer of the peninsula to
&quot;The place has already been ceded, so I don't know  how they can retrieve it,
unless we go to war, and I am not ready for  any war. The only way you can
retrieve Bakassi now after the handing  over is through war, and I don't think
this country is ready for any  war. So, it is a case of crying over spilt milk.
The issue has already  been done, the harm has already been done,&quot; Ayi said.
What should be of importance, the lawmaker said,  should be the resettlement
of the people of Bakassi who have agreed to  relocate to Nigeria. He dismissed
calls by Ewa-Henshaw that the issue  should be revisited. Ayi warned that for
the avoidance of outbreak of  hostilities, the issue should not be reviewed
and the Federal  Government should face the challenge of resettling Bakassi
people who  are willing to resettle in Nigeria.
Lagos Lawyer, Bamidele Aturu, described the  decision of the Senate to void
the transfer of Bakassi as a dangerous  trend that should not be contemplated.
In a statement he made  available to Sunday Trust, Aturu maintained that if
Nigeria was  determined to reclaim Bakassi, what should be done is setting
machinery in motion that would encourage the Bakassi to mount pressure  on UN to
conduct a plebiscite to determine where they want to belong
&quot;The option chosen by the Senate is likely to lead  to needless war that
would hurt everyone but those fanning it. I urge  the working people in both
Nigeria and Cameroon to resist any  invitation to shed blood on account of a matter
that can be solved  amicably. They must recognise that none of the
pot-bellied senators  would be drafted. The patriotism displayed by the Senate on this
issue  is to all intents and purposes false. We do not need to go to war on
this matter,&quot; Aturu said.
Director General of the National Boundary  Commission, NBC, Alhaji Sadiq
Diggi, said on Friday that Nigeria has  benefited from the ICJ verdict and that no
amount of opposition would  stop the transfer of Bakassi to Cameroun which is
a fait accompli.  Speaking to Sunday Trust, Diggi said that the ICJ verdict
was a good  omen to the country.
According to the NBC boss, &quot;in Adamawa state alone,  we have been able to
gain, minimum 60 square kilometres of additional  land which was not available
before in Nigeria and in fact when you  move to Taraba state, we have been able
to gain 75 square kilometres,  and by the time you add the small number of
square kilometres, we have  been able to gain minimum of about 90 square
kilometres additional  land into Nigeria.&quot;
Diggi said that President Yar'Adua has given his  commitment towards ensuring
the full integration of Bakassi people  into the Nigerian society.
A Daily Trust online poll on whether the Federal  Government should reclaim
the Bakassi peninsula indicates that 119 out  of 154 respondents were
favourably disposed to the nullification of  the transfer. This represents 77.3 per
cent of the total respondents  were in favour of the Senate's action.
With the Federal Government declaring last week  that it has no intention of
reviewing the Greentree Agreement that  ceded Bakassi to Cameroun, some
Nigerians are asking what options are  there left for the Senate to force the
Yar'Adua government undertake a  review of an agreement that was signed on June 12,
2006 in new York by  Obasanjo and Biya. Will Yar'Adua buckle under the
pressure of the  lawmakers or will the president send the Greentree Treaty to the
National Assembly for ratification?
