My drive across northern Florida today was on Highway 98, along Florida's Gulf Coast. I was struck by how many properties along the coast are for sale and seemingly sitting empty. If I had to guess, I'd say it must be impossible or horribly expensive to get flood insurance for these properties. In one sense, it is sad to see so many beautiful properties up for sale and seemingly not selling. On the other hand, it is encouraging to know that maybe the next time a major hurricane strikes this area, there might be less occupied human development in the way of its storm surge.
