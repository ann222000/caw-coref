even the star has gone hyper bole and polemic in its report.

1. anti samyvellu vernacular paper- this is 'MAKKAL OSAI&quot;  a new tamil paper. it gives equal coverage to both pandithan and his opponents. and it reports facts with reason. it is neither anti samyvellu nor pro anybody. it is the peoples paper. it respects the readers who pay to buy the paper unlike malaysia nanban and tamilnesan in  which the reporters are in the payroll of samyvellu.- s much for journalistic integrity among some tamil journalists.

2. the opponents/dissidents in IPF are NOT gainst samy and pandithans renewed friendhsip despite both being vitroilic calling each other names unheard of.eg pig, black devil, ungrateful dog,etc etc. what they want is proper accounting of party funds and other donations and democracy in IPF. perhaps the dissidents are totally UNFAIR in the eyes of the star in wanting what is considered legal and decent.

3. makkal osai is the only tamil paper that reports wo rear and favour the truth among the malaysian indian community. the other 2 dailies ie tamilnesan and malaysia nanban have become MICs propaganda papers. perhaps theres a secret agreement to share the spoils of the coming elections with malaysia nanban.

4. samy and pandthan will realise that malaysian indians are more than them in the coming elections.

KUALA LUMPUR: The Indian Progressive Front (IPF) would not be dissolved as
long as &quot;I am alive,&quot; said its president Tan Sri M.G. Pandithan.

&quot;Even to the last drop of my blood, I want to remain in IPF. We have gone
through 20 years of hardship and struggle and I want the party to remain,&quot;
he said.

In his address at the party's 15th general assembly, Pandithan said that
despite IPF's new cooperation with MIC, the struggle to be admitted into
Barisan Nasional would continue.

For the first time in IPF's history, one-time political foe MIC president
Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu was given the honour of addressing the 3,000
delegates yesterday.

Acting Gerakan president Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon, MIC deputy president Datuk G.
Palanivel, and MIC vice-presidents Datuk S. Veerasingam and Tan Sri K.S.
Nijhar were also present.

Samy Vellu said that the question of IPF's entry into Barisan was not
discussed but MIC held fast to the belief that only one Indian-based party
could represent the community in Barisan.

The frail Pandithan, 67, who was once an ardent critic of Samy Vellu,
yesterday heaped praise and welcome on the MIC president.

&quot;His (Samy Vellu's) presence has brought a glow to IPF and this day will be
long remembered as a momentous day in the chequered history of IPF,&quot; he
said.

However, his recent rediscovered affection for Samy Vellu has not gone down
well with many in his own party. An anti-Samy Vellu vernacular newspaper had
gone to town recently slamming Pandithan for selling out IPF and predicting
that it would be dissolved.

Pandithan took issue with the newspaper yesterday, saying that IPF
dissidents had used the paper to vent their frustration.

&quot;I said I would make an important announcement on the future of the party at
today's assembly but the newspaper gave space to members who claimed to have
positions in IPF,&quot; he said.

Earlier in his speech, Samy Vellu said MIC and IPF could work together to
resolve the problems faced by the community especially on housing,
employment opportunities and business. He also pledged RM500,000 for the IPF
building fund.

Speaking to reporters later, Pandithan said he was grateful to Samy Vellu
who had agreed to MIC working with IPF without setting any conditions.
