Eight First Kisses

Part 1
Please see part 0 (template) for warnings and summary.

River often wonders about her first kiss.

She wonders about who, and when, and where, and--obviously--what it will be
like.

She's been kissed before, of course. There were kisses to the forehead and
cheek when she was younger, but her parents and brother don't count. Those were
more like hugs, in her mind. Gestures of comfort and familiarity. Gestures that
stopped once she reached a certain age. Her parents didn't want to coddle her,
and her brother...

Well, he still gives her a peck on the cheek now and then, but there is
something guilty and furtive about it, as if he is afraid of letting his lips
linger too long so that it turns from an almost-hug into something else.
Something like a real kiss, maybe.

Intellectually, she knows that a kiss is nothing more than a modified nursing
instinct that has become part of human mating protocol. The fact that her lips
tingle when she thinks about kisses is an autonomic response driven by hormones
and neural pathways in the few parts of her brain that she can't control.

It has nothing to do with romance.

Romance is nothing but a pretty fiction, designed to add a veneer of civility
and mystery to a basic human function. Romance is not necessary, and neither
are kisses. The fact that she can't stop thinking about them is an irritant,
both because it is horribly distracting and because it reminds her that kisses
should have happened years ago. But, the Academy got in the way of kisses, just
like it got in the way of so many other things, like dances, and sunshine, and
being able to have her mind to herself.

But now she's here on Serenity, free in ways she had never imagined; yet at the
same time almost as trapped as she was at the Academy, except for those rare
times she can suit up and go out into the black. Then, she's free, or something
close to it. Most of the time, though, it's nothing but the same eight people,
all the gorram time, leaning up against her mind so much that she feels like
they're pressing up against her flesh. When it's like that, she can't feel
Serenity. She can't feel herself.

It's almost certain that her first kiss will be with someone on Serenity. Logic
dictates this, and fantasy encourages it.

One thing she's sure of is that it won't be Book.

She's long since figured out that she isn't really scared of his hair, let down
and sticking out like thousands of microwire probes going into his brain. What
really scares her is what she sees hiding beneath that hair, and what it will
be like if it is let loose.

No, she doesn't kiss Book. Just the thought of it makes her stomach feel
squiggly, and not in a good way.

Sometimes, especially those times when everyone is so busy that they pretend
she doesn't exist, she thinks she might just up and kiss Simon one of these
days, just to see what happens. The thought of it makes her giggle--he'd be so
upset with her, and at himself, too. It might be worth the inevitable lecture
on proper behavior just to see the expression on his face.

To be honest, she is also curious to know if he'd kiss her back. He wants to
and he doesn't want to, all at the same time, and that intrigues her. One
either wants something or doesn't want something. The two should not coexist in
one brain.

Well, not in the brains of *sane* people, anyway.

Then there is Mal.

She knows how it starts. He stands there for a few minutes with his hands on
her shoulders, staring down at her almost angrily, jaw working as he tells
himself not to do this because she's too gorram young, not to mention crazy in
the bargain. Even in her imaginings, River hears his thoughts as if he's
standing right there in front of her. He's imagined this, too, and she's not
sure if it's her imaginings or his that she sees.

Once he's done thinking, he leans down and kisses her, mouth closed but still
rough, like he's trying to tell her that she doesn't want this, not really, not
with someone as damaged as him. She's already been hurt enough, he thinks, and
there's nothing he can give her that won't hurt her more.

What happens after that, she can't tell. Sometimes, he just lets go of her
shoulders and all but pushes her away as he turns and stalks off. Other times,
his mouth eventually softens against hers, and his hands drift down from her
shoulders to her back as he pulls her against him.

It bothers her that she doesn't know which imagining is the true one. It
bothers her even more that she'll probably never find out for sure.

As for Zoe and Wash, she doesn't think it will be either of them. The idea of
one of them without the other just doesn't feel right in her mind. They can't
be separated. Just thinking about it is a wire sparking and smoking in her
brain. If one of them kissed her, it would be the way her parents kissed her,
back when they believed they loved her.

They are good parents, she thinks. Zoe might be too strict, and Wash not strict
enough, but they'll never sell their children in order to cement their own
social status. Sometimes, she thinks that it is Zoe who rescues her from the
Academy, guns blazing and bodies falling as she swoops down to River like a
mother-angel of vengeance. And then Zoe spreads her beautiful, blood-spattered
wings and takes River to Serenity so that Wash can fly them to somewhere far,
far away into the black where no one will ever be hurt again.

To be honest, she wouldn't mind if Zoe one day leaned over and kissed her on
the forehead. Wash would be more likely to throw an arm around her shoulders
and give her a sideways hug, and say something that would make her laugh. She
wouldn't mind that, either. And these are things that might happen, so there is
no point wondering about them.

Inara will kiss her, if she asks in just the right way. Inara always smiles
softly when River admits that it's her first kiss, and she is always careful to
ask if River is absolutely sure she wants to do this. Inara rests one
lotion-soft hand on River's cheek, steadying her, calming her, and then she
leans in (they are always kneeling face-to-face when River imagines this), and
her lips touch River's, feather-light, pressing just hard enough to leave
memories, but not so much that she'll leave regrets. She then leans back, still
smiling, with her hand lingering for a moment on River's cheek. And that is
all, and it never happens, because River never asks.

But maybe she will. Maybe she already has.

With Jayne, it's all very, very different. He hesitates, like Mal does, but
only because he wonders if it's worth all the trouble, kissing this crazy girl,
because no one will believe she'd started it.

Jayne's thoughts are not subtle, and they hit her like hammers.

He thinks it's a trick, a trap, a test. He thinks it's nothing but craziness,
that she'll start screaming the second he so much as touches her. He thinks
about airlocks and the coldness of the black. He thinks about knives. He thinks
about the noises she'll make when he slides his hands up the front of her
shirt. He thinks he is dreaming.

If he doesn't run away before he lets himself catch her, his kisses are rough
without meaning to be, and she is just as rough in return. It's messy, it
certainly isn't romantic, and once they start, there isn't much in the way of
thought, not from him, and not from her.

She's pretty sure they don't stop at kissing, and that notion is at once
exciting and problematic. Probably not worth the consequences, she thinks
wistfully. Still, it's a nice thing to ponder when she's in the mood.

She often thinks that Kaylee will the first one who kisses her. Or the first
one she kisses. It goes either way. It happens naturally, like part of a game.
They'll be talking, then laughing, then kissing. Even when they start kissing,
they can't tell who started it. What River does know is that Kaylee tastes
sweet, like gum or strawberries, and there isn't any worry about consequences,
or regrets, or shame, or misunderstandings hiding in her kisses. If such a
thing is possible, they are laughing, even as they kiss.

There might be more kisses, or more than just kisses. Or there might only be
the one kiss, like a joke shared just between the two of them. The best part
about it is, any one of these endings is just as good as the others. Most of
the time, thoughts of kissing Kaylee fills River with a warmth and contentment
she thought she'd lost long before the Academy.

But sometimes, especially late at night when Serenity is the only other one
awake, River suspects that the Kaylee she's kissing is the Kaylee from before
the gunfire and before the fear. She's not sure that Kaylee tastes like
strawberries anymore.

These are the things that River thinks, when she thinks about kissing.

And every time she thinks about kissing, she also thinks about the black.
Sooner or later, the longing that these kisses wake in her body always becomes
a longing to be outside.

On a few rare, precious occasions, when they're not on a job and no one is
after them, she is able to wheedle Mal and her brother into allowing her to put
on the suit and go outside to nestle against Serenity's hull. Most of the time,
though, she has to go outside in thought only, cheek leaning into Serenity's
bulkhead, the hull cupping her face like it's making her a promise. It's not
enough, just like going outside confined in the suit is not enough. She wants
to wear Serenity like she wears her own skin.

And even though she knows all the reasons why it's impossible, when she goes
outside she feels the starlight warm and soft on her lips, her throat, her
belly. It's the only kiss she has ever known, and maybe, the only one she truly
craves.
