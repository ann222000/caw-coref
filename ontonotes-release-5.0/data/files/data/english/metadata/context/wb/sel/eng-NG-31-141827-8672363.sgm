Coke and Pepsi and Nestle water fraud

The following are some notes from the Democracy Now
and other sources.

Nestle (Purina butcher invested as well as major marketer of factory
farmed milk through Butterfinger and a number of other products) owns
Poland Spring, Arrowhead, Deer
Park, and Ice Mountain.

Coke and Pepsi forced to admit their bottled water Aquafina
and Dasani are from tap. The campaign &quot;Think outside the bottle&quot;
has had some success. Deer Park has not released its source. Coke,
Pepsi, and Nestle
continue to hide their source.

Nestle owns 2 dozen brands of bottled water including Poland
Spring of Maine (site of homes of G H W Bush and John Roberts).

Water activists want Poland Spring and every other
spring water seller to publish assays of their water.

Stockton California has rebought its water system
back after it was privatized (sold at firesale prices to profiteers)

El Salvador govt has arrested 12 protesting privatization of
water.Those driving to the peaceful protest against privatizaiton
of water
were pulled out of their cars and charged with terrorism.
the World Bank funded the water privatization. Committee in
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador and Christy Hanson
have done much work.

In some areas of polluted water, fruit juice is the safest, since
the fruit embryo is shielded by tree leaves, roots, and stems.

http://www.democracynow.org provided much of the information
for this post. Democracy Now has a daily news show of an hour.

Michael Blanding has written 'The Bottled Water Lie&quot;.

Democracy Now: Since these companies charge sometimes
1.50 a bottle, this water is 7000 times more expensive
than tap water.

Corporate Accountability has done a lot of work in exposing these
corporations

In the UK 1/2 million bottles of Dasani sickened people.
India has taken corporate water to their highest court.

The process of ozonation of water leaves a byproduct
suspected to be a carcinogen.

&quot;Public water source&quot; means tap water.

****
The choking of landfills with plastic bottle trash of Nestle, Coke
and Pepsi has caused the destruction
of billions of trees.

In addition, these corporations deplete water supplies.

Privatization of water has caused free water to be outrageously
priced.

NYC, SF, and Ann Arbor have active water movements.

The mayor of SF has announced public money can't be spent
to buy bottled water. He, the mayors of Salt Lake City and
Minneapolis issued a resolution at the mayors' conference
about the impact of bottled water.

The plastic in the bottle leaches into the water.

a commercial filter site above speaks about bromide
contaminants

The book and movie Thirst report on water privatization in
India, Bolivia and the US. Alan Snitow wrote the book.
http://www.thirstthemovie.org

Privatizers want to control the world's seeds (in Iraq Paul
Bremer outlawed the farmers' saving their own seeds), food,
(Cargill ConAgra ADM), water, sun and land.

(In Stockton City Council had
signed a privatization contract without consulting the people)

(In Stockton, temp workers were brought in. There was increased ecoli
(fecal matter in water) and the people were not informed.

Stockton signed a 'no disparagement' contract with OMI Thames
the water privatizer.

Suez, a privatizer, was kicked out of Atlanta.

In Holyoke, Aquarian took over the water system.
Nestle has been kicked out of Wisconsin, has infiltrated Michigan.
In Lexington, a water fight.
Atlanta Georgia.. one of the biggest scandals.. the mayor
who brought in the water company was indicted for scandal.
