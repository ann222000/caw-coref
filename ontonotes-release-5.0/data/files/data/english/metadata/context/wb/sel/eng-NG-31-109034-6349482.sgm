Decades of Darkness #160: West of Suez

"We are going to have peace even if we have to fight for it."
- New England President Shane Mullins, 1929

* * *

19 June 1929
HMS Challenger
Off Port Said, Eastern Mediterranean

Chief Petty Officer Anthony Woodward craned his neck as he searched
the skies for any glimpses of German skycraft.  His gun crew were
ready to fire.  They had to be.  Challenger's sister ship, the
destroyer Enterprise, had been sunk yesterday by one of the damnable
Valk fighter-bombers.  If one of those diving monsters picked out the
Challenger, it would be up to him and the other gun crews to stop it
before it could release a five-hundred-pound bomb on the destroyer.
All it took was one bomb, and the ship would become nothing but an oil
slick and scattered wreckage...

"Skycraft!" the shout came, from somewhere behind him.

A moment later, Woodward spotted the enemy skycraft himself.  Three
black specks in front of white clouds, but already dropping rapidly.

"Look sharp, boys!" he said.  They were ready even without his order,
and the first five-inch shell climbed into the sky... but it burst too
far from the rapidly-plunging Valks.  None of Challenger's six five-
inch guns came anywhere near the bombers as they dived ever so fast
toward the destroyer.

The first bomb plunged into the water far off to starboard, sending a
jet of water into the sky but doing no harm to the ship.  Woodward
never found out where the second bomb landed, but he did discover why
there was no third bomb, when a Valk never pulled out of its plunge
until it hit the sea.  One of the other Valks pulled up just above the
waves, and screamed above the Challenger's superstructure.  It was
close enough for Woodward to see the enclosed cockpit and machine guns
embedded in the wings.

"Where's our damned skycraft?" he muttered, but he still let loose a
sigh of relief.  The first wave of enemy bombers were gone.  Now all
he had to worry about was a second wave.  And sea wolves.  And the
main body of the German fleet, whenever they sortied from Port Said.

Chapter 2: Around The Middle Sea

The first clashes near the Suez Canal offered both Germany and Britain
considerable opportunity in the early days of the war.  In a clash
which was ostensibly over access to the Canal itself, the morale-
boosting effects of a victory were obvious.  The strategic gains on
offer were equally impressive.  Consolidating their hold on the Canal
area would give Germany a hand at the throat of Britain's Middle
Eastern possessions.  Egypt would be isolated, the defending British
forces cut off from easy resupply, and forced into a two-front war in
Libya in the west and Suez in the east.  Palestine, too, would be
threatened.  And having naval access to the Canal would allow the
German Mediterranean Fleet to receive support from their Indian Ocean
squadron.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the British perspective, recapturing the Canal would reopen the

most important sea lane in the Empire and blunt the thrust of
Germany's surprise attack in the Mediterranean.  Any naval battle
which inflicted comparable losses on the German Navy would also
enhance the British naval position in the Mediterranean, given that
the German Navy was outnumbered in this theatre.

In short, the struggle for control of Suez was a significant one for
both sides.  Yet the forces they had available were hardly ones which
either side would have preferred to deploy for such a battle.

Germany's forces were on the whole more prepared, but naval
commitments elsewhere and the need to mobilise forces quickly meant
that they had not brought everything they would have wanted.  They had
sent five capital ships, two carriers and three battleships, and a
good number of smaller vessels to screen the capital ships and offer
support to their ground forces.  But the German Marines, while well-
equipped for a shock landing, lacked the heavy artillery and arlacs
which would be vital in a major ground battle.  The German sky power
was also quite limited.  They had only the sky wings of two carriers;
ninety-six Valk fighter-dive bombers who had the difficult tasks of
protecting against British land-based fighters while still striking
both land and naval targets.

British forces were less organised than their German counterparts.
For naval forces, they had three battleships and more cruisers and
destroyers than the German Navy had in the area, but these ships did
not have a unified command structure in place before the war broke
out.  Britain did have more skycraft available in Egypt, over three
hundred in all, which varied from one squadron of the modern Grisham
Enigmas [1] to North American War-vintage bi-wings used for
reconnaissance and harassment raids.  But these skycraft also lacked a
unified command and had not trained to work in cooperation with the
Royal Navy, although they did have some experience supporting ground
forces.  Britain's colonial forces in Egypt were also under-manned,
although they did have the advantage of a considerable number of
arlacs...

The German strategy in Suez had been predicated on the assumption that
Britain would maintain a substantial portion of its forces in western
Egypt to defend from the Deutschleger forces advancing from Libya.  In
fact, Major-General Lord Gort quickly reached the decision to withdraw
all troops from the west except a small screening force.  He assembled
all available forces for a rapid ground assault to recapture Port
Said.  The Royal Navy and Royal Sky Force concentrated their forces
for an assault at a similar time.  The stage was set for simultaneous
land and naval battles.  The British arranged a series of harassing
sky and sea raids over three days while they manoeuvred their ground
forces into position, then launched a major naval sortie on 29 June.
The immediate fate of Egypt and the Canal would now be decided in the
Battle of Suez on water, and the Battle of Port Said on land...

From: "Salt of Glory, Salt of Tears: The Last War of the Royal Navy"
By Admiral John Cochrane (ret.) and Prof. Albert McLaughlin
(c) 1944 New Cambridge University Press
Sydney, Kingdom of Australia
Used with permission.

...Vice-Admiral Bertram Montgomery set simple terms of engagement for
his forces during the Battle of Suez: engage the German fleet, sink or
damage as many enemy ships as possible without unacceptable British
losses, but above all keep German ships and skycraft too busy to help
their land forces during the crucial stages of that battle.

The forces he had under his command were a motley assemblage of those
Royal Navy ships which had been assigned to the area recently, rather
than those who had trained together.  With the inherent
professionalism of the RN, that was not something he expected to cause
any particular problems during the battle.  Communication protocols
were standard, after all, and while there were some occasional moments
of confusion, on the whole Montgomery was correct in his assumption...

The British forces for the Battle of Suez consisted of three
battleships, the recently-constructed Redoubtable and the veterans
Prince of Wales and Warspite.  These capital ships were supported by
six cruisers, twenty-one destroyers, and an uncertain number of sea
wolves, variously reported as eleven or fifteen.  While not operating
under Montgomery's command, the RN forces had the aid of a variety of
land-based skycraft.  Their main fighter support came from two
squadrons of Grisham Enigmas, and three squadrons of the older Turner
Gauntlets.  The RSF bomber contingent included twelve Vickers
Thunderers [2], and a variety of older bombers, most of which were bi-
wings.  Unfortunately, the RSF Egyptian squadrons had no dive-bombers
or torpedo bombers, which would have been extremely valuable against
the Krijgmarine.

The German forces in the Battle of Suez have been reported in so many
different ways that it is difficult to determine exactly which ships
were involved.  It is certain that they had two fleet carriers, Der
Haagen and Bremen, and three battleships, Gneisenau, De Ruyter, and
Tegetthoff.  The number of German cruisers in the battle has been
variously reported as four, five and seven, although five appears to
be the correct figure.  They had at least twenty-eight destroyers,
perhaps as many as thirty-four, as the Krijgmarine placed a high
priority on suppressing British submersible activity.  The number of
German sea wolves operating in the battle zone has never been
officially reported, but is believed to have been less than ten.  The
naval sky arm is one of the few components of the German fleet whose
numbers are reliably known; Der Haagen and Bremen were each carrying
their full complement of forty-eight Valk fighter-dive bombers at the
start of the invasion of Suez.  Except for one of Bremen's skycraft
which had crashed during support of the first landings, the remaining
ninety-five Valks would be engaged in the Battle of Suez...

Inevitably, the battle involved a series of engagements between the
supporting vessels on each side, sea wolves being both hunters and
hunted, and a battle fought between ships and skycraft, and skycraft
against each other.  None of these engagements would prove decisive to
the battle, although they certainly kept the men on both sides busy.
Sea wolves had quite mixed success against warships; they damaged
several but only succeeded in sinking destroyers (three German and two
British vessels).

The sky battle led to similarly mixed results.  The Valks launched two
waves of assaults against the Royal Navy on the day of battle.
Including ships sunk in the harassment phase, the German fighter-
bombers sunk one British cruiser, the Undaunted, and three
destroyers.  But the German skycraft took severe losses of their own
during the sky battle.  The Valks gave a better account of themselves

In part, but regardless of the result in Suez, it would still be a long war.
The length of the war will be dictated by how the battles fare on
continental Europe, and by the naval contests in the North Sea and central
Med, rather than around Suez.  The biggest outcome of this battle is
actually that both sides have learned the value of skycraft against
battleships - one dive-bomber inflicted nearly as much damage on a
battleship from one bomb as the battleship took in a two-hour engagement
with another battleship.  _That_ is a lesson which all of the world's navies
would do well to notice.

'Battle of Suez?' - location? As the city of Suez is on the Red Sea end
of the canal, I'm rather surprised if the _naval_ engagement would take
place _there_. [The German landing - and re-supply - fleet - should
mostly operate from the Med side of the Canal, shouldn't they, out of
the Adriatic..?]

Well, to call it 'an acceptable outcome' they would have to look trough
a set of pink glasses... - As Germany has no allies in Asia (yet),
keeping the shortest supply lines open is way more important to them
than to the Brits..

And of course, the 'decisive blow' might be an even greater
exaggeration. If the Brits had to strip the western borders of Egypt....

---

Some further comments about strategic options (continued from 158...)

&gt;&gt; Of course there might be some rivalry between Army and Navy.... :) If
&gt;&gt; keeping the colonial Empire intact would be a number one priority -
&gt;&gt; *England first* might well be the preferred strategic option....
&gt;
&gt; The Navy might well think so.  I doubt the Army does.  The colonial
&gt; empireis all very well, but having the French knocking on the gates of
&gt; Frankfurt is a moderately bad strategic position to be in.  And the
&gt; difficulties with an amphibious assault are _very_ large; even if the
&gt; Germans try a Sea Lion Express in July 1929, I think it would end in a
&gt; fiasco.  Essentially, they need to knock the Royal Navy and the *RAF
&gt; out of the fight first.  The British will no doubt be building more
&gt; planes _very_ quickly, but theGermans will need a window of
&gt; opportunity.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; How important Air-forces already are in 1929 is another question...
&gt;&gt; If naval superiority is possible and can be maintained, the supply
&gt;&gt; lines -for whom ever is launching an invasion - are not that long....
&gt;
&gt; The problem is that protecting the resupply gets very difficult if
&gt; there's aircraft and warships wandering around all over the place.
&gt; Supplying an army large enough to invade Britain will require a lot of
&gt; materiel, and this needs to be taken away from what's needed to fight
&gt; the French, the Italians,keep down Hungary and Croatia, and German
&gt; troops kept over near the Russian border in case the Russians do
&gt; decide to join in.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt; The later shouldn't be to difficult - expect most German air-bases to
&gt;&gt; be concentrated in Flanders, in easy reach of both London and Paris.
&gt;&gt; So, of course, they have to fight off the French Sky-craft as well,
&gt;&gt; but if they do, aerial parity is a distinct possibility.
&gt;
&gt; Aerial parity may not be enough to supply an invasion fleet.  All it
&gt; takes is one bad day when the enemy can strike at the transport/cargo
&gt; vessels, and things get very ugly

&gt;
&gt; The RN will need to be careful, but the best time to hit an invasion
&gt; fleet might well be _after_ the first troops have landed.  It seems
&gt; odd, in one respect, but that guarantees that the Krijgmarine will
&gt; fight, too.  And having to defend the resupply fleet will limit the
&gt; manoeuvrability of the Krijgmarine a lot more than the Royal Navy.
&gt; And if the British win the naval battle in such circumstances, or even
&gt; inflict enough losses that the Germans can't resupply effectively,
&gt; whatever troops Germany has landed are pretty much gone anyway.

Short summary... Invading across the Channel is risky, and very costly,
as  long as no side has a clear naval AND aerial supremacy... Agreed.

But.. you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs - so even
significant casualties might be an acceptable price, if the prize to
gain in an invasion is large enough...

If we assume a rough parity of both naval and aerial forces in the
region, this of course means that not all of your supplies and
re-enforcements will make it across [but a significant part still will].
But as both sides have a staging ground quite close to the target area,
and this staging ground isn't far from their main industrial centers,
adjusting deliveries according to need shouldn't be that a big problem...

So the question is - who has more to *win* from shipment across...

Britain needs to ship if they want to have an impact at all on the
continent. With parity in the Strait of Dover, the likely losses from
direct shipments to France might look unacceptable, just to send and
supply a BEF. And if - to minimize losses - shipments mostly go the long
way - say from Bristol and Liverpool to Nantes and Bordeaux, instead of
Southampton to Le Havre or Newhaven to Dieppe, this will considerably
lengthen shipment time - and reduce capacity. [Of course, as long as the
Germans control Flanders and have naval parity, Britain can't afford to
send a large force to the continent... - and thus, the obvious target
for a British invasion of the continent would be Flanders... - this
would remove the imminent danger of a German invasion in SE-England.
OTOH, the price might still be to high, as even a successful conquest of
Antwerp will not knock out Germany.]

But for Germany, the options might look quite different...

They, of course, would need to ship (and invade) if they want to make an
impact (on land) on the British isles. But if they could gain as much
ground as the Brits would by taking Antwerp, they should hold London,
Reading, and probably Oxford...This would not only eliminate much of
England's industrial capacity and of it's transportation network, but
would also look as a distinctive psychological blow. So, loosing the
heart of England might well knock out Britain, and thus, the price might
not look *to high*.

But generally, the strategic position of the British Home Island *at the
start of the Great War* is much worse , than what it ever was IOTL in
the 19th or 20th century (At least as bad as if Napoleon would have won
at Trafalgar...).

&gt;&gt; If they learnt some lessions from the NAW, they might as well go on
&gt;&gt; the defensive against Italy and France (well, winning a naval battle
&gt;&gt; in the Adriatic and shell a few Italian coastal cities would still be
&gt;&gt; possible), and concentrate on the 'treacherous former friends and
&gt;&gt; allies'. [The German public wouldn't expect anything than hostility
&gt;&gt; from France and Italy, so the outrage about the _betrayal_ from
&gt;&gt; London will run high, and Britain can easily achieve the _most hated_
&gt;&gt; status by a vast margin.]

&gt; This is quite true, but standing on the defensive may well be the
&gt; _wrong_lesson for Germany to have acquired from the NAW.  Especially
&gt; if the French or Italians have even a moderately effective version of
&gt; blitzkrieg

This seems a bit far fetched (ASB in the case of Italy, but more on that
later). If *Russia* is on the Bouclier side, the French alone might
achieve enough superiority in the west that they could do well. But the
distance from the border to Frankfurt is a bit longer than to Paris, and
the terrain might be more advantageous for large armored assaults in the
later case than in the former... And France is more centralized than
Germany, so the loss of Paris would hurt more. A distinctive victory in
a French 'Blitzkrieg' would require them to reach the Rhine on it's
length, take the Ruhr area, Frankfurt and to proceed from there at least
to either Bremen/Hanover or Nuremberg (better both). This seems
extremely unlikely....
But without Russia in the war, the French can't reach sufficient
superiority. The short-term impact of a BEF on the continent should be
limited for the reasons listed above.

So France is much more likely to become the *victim* of a Blitzkrieg
than the *victor*. At least, if Germany would pick *France first* as the
strategic option...

But Italy - ASB. [And this is not based on OTL's mediocre performance of
Italian armies, but on geo-strategic considerations alone]. If your main
base is in Italy, you can project power across the seas (if your have
naval supremacy) and establish beach-heads, if the opposition is weak
enough. And from there, you can supply by sea, and land (if there is a
connection) - around the Med, and invade the interior. This is what Rome
successfully did...But to launch a major invasion North across the Alps?
Well, it

With Russia neutral France is toast to put it bluntly. Just count what
ATL Germany holds. Low countries 16.3 million, Czechoslovakia 14.7
million, Switzerland 4.1 million, Austria 6.7 million, Germany proper
~72.2 million (probably more as ww1 casualties would be way heavier than
the 2nd Napoleonic wars ones). That is 114 million without counting
Venezia and north France.

Germany will be able to start the war with something in the order of 300
divisions. France will be lucky to have a population around 40 million
and more probably will have around 35 million. That's about 80-90
divisions...

Quite complicated in naval terms, yes.  The Mediterranean is going to be a
difficult balance.  Germany has perhaps the biggest individual fleet, or
close to it.  The Bouclier have a larger combined fleet, but coordination
amongst the allies may prove difficult.

Of course, if Germany can steamroll France before the Bouclier allies can
mobilise there, then the course of the war could be quite short.

It's really called putting the best face on it.  For Germany to lose the
shortest supply lines to Asia hurts, of course, but even if they held the
Suez Canal, they'd still need to force passage through the Red Sea, where
Britain sits at the other end.  And denying the Suez Canal to Britain does
at least make it easier for Germany to control operations in the Med.

Yup.  The battle for Egypt has, in one sense, only just begun.  However,
there's also the French presence in Algeria to bear in mind.  France can't
spare the manpower for a full-scale invasion, but even harassment from
colonial forces would accomplish a lot to prevent resupply, unless Germany
pulls substantial forces west.

The problem is the advantage that the defenders have in terms of supplies.
Landing a major invasion force is difficult, and supplying it is more
difficult still.  The question is _what percentage_ of supplies make it
through in the first wave, then the second, then the third, to make up for
what's used in fighting.  The military readiness of TTL's Britain of 1929 is
not comparable to British military readiness in either world war in OTL.
ITTL, the big lesson the British learned from the North American War was
that they needed to be ready to mobilise their military strength quickly.
Which means conscription and the organisational capacity for rapid
mobilisation.  Britain will be able to mobilise their manpower extremely
quickly.  And if they haven't sent their soldiers to France (for whatever
reason) it means that those troops are mostly sitting in the south of
England (not much point stationing them in, say, Scotland).  Ready to repel
any invasion force.  Given that the British have a substantial amount of
arlacs and artillery, and that landing _those_ is difficult for an invasion
force until they can secure a deepwater port, it means that a successful
invasion is going to require more than rough parity of naval and aerial
forces.  It means that the invaders need to secure a useful harbour
_quickly_, preventing British sabotage, and establishing a reliable source
of supply and reinforcements (probably at least two-thirds of those sent)
immediately.  This is not entirely impossible, but it requires a great deal
of luck.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So the question is - who has more to *win* from shipment across...

&gt; Britain needs to ship if they want to have an impact at all on the
&gt; continent. With parity in the Strait of Dover, the likely losses from
&gt; direct shipments to France might look unacceptable, just to send and
&gt; supply a BEF. And if - to minimize losses - shipments mostly go the long
&gt; way - say from Bristol and Liverpool to Nantes and Bordeaux, instead of
&gt; Southampton to Le Havre or Newhaven to Dieppe, this will considerably
&gt; lengthen shipment time - and reduce capacity. [Of course, as long as the
&gt; Germans control Flanders and have naval parity, Britain can't afford to
&gt; send a large force to the continent... - and thus, the obvious target for
&gt; a British invasion of the continent would be Flanders... - this would
&gt; remove the imminent danger of a German invasion in SE-England. OTOH, the
&gt; price might still be to high, as even a successful conquest of Antwerp
&gt; will not knock out Germany.]

&gt; But for Germany, the options might look quite different...

&gt; They, of course, would need to ship (and invade) if they want to make an
&gt; impact (on land) on the British isles. But if they could gain as much
&gt; ground as the Brits would by taking Antwerp, they should hold London,
&gt; Reading, and probably Oxford...This would not only eliminate much of
&gt; England's industrial capacity and of it's transportation network, but
&gt; would also look as a distinctive psychological blow. So, loosing the heart
&gt; of England might well knock out Britain, and thus, the price might not
&gt; look *to high*.

&gt; But generally, the strategic position of the British Home Island *at the
&gt; start of the Great War* is much worse , than what it ever was IOTL in the
&gt; 19th or 20th century (At least as bad as if Napoleon would have won at
&gt; Trafalgar...).
">

Agreed that Britain is in a perilous position, but the big question is what
are the German strategic priorities.  From Germany's point of view, they
have three major enemies - Britain, France and Italy - and one very major
potential enemy, Russia.  No-one knows which way Russia will jump, but given
that France is a Russian ally, there is a strong temptation to knock France
out of the war before Russia can join in on the French side.  Although that
attempt may bring Russia into the war on the French side, so who knows?

Or, to put it another way, Germany has four options:

1. Attack France quickly, hoping to knock them out before British and Empire
reinforcements can arrive in strength.  Germany has the advantage in
manpower, even allowing for reserving substantial numbers of troops on other
fronts (watching Russia, in particular).  This option does risk Russian
intervention, but Germany may succeed if they can mobilise quickly and/or
use diplomacy effectively.

2. Concentrate against Italy.  A major German push may have difficulty
capturing all of Italy - the terrain is hardly suited to a long push down
the country, as demonstrated in WW2 in OTL - but the northern parts of Italy
are quite vulnerable if Germany sends in a few army groups.

3.  Sit on the defensive against France and Italy, and try to knock Britain
out of the war.  This assumes a naval and/or aerial battle, and some
variation of Sea Lion Express.  Very much the high-risk high-reward option.
Personally, I suspect that an invasion of Britain would be a colossal
strategic blunder unless France has been neutralised first, but I'm open to
correction.

4. Take on a role of strategic defensive, and confine most military action
to naval clashes, stabilising the situation in Hungary and Croatia, and
fighting a limited war in Egypt and the Middle East.  This assumes that
Germany has interpreted the lessons from the North American War to be that
the defender has the advantages, and that they want to bleed the Bouclier by
inviting them to attack.  This also allows Germany maximum opportunity to
gain the moral and diplomatic high ground.  "We were forced into war, and we
are showing that we don't want to fight any more than necessary."
Presumably, the main intention of this strategy is to ensure that Russia
(and hopefully the United States) can be persuaded to stay neutral.  If
Russia looks like it is certain to stay out for a while, Germany can release
large numbers of troops who would otherwise need to be kept in the east to
keep an eye on Russia (and keep Poland and Courland happy).

I suspect that Germany is most likely to settle for option 1, followed by
option 4, but again I'm open to other views.

&gt; With Russia neutral France is toast to put it bluntly. Just count what ATL

I have some minor quibbles on the numbers - the Slovak half of
Czechoslovakia is part of Hungary, and thus effectively not available for
supplying troops.  Some small parts of OTL Switzerland ended up under French
rule.  But these are only minor.  Certainly, Germany can count on at least
114 million when Venezia is taken into account.  (I doubt that they'd trust
the troops raised in the parts of northern France they recently hold -
Alsace aside).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Germany will be able to start the war with something in the order of 300
&gt; divisions. France will be lucky to have a population around 40 million and
&gt; more probably will have around 35 million. That's about 80-90 divisions...
">

France's position is certainly desperate, although again I'd add some
quibbles on the numbers.  One of my assumptions has been that ATL French
demographics have been not quite the "French demographic paradox" of OTL,
and that *France saw somewhat higher population growth in the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries.  Its population growth rate was still lower than
that of, say, Germany, but ATL France has at least 40 million people,
perhaps somewhat higher including somewhat higher birth rate and also some
immigrants from the parts of OTL France which are part of *Germany.

Aside from that, yes, I agree that France is in severe trouble, to put it
mildly.  Even at the most optimistic demographic projections I've had for
*France's population, they can't field more than 100 divisions.  That is,
well, not good.  They need allies.  ATL Italy has a population of perhaps 35
million, allowing for, say, 80 divisions or so.  ATL Britain (plus Ireland -
separate kingdom, but it will be supplying soldiers) has perhaps 48 million.
Another 120 or so divisions there.  Aragon will supply a few divisions, too,
but I don't have a handy estimate of their population.  South Africa may
supply a few divisions, too.  *Australia has a substantial population, and
could in time send manpower to help, but their first preoccupation will be
with the German colonies in the Far East.  Still, theoretically, this means
enough manpower is available to stop Germany, if the Bouclier nations can
land lots of soliders and prop up France.  But they will really be racing
against the clock.

France does have two points in its favour, though.  Firstly, Germany cannot
trust Russia at all, and they have to keep some troops in reserve in case
Russia does decide to join in the war.  It wouldn't look good if the Germans
were in Paris but the Russians were in Warsaw, or worse yet Berlin.  And
Germany does have to divert some of its manpower to stabilise the situation
in Hungary and Croatia.

Secondly, German has a major, major strategic weakness: oil.  German sources
of oil are negligible - a few minor wells, and whatever they can convert
from coal via the Fischer-Tropsch process, basically.  Ploesti is in Russian
hands.  The Libyan oil reserves have recently been discovered, but not
tapped.  The Dutch East Indies are on the other side of the world.  The
*United States is far and away the biggest supplier of oil in the world at
the time, but Germany very badly needs open sea lanes to ship in oil, or a
Russia which is willing to sell it oil.  If Russia and/or the United States
ever decide to cut off supply, Germany is in deep, deep trouble.  Having the
biggest navy in the world doesn't help if it's so short of fuel oil that it
can't make a decent number of sorties.  Germany does of course have a large
strategic oil reserve - they're not stupid - but still, it's a bad position
to be in.  Of course, France is in a worse position.

Well there is also the Polish army. Call it another 30 million people.
That makes for 60 divisions or so. Add say 20-40 German division to
that, put 30 more to hold back the Italians and say 10-20 divisions to
intervene in Hungary and Croatia, after all there Hungarian and Croat
troups will be fighting also in the German side and you can concentrate
something in the order of 240 divisions for the initial drive to Paris.

You are of course taking risks this way but knocking out France is worth
losing ground on other fronts. Even if the Italians drove all the way to
the Brenner pass with France knocked out all it would have managed would
be wearing down their own forces. By the same token Hungary and
Croatia can also wait.

The only significant risk there is Russia...but if you don't take the
risk and Russia does actually jump in you end with a two front war on
your hands.

No need for that.. Domestically, the propaganda case should be easy. And
internationally, restraint is likely to be interpreted as _weakness_.
So the important thing is _never_ to look like the loosing side. With
supply lines via Suez closed, the situation might be _difficult_ in the
East-Asian theater.

But Germany can't afford to *look* loosing, or the neutrals might get
ideas. And at least for the large colonial interests, especially in the
Netherlands, inaction smells of defeat...  Even if army and navy can't
agree on a strategy, inaction (defence) means that heads of 'defeatistic

As long as Russia isn't fully mobilized, it's not necessary to block
large numbers of troops. The Poles can look for that... And to have
large numbers of conscripts mobilized without actually fighting in the
war would hurt the economy to much. So Russia will most likely not fully
mobilize unless it intents to attack Germany. On all other parties, it
might easily declare war first, and then mobilize.

I agree with Demetrios here, that, should Germany decide for _France
first_ - the odds for success are good. And especially the relative
shortage in oil should be even a stronger incentive for a short war, and
thus for the very big hammer at the start. If France is flat, Russia
entering the war doesn't make much sense anymore. Unfortunately, (for
the TL) this would be rather a short war, because after France falls,
the Bouclier cause is a lost cause....

The force ratio between France and Germany at the start of this war
should be clearly more advantageous to the Germans than ever IOTL. So
everything other than 'in two months - at the latest - in Paris' would
be - _a very big strategic blunder_.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I never thought that the Italians would be able to knock out all of Germany.

To call this "help" might be a vast exaggeration... Croatia has one
natural _enemy_ - that's Italy - and for the Magyar domination within
Hungary, a Russian victory _against_ Germany would be even _worse_ than
defeat... So my guess is that the _martial law_ regimes will be able to
keep things at home at least widely quite, as long as the armies are NOT

&gt; North of the Alps is certainly going to be impossible for Italy to reach in
&gt; any significant way (a few minor raids by irregular forces, at best, and
&gt; probably not even that).  Ideally, Italy would like to reach Vienna, but the
&gt; terrain in the way is really not promising for that endeavour.

&gt;&gt; And of course their will be a pressure in Germany to have at least one
&gt;&gt; obvious victory ASAP. For that, Italy might be the _obvious target_. If it
&gt;&gt; can't be put out as a significant force within two months (more or less),
&gt;&gt; I'd expect heads start rolling in the German war cabinet / general
&gt;&gt; staff....

&gt; I suspect that France is seen as the prime target, according to the German
&gt; general staff.  Paris is oh so tempting for an early victory, and the spine
&gt; of Italy makes for bad terrain to push through.

Pros and contras for the various strategies:

France first: Should be doable [without Russia in the war, France
_should_ be toast]. Biggest drawback: The Navy doesn't have any part of
the action, and the supply lines towards Africa and Asia aren't getting
better by conquering Paris and the Loire valley.

Britain (or - as the Germans would call it _England_) first: Difficult,
highest risk, but highest gain in case of success. Mostly navy action,
so the army might not like it....

Italy first: Doable - crippling Italy should be well possible,
conquering the entire country - without the two largest islands - might
take more time. Bonuses: Joint action of army and navy, absolutely
necessary if Germany wants to play an important role in the Mid-East,
and keep part of Africa. Victory in the Mid-East might allow re-opening
of routes to Asia, hopefully not TO late.

So Italy first might look like an acceptable compromise..

Bonuses for the timeline: If Italy suffers and the Germans have some
success in the eastern med, but subduing Italy takes time.. this is
an ideal option for Russia to choose to jump in on the 'winning' side  -
Turkey, Iran etc are valuable targets.... It allows the North-Americans
to enter the war on the other side [with the US mostly trying to
eliminate German influence in the Americas, while Mullins might send -
- young New Englanders to die in French trenches - this requires that
France holds out long enough - which seems incompatible with strategy 1....

Malus for the TL. If the Turks can do math, and the British position in
the Med looks vulnerable, outright surrender (not yet unconditional)
might obviously be the wise solution for Constantinople, once the
Russians start showing their

Sounds about of the right order.  Which means that France is facing odds of
roughly 2.5 to 1 unless and until Britain can get significant numbers of
troops across the Channel.  (Or, potentially, around Brittany and to ports

Unless Russia views that its long-term benefit is served by having France

Quite.  If Italy is the main target, then they have to hope that France and
Britain can do something quickly to draw the Germans away.  And if Germany
is busy elsewhere, it's very tempting for Italy to try to gain some ground
quickly, so that even if they have to go on the defensive later, they will
still be fighting on German soil for a while.

Nothing in war is a given, of course, but given the immense logistical
difficulties involved in a cross-Channel invasion, even French spoiling

divisions, forcing it (and thus the French Navy) out of the war before they

I doubt Paris can be held with the forces available and the Germans
starting in Dieppe and Amiens. Even with the BEF sent into the field you
still have 150 divisions facing 50 and if the BEF gets into the fight
piecemeal it would be highly problematic.

So what to do if you are France and you have to take on the onslaught?
First put every single frank you can in motorizing your army. The more
tanks, mobile artillery and mechanized infantry you have the better. Any
division of yours that can't move faster than the Germans is a drain. Or
in short you want both a qualitive/firepower edge over the average
German division but as importantly the ability to be able to run away
from it in one piece if you so decide.

Second accept Paris will go down and work with that in mind. Fortify it
and secondarily the Seine, store supplies there in advance and have a
territorial army  garrison plus some regular troops that aren't needed
elsewhere. (basically arm the Paris population that is not drafted into
the mobile army.)

Three expand the territorial army concept to the rest of the country.

What's your goal in all that? The mobile army is to fight a delay action
to behind the Seine. Unless somehow the Seine can be held you keep on
the delay action to a line from Normandy to Orleans and along the Loire
to the Alps, while in the meantime the British are landing and forming
up in Brittany.

In the meantime Paris is to play the same role with 1870 or for that
matter with places like Leningrand and Stalingrand in OTL. Tie down
German troops to besiege it and bleed them in trying to reduce it.
Costly? Certainly. But with 250 divisions charging down your way... The
territorial army in the meantime is obviously intended to play frank
tireur in the areas the Germans overrun.

Then hope that the Germans are bled, delayed enough to hold down the
Orleans-Loire line and wait for the British to come in strength, the
Germans to run out of oil and the Russians to decide you are game after
all.

Should the Orleans-Loire line fall retreat to a Brittany breachhead up
in the north, BEF should be big enough to hold that for a long time and
south to the Massif Central-Bordeux (basicaly call it the area of Vichy
France) and repeat as needed.

Something to consider is the French fortress lines. OTL the French had
been building them since about the 11th century with existing
fortifications being replaced or upgraded. In this time line I can see
the entire French frontier being fortified. Another point is that it
will be difficult for the Germans to use their full forces due to
geographical limitations on approach lines. The frontages are just not
big enough.

Britain had been installing coastal defences since the Romans. There
was a major effort during the Napoleonic Wars and OTL by 1914 every deep
water port on the South Coast plus a the major ones on the East and West
coasts had extensive coastal defences. Of course so did the German and
French ports.

May be.. But without Russia in the war, a straight Bouclier victory
isn't in the cards. And both in France and Italy will the shock about
continued Russian non-belligerence be quite heavy.
So, if it's 'France first' - the Italians might as well sit it out on

broken, and someone in Rome might try to strike a deal with Germany
[reparations, partial demilitarization, but no further territorial
losses, and no large scale destruction of the country, few
casualties...] - seems far better than: huge bloodshed, catastrophic
destruction, occupation of most of the country, etc.,etc.
In that case, Britain might find itself suddenly alone...
And even if the French hold for some time, reaching the foothills of the
Alps will do the Italians no good, if Germany still has the force for a
major counter-offensive. Italy's best (slim) chance would have been
fortifications - but if they move forward, they would have to give up

Yep. Domestically, and within Poland - rally to the flag. The Hungarian

As long as Britain hasn't regained naval supremacy, it can't afford to

stay home.

it's capital turned to rubble in defense. And the Seine isn't that a

possible). If the line doesn't hold, all bet's are off...

Loosing Paris, - or having it turned to rubble - will hurt morale very
big. Western France - from the Seine to Pyrenees - is mostly open
ground. To establish a line that will hold after Paris (and probably the
upper Loire valley - a diversion trough Burgundy might catch ground as
well) have fallen, in the west, seems impossible. So, no Atlantic ports
(except in Brittany - but to break out of a peninsula isn't that

That's what I'd figured.  The Germans are going to find it very difficult to

This sounds like France's best hope, with one additional caveat.  I doubt
that it will be politically possible to put all the fortifications around
the Seine.  The border will have to be fortified as well... but that's not
necessarily a problem.  The Maginot Line served the purpose it was meant to
reasonably well, and a concrete jungle around the border will also help in
buying time.  Provided that the French Army mounts local counter-offensives
in the early stages (see tanks, large numbers of) and has the sense to fall
back when there is a major breach in the line, the time such fortifications
buy could be quite valuable.

South America look the most tempting.  At the very least, they'd rather all
South American nations were placed under similar restrictions to New
England, i.e. the odd military base, restrictions on their armed forces, and
a guarantee that they will not enter into any foreign alliances.

That is the biggest American motivation.  The war looks big enough that they

I had expected France under Napoleon V to start construction of an *Maginot

Absolutely.  Every British port will be well-fortified.  Which is another
difficulty with any early Sea Lion attempt.  I suspect that Germany will
need first of all to gain control of the sea, and then use their battleships
en masse to reduce selected coastal fortifications to rubble.  Only then

Depends on how many German forces are left staring at Paris.  The French
Army is pretty well mechanized.  If Germany is loading all of its divisions
into northern Italy, then France can certainly cause some mischief
elsewhere, especially since a sizable portion of the BEF will be deployed to
France, too.  A push to the Rhine would be awfully tempting for the

They can always fall back to those fortified lines, if need be.  And
something which the early days of a German offensive into France would
surely show is that fortified lines are useful, they can be broken by force
of numbers, if left alone.

A push to the Alps, however, offers several advantages _if most German
troops are busy in France_.  More space to play with during mobile warfare..
and France will be offering lessons in that.  The foothills of the Alps do
not in themselves offer much defensive advantage (a little, but hardly
grand).  If Italy can push far enough into the Alps while German troops are
busy elsewhere, though, they could make it quite difficult to dig them out
again.  The foothills, themselves, would not be enough; Italy would need to
go further in.  Again, this depends on the force concentrations opposing
them.  Also, if Italy can push far enough along the coast, they may actually
make it rather difficult for the German Navy to operate in the Med.

&gt;&gt; though.

&gt; Yep. Domestically, and within Poland - rally to the flag. The Hungarian
&gt; and Croatian public will be split, but the de facto governments have
&gt; chosen their side. Within some Bouclier nations, the wisdom of going to
&gt; war might not be undisputed - but this is more on the line - 'no need to

That's about the best which Germany could offer, but the problem is that all

Those numbers sound about right, although it would depend on how threatening

Well, if we use the 50 division you proposed to send to France down
thread, how would the strengths of the various parties, on various
fronts be..

Germany - overall 250 divisions:
20 divisions are left east to secure the Verein nations, keep the Poles
happy (who could muster another 50 division if need would arrise).
40 division should be enough to hold the border in Italy (20 would do to
keep Trieste and keep the Italians out of the Alps, but for arguments
sake let them use more troops to face the Italians).

Of the remainder, 100 division should be enough to defend against France
(60 divisions + 50 BEF - you listed another 10 Aragonians, although this
seems a bit much as Aragon would have to watch its back - assuming the
relations to Castille aren't that rosy...) 100 to 110 is more or less
parity - so still not enough for a significant Bouclier offensive.

But of course, this means the UK committed suicide. If they send 50
divisions to France, they only left about 20 at home. They are staring
at 70 to 90 German division at the Channel. Forget about OTL's Sea-Lion
comparision, and forget about Port Said. Supply lines across the Channel
are only 2 to 3 percent as long as those to port Said, and the main
supply bases are very close to the staging area. So Germany can afford
to send 70 division across, and *can afford to loose two thirds in the
attempt*, and they still will take London.

Sending more than a token force to the continent is _suicide_ for the
UK, until (if at all) they achieve clear naval and aerial supremacy, or
unless the Germans are forced to abandon Flanders (to US and NE forces?)
- or withdraw most of their forces to the East (because the Russian have

count here, very different military tactics). But aside from the direct
psychological effect, there would be the indirect psychological effect,

because the idea of loosing Paris would be a political taboo, and
preparing for that kind of worst case isn't politically feasible.

&gt;If we assume a rough parity of both naval and aerial forces in the
&gt;region, this of course means that not all of your supplies and
&gt;re-enforcements will make it across [but a significant part still will].
&gt;But as both sides have a staging ground quite close to the target area,
&gt;and this staging ground isn't far from their main industrial centers,
&gt;adjusting deliveries according to need shouldn't be that a big problem...

Here you have the fundamental question of innumerable Sealion debates
- no one disputes that a landing can be made, what is in dispute is
whether it can successfully be made which unless you can transport
sufficient supplies it won't be. Once the landings are made the area
the Royal Navy has to watch is hugely reduced.

I see no reason why in this scenario this factor has changed from OTL.

&gt;Britain needs to ship if they want to have an impact at all on the
&gt;continent. With parity in the Strait of Dover, the likely losses from
&gt;direct shipments to France might look unacceptable, just to send and
&gt;supply a BEF. And if - to minimize losses - shipments mostly go the long
&gt;way - say from Bristol and Liverpool to Nantes and Bordeaux, instead of
&gt;Southampton to Le Havre or Newhaven to Dieppe, this will considerably
&gt;lengthen shipment time - and reduce capacity. [Of course, as long as the
&gt;Germans control Flanders and have naval parity, Britain can't afford to
&gt;send a large force to the continent... - and thus, the obvious target
&gt;for a British invasion of the continent would be Flanders... - this
&gt;would remove the imminent danger of a German invasion in SE-England.
&gt;OTOH, the price might still be to high, as even a successful conquest of
&gt;Antwerp will not knock out Germany.]

How is this different from OTL's 1914-18 and 1939-45 where British
troops on the continent were primarily NOT supplied across the North
Sea? (Both in 1940 and 1944-5)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But for Germany, the options might look quite different...

&gt;They, of course, would need to ship (and invade) if they want to make an
&gt;impact (on land) on the British isles. But if they could gain as much
&gt;ground as the Brits would by taking Antwerp, they should hold London,
&gt;Reading, and probably Oxford...This would not only eliminate much of
&gt;England's industrial capacity and of it's transportation network, but
&gt;would also look as a distinctive psychological blow. So, loosing the
&gt;heart of England might well knock out Britain, and thus, the price might
&gt;not look *to high*.

&gt;But generally, the strategic position of the British Home Island *at the
&gt;start of the Great War* is much worse , than what it ever was IOTL in
&gt;the 19th or 20th century (At least as bad as if Napoleon would have won
&gt;at Trafalgar...).

The latter is an exaggeration but I agree with your first point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;This seems a bit far fetched (ASB in the case of Italy, but more on that
&gt;later). If *Russia* is on the Bouclier side, the French alone might
&gt;achieve enough superiority in the west that they could do well. But the
&gt;distance from the border to Frankfurt is a bit longer than to Paris, and
&gt;the terrain might be more advantageous for large armored assaults in the
&gt;later case than in the former... And France is more centralized than
&gt;Germany, so the loss of Paris would hurt more. A distinctive victory in
&gt;a French 'Blitzkrieg' would require them to reach the Rhine on it's
&gt;length, take the Ruhr area, Frankfurt and to proceed from there at least
&gt;to either Bremen/Hanover or Nuremberg (better both). This seems
&gt;extremely unlikely....
&gt;But without Russia in the war, the French can't reach sufficient
&gt;superiority. The short-term impact of a BEF on the continent should be
&gt;limited for the reasons listed above.

&gt;So France is much more likely to become the *victim* of a Blitzkrieg
&gt;than the *victor*. At least, if Germany would pick *France first* as the
&gt;strategic option...

No question. This is the #1 reason why I strongly suspect that Britain
in TTL would keep the Navy and Air Force strong and let the army pick
up what it could.

&gt;naval supremacy) and establish beach-heads, if the opposition is weak
&gt;enough. And from there, you can supply by sea, and land (if there is a

&gt;successfully did...But to launch a major invasion North across the Alps?

&gt;So, best case, an Italian 'Blitzkrieg' could repeat the initial success
&gt;in the Second Napoleonic Wars. But they wouldn't get across the Alps,
&gt;Vienna, Munich or Zurich are out of reach, and thus they wouldn't knock

&gt;that someone else is knocking out Germany.

&gt;But the strategic situation looks really bad for Italy, if Russia isn't
&gt;on it's side, and keeps much of the German armies busy... Exchanging

TTL's France is considerably more prosperous - the only analogue to the

A good point, although France's colonial empire is reduced compared to OTL.
Still, they have likely raised troops in French West Africa, and less likely
in Algeria.  I suspect that given France's current, ah, critical manpower
shortages, colonial troops would be called home _very_ fast... in fact, I
wouldn't be surprised if some of them were being readied when war was
imminent, even before it was declared.

So, for argument's sake, say that France has half a million colonial troops
available.  Most of those in Algeria would likely stay there; those in
French West Africa could be deployed quickly.  Another half million colonial
soldiers translates to, hmm, something around 25-30 divisions, depending on
their size.  Call it 25.  Factor in 100 regular French divisions, say a
25-division BEF to be deployed in a reasonable period of time, and perhaps 5
Aragonese divisions.  That makes for a total of 150-155 divisions, facing at
least 240 German divisions.  Those are not good odds.  Even if France has
been pouring concrete around every tree and ditch in the northern half of
the country, those are still not good odds.

I still say you should include something about French colonial troops.

Also, if you're going to include a long period of French mobilization
then presumably you're going to have to include larger numbers of
something like the equivalent of the German / Austrian 420 and 305mm
howitzers that were so effective in 1914.

Is there a Foreign Legion in TTL? (Presumably if so it isn't primarily
German in makeup...)

My overall read on this scenario is if France doesn't have Russian or
less likely American aid pretty much from day 1 she's doomed. Your
scenario is basically a 1914 German army on steroids (e.g. a better
geographical / demographic position than any OTL German army
1900-1950) facing a French army with better fortifications which I
would assume to be a wash given the obvious German response would be a
greater emphasis on big howitzers to break them and frankly not a lot
else over what the French had in the OTL interwar period.

This may not be immediately clear, since it's referred to elsewhere in the
section, but the Germans in fact have very few battleworthy aircraft left by
this stage of the battle.  They've been fighting a losing battle against
better land-based fighters (think, in terms of historical analogues,
Blackburn Skuas going up against Hurricane Mark Is).  It's easier for the
British to withdraw when there isn't that much air power to pursue them, and
when the German capital ships have also taken a battering.

&gt; OTL the understanding was very clear that if Britain loses control of

&gt; read of previous installments indicates that in this timeline this
&gt; factor would be if anything increased in importance not lessened.

TTL's Britain is self-sufficient _in food_ - a side-effect of the North
American War, when they learned that lesson the hard way.  They've
encouraged agricultral self-suffiency ever since.  Britain is not, however,
self-sufficient in other natural resources - it still needs open sea lanes
to continue its war effort.

&gt;&gt;If we assume a rough parity of both naval and aerial forces in the
&gt;&gt;region, this of course means that not all of your supplies and

&gt;&gt;But as both sides have a staging ground quite close to the target area,
&gt;&gt;and this staging ground isn't far from their main industrial centers,
&gt;&gt;adjusting deliveries according to need shouldn't be that a big problem...

&gt; Here you have the fundamental question of innumerable Sealion debates
&gt; - no one disputes that a landing can be made, what is in dispute is
&gt; whether it can successfully be made which unless you can transport
&gt; sufficient supplies it won't be. Once the landings are made the area
&gt; the Royal Navy has to watch is hugely reduced.

&gt; I see no reason why in this scenario this factor has changed from OTL.
">

Neither do I.  Britain has the option of doing what was planned in OTL -
withdraw the RAF back to the north if it lost the air battle, then sortie
both the Royal Navy and the whole damn RAF once the invasion fleet has
landed.  Hey, it'll cost them a lot, but sinking every available transport
ship the Germans have will more or less sink their invasion plans for the
next while, too.

&gt; in TTL would keep the Navy and Air Force strong and let the army pick
&gt; up what it could.

Or ramp up defense spending overall.  The Navy and *RAF still get first
dibs, but if there's a bigger defense budget to be spent, then the Army does
better too.  And most importantly, conscription means that it can be

&gt; Italy do? Even if the Italian navy walks on water and decimates the

Depends how far they go.  But unless they can threaten Vienna - which
_would_ see significant German troops deployed to block the threat - the
Germans are unlikely to let up too much of the attack on France.  For
helping Croatia and Hungary, similar things apply - they'd need to advance a
long way first.

&gt;&gt;concerned about a German presence at their borders on land, they might
&gt;&gt;remember that it was the result of a compromise accepted in London that
&gt;&gt;brought them there in the first place...

&gt; Given the move for South African neutrality in OTL's 1939 I would

Definitely.  There is going to be a South African backlash, one way or

&gt;&gt;TTL's France is considerably more prosperous - the only analogue to the
&gt;&gt;Great Depression lasted a year or so, and was a recession - and has been
&gt;&gt;building fortifications for a lot longer.  They've been aware of the
&gt;&gt;overwhelming numbers Germany possesses since at least, oh, 1900.  And one
&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;the side benefits of fortifications is that they go obsolete a lot less
&gt;&gt;quickly than *tanks.  A fort built with 1915 artillery is hardly as nice
&gt;&gt;as
&gt;&gt;one built in 1928, but it is an awful lot better than nothing.

&gt; True - even a Vauban era fort could make a pretty nifty anti-tank

I don't recall, but ATL France certainly has plenty of equivalents.  Some of
them will be more effective than others, but even the weakest of them are
likely to buy time.  And time is what France desperately, desperately wants.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And THAT is the best case scenario for the French. How you get a 50

&gt;&gt;been using conscription and military planning since the end of the North

&gt;&gt;Getting 50 divisions _to France_ in 90 days is another matter, though.

I meant to suggest that it might be difficult, but not impossible.  If the
50 divisions are mobilised in the first place, the question becomes more one
of whether the shipping to get them to France exists in the first place
(i.e. if it's not tied up elsewhere, say in bringing in raw materials to
supply the British war effort).  And if the shipping can be done in the face
of Krijgmarine actions.  Maybe, maybe not, but I wouldn't rule it out
entirely.

&gt;&gt;&gt; About the ONLY way I see that happening is if the war starts after 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; November. Why Germany would do that is also beyond me.

&gt;&gt;Hmm.  The French would need a considerable amount of luck, yes.  But _if_
&gt;&gt;they've been building fortifications for a long while, and _if_ the
&gt;&gt;analogue
&gt;&gt;to the Maginot Line holds for some time and _if_ they have grasped the

&gt;&gt;reasonable amount of time... they may hold out for a few months.  Paris
&gt;&gt;will
&gt;&gt;not be a pretty sight come September, though.  Of course, France's cause
&gt;&gt;would be helped considerably if Russia joined the war sooner rather than
&gt;&gt;later, or if they could get some Italian divisions temporarily deployed to
&gt;&gt;France, or if they could find another ally somewhere, anywhere.  I
&gt;&gt;wouldn't
&gt;&gt;care to bank on the odds of that, though.

&gt; I still say you should include something about French colonial troops.

I will, although how much detail I'll go into about it is still
undetermined.  The next post I'm writing is about the German campaign in
France.  There will be at least some mention of colonial troops, along with
much else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, if you're going to include a long period of French mobilization
&gt; then presumably you're going to have to include larger numbers of
&gt; something like the equivalent of the German / Austrian 420 and 305mm
&gt; howitzers that were so effective in 1914.
">

Definitely.  Germany will have them.  The question becomes one of _how many_
they build given other priorities.  What I need to have a good think about
is Germany's strategic priorities.  Until 1915 or so, Germany was still
thinking of Britain as a reliable ally, and Russia as the big enemy.  Russia
was still seen as a big enemy after that, so how did Germany divide its war
budget between its navy and army, and between things which would be useful
in France versus those which would be useful in Russia.  But the German
General Staff is not composed of fools - they will have tried to find a way
to break through French fortifications.  They may underestimate the scale of
French fortifications, or underestimate the time needed to batter
fortifications into dust, but they won't forget about them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is there a Foreign Legion in TTL? (Presumably if so it isn't primarily

There's two sections to the Foreign Legion, yes.  One in Algeria, the other

though - I'd need to look more into the history of the Foreign Legion before
I could work that one out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My overall read on this scenario is if France doesn't have Russian or

Depending on how long it takes to batter through one line of fortifications
after another (see below) I'd give France about four months maximum until
most of it is occupied.  July-October, depending on how quickly they
mobilise, how much of a fight it takes to capture Paris, and then all that's
left of France is whatever is holding out in the Massif-Central and perhaps
a BEF-supported pocket in Brittany.  And this is assuming that most things
go relatively right for France.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your scenario is basically a 1914 German army on steroids (e.g. a better
&gt; geographical / demographic position than any OTL German army

&gt; would assume to be a wash given the obvious German response would be a
&gt; greater emphasis on big howitzers to break them
">

Hmm.  That Germany could assemble the big howitzers, I've no doubt
whatsoever that they could break through one line of fortifications after
another, _given enough time_.  What I wonder about it is how long it will
take.  What is basically a mid-1930s Maginot Line is quite a different
prospect to what the Germans faced in 1914 in OTL.  Simply using reinforced
concrete will make a big difference, as Verdun showed in 1916 in OTL - it
withstood bombardment much better than 1914-era or earlier fortifications
which the Big Berthas smashed so effectively in OTL.

More broadly, big howitzers are more vulnerable to air attack than what they
faced in OTL.  Or to flanking armoured counter-attacks.  Or to
counter-battery fire - the Big Berthas had a max range of about 12km in OTL,
and French artillery of 1930s vintage had a longer range than that.  Big
guns were also damnably slow to move, set up and use.  Getting them from one
place to another would be a pain, since they needed rail transport.  If
France has infiltrators sabotaging the rail lines (see territorial army, use
of), well, things get fun.  Or if France simply destroys the rail lines as
they withdraw, then there's the time needed to lay new rail lines to move
the heavy guns.

In other words, how long is it likely to take Germany to reduce fort after
fort to rubble?  Quite a while, I suspect, although it makes a big
difference if it's one month or four months.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and frankly not a lot
&gt; else over what the French had in the OTL interwar period.

And more British aid earlier, and Italy in the fight on their side, and a
Germany which is even shorter of oil.  None of these are war-winning
advantages, of course.  But what I am trying to figure out is how long
France could plausibly hold out.

Durned tootin' - there was great consternation about the possibility

But your German army of 1929 is primarily an infantry force and not
even motorized infantry (e.g. like the British and American armies of
1941-45) at that. This would tend to dramatically reduce the amount of
oil required. The trains run on coal (mostly) which I've not heard any
suggestion that *Germany is in any way short of.

In your scenario the greatest limitation on the 1929 German army would
be logistical particularly in the area of munitions supply. This would
require moving a LOT of materiel to the front quickly.

Verdun proved that big howitzers were overrated. Even the smaller forts
managed considerable resistance.

By the way the OTL French forts were updated at regular intervals. The
only chance of a Vauban fort surviving as built would be if it became
strategically obsolete. On the other hand Vauban also built defences for
major towns and cities some of which may survive. I have no details

&gt;&gt; Depends on how many German forces are left staring at Paris.  The French
&gt;&gt; Army is pretty well mechanized.  If Germany is loading all of its
&gt;&gt; divisions into northern Italy, then France can certainly cause some
&gt;&gt; mischief elsewhere, especially since a sizable portion of the BEF will be
&gt;&gt; deployed to France, too.  A push to the Rhine would be awfully tempting
&gt;&gt; for the Franco-British _if_ German troops are undermanned.

&gt; Whatever means undermanned.. (certainly not in the same way as in
&gt; September of 1939 OTL, when the French could easily resist the

Although it turns out that they would most likely have done extremely well
for themselves if they _had_ given in to the temptation.

Probably too many German troops to mount a major offensive - they do have

&gt;&gt; This is assuming that Germany _offers_ reasonable terms.  That may be

That terms would be more reasonable earlier than later, I'd agree.  But that
runs into the problem that countries often have a certain sense of optimism
for their chances (the remaining Bouclier countries do, after all, have
greater total manpower than Germany et al, if barely) and that even a short
time into a war, a nation's idea of "reasonable" demands can become quite
high very quickly.  Cf. German war demands in WW1 even early in the war -
they weren't exactly soft proposals.  They got even more outrageous later,
but even early in the war Germany wanted a lot.  *Germany isn't quite the
same nation - less overtly expansionistic, for one thing - but I don't see
them letting any of their Great Power neighbours off lightly.

&gt; Yes, the best Britain could achieve (in perfidious self-interest) would be
&gt; selling it's allies down the river. Keep the home army at home, build up

&gt; pro-British-Chinese Warlords and the Indian Army (plus those in
&gt; Africa...), and hopefully, hold Egypt. But without a major non-Bouclier
&gt; power in the war, don't waste a penny on helping France, Italy, or Turkey.

Hmm.  Turkey is a British area of interest, albeit one they may choose to
sacrifice in the short-term.  But the problem with letting their allies fall
is what would happen if Germany says, in effect, "sod you, we're going for
broke", i.e. knocking France out of the war, spurning British peace terms
then bringing the full Krijgmarine into the North Sea with orders for
Seelöwe uber alles.  The potential advantage for Britain in propping up
France and Italy for as long as possible is that a more bloodied Germany may
lack the capacity to mount an effective invasion across the Channel.  (The
potential disadvantage, of course, is that Germany by this point may want to
demand even more).

Russia would certainly be of more use, in a lot of ways.  But the biggest
advantage from the British point of view would be the American navy, and
perhaps their air force.  Combined, the US and Royal Navies _are_ bigger

numbers of American troops fighting the Germans on land.

&gt;&gt;&gt; fortifications - but if they move forward, they would have to give up
&gt;&gt;&gt; their fortified lines.

&gt;&gt; They can always fall back to those fortified lines, if need be.

&gt; Only if the retreat would be very orderly - which seems a bit unlikely, as
&gt; Italy would have to give up territories it claims and conquered. So it
&gt; seems more likely that they would fall back as part of a chaotic retreat,

An orderly withdrawal does assume that Italy has been explicit in its

True, but the Allies got most of the way up Italy in WW2, and they were only
committing a fraction of their manpower.  (Admittedly, so was Germany).  It
depends how much airpower, tanks and artillery have changed the state of the
game since WW1-level technology.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Again, this depends on the force concentrations opposing

&gt; Yes, raw guess - one division of defenders will keep ten division of

&gt; and the Germans cut down defense of the Alps to 25 division, Italy has a
&gt; fair chance to pass the Alps, else, not ;).

Depends, again, on how much of a force multiplier tanks and aircraft are.
Tanks are certainly _less_ use in alpine warfare than in open country, but
tanks were used to good effect in the Allied push up Italy during WW2.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Depends over what timeframe, and most importantly how successful France

&gt; Well, if we use the 50 division you proposed to send to France down
&gt; thread, how would the strengths of the various parties, on various fronts
&gt; be..

&gt; Germany - overall 250 divisions:
&gt; 20 divisions are left east to secure the Verein nations, keep the Poles
&gt; happy (who could muster another 50 division if need would arrise).
&gt; 40 division should be enough to hold the border in Italy (20 would do to
&gt; keep Trieste and keep the Italians out of the Alps, but for arguments sake
&gt; let them use more troops to face the Italians).

&gt; Of the remainder, 100 division should be enough to defend against France
&gt; (60 divisions + 50 BEF - you listed another 10 Aragonians, although this
&gt; seems a bit much as Aragon would have to watch its back - assuming the
&gt; relations to Castille aren't that rosy...) 100 to 110 is more or less
&gt; parity - so still not enough for a significant Bouclier offensive.

&gt; But of course, this means the UK committed suicide. If they send 50
&gt; divisions to France, they only left about 20 at home.
">

Britain + Ireland have enough of a population to raise closer to 100
divisions than 70, so probably 40 divisions, rather than 20.  Given the
value of coastal defences, the value of a few armoured divisions, and a
significant *RAF, that should be enough.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They are staring at 70 to 90 German division at the Channel.

And unless the Germans can ship those divisions across the Channel, they'll
keep staring, too.  The requirements the Kriegsmarine set for a successful
cross-Channel invasion in 1940 haven't changed ATL:

1. The Royal Navy must be eliminated or unable to intervene.
2. Royal Air Force air strength must be eliminated.
3. Coastal defences must be destroyed.
4. British submarine action against landing forces must be prevented.

1 is possible, given the larger Krijgmarine.  2 is damnably difficult.  3
takes a lot of time and naval firepower, and is even then unlikely.  4 is
also close to impossible.

Definitely.  French ATL strategy was based on the assumption that they would
be fighting alongside Russia.  Thus lots of fortifications made sense - the
idea was to make sure that France could not be over-run _quickly_, to give
Russia a chance to make its weight felt in the east even if Germany opted
for the "drinking coffee in Berlin by the end of summer" option for its
troops.  An early assault was thus not really considered.  Given that Russia
has dropped out, France is even less likely to make major assaults, unless
Germany _really_ strips the border of troops... and they're unlikely to do
that.

Caucasian oil is discovered (Baku, anyway), and forms part of the Russian

Not when the prohibitively expensive part comes from the cost of industry
relocation, not the fortification construction.  (If I'm reading Ken's
comments correctly, that is).

On a broader issue of the cost of the fortifications, as Good Habit pointed
out, the effective area needed to be defended may be larger than OTL.  No
need for an Alpine Line with Italy, but some fortifications against German
Switzerland (probably not that many needed for the mountainous areas, but
everything costs), and all the way to the Channel along a longer border.
France is not suffering from the effects of the Depression, so such
fortifications would still be affordable, I think.  Especially since the
earlier ones would go back until the 1910s... they would need some upgrades,
but that's cheaper than building from scratch.

&gt;&gt;Hmm.  That Germany could assemble the big howitzers, I've no doubt
&gt;&gt;whatsoever that they could break through one line of fortifications after
&gt;&gt;another, _given enough time_.  What I wonder about it is how long it will
&gt;&gt;take.  What is basically a mid-1930s Maginot Line is quite a different
&gt;&gt;prospect to what the Germans faced in 1914 in OTL.  Simply using
&gt;&gt;reinforced
&gt;&gt;concrete will make a big difference, as Verdun showed in 1916 in OTL - it
&gt;&gt;withstood bombardment much better than 1914-era or earlier fortifications
&gt;&gt;which the Big Berthas smashed so effectively in OTL.

&gt; Nevertheless similar siege-type weapons were used quite effectively
&gt; against Sevastopol in 1941-42. As you know Sevastopol was heavily
&gt; fortified.

The super-heavy guns such as Dora weren't all that useful during the
bombardment, though.  And even then, Sevastapol held out for nine months.

France, not whether they can.

&gt;&gt;More broadly, big howitzers are more vulnerable to air attack than what
&gt;&gt;they
&gt;&gt;faced in OTL.  Or to flanking armoured counter-attacks.  Or to
&gt;&gt;counter-battery fire - the Big Berthas had a max range of about 12km in
&gt;&gt;OTL,
&gt;&gt;and French artillery of 1930s vintage had a longer range than that.  Big
&gt;&gt;guns were also damnably slow to move, set up and use.  Getting them from
&gt;&gt;one
&gt;&gt;place to another would be a pain, since they needed rail transport.  If
&gt;&gt;France has infiltrators sabotaging the rail lines (see territorial army,
&gt;&gt;use
&gt;&gt;of), well, things get fun.  Or if France simply destroys the rail lines as
&gt;&gt;they withdraw, then there's the time needed to lay new rail lines to move
&gt;&gt;the heavy guns.

&gt;&gt;In other words, how long is it likely to take Germany to reduce fort after
&gt;&gt;fort to rubble?  Quite a while, I suspect, although it makes a big
&gt;&gt;difference if it's one month or four months.

&gt; I guess I'm more pessimistic than you are.

Well, the more I look at the super-heavy artillery the Germans developed in
response to the OTL Maginot Line (i.e. Dora), the more I think that they
would be difficult to use effectively.  Dora required purpose-built rail
lines in most cases, was extremely cumbersome to move - it took most of a
month to set up against Sevastapol - and tended to wear out the gun barrels
relatively quickly.  In other words, while heavy artillery can certainly
smash big fortifications given time, it can't do it quickly.  Especially
since much of the more effective fortifications on the Maginot Line of OTL
were smaller ones and present in large numbers.  Super-heavy artillery
doesn't help that much here, since there's too many targets.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You seem to be rolling a lot of French sixes to me.
">

More rolling a few German ones, I think.  (Semi-serious point: Germany to
date ITTL has had a considerable amount of good luck.  Some bad luck seems
fair enough).

What I've basically worked on is the principle that French strategy ITTL is
going to be inexorably fixed into defensive purposes.  The simple difference
in manpower requires that.  They don't plan on over-running Germany in a
hurry.  So the French response has basically been a bigger version of the
Maginot Line - which I think that they could afford, along with some
mechanisation of their army.  (Not all of it, by any means, although they'd
like to).  Everything France has planned for has been with the intention of
_slowing down_ the German advance.  Fortifications, armour reserved for the
purpose of local counter-attacks rather than major drives into enemy
territory, infiltrators/guerrillas deliberately ordered to wait behind the
enemy line of advance and then go to work as saboteurs on key rail lines,
and so on.  This is, I think, a realistic French strategy given the
circumstances.

The question comes from how Germany will try to over-run such a French
strategy.  I think that their answer will be artillery, *tanks (for local
fire support, not massed for major raids), more artillery, some bombers, and
more artillery.  I've no doubt that they can develop those things.  But I'm
not sure if they'll realise all of the problems with the ultra-heavy
artillery which happened in OTL.  If they have some bad luck, it will be in
the form of underestimating the number of shells needed (they'll manufacture
a lot, but never enough, as per OTL's WW1), the length of time it would take
to reduce reinforced concrete fortifications (as per Verdun and Sevastapol
in OTL), and the degree of wear on the heavy artillery (barrels needing to
be rebored, etc).

In other words, I don't doubt the result of an *German invasion of France
(barring outside intervention, of course), but I do think that it's
realistic that France would put up a lengthy fight.  More so than in OTL in
either world war, incidentally.  I always got the impression that for
Germany to get as far as it did in WW1 required a large dose of luck
(largely by France cooperating so helpfully in attacking into Alsace) and
also in WW2 (mostly catching the French army in the middle of a
modernization, plus breaking through the Ardennes).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; else over what the French had in the OTL interwar period.

&gt;&gt;And more British aid earlier, and Italy in the fight on their side, and a
&gt;&gt;Germany which is even shorter of oil.  None of these are war-winning
&gt;&gt;advantages, of course.  But what I am trying to figure out is how long
&gt;&gt;France could plausibly hold out.

&gt; But your German army of 1929 is primarily an infantry force and not
&gt; even motorized infantry (e.g. like the British and American armies of
&gt; 1941-45) at that. This would tend to dramatically reduce the amount of
&gt; oil required. The trains run on coal (mostly) which I've not heard any
&gt; suggestion that *Germany is in any way short of.
">

Germany could move plenty of infantry up to the front if they run out of
oil, certainly.  But they couldn't supply lots of tanks - needed for local
fire support in a big way.  Nor could they fly plenty of planes - and
handing the enemy the control of the air was a very bad thing, as
demonstrated throughout WW2.  Nor could they use their navy effectively,
which frees up the Bouclier navies to cause all sorts of mischief.  The
effectiveness of a mostly pure infantry + artillery army against a fortified
opponent which had working tanks and sufficient fighters and bombers is
something I'm not so convinced about.

They could have afforded the fortifications, it was the industry bit
that was prohibitive. 2 was seriously considered to the point a survey
was made to establish where the line could run and minimise the
unprotected area. However it was around then that a mobile defence was
adopted with the hope that fighting could be confined to Belgium. I

from about then.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Demetrios Rammos's post upthread gives what looks quite a credible
&gt;&gt;&gt; position of the lines which France would fall back to, one by one.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt; Seine would be one of a series,

&gt;&gt; I'd think the Seine would be the last, mostly.

&gt;Last bar one, I'd think.  The Orleans-Loire line which Demetrios Rammos
&gt;mentioned is probably the last.  The rationale for this is as follows:
&gt;French strategy was based on fortifications for delaying actions in case
&gt;Germany was trying a &quot;France first&quot; strategy.  France was of course assuming
&gt;that Russia would be busy in the east smashing into Germany _if the German
&gt;troops were mostly in the west_.  So the fortifications are there to let
&gt;France hold out for long enough for Russia to make its weight felt.  Thus
&gt;there would be some fall-back positions behind Paris, in case the city fell
&gt;even as Russia was pushing into the east.  The assumption would be for a
&gt;temporary loss of Paris not being the end of the war.  Of course, this
&gt;strategic plan was shattered when Russia stayed neutral, but the
&gt;fortifications would still be there.
">

The catch of course is that one has to retain enough of the homeland
to keep enough of an economy going to fight a war over the medium to
long term. I don't think that's doable from the Orleans-Loire line.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And mainly for psychological reasons. Loosing Paris would hurt French
&gt;&gt; moral very big, would cut Frances transportation network, and well -
&gt;&gt; continuing to fight afterwards was never done in more recent history OTL
&gt;&gt; (the HYW doesn't count here, very different military tactics). But aside
&gt;&gt; from the direct psychological effect, there would be the indirect
&gt;&gt; psychological effect, meaning - there aren't that many fortified positions
&gt;&gt; _west of Paris_ - because the idea of loosing Paris would be a political
&gt;&gt; taboo, and preparing for that kind of worst case isn't politically
&gt;&gt; feasible.

&gt;I'd agree about the psychological reasons being severe, although not
&gt;insurmountable.  The likelihood of France staying in the fight of course
&gt;goes up considerably if they have some reason to believe that Russia is
&gt;going to join the war soon.

Yes but look at the French rail network and what it looks like without

&gt;So, time to start developing things around 1920-1929.  Much depends on when
&gt;the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is developed, of course.  Sometime in the OTL
&gt;1920s, if memory serves, but I don't have the exact date handy.  That's a
&gt;short time to build up production... maximum of 9 years from when the

&gt;&gt; This will indeed matter, but that much more than the massive central,

France lasted 4 years in WW1; I've never read any history that

Let's just confirm that we both mean "6 = extraordinarily good luck"
since I know several wargames (from which the term comes) where the
reverse is true.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What I've basically worked on is the principle that French strategy ITTL is
&gt;going to be inexorably fixed into defensive purposes.  The simple difference
&gt;in manpower requires that.  They don't plan on over-running Germany in a
&gt;hurry.  So the French response has basically been a bigger version of the
&gt;Maginot Line - which I think that they could afford, along with some
&gt;mechanisation of their army.  (Not all of it, by any means, although they'd
&gt;like to).  Everything France has planned for has been with the intention of
&gt;_slowing down_ the German advance.  Fortifications, armour reserved for the
&gt;purpose of local counter-attacks rather than major drives into enemy
&gt;territory, infiltrators/guerrillas deliberately ordered to wait behind the
&gt;enemy line of advance and then go to work as saboteurs on key rail lines,
&gt;and so on.  This is, I think, a realistic French strategy given the
&gt;circumstances.
">

Probably true. The major difference between the French in your
scenario and OTL 1940 is in fact doctrinal at least as much as any
specific weapon system.

There's certainly no question the 1940 OTL French could have done
better both tactically and strategically than how they actually did.
(One could reasonably argue that they could hardly have done much
worse!) Actually in the defensive role, 1943-45 would seem to
demonstrate that tank destroyers do better in prepared positions than
tanks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The question comes from how Germany will try to over-run such a French
&gt;strategy.  I think that their answer will be artillery, *tanks (for local
&gt;fire support, not massed for major raids), more artillery, some bombers, and
&gt;more artillery.  I've no doubt that they can develop those things.  But I'm
&gt;not sure if they'll realise all of the problems with the ultra-heavy
&gt;artillery which happened in OTL.  If they have some bad luck, it will be in
&gt;the form of underestimating the number of shells needed (they'll manufacture
&gt;a lot, but never enough, as per OTL's WW1), the length of time it would take
&gt;to reduce reinforced concrete fortifications (as per Verdun and Sevastapol
&gt;in OTL), and the degree of wear on the heavy artillery (barrels needing to
&gt;be rebored, etc).

&gt;In other words, I don't doubt the result of an *German invasion of France
&gt;(barring outside intervention, of course), but I do think that it's
&gt;realistic that France would put up a lengthy fight.  More so than in OTL in
&gt;either world war, incidentally.  I always got the impression that for
&gt;Germany to get as far as it did in WW1 required a large dose of luck
&gt;(largely by France cooperating so helpfully in attacking into Alsace) and
&gt;also in WW2 (mostly catching the French army in the middle of a
&gt;modernization, plus breaking through the Ardennes).
">

I'd argue the French problem in 1940 was as much due to their rapid
advance into Belgium nearly as much as the failure to understand that
the Ardennes were just not that much of an obstacle as had been
thought. I'd further argue that the Americans (and to a lesser extent
the British) were culpable in making exactly the same mistake in
December 1944.

As for 'how many shells is enough?' it's almost a rhetorical question.
In both OTL world wars there were VERY few cases of armies that were
not encircled suffering from shortage of ammunition. I can think of a
couple of cases in 1916/17 on the western front but that's about it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Germany could move plenty of infantry up to the front if they run out of
&gt;oil, certainly.  But they couldn't supply lots of tanks - needed for local
&gt;fire support in a big way.  Nor could they fly plenty of planes - and
&gt;handing the enemy the control of the air was a very bad thing, as
&gt;demonstrated throughout WW2.  Nor could they use their navy effectively,
&gt;which frees up the Bouclier navies to cause all sorts of mischief.  The
&gt;effectiveness of a mostly pure infantry + artillery army against a fortified
&gt;opponent which had working tanks and sufficient fighters and bombers is
&gt;something I'm not so convinced about.

The German army in 1939-45 was horse-drawn to what would be a
surprising degree. I haven't seen anything in your scenario that says
your *1929 German army would be more mechanized than in OTL.

I'll see what I can track down.  For ease of reference, the borders of ATL
France and Germany differ in a few ways.  The OTL French departments of Nord
and Pas de Calais are part of Germany.  So is Alsace and that part of
Lorraine east of the Meuse.  So is virtually all of Switzerland, except for
the canton of Geneva which is an independent state.
