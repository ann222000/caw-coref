CIA criticizes former chief over terror readiness

By David Stout and Mark Mazzetti

Tuesday, August 21, 2007
The Internationl Herald-Tribune

WASHINGTON: George Tenet, the former head of the Central Intelligence
Agency, recognized the danger posed by Al Qaeda well before the attacks of
Sept. 11, 2001, but failed to adequately prepare the CIA to meet the threat,
according to an internal agency report that was released in summary form
Tuesday.

Tenet was sometimes too occupied with tactics instead of strategy, and he
was lax in promoting an information-sharing environment within the CIA, the
agency's inspector general's office says in the report.

An inspector general's team that reviewed the agency's performance found
that CIA officers &quot;from the top down&quot; worked hard against Al Qaeda and its
leader, Osama bin Laden, before the 9/11 attacks.

&quot;They did not always work effectively and cooperatively, however,&quot; the team
concluded, in what amounted in part to sharp criticism of Tenet's management
skills and style.

&quot;The team found neither 'a single point of failure' nor a 'silver bullet'
that would have enabled the intelligence community to predict or prevent the
9/11 attacks,&quot; the inspector general's office said. &quot;The team did find,
however, failures to implement and manage important processes, to follow
through with operations, and to properly share and analyze critical data.&quot;

&quot;The agency and its officers did not discharge their responsibilities in a
satisfactory manner,&quot; according to the report, which was completed in June
2005 but kept classified until now.

No CIA employee violated the law, nor did any of their errors amount to
misconduct, according to the review team led by Inspector General John
Helgerson.

Tenet, who resigned from the CIA in 2004 and was succeeded by Porter Goss,
has defended his and his agency's actions, and he did so again Tuesday. The
CIA's anti-terrorism efforts were embodied in &quot;a robust plan, marked by
extraordinary effort and dedication,&quot; long before Sept. 11, 2001, he said in
a statement.

&quot;Without such an effort, we would not have been able to give the president a
plan on Sept. 15, 2001, that led to the routing of the Taliban, chasing Al
Qaeda from its Afghan sanctuary and combating terrorists across 92
countries,&quot; Tenet said.

The current head of the CIA, General Michael Hayden, issued a statement
making clear that he did not favor publication of the inspector general's
report because he thought it would &quot;consume time and attention revisiting
ground that is already well plowed.&quot;

The report was released as part of an arrangement with Congress, which
recently endorsed the recommendations of the independent, bipartisan
commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks.

It concluded that Tenet &quot;did not use all of his authorities&quot; in leading a
strategic effort against Osama bin Laden, and that &quot;the management approach&quot;
within the CIA's counterterrorism center &quot;had the effect of actively
reinforcing the separation of responsibilities&quot; among the agency's
divisions.

Its not rubbish. The various people and groups who might have
been able to prevent 9/11, as later attacks have been prevented, were
PREVENTED from doing so because of regulations prohibiting
data sharing, put in place during the Clinton administration. Tenet
was a holdover, of course. Bush had had neither the time nor
inclination to remedy this, indeed, while it was obviously
a serious mistake to not have agencies share information,
the immediate danger was not obvious because of the lack
on information sharing, thus leading to no urgency in
correcting the problem. Its thus a circular chain
of blundering stupidities which ultimately issued
from Bush's predecessors. Today at least we are not
acting like the proverbial ostrich. We can't be perfect, but
at least we do worry about being imperfect, as Clinton
most emphatically and disastrously for 3000 people did not.

This part by Doug McDonald [vide infra] is correct -- but Tenet IS being
singled-out and scapegoated, as Surreyman suggests.

Mind you, Tenet WAS the DCI in an Era that HAD NO Director of National
Intelligence -- WITH STAFF -- because no one in power wanted one.

It was not only the Chinese Wall between the CIA and FBI that was the
problem -- a leftover from Watergate overreaction.

The other two major causes were:

The Multiculturalism Craze -- which made it Grossly Politically Incorrect to
spy on distinct ethnic, racial or religious groups such as Arabs or Muslims.

The Race, Gender, Sexual Orientation, Disabled and Multicultural Craze which
penalized managers for not showing they were meeting or exceeding hiring and
promotion quotas for these &quot;Protected Groups&quot;.

Savvy CIA, DIA, FBI, INR, NSA and Service Intelligence, Law Enforcement and
Cryptologic Managers were spending FAR more time on Personnel Matters and
far LESS time on looking out for the National Security interests of the
United States and the protection of the American People.

Priorities, Recruitment, Promotions and Funding Were All Skewed.

TODAY the Climate of Opinion has changed radically and Tenet is being blamed
for having lived, worked and competed in the OLD Climate of Opinion that
prevailed BEFORE 9/11.

The &quot;regulations&quot; that you mention are also known as &quot;rights&quot; of US
citizens. Then, too, there were the aerial exercises being conducted
that day in the vicinity by our own military....we will probably never
know the entire chain of events. All we have are questions and our
great-grandchildren will probably have the same questions. This is an
issue beyond left versus right.

&gt; The Race, Gender, Sexual Orientation, Disabled and Multicultural Craze which

&gt; Savvy CIA, DIA, FBI, INR, NSA and Service Intelligence, Law Enforcement and

&gt; far LESS time on looking out for the National Security interests of the
&gt; United States and the protection of the American People.

&gt; Priorities, Recruitment, Promotions and Funding Were All Skewed.

&gt; TODAY the Climate of Opinion has changed radically and Tenet is being blamed

Bollocks.

Since when the activities of the CIA, who it is spying on and what
cultural groups those people belong to, are open to public scrutiny,
so that Tenet would fear taking steps that were politically
incorrect?

Bad excuse for what pure and simple incompetence.   Company men, which
Tenet was, are yes men, not fountains of creativity and initiative and
risk taking.

All this concentrates on intelligence failures regarding the 911
attacks.

It ignores common sense security.

First, the only viable large casualty method open to terrorists at
that time was a large airplane &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack of the the type they
did. It could have been foreseen, thwarted or precluded merely by
fortified cockpit doors and an in-plane camera system for monitoring
activity in the passenger compartment. It was systematic stupidity
from the airlines, the government, insurers and re-insurers that none
of that was done years before.

So much for the concept of free market efficiency.

Second, an FBI operative actually did his job and tried to raise an
alarm about suspicious people taking airliner flight training. The
fact that this was stopped from being acted upon within the FBI says
all that needs to be said about US government beaurcracy and the
people who attain managment positions within it.

The only way Bush would have changed the US intelligence services,
would have been if he saw some way to politicize them to his
advantage.

You forget the prime motivator: low fares.

Remember that next time your flight departs hours late or it is
canceled.

Even if it had been foreseen, it doesn't mean that the measures you
mentioned would have been put into effect.

The public is ruthless and demands low fares.   Anything that will
make low fares hard will be resisted.   Airlines are already juggling
priorities to maintain competitive fares in the face of severe
challenges, like stricter security, and a crumbingly old air traffic
control system wholly inadequate for today's traffic.

It will take billions and decades to update.  They tried once already
in the 90s and they failed, when only a small part of the system was
updated after grievous losses and a ten-year effort.

Something has to give and at the moment that is efficiency.   To think
that without a CLEAR and PRESENT threat, and only on mere probability,
the government or the airlines would fortify all their aircraft cabins
is naive.

George Tenet worked as a  busboy in his family's diner in Queens, New York
(later renamed the Scobee Diner).

He was an obsequious toady from a very early age -- but a street-smart,
conniving and clever one.

Tenet was also eminently politically correct as a multi-ethnic [Greek,
Albanian], had the requisite Congressional &quot;oversight&quot; experience and
connections to be a good toady to Congress critters and was pock-marked --
so he had &quot;overcome a physical disability&quot;.

He had ALL the right qualifications -- EXCEPT the extensive field
intelligence experience to make him a competent DCI.

George Tenet had zip point zero military or intelligence field collection or
even analytical experience.

Then people wonder why we didn't prevent the 9/11 Attack.

Naïveté Writ Large.

A Common Human Trait among The Poguenoscenti.

But the blame cannot ALL be put on Tenet.

So because Bush wanted to undo everything that Clinton did it was
necessary to ignore any warnings that appeared during that nine-month
period? We have seen in the subsequent 6 years that Bush could get
elected but he had no clue as to governing. Better to load up
important cabinet departments with loyal bushies with no concept of
who they were working for, after all they took an oath to Bush not the
Constitution. Several good strong warnings told the management things
were going to happen, an  unnamed CIA briefer  flew to Bush's Texas
ranch during the scary summer of 2001, amid a flurry of reports of a
pending al-Qaeda attack,  called the president's attention personally
to the now-famous Aug. 6, 2001, memo titled &quot;Bin Ladin Determined to
Strike in US.&quot; Bush reportedly heard the briefer out and replied: &quot;All
right. You've covered your ass, now.&quot;

So he knew about al-Qaeda. He knew that al-Qaeda was determined to
attack. The CIA even flew to dubya's vacation ranch in Crawford, Texas
to personally call his attention to the PDB.

And yet he did nothing about it.

A not-so-gentle reminder of the great and glorious leader.

Yep...

Naïve people simply don't understand how difficult it is to change the
course of the American Federal Government.

Change -- in the absence of a triggering catastrophic event such as the
Pearl Harbor or 9/11 attacks or Watergate -- proceeds at a funereal pace --
and no President can change that fundamental fact of Washington.

The Founding Fathers WANTED the American Government to be checked and
balanced to equilibrium on many issues -- NOT constantly innovative and
simulative.

It's written by Mr. Madison into the Constitution.

Further, they never envisioned the United States as Top Nation -- the only
Great Power left in a Multi-Cultural World with over 200 so-called Sovereign
Nations.

Nor can they be expected to have foreseen it.

No matter how many times you state this, the FACT is that
the warning, weak though it was, came too late for
action. All this was a CLINTON LEGACY.

There is nothing you can do about that: Clinton did not take
security as important. Yes, it happened on Bush's watch ...
but the PREPARATION and most of the intelligence came during
Clinton's AND HE DID NOTHING. Also, one points out, CLINTON
HAD SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO KILL bin LADEN AND DID NOT ACT.
This despite that it was clear that al Qaeda was involved
with previous murderous attempts around the world.

The BOTTOM LINE is that Bush has been doing as good a job as
can be done with people like you and many Democrats attacking
EVERYTHING he does in the war on terror, no matter WHAT IT IS.
Note that the Democrats are currently busily scurrying to
figure out new ways of attacking him now that it is apparent
that the &quot;surge&quot; is working, and that, ABSENT HELP FROM
PEOPLE LIKE YOU, the terrorists WILL eventually lose,
just as the IRA eventually lost. It probably will take
as long.

The Clinton Administrations -- led by Bill and Hill, plus Gore -- saw all
sorts of OPPORTUNITIES -- but neglected THREATS.

After all, they were basking in the glow of a successful WIN for the Free
World in The Cold War -- so, as in the 1920's -- America had a Long Weekend
Party.

Once Again they were working in a completely different CLIMATE OF OPINION --
Pre 9/11.

The Clinton Agenda was also almost completely DOMESTIC -- NOT oriented
towards NATIONAL SECURITY.

The Clintons are Accomplished Policy-Wonks on DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.

Hillary, because she is damned smart, has been tooling herself up on
National Security Issues ---- trying to build experience and credibility
during her Presidential run -- in order to be seen as a qualified
Commander-in-Chief.

That's why she has taken on Barack Obama -- and pointed out he is &quot;naïve and
irresponsible&quot; on said issues -- including talking about nuclear weapons.

&gt; The point that a lot of people forget is that intelligence agencies do not
&gt; exist in a vacuum.

&gt; They have people who can best be described as 'customers'.

&gt; These customers 'pay' for the information they receive.

&gt; If the intelligence agencies didn't actually produce something beyond what
&gt; you can read in the columns of your daily newspaper then nobody would pay
&gt; them.

&gt; For the about fifty years before World War I the British had no
&gt; crypyanalytical capacity because they considered they didn't need any, and
&gt; shut the agency that did it.  They had to start from scratch in 1914 with
&gt; a naval educator who solved ciphers for fun.

&gt; Between WWI and WWII the GCCS (the British code breaking department)

Yep...

Naïve people simply don't understand how difficult it is to change the
course of the American Federal Government.

Change -- in the absence of a triggering catastrophic event such as The
Great Depression, Pearl Harbor and 9/11 attacks or Watergate -- proceeds at
a funereal pace -- and no President can change that fundamental fact of
Washington.

The Founding Fathers WANTED the American Government to be checked and
balanced to equilibrium on many issues -- NOT constantly innovative and
stimulative.

It's written by Mr. Madison into the Constitution.

Further, they never envisioned the United States as Top Nation -- the only
Great Power left in a Multi-Cultural World with over 200 so-called Sovereign
Nations....

Nor can they be expected to have foreseen it.

&gt; administration the FBI and the CIA were CONSTRAINED by Clinton's
&gt; directives to do the wrong thing and not communicate. They had no
&gt; legal choice. True, Bush COULD have acted faster than he did
&gt; to correct the situation ... but the situation itself
&gt; led to a false complacency. This was a leftover from Clinton.
&gt; Remember that Tenet was a Clinton holdover, as were many
&gt; other mid-level functionaries.

&gt; It would take have taken time to fix the problems, even had
&gt; they started out on the front burner on inauguration day. It takes
&gt; time to get rid of all the baggage from the old regime.

&gt; Note that the Bush administration has been very good at
&gt; correcting these problems, post 9/11, despite attacks from people like you
&gt; trying to stop them from doing the right thing.

&gt; The key points are that we must discriminate on the basis
&gt; of likelihood of being a terrorist, spy on possible
&gt; terrorists, monitor their communications, etc. This is
&gt; being done. And it is critical, absolutely critical, not to impose
&gt; artificial barriers on who they spy on.

&gt; There is nothing you can do about that: Clinton did not take

&gt; but the PREPARATION and most of the intelligence came during
&gt; Clinton's AND HE DID NOTHING. Also, one points out, CLINTON
&gt; HAD SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO KILL bin LADEN AND DID NOT ACT.
&gt; This despite that it was clear that al Qaeda was involved
&gt; with previous murderous attempts around the world.

&gt; The BOTTOM LINE is that Bush has been doing as good a job as
&gt; can be done with people like you and many Democrats attacking
&gt; EVERYTHING he does in the war on terror, no matter WHAT IT IS.
&gt; Note that the Democrats are currently busily scurrying to
&gt; figure out new ways of attacking him now that it is apparent
&gt; that the &quot;surge&quot; is working, and that, ABSENT HELP FROM
&gt; PEOPLE LIKE YOU, the terrorists WILL eventually lose,
&gt; just as the IRA eventually lost. It probably will take

When did Republicans lose the ability to think independently and just
blindly follow their chosen leader no matter how precarious and
incorrect the path?  With the constant lies, cases of corruption,
blatant disregard for the American traditions, etc. you would think
that more of them would wise up and realize that they have been
following a fool over the precipice. Forget Clinton - you're fixated
on him.  At least no one died from his corruption and it didn't get
the US into a unjust war. No one has done more to increase recruitment
into Al Quade and the Jihad than Bush. He is not the answer to
security problems; he IS the security problem.

Let's LOOK at the relationship between American presidents &amp; bin
Laden....Saudi Oil is in Texas, is it not? The rich bin Laden family
is close to the Bush family - still - possibly with the exception of
Osama. The exception was not always there. Just after 9/11 members of
the bin Laden family were flown out of the US for their safety. How
many Saudi oil wells does Clinton have?  How many times has the bin
Laden family been hired by Clinton for construction jobs?  Take a very
very close look at the connections between the Bush family and the
Saudi royalty as well as the Saudi financial aristocracy, such as the
bin Laden family.

&quot;Monday morning quarterbacking&quot; doesn't mean &quot;post-mortem, lessons-
learned review&quot; as you imply.

It means criticizing with the benefit of hindsight those who without
it failed to act in a winning way, especially in reference to dealing
with unforseen circumstances.

To say that Bush should not have invaded Iraq is not it, because the
current difficulties were far from unforseen.

To say that all cockpits should have been made hijack proof is it, for
nobody anticipated 9/11, even though Tenet did urged Rice to attack Al-
Qaeda in Afghanistan -- not quite the same.

The same situation obtains with shipping containers.  We visited the
vulnerability briefly and moved on.   It's not the same to say &quot;Don't
invade Iraq,&quot; as to say, &quot;Secure all containers,&quot; unless you are happy
paying $20 for a pound of rice.

Yet, if a container were to blow up in a bad way, the I-told-you-so
brigade would be upon us.

We secure all containers, and then a rogue vessel drops anchor in
international waters off the New York coast, before anyone can react,
drops a fast boat with two 250 HP off-board engines, which races
unstoppably toward the New York harbor and when it is above the
Lincoln Tunnel goes bang.

I told you so.
