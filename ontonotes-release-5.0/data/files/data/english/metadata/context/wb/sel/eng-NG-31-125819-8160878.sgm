Has anyone come across a UK supplier of saddles that are kind on the
prostate - ie no horn to put pressure on sensitive parts?

There are seemingly plenty in North America, albeit a bit pricey, such as
Spongy Wonder, Moonsaddle, Spiderflex, Comfort Saddle and Easy Seat.
Some of these can be seen here: www.coccyx.org/coping/riding.htm

Any experiences with this type of saddle would be most interesting.

Surprisingly E-bay and Google doesn't appear to reveal anything here.

A normal saddle with a horn won't necessarily do that anyway, *if* it is
otherwise the right shape for you.  For example, my Brooks saddles don't
put any discernible pressure on &quot;sensitive parts&quot;.

General feeling is they don't actually help.  If you get a &quot;normal&quot;
saddle that's actually the right basic shape for your bottom end, and
it's set up right (fore/aft, height and tilt) then it should be a non-issue.

Alternatively, do comfort Properly and get a recumbent...

A conventional saddle need not put pressure on sensitive parts. If you are
used to saddles with gel or thick foam this may be your problem: the sit
bones just sink in, putting load onto the central area.

I look for thin foam wings and a soft central spine (not a hole) which is
the complete inverse of a gel saddle. The Bodyfit Viper is one such and
might be a cheaper alternative to the BodyGeometry.

Hi Mike,

We, at Manta Design Ltd - http://www.comfortsaddle.org - have a fully
re-engineered bicycle saddle with a real difference.
Also details here: http://www.mantamedia.org

We are based in Edinburgh and should be launching quiet soon, our
price will be as low as we can get it; our design has a fair degree of
technology.

Launching a radically new design into such a notoriously conservative
marketplace is rarely easy - especially in the UK - but everyone who
has seen or tried our prototype(s) has been impressed (in a good way).

&quot;...It is obvious from inspecting this design that as there is no
contact in the areas that are proven to
be problematical with conventional designs; I would suggest that the
blood flow analysis for a cyclist
using this saddle would probably approximate to that of a person
exercising other than on a bicycle;
i.e. a general increase in blood flow as opposed to the pudendal-
artery-specific restriction found in
riders using conventional saddles...&quot;
Dr Laurence Berman
Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's
Hospital, UK

Effects on the prostate are becoming increasingly linked to
conventional bicycle saddle design, as is general damage to arteries
(think stick tube - but not for too long!) and soft pudendal areas -
which are intended to remain soft.

Many thanks to all of you who took the trouble to reply to my request for
information on &quot;kind&quot; saddles.  My problem is that I am already suffering
from prostatitis due, originally, to an infection.  The inflammation is
gradually improving from excruciating to mild and my consultant has advised
me that I can take up cycling again after a break of almost 2 years
provided I put no pressure on the perineum as this will certainly cause a
flare up of inflammation.  After researching the subject it would appear
that only the designs such as the Spongy Wonder, Moonsaddle, Spiderflex,
Comfort Saddle and Easy Seat satisfy the criteria.

Geoff Pearson and Mark T correctly identify that the prostate is a long way
in and that pressure point is the perineum.

Peter Clinch said, &quot;The general feeling is they don't actually help&quot;; are
there any written studies supporting this from a scientific and user
viewpoint?  As a point of interest what is the &quot;correct&quot; set up (fore/aft,
height and tilt) of a normal saddle?

John Hearns said that the Specialized Body Geometry is available in most
bike shops and use the handy Assometer.  At 559Active they say that the
‘assometer’ measures the exact width of the ischial tuberosities to fit
individual sit bone width.  So this only concerns itself with the prominent
downward protuberance of the hip bone.

DavidR knows someone who has a Spongy Wonder and I shall be contacting him
direct but David, for the benefit of all, what is your friends experience
of using the saddle?

Jon Catling's design looks to be most innovative but the flexing of the
central section looks to be a potential reliability issue and I have
commented accordingly on his web site form.

Thanks to those who suggested a recumbant cycle, this is certainly an
option that I have looked at quite seriously but storage space is a bit of
an issue for these machines.

I'm not aware of published science, but plenty of anecdotal data you'll
find googling the archives of this group.
Put simply, the anecdotal evidence is that despite the brouhaha about
standard saddles rendering men infertile, there isn't an obvious track
record of it happening, and traditional hard leather saddles are still
frequently recommended for maximum comfort by seasoned cyclist.  It is
also the case that in countries like NL and Denmark that have never lost
their cycling culture there has never been that much obvious worry about
this &quot;problem&quot;, suggesting to me it's a non-problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; height and tilt) of a normal saddle?
">

If there was only one way to do it then there'd be no point in letting
people vary it.  It will vary according to your riding position and
personal physiology, and the way to find out what's right is experiment.
The Correct Answer is the one that allows most comfort.

Note the influence of riding position in there.  If you usually operate
in a crouch you may well find that sitting far more upright (like your
typical Dane or Cloggie, in fact) will help considerably as that will
rock the weight backwards and reduce the chance of pressure where it's
important.  Sitting bolt upright might be a good starting experiment:
you may need a change of position for the bars, and maybe a change of
bars altogether.

Though with a firm saddle you won't be sinking in and it's relatively
unlikely you'll be pressuring anything, at least after you're fiddled
the position.
The Speccy BG is a case in point for me that saddles are very individual
things.  While designed by anatomists with fancy computers and marketed
as being very body friendly, what they tell my particular bottom is that
the &quot;body geometry&quot; they're made around is rather different to mine.
The time I rode one for about 5 miles I found it almost cripplingly
uncomfortable.  Mileage clearly vcaries.

Not particularly more so than a conventional bike.  They're often a
little longer and you can't use e.g. widely available ceiling hoists
that assume you've a diamond frame, but aside from that there's really
not much difference to speak of storing a recumbent bike rather than a
conventional one.  Having said that, if you live up a stair, especially
with a narrow close, they can be a royal PITA if you need to get the
bike up and down.

HTH, Pete.

The point is that if you're supporting your weight comfortably on your
ischial tuberosities (and arms and legs) then you're relieving pressure
on your perineum.  A saddle that's the right shape and size for your
anatomy doesn't need high-tech padding[1] or special cutouts to
compensate for poor fit.  Once you have a saddle that suits your shape,
have sorted your position on the bike (horizontal and vertical position
and tilt of bars and saddle) and have developed a bit of tone in the
muscles that contact the saddle, you'll hardly be aware that you're
sitting on anything.
One issue is that fore/aft balance on the bike varies with the effort
that you put into pedalling - it will probably change as you get fitter,
so will need to be adjusted to compensate.  This mainly affects the bar
reach and height, which unfortunately is more hassle to adjust than
saddle position.

[1] or indeed much padding at all - one of the most comfortable saddles
I've ever used has no padding, just leather over a hard plastic base
that happens to suit my anatomy.

Mike,
I shall, of course, respond directly to your kind comments; we work
very closely with DuPont - who have been exceptionally helpful and
have set the material parameters so we can be sure of their continual
performance.
Even our old prototypes are faring well and showing little signs of
wear at the bearings, but the movement and bearing pressure is
actually quite modest.

We shall also have a guarantee in place and the individual parts are
inexpensively replaceable, mostly so they can be finely customized if
required.
We plan to have a returns and exchange service for parts not needed,
and for recycling.

The design does not need any padding as the load is spread over such a
large area - the opposite if the 'Spongy Wonder' and many other
alternatives.

I tried [built] a recumbent and although I enjoyed it I prefer the
sense of control one gets from uprights, perhaps due to the horse-like
steering with the legs - on every subtle, distinct pedal stroke; which
is what sent me back to the 'drawing board'.

http://www.comfortsaddle.org - [emphasis on the '.org' - as we are
manta design - not the other comfortsaddle]
The manta saddle can *increase* the pudendal blood flow; like other
forms of exercise...

This is not from the UK (yet) but I didn't get charged any extra or
any tax to have all three of mine shipped over from the US - the Selle
Anatomica leather saddle with cut out hole. Take a look at the
website: http://www.mcmwin.com/ In particular the MPEG files - if you
click 'R&amp;D video clips' on the home page and scroll about half way
down past the bike photo, theye are there and you can see there how
these saddles actually work when someone is pedalling whilst sitting
on one. This shows that it is not just down to the width and set up of
the saddle - they do *need* (for many people) to flex at the 'wings'
in order to accommodate the pedalling action without excess contact,
chafing or pressure to the undercarriage of the rider. This is the
only saddle that works for me. I have tried many, including 2
Specialized Jetts (women's version of the Avatar) which were far too
softa nd caused even worse problems, and two Brooks B17s (with no cut
out holes). I have ridden a 400 and 600km on the Selle Anatomica
saddle and had no probelms - a big improvement from last year when I
got contusions when riding and also painful and long lasting (9
months) pressure sores -  hard lumps of tissue on genitals (rather
than on buttocks) which made them appear literally twice the size,
with the surrounding swelling of tissue (alarmingly, it looked like I
had changed sex and had a pair of gonads or something). These hard pea
sized sores were formed by contiunual pressure from the Brooks saddle
without a cut away hole. Every anatomy is different and so I know it
is not merely a matter of set up and saddle width - some people really
do need a cut out hole. I am one of them. I realise that for women it
is a bit different as we actually sit on the genital area (in many
women, the labia protrude more than the sit bones when in a sitting/
cycling position, in which case one has no choice, no matter how the
saddle is positioned or tilted) whereas men can lift theirs out of the
way! But, the (male) loved one also finds holey saddles better, as he
gets penile numbness from perennial nerve constriction when using a
non-cut away saddle, although this is only a temporary feeling it was
rather alarming and so he also prefers a saddle with a cut away hole.
I know the selle anatomica saddle is not a cheap option, but for me it
is the only one - I now have three of them, one for each bike!

There isn't one. The OP said &quot;reply address&quot; not &quot;Reply-To&quot;, presumably
meaning the From: line which is not obviously mangled. Yes, that's a
confusing thing to call the From: line.

Actually I'm rather surprised reply-to-sender doesn't work automatically
(though I have checked that my addy is definitely visible).
I am sure I have managed reply-to-sender accidentally to posters on a
couple of times...

&gt; DavidR knows someone who has a Spongy Wonder and I shall be contacting

&gt; of using the saddle?

OK.
I helped her try out two saddles. She rode the Spongy Wonder for about 200
yards and didn't feel secure, the saddle being soft and shapeless. The
second saddle (I can't remember what it is called) was much better so we
concentrated on setting that up.

Coincidentally (knowing nothing about our discussion), she tried the Wonder
again a couple of days ago and sent me an email about her experience. She
used the term &quot;Spongy Horror&quot;.
//
After riding home again on the saddle, I became quickly aware that any kind
of prolonged use, for me, would almost certainly result in a dead (right)
leg; it might not pressurise the soft bits, but there's something wrong
when you get off a bike after five minutes and you've got pins and needles
in your toes.  I don't think it's right for me.

Sure, but it depends on your setup. I only have the NNTP (news) server
settings completed, as I don't use SMTP mail, so for me, and
potentially many others, my newsreader just isn't able to send emails,
period.

If there isn't a Reply-To field then replies will be sent to the From
