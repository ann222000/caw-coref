&gt; Can American Jews unplug the Israel lobby?

I am afraid, it would be like getting rid of AIDS!  The Jews will remain in
power of the United States for a century yet, barring a massive
revolutionary event. Which is not likely to take place, because they have
already captured all the most important positions in the government in USA,
and they do not give those up easily.
Russians got rid of the Jewish domination also by a revolutionary event
(fall of communism) which sidelined Jews . But even today there is a vast
Jewish influence in Russian politics still remaining.

&gt; As Bush's unbalanced Mideast policies careen from disaster to disaster,
&gt; people who don't toe the AIPAC line are beginning to speak out.

&gt; http://www.salon.com/opinion/kamiya/2007/03/20/aipac/index1.html

&gt; By Gary Kamiya

&gt; March 20, 2007 | Last week, a familiar Washington ritual took place:
&gt; Leading American politicians from both parties lined up at the annual
&gt; policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to vie
&gt; with each other over who could pledge the most undying fealty to Israel.
&gt; As usual, much of Congress showed up -- half of the members of the U.S.
&gt; Senate and more than half of the House, including figures like Hillary
&gt; Clinton and Barack Obama, along with Vice President Dick Cheney.

&gt; It was a typical AIPAC parallel-universe extravaganza, marred only by
&gt; partisan rifts that have begun to appear over Iraq. (Even some of the
&gt; AIPAC crowd, who overwhelmingly supported the war at the outset, have
&gt; begun to realize that it has been a disaster for both the United States
&gt; and Israel.) Cheney got a standing ovation, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
&gt; Olmert said via a video link that winning the war in Iraq was important
&gt; for Israel, Nancy Pelosi was booed for criticizing the war, a
&gt; fire-breathing Christian dispensationalist who believes that war on Iran
&gt; will bring about the Rapture and the Second Coming was rapturously
&gt; greeted, and Barack Obama took heat for having the audacity to mention the
&gt; suffering of the Palestinians.

&gt; But AIPAC showed its true power -- and its continuing ability to steer
&gt; American Mideast policy in a disastrous direction -- when a group of
&gt; conservative and pro-Israel Democrats succeeded in removing language from
&gt; a military appropriations bill that would have required Bush to get
&gt; congressional approval before using military force against Iran.

&gt; The pro-Israel lobby's victory on the Iran bill is almost unbelievable.
&gt; Even after the nation repudiated the Iraq war decisively in the 2006
&gt; midterms, even after it has become clear that the Bush administration's
&gt; Middle East policy is severely unbalanced toward Israel and has damaged
&gt; America's standing in the world, Congress still cannot bring itself to
&gt; stand up to the AIPAC line.

&gt; The fact that AIPAC, which is ranked as the second-most powerful lobby in
&gt; the country (trailing only AARP, but ahead of the NRA) virtually dictates
&gt; U.S. policy in the Mideast has long been one of those surreal facts of
&gt; Washington life that politicians discuss only when they get near
&gt; retirement -- if then. In 2004, Sen. Ernest &quot;Fritz&quot; Hollings had the bad
&gt; taste to reveal this inconvenient truth when he said, &quot;You can't have an
&gt; Israel policy other than what AIPAC gives you around here.&quot; Michael
&gt; Massing, who has done exemplary reporting on AIPAC for the New York Review
&gt; of Books, quoted a congressional staffer as saying, &quot;We can count on well
&gt; over half the House -- 250 to 300 members -- to do reflexively whatever
&gt; AIPAC wants.&quot; In unguarded moments, even top AIPAC figures have confirmed
&gt; such claims. The New Yorker's Jeffrey Goldberg quoted Steven Rosen,
&gt; AIPAC's former foreign-policy director who is now awaiting trial on
&gt; charges of passing top-secret Pentagon information to Israel, as saying,
&gt; &quot;You see this napkin? In twenty-four hours, we could have the signatures
&gt; of seventy senators on this napkin.&quot;

&gt; Until 9/11 and the Iraq war, this state of affairs was of little concern
&gt; to anyone except those passionately interested in the Middle East -- a
&gt; small group that has never included more than a tiny minority of
&gt; Americans, Jews or non-Jews. If the pro-Israel lobby wielded enormous
&gt; power over America's Mideast policies, so what? America's Mideast policies
&gt; were always reliably pro-Israel anyway, for a variety of reasons,
&gt; including many that had nothing to do with lobbying by American Jews. And
&gt; the stakes didn't seem that big.

&gt; But in the wake of 9/11 and the Iraq war, that all changed dramatically.
&gt; 9/11, and the Bush administration's response to it, made it inescapably
&gt; clear that America's Mideast policies affect everyone in the country: They
&gt; are literally a matter of life and death. The Bush administration's
&gt; neoconservative Mideast policy is essentially indistinguishable from
&gt; AIPAC's. And so it is no longer possible to ignore it -- even though it is
&gt; a notoriously touchy and divisive subject.
&gt; The touchiest aspect of all is the role played by pro-Israel
&gt; neoconservatives in laying the groundwork for the Iraq war. Much of the
&gt; media has been loath to go near this, for obvious and in some ways
&gt; honorable reasons: It feels a little like &quot;blame the Jews.&quot; But that taboo
&gt; has faded as it has become clearer that &quot;the Jews&quot; are not the ones being
&gt; blamed for helping pave the way to war, but a group of powerful
&gt; neoconservatives, some but not all of them Jewish, who subscribe to the
&gt; hard-right views of Israel's Likud Party. This group no more represents
&gt; &quot;the Jews&quot; than the Shining Path represents &quot;the Peruvians.&quot;

&gt; Logic and forthrightness has traditionally taken a back seat to timorous
&gt; self-censorship when it comes to discussing these matters. But in addition
&gt; to the war debate, several other watershed events have helped erode the
&gt; taboo against discussing the power of the Israel lobby. The most important
&gt; were the publications of John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt's &quot;The Israel
&gt; Lobby,&quot; and Jimmy Carter's &quot;Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.&quot; The
&gt; overwrought reaction to Mearsheimer and Walt's piece, ironically, only
&gt; supported its thesis. Similarly, the opprobrium heaped on Carter only
&gt; succeeded in making it clear how little room there is for open discussion
&gt; of these issues in America.

&gt; For all these reasons, a powerful spotlight has been turned on the
&gt; pro-Israel lobby. And there are signs that increasing numbers of
&gt; Americans, Jews and non-Jews alike, are willing to openly question whether
&gt; it is in America's national interest for AIPAC, whose positions are well
&gt; to the right of those held by most American Jews, to wield such
&gt; disproportionate power over America's Mideast policies.

&gt; As a group, American Jews continue to be staunchly liberal. A new poll
&gt; shows that 77 percent of American Jews now think that the Iraq war was a
&gt; mistake, compared with 52 percent of all Americans. (Jewish support for
&gt; the war has collapsed: A poll taken a month before the war showed that 56
&gt; percent of Jews supported it, somewhat below the national average at that
&gt; time.) Eighty-seven percent of Jews voted Democratic in 2006. And although
&gt; data here is murkier, polls also show that most American Jews hold views
&gt; on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that are to the left of AIPAC's.

&gt; What all this adds up to is that for liberal or moderate American Jews who
&gt; don't support Bush's war in Iraq or his &quot;war on terror&quot; and who are
&gt; willing to look at Israel warts and all, the fact that AIPAC has anointed
&gt; itself as the de facto spokesmen for American Jews is becoming more and
&gt; more unacceptable. And increasing numbers of them are beginning to speak
&gt; out.

&gt; One of the most trenchant commentators is Philip Weiss, a regular
&gt; contributor to the Nation. Weiss' blog, MondoWeiss, offers informed and
&gt; passionate discussions of what he calls &quot;delicate and controversial
&gt; matters surrounding American Jewish identity and Israel.&quot; He routinely
&gt; skewers attempts by mainstream Jewish organizations and pundits to lay
&gt; down the law on what is acceptable discourse. This means being willing to
&gt; look at off-limits subjects like &quot;dual loyalty.&quot; When the American Jewish
&gt; Committee, a powerful advocacy group that shares AIPAC'S line, issued a
&gt; reactionary response to the Mearsheimer-Walt piece and the Carter book,
&gt; accusing Jewish intellectuals who didn't toe the party line on Israel of
&gt; being &quot;self-haters,&quot; Weiss pointed out that the heavy-handed attempt had
&gt; backfired -- instead of silencing dissenting voices, the AJC piece
&gt; revealed for all to see the &quot;anti-intellectual, vicious, omerta practices
&gt; of the Jewish leadership.&quot;

&gt; Other widely read writers who have been outspoken on formerly taboo
&gt; subjects include Matthew Yglesias of the American Prospect and Glenn
&gt; Greenwald of Salon. Both Greenwald and Yglesias, for example, punctured a
&gt; classic attempt by the Jewish establishment to smear Gen. Wesley Clark,
&gt; who, saying that he feared that Bush might be preparing to attack Iran,
&gt; added, &quot;The Jewish community is divided but there is so much pressure
&gt; being channeled from the New York money people to the office seekers.&quot;
&gt; Clark was immediately -- and predictably -- accused of being anti-Semitic
&gt; for referring to &quot;the New York money people&quot; and implying they wanted war
&gt; with Iran. But as both Yglesias and Greenwald pointed out, everything
&gt; Clark said was demonstrably true. Adding insult to injury, Greenwald
&gt; proved it was true by citing such right-wing, pro-Israel media sources as
&gt; the New York Sun and the New York Post.

&gt; Of course, a few blogs, articles and organizations do not necessarily a
&gt; movement make -- certainly not one

The major influence of the hebes in Russia seems to be associated with
