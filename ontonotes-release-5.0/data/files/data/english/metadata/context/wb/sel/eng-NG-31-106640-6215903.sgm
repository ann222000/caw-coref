Entity has new 2007 pocket calendars that are beautiful.  You could laminate them and mail them in a card to your clients.  It isn't a huge gift, but it's something affordable and they are really stunning!!!!!

that is such a great idea we have ordered up some pocket calendars from Amsterdamprinting.com that are in nice leather covers they can be ordered in monthly or weekly we did weekly.  best part is order  50 get 50 free so it is cost effective.  I get samples from them all the time which is even better.

I do up a goodie bag...  I put a calendar, sample bottle of solar oil, sample bottle of hand lotion, a bottle/can opener with salon logo on it ("Your nails are jewels, not tools), and some christmas candy...  I also, write down there appointments for the entire year in the calendar, so they never forget..  I also add a note telling them the appointments are written in "Pencil" not gold so they can be changed if necessary.......

Ok, the calendars are beautiful, and they are just $7.95 for a pack of  50!
Great!  My clients would LOVE these!  However, there is a  shipping charge of
$8.95 on orders less than $200.00!  Yikes!  Anyone  have an order going into
Entity soon that would order a pack or two of these  calendars for me?  Please?
Pretty please?
Thanks!

Hello Mary Jo

In my salon I give all  clients a little pocket diary every year.
The main reason is to prevent No Shows and or forgetful clients
They find them handy y they   can keep   all     theirinta
ll my standing appointments I have them choose from soaps, candles or
lotions
