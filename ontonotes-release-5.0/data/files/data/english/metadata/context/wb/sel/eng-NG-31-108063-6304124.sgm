I have a large apple tree which dumps hundreds of pounds of mostly
unwanted apples on our property every year. I'd like to spray the tree
with Florel Fruit Eliminator this year to eliminate most of the fruit.
My questions is: Will any fruit that sets and ripens despite my
application of Florel fruit eliminator be safe to eat? The product
safety sheet only mentions Florel in the context of ornamental trees
and there avoids the whole edibility question but it's clear from
perusing usenet that many people are using it on edible fruit
producing trees. Does anyone have any experience with this product on
apple trees?

Thanks

I think this is a question best left to the manufacturer....

Couldn't you get a local food bank to send an unemployed person to
collect/pick  the unwanted apples?  Or simply invite neighbors to
pick?

or prune the thing and thin by hand (thin in June, leave one fruit for
every 25 leaves, for best production)? And do what I do with my pears,
rake those that fall and give them to my neighbor, who has chickens
who gobble them up?
