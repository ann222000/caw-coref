Smoking ban - interesting effect on pub gig

So, I did a singalongahamish pub gig last night in Worthing. Not much
to do with folk, I suppose, the closest being a couple of Paul Simon
songs. But it was my first since the smoking ban. And, yes, it was
lovely to play in a smokeless atmosphere. But something I hadn't
anticipated was that folks would have to go outside for regular
nicotine fixes. In fact I was on right after the quiz (yes, I know:
but a gig's a gig...) so I started to a half empty pub.

And, observations about how maybe their craving for nicotine might be
increased by my performance aside, I er... thought I'd mention it.

I suppose I should be drawing some lesson or suggesting strategies at
this point, but, er... well, yes, I thought I'd just mention it.

I guess I could say something about always having to be on form, cos
if they go outside and think &quot;I didn't think much of that song&quot; as
they leave, they'll be less likely to hurry back. So don't be tempted
to put any padding in.

...maybe...

...fades out...

Two pubs in my own town - both of which supported live music - have gone
bankrupt in the last 3 weeks and since the ban came in. Now they have really
clean air that NO-ONE wants to breathe.

Neither of them had outdoor facilities for their mainly smoker clientele.
This is summertime-ish.  Others in the town are looking imminent for closure
too.  Wait until the winter.  It looks like hundreds and hundreds up and
down the country will go out of business just as they have done in Scotland
and Ireland. What a great fucking idea that was by all the zealots who
supported this draconian crap.

No problem about naming it. It's a good place: decent, home-made (and
it is!) food at sensible prices. Nice enough clientelle. It's a proper
local with regular punters. No daft kids. Friendly gaffer...

It's The Half Brick: on Brighton Road (i.e. just over the road from
the beach) at the bottom of Ham Road. Pretty good music venue: Bob,
the gaffer, is a pretty handy blues harp player and bluesy/gospelly
vocalist and fronts a band which seems to get around a bit, so he's a
keen supporter of live music. There's live music most nights, and he's
trying to build up Wednesdays as some sort of folk thing. I hope to be
doing one such in the vague future. Although I'm slightly anxious: he
keeps using the word &quot;hoolie&quot; about it, and I'm a bit too laid back
for that. But he knows my style - even if he hasn't heard my core
repertoire as yet - so I reckon I'll be okay.

p.s. and, Chris, yes they do have a large covered patio area. The pub
was at least as busy as the other two times I went pre-ban.

Re the smoking ban - my father-in-law is chairman of a workingmen's
club, and die-hard smokers have complained that the club has banned
smoking in accordance with the new law but yet it still sells fags
from a vending machine.

They were politely informed that the club also sells condoms from a
machine in the toilets, but definitely does not allow members to have
sex on the premises!

Not really sure what the effects of the ban in the sessions I go to are
but...

In one the first non smoking night was a very busy and noisy night but
over the last 4-5 weeks. I can not remember a week where I have
struggled for example to hear the Irish pipes the opposite side of the
table to me. I think this has gone with a drop in numbers of drinkers
but not a drop to the extent I would be worrying about our future there.
Maybe it will prove to be some benefit as a result of a law I would
strongly disagree with even if I was a non-smoker - I don't know yet.
The pub has always been variable in terms of numbers, maybe some locals
have been on holiday, etc. but there just may be one change for the better.

I have not been getting to the other one on a weekly basis but numbers
of players have generally been low the weeks I've been.  I think there
are other reasons, eg. holidays, some play in groups, etc for the drop
and not many of that group smoke but the last one did amuse me in some
way. There were only 3 of us and 2 of us were smokers. There was no
music at all when we had our fag breaks.

Ah yes, I remember the Half Brick. Some years ago we had a session
there, largely for the benefit of TV cameras. A member of the morris
side I played for lived in Ham Road, and the local TV network decided to
do a feature on the people living in Ham road and their various hobbies
and eccentricities. They couldn't believe their luck when they found
that Sally was a morris dancer... Could she arrange for the side to
dance outside her house, maybe tomorrow?

So at about 24 hours' notice we managed to raise a mixed side to do a
processional dance down the middle of Ham Road at the required time,
which was about 5.30 pm, during the evening rush hour. The point of
this, for the cameras, was to demonstrate how Sally and her
morris-dancing friends liked to spend their time dancing down her
street. Passing motorists were (variously) amused, entertained or
exasperated.

We ended up, not surprisingly, in the Half Brick for a bit of a session.
Not one of Worthing's most charming pubs, but yes, quite a roomy pub for
music etc.

I was pleased, when I saw the TV programme with its tantalisingly brief
shots of the morris processsion, that they continued using my music as a
background track to some of what followed (interviews with other people
in the street who kept budgies or collected teapots or whatever).

Morris dancers, however, if they dance outside pubs, now find themselves
with new, small, intermittent audiences who pop out from time to time, watch
the odd dance, and pop back in. Sometimes they actually seem to enjoy it and
hang around after their fags have gone out. Sometimes they even drop some
loose change in our charity bucket...

I'd have to really want to go somewhere to do that.  Can't see Spain

While I hope people enjoy the music (and that they do so in enough
numbers to make a session worth a landlord's while) , entertaining
people is a secondary concern.

I suppose the local folk club, although a singaround, comes that little
bit closer to entertaining others.  I have stopped going to that one
since the smoking ban came in. My nerves are awful and I always get edgy
there and I decided I couldn't be bothered with the additional hassle of
walking out for a fag, worrying about my turn.

We now fit in another session (my preference) in instead of the club.
Pip (a life time non smoker) and I had tried to balance up evenets we
could both go to and she preferred the folk club.  She agrees with me
that it's not worth my while now.

I play about three pub &amp; working men's club gigs a week, in places where the
overwhelming majority are smokers and it's been quite dispiriting since the
ban, with more people outside than in. A couple of times I've even unplugged
my guitar and gone out to play a few songs in the beer garden just to have
someone to sing to. Roll on the cold, blow and rainy nights.

So what... ?  You wheel out tired old anti-smoke arguments.  You miss the
point I made entirely.  I'm an ex-smoker worried about the very negative
effects of the ban in many pubs.

We've lost 3 important live music venues in the last 6 weeks - all because
of the smoking ban.  We've also lost 3 sessions - two to the smoking ban,
one to modernisation plans to change the character of the pub.

Two of them were IMO the best live venues in the town. Pubs - all of which
were frequented 7 days a week by drinkers who smoked - in some cases in
ratios as high as 3 to 1 - are now closing down.

The Licensing changes, increasing costs, increased PRS charges and losing
smokers to other pubs (where outdoor smoker's facilities exist). All these
things are having their effect and taking their toll.

Given that flying to Spain involves a few hours in the non-smoking

No wrong, they were full of customers buying drinks and smoking.  How long
can a business sustain not having customers.  The regulars were pretty much
ALL smokers - people who supported many pubs financially by being regulars.
The sessions of non-smokers didn't add that much - twice a month musicians
bought 2 or 3 pints each.

Haven't really worked the seasonal shifts in Norwich out although where
I am on the N Norfolk coast, I see more people around.

The summer holiday effects where more marked when I lived near
Llandudno. It was a busy time for the clubs. The struggle with the
Llandudno club came after Christmas/N Wales. Some weeks at least some
years we closed and other weeks a few might sit round tables rather than
use the PA. Dance wise, Conwy Morris practiced in the winter and danced
out on Llandudno prom every week of the Summer.

I'm not saying you are wrong in your assessmet, just that because one
area experience quiet it's not guaranteed another does..

Well you can always trust Bliar to mess up, the law should have been in
all the areas of the pub of course. Now people who take their kids in
pub gardens have a problem they didn't have before (as much). And
getting in the pub is as smelly as getting in the local hospital where
the smokers sit in their wheelchairs complete with drip feed (really).

Ref Chris's comments, I've been attending music clubs and sessions all
my life, my opinion is that current generations who are smokers and
session players may well as Chris says not attend those pubs and venues.
But we all know our music is strong at present, and always bounces back.
Umpty years from now sessions will still be strongly on the go with
people who won't expect to smoke at the same time. Myself and my friends
are now attending more pubs/gigs and restaurants since the ban.

I thought Chris was commenting on the regular customers at pubs rather
than the session players. The people who often keep the pubs we use in
business the other 6 days of the week when we are not there as well as
perhaps drinking when we are there.

I don't anticipate many losses in terms of smoking players in pub
sessions. The smoking players have more incentive to put up with the ban
than the other smoking customers, many of whom in sessions I suspect
have been doing no more than accepting the presence of the music.

Personally I wonder how tolerant many smoking customers would be of
sessions if they read some of the attitudes towards smoking expressed
here and elsewhere.

Cigarette smoke is no more ghastly a stench to me than horrible perfume and

anything else. The rest is a typical anti-smoke zealot overreaction.

Well it is nice because it means my smoking partner and I - a non smoker -
can sit outside the pub and she can smoke freely and we can both enjoy a
drink together.

We've had some interesting evenings sitting outside with the smokers the
last two months.  Funny, but they are an altogether more friendly and
affable bunch of people with some interesting conversation.

In the wintertime (starts end of this month round here) my partner will
rarely be going to the pub.  Our nearest one has closed down due to the ban
now anyway.  The anti-smoking zealots if they bother going to the pub at all
anyway - and assuming there's a pub still in existence to go to - will have
the entire places - inside and out - all to themselves.

As for sessions - we've lost 2 weekly and 2 fortnightly already.

And guess what - sales of cigarettes have gone up since the ban.  No
surprises there either - it happened in Scotland and Ireland too.  If you
think I'm angry with those fuckwits who voted for this law - you're damn
right.

We had one person in particular who complained out loud about smoke at one
of the sessions.  One of the smoking regulars pointed out that he frequented
the pub 5 days a week against our one or two ,max and also pointed out that

But you've got to admit, it's an interesting line of argument. Has
anyone ever developed cancer or had an asthma attack as a result of

press the air-button and ease the bellows in and out to get rid of the

&gt;&gt; songs. But it was my first since the smoking ban. And, yes, it was
&gt;&gt; lovely to play in a smokeless atmosphere. But something I hadn't
&gt;&gt; anticipated was that folks would have to go outside for regular
&gt;&gt; nicotine fixes. In fact I was on right after the quiz (yes, I know:
&gt;&gt; but a gig's a gig...) so I started to a half empty pub.

&gt;&gt; And, observations about how maybe their craving for nicotine might be
&gt;&gt; increased by my performance aside, I er... thought I'd mention it.

&gt;&gt; I suppose I should be drawing some lesson or suggesting strategies at
&gt;&gt; this point, but, er... well, yes, I thought I'd just mention it.

&gt;&gt; I guess I could say something about always having to be on form, cos

&gt; Neither of them had outdoor facilities for their mainly smoker clientele.

It does linger, doesn't it? I just bought something from an eBay seller -
everything went smoothly, the parcel arrived this morning, and I opened it
to be hit with the smell of stale fag smoke. All the shredded paper and
bubble wrap had to go straight into the recycling bins, but the item itself,
which looks fine in every other way, will have to be aired for some time
before I can use it. At first I thought of giving negative feedback, but the
sender obviously had no idea her smoke would fix itself to the parcel. When
I smoked (which I did for many years until 2000) it certainly wouldn't have
occurred to me.

&gt;thousands of pubs.

&gt;&gt; It used to be that if you wanted a meal in a pub uninterrupted by the
&gt;&gt; ghastly stench of cigarette smoke you had to sit outside.

&gt;Cigarette smoke is no more ghastly a stench to me than horrible perfume and
&gt;aftershave; farts and stale sweat; petrol or diesel fumes; or coal smoke or
&gt;anything else.

Crikey - no wonder you didn't notice ciggy smoke in your pub, sounds
like a smelly old hole. (Literally :0)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The rest is a typical anti-smoke zealot overreaction.

&gt;As for nice pipe and cigar smoke smells, I really do miss them.

&gt;&gt; Now you have to sit inside to avoid the smoke, and pub barbeques have almost
&gt;&gt; disappeared...

&gt;Well it is nice because it means my smoking partner and I - a non smoker -
&gt;can sit outside the pub and she can smoke freely and we can both enjoy a
&gt;drink together.

&gt;We've had some interesting evenings sitting outside with the smokers the
&gt;last two months.  Funny, but they are an altogether more friendly and
&gt;affable bunch of people with some interesting conversation.

&gt;In the wintertime (starts end of this month round here) my partner will
&gt;rarely be going to the pub.  Our nearest one has closed down due to the ban
&gt;now anyway.  The anti-smoking zealots if they bother going to the pub at all
&gt;anyway - and assuming there's a pub still in existence to go to - will have
&gt;the entire places - inside and out - all to themselves.

&gt;As for sessions - we've lost 2 weekly and 2 fortnightly already.

&gt;And guess what - sales of cigarettes have gone up since the ban.  No
&gt;surprises there either - it happened in Scotland and Ireland too.  If you
&gt;think I'm angry with those fuckwits who voted for this law - you're damn

&gt;&gt; Me, I'm enjoying being able to play my melodeon in a pub and then, when I
&gt;&gt; get home, not having to take it out in the garden some time later to press
&gt;&gt; the air-button and ease the bellows in and out to get rid of the stale
&gt;&gt; smoke fumes inside it. Ugh. Petrol, perfume, sweat - there are lost of
&gt;&gt; unpleasant smells, but they don't linger and cling and pollute in the way
&gt;&gt; that smoke does.

&gt;It does linger, doesn't it? I just bought something from an eBay seller -
&gt;everything went smoothly, the parcel arrived this morning, and I opened it
&gt;to be hit with the smell of stale fag smoke. All the shredded paper and
&gt;bubble wrap had to go straight into the recycling bins, but the item itself,
&gt;which looks fine in every other way, will have to be aired for some time
&gt;before I can use it. At first I thought of giving negative feedback, but the
&gt;sender obviously had no idea her smoke would fix itself to the parcel. When
&gt;I smoked (which I did for many years until 2000) it certainly wouldn't have
&gt;occurred to me.

Thanks.

I've never been in one, I don't know how they work, but this seems to make
sense - sending people outside hits their moneymaking in more direct ways.

(An analogy might be the really hardcore chainsmoker who wasn't able to stop
smoking long enough to go inside to the bar ? Would equally be prevented
from spending money. But also wouldn't have been able to get through the
building into the smokers' reservation ... file under &quot;bread-and-butter

Though, on a minor point of order, it says that &quot;Bingo halls have been more
seriously affected by the Scottish smoking ban than pubs&quot;, rather than that
pubs haven't been affected.

Oh I've got books like that! There's an old edition of Chambers' English

I seem to come across so many conflicting reports over how it has
affected pubs in Scotland and Ireland that I'm not sure what to believe.
That is except that if I asked the what the effects were, I'd have a
pretty good idea from the answer whether the person was in favour of the
ban or not. I can't believe it hasn't affected anything and feel it is
unlikely that everything has all worked out for the better of worse for
businesses.

My biggest fear is not so much in an overall reduction of number pubs
but in a further reduction of pubs with a bit of character left and pubs
willing to hold sessions. I suspect many of these will have a much
harder time than restaurants which serve beer for example and I'm aware
of a couple of pubs I like where I think the ban will mean the end. In
one case at least as I've enjoyed it - it might be able to change
character to start attracting food customers. In the other case, I don't
see what they can do.

Yes, I remember somebody making that observation many years ago when

Has any explanation been offered for this?

Another interesting social aspect of smoking is that smokers and
non-smokers tend to gather naturally in separate social groups. Not
surprising really, but it partly explains why, as you decribed in an
earlier post, some smoking pubs have closed down.

The smarter landlords of previously smoky pubs have taken steps to
encourage more non-smoking customers into their premises before the law
took effect. They had plenty of time to do this, if they were so inclined.

Doesn't always work though and in some cases, I'm not sure what you can
do as I really do not imagine many of the types who say they were put of
by smoking being ones who would be out having a few pints most nights of
the week.

One of the pubs I was thinking of in another post in this thread has no
space, not even a pavement in front, round it. The rooms are small,
there is nowhere to expand for a kitchen, etc.

I think it will go whatever they try. Shame really, I didn't drink in
this one often but it was a fun/mad village pub that once in a while
even had some live music.  I can't imagine another pub where I could
have wound up having my hair cut by a fiddle player at around 3am as a
sort of spontaneous fund raiser for charity (Scope IRRC)...

The other pub I was thinking of changed hands around Christmas time.  I
liked it but it had been a bit run down by the previous owner who I
think was only trying to do enough to keep the pub he had paid for going
until he found a buyer.

The new owners have said they talked to most people in the village and
the responses (which I believe included references to things being more
likely after the ban) were positive. The pub's brighter now and does (my
parents tell me - I've yet to try it) lovely food but the local
&quot;promises&quot; simply haven't really turned up, not even to give it a try.
In the meanwhile, I think some of the existing smokers are coming out
less often.

My guess is that it probably will survive by going more up market,
advertising more or to a wider area outside the village and forgetting
any desire to remain at least to some extent a local.

I never said pubs haven't been affected. What I said was that the original
statement that hundreds of pubs have 'closed' across Scotland because of the
smoking ban is untrue. About 40% of pubs have seen profits increase whilst
around 55% have seen them reduce. It seems to depend on what effort is put
in by the licensee. Country pubs have been more affected than town and city
pubs! Reduced profits though is not the same as hundreds closing down. It
seems that statement was the spectacular factoid!

The Irish ban has been in force since 2004 and the pattern is clear. Places
don't close down immediately... they struggle on; they borrow; they try to
buy themselves time...

From The Times
February 27, 2007

RURAL PUBS WILL SUFFER FROM SMOKING BAN

David Lister
England¹s country pubs are likely to bear the brunt of any closures after
the introduction of the smoking ban this summer, according to Irish
publicans.
As pubs prepare for the implementation of the ban on July 1, the warnings
from rural Ireland were backed by official figures from Dublin showing that
country pubs were shutting at a record rate.
Nearly 440 fewer pub licences were issued or renewed last year than in 2005,
the steepest fall recorded in the Republic. The greatest number of closures
were in remote communities along the West Coast. Up to 1,000 rural bars are
now thought to have shut since the ban came into effect in 2004.
While the ban has been welcomed by tourists and health campaigners, and has
led to an increase in business in many city pubs, it has caused problems for
those that depend heavily on local trade.
Although a range of factors ? from a crackdown on drink-driving to rises in
beer prices ? are to blame for the fall in custom, landlords say that they
have failed to recover from the smoking ban¹s introduction.
³The story here is the same no matter who you speak to ? everyone tells you
that their trade has gone down something terrible,² said Maureen Kirwan from
behind the Central Bar in Killimor, Co Galway.
She added: ³You couldn¹t get a packed bar these days unless there¹s a
funeral or some other big event.²
While Mrs Kirwan says that she is just about keeping her head above water,
elsewhere in the village the mood was more gloomy. Eugene Duffy, proprietor
of Duffy¹s Bar, said: ³Drink takings have been down about a third over the
past 12 months. At the moment we can¹t afford to close, but I can¹t see the
next generation keeping it going.²
