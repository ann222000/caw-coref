My son has a 63&quot; DLP HDTV set and it looks quite good. As you know
from another thread I am looking into a much smaller set, say 32&quot; or
37&quot;. My preferred viewing distance is 6 feet with another seat about
12 feet away at a 45 degree angle.

What are the features and problems with DLP technology in a small set
for my setting.

I believe there is no pixelation problem with DLP and there are no
burned out/discolored pixels either. I also believe that the DLP sets
are a bit less expensive. One of the downsides is they are much
thicker but no worse than a CRT TV. I have the space for a thick DLP
if I go that route.

Comments please.

Regardless of which type of display you select do not go with less than
42 inches.  42 to 50 is what you want for those viewing distances.

I have a 32 in the bedroom and a 42 in the living room.  The difference
is significant.  You just don't get the full impact with less than 42
(40 absolute minimum).

It is clear that I need to visit a showroom or two to see what you
mean. I am trying to imagine sitting 6 feet from a 42&quot; TV and all I
get is this image of being overwhelmed by the extraordinary size of
such a huge screen in my face.

The 12 foot distance is not important - it is not used much so I do
not want to accommodate it with anything special. Most viewing is done
at 6 feet distance and that is what I do want to accommodate.

If you're comparing to a 4:3 aspect ratio, you need to recalibrate your
thinking! A 50&quot; widescreen (16:9) is approximately the same height as a
42&quot; 4:3 image.

I have a 65&quot; Mits DLP. After doing a lot of research, these are the
downsides of DLP sets:

o Limited life on the bulb - be prepared to replace the light source
every 1 to 2 years. You'll probably get more life than that, but be
prepared...

o DLP sets have a couple of motors that may be noisy and are a potential
failure point. One motor is for the cooling fan for the light source,
the other is for the color wheel.

o DLPs give some folks headaches, especially if there's a lot of light
colored objects moving on the screen. This is supposedly due to the
color wheel - the trailing or leading edge of a relatively small white
object that's moving rapidly across the screen may seem to flash and
change colors. Mitsubishi has gone to a 6 color color wheel (and maybe a
faster rotation of the color wheel) to minimize this. Either I'm not
susceptible or the work Mits did helps (or both), but I haven't had any
problems with this.

o The contrast ratio on DLPs is so great that it can cause eye strain in
some folks when watching in a dark environment. The standard fix for
this is to put a small light fixture behind the set reflecting off the
wall. This helps keep viewers' eyes dilated. I've not had a problem with
this either.

o Some DLP sets don't have a very rich black - black stuff on the screen
looks to be more of a very dark brown. My Mits set has a &quot;black
enhancer&quot; that remedies this.

o Per your original post, DLPs are thicker than LCDs and plasmas.

Upsides:

o Newer sets have advanced enough to remedy some of the above listed
downsides.

o Terrific picture!

o Currently, DLP sets provide the best bang for the buck - you get the
biggest screen and (arguably) the best picture per price range. You can
get a 55&quot; DLP for about the same price as a 40&quot; LCD or plasma.

o My DLP upscales everything to 1080p; a good quality DVD looks almost
as good as a true HD source.

I'm very happy with my DLP and wouldn't hesitate to buy another if I
needed another TV.

I didn't think there are any DLP's of a size this small.  Smallest I
know of right now is 42&quot; (Toshiba) and I think that is discontinued.
Samsung's smallest that I see available is 46&quot; and the current
models start at 50&quot;!

The small DLPs are certainly less than a foot thick, probably thinner
than your old 19&quot; CRT.  Compared to older CRTs, there is still more
pixelation - but then even old rear-projection NTSC and newer CRTs had
a certain amount of pixellation.  There may be no individual pixels in
this case to burn out, but you may still have digital compression
artifacts that appear in the image.

You get at least one extra size for the bucks, 37&quot; DLP for the price
of a 32&quot; LCD.  The image is not as clear off-axis as an LCD, but it is
much, much better than old rear-projection sets.  Because of the
motors and the bulb and a small difference in picture quality, I like
the LCD, but others are very happy with their DLPs.  I think the main
virtue with DLPs is in big sets, though.  Oh, and some DLPs may come
with better sound than any of the LCDs, they have at least a few
inches more to play with re speakers, and less concern with adding
weight.

If and when a new generation of projectors comes out with LEDs instead
of incandescent bulbs, and no wheel, well, I'd say the projection
route will be very tempting - again, especially for 60&quot; and above.

--

OTOH, apparently the LCDs may age less gracefully than old CRTs,
brightness and contrast slowly fading, and probably failing in under
ten years where CRTs commonly go over ten years.

But I might be tempted to blow the price difference on the DLP by
buying the long-term service contract.

As a former DLP owner, I agree with everything you wrote in this post
except this (although the 'arguably' comment is noted).  I think you
can get just as good a value with a LCOS set (in my case a JVC).
Either can provide a big picture at a bargain.

I'm curious as to why you went from DLP to LCOS.  What do you
perceive as the pluses and minuses of both (rainbows, or lack
thereof, being an obvious one).

In my case, the DLP was a lemon.  I was a Sharp model and it provided
a beautiful picture for six months.  Six months and three light
engines later, Sharp gave me a full refund (and got out of the DLP
business).  So I know from my first six months that a DLP set can be
great, but I've been real happy with JVC as well.

Hey, how about that.

A little Googling shows good reviews, ... and high price.

Can anybody point me at some technical detail on just how it works?

I notice that there are now 3 watt white LEDs, and I just saw a 6
watt, though its output was well less than twice the 3w model.  But I
wonder about the availability of the proper color outputs for driving
a TV.  Do they flicker the three LEDs, or give them each a DLP, or
wot?

But thanks for the pointer, apparently Samsung has been shipping these
for well over a year!

Very little detail, does not really explain how they do away with the
color wheel.  Do they really collimate three light sources on the same
path and then pulse the LEDs in sequence?  That's very zippy, if
indeed they are serious.  Figure 5 in the paper is as close as they
come to answering that question, and that they mention pulsing the
LEDs for intensity.  Might be a tad tough on the electronics, I'd have
some concern for their longevity - tho again, all the current HDTV
technologies - except old-fashioned CRTs - seem to have a projected
lifetime under ten years.  I guess I can live with that, just sayin'.

It uses some excess available bandwidth in the DLP technology, but
you're still wearing those stupid glasses, and that kind of 3D is no
better now than it was in 1957.

As many as it takes to keep people interested enough in responding. I
have found that new topics get a better response if they are in their
own thread.

I have learned more about HDTV in the last few days on this one forum
than I could have learned in months of circle jerking around the
Internet. Even the web forums are lame compared with this forum.
