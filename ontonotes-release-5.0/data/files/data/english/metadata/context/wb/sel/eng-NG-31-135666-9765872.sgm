How do I uncompress a '.rar' file? / Lotus software on the Mac

I've received a file which has a '.rar' extension - which I believe is
a form of compression. Can anyone tell me how I uncompress it on an
Intel Mac please? Is something like Stuffit Expander the preferred Mac
option for this kind of task?

Also, a colleague wants me to run a program called Lotus Smartsuite
which includes a very good database application (Lotus Approach)
that's supposed to be a lot more capable than MS Access. It's no
longer commercially available as far as I know, so most people on this
forum might not know it. Nevertheless, would anyone else happen to
know if it does (or did) run on the Mac? If it ever has, then that
would be for pre-Intel, Power-PC Macs. In that case, is there software
available for Intel Macs that may allow older Mac software to run on
the new machines? I suspect not, but if you know any different please
do tell me.

Thanks for any advice...

The current SITx (v12) will un-rar a rar, or so it claims. There may
be more than one 'standard' for rar, so if SITx doesn't cut the
mustard, try UnRarX

See that pole, that's a barge pole that is.
And I won't touch it. No sir. Not a bit.

Lotus == IBM == no Macs

The best you could hope for is getting an old copy of SmartSuite and
running it in Windows/VMware. Sounds like a lot of trouble to me.
Better to try a mac solution. If your needs are simple, database wise,
try the Tiny Tim of the Filemaker family - Bento &lt; http://tinyurl.com/
3byp89&gt;. It depends on your needs, and you haven't revealed them
yet...

Thanks for the advice John. I suppose that's pretty much the answer I
expected! Yes, better to try a Mac solution - isn't it always?!
Unfortunately, the rest of the world hasn't realised this yet.

Hi David,

Just seen this demoed on a screencastsonline show, it's called The
Unarchiver, it seems to handle everything I've ever heard of,
including rar files.
