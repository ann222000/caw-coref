&quot;George W. Bush is the imperial president that James Madison and other
founders of this great republic warned us about. He lied the nation into
precisely the &quot;foreign entanglements&quot; that George Washington feared
would destroy our experiment in representative government, and he has
championed a spurious notion of security over individual liberty, thus
eschewing the alarms of Thomas Jefferson as to the deprivation of the
inalienable rights of free citizens. But most important, he has used the
sledgehammer of war to obliterate the separation of powers that James
Madison enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.&quot;

&quot;The problem is that the &quot;state of war&quot; in question here was an al Qaeda
attack on the United States that had nothing whatsoever to do with
Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Perhaps, to spare Congress the embarrassment of
formally declaring war against a nation that had not attacked America,
Bush settled for a loosely worded resolution supporting his use of
military power, if Iraq failed to comply with U.N. mandates. This was
justified by the White House as a means of strengthening the United
Nations in holding Iraq accountable for its weapons of mass destruction
arsenal, but as most of the world looked on in dismay, Bush invaded Iraq
after U.N. inspectors on the ground discovered that Iraq had no WMD.&quot;

As witnesses not of our intentions but of our conduct, we can be true or
false, and the hypocrite's crime is that he bears false witness against
himself. What makes it so plausible to assume that hypocrisy is the vice
of vices is that integrity can indeed exist under the cover of all other
vices except this one. Only crime and the criminal, it is true, confront
us with the perplexity of radical evil; but only the hypocrite is really
rotten to the core.

US steps closer to war with Iran :
The Bush administration has leaped toward war with Iran by, in essence,
declaring war with the main branch of Iran's military, the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which it plans to brand as a
terrorist organization.

A senior Iranian cleric said on Friday that plans by the United States

Do Americans care if America ends?
by Nancy Levant
August 17, 2007
http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/levant/070818

It's an interesting question, and one that I was asked today. I have
pondered the question for years, and have come to the conclusion that
those born after the mid to late 1960's are not patriotic citizens by
the same definition as those born prior to the 60's. In fact, I've heard
many 20, 30, and even 40-somethings claim that they held no particular
allegiance to the United States, as they consider their country to be
Imperialistic, dishonest, exploitative, and devious.

But we older citizens must realize that the younger generations have not
had the benefit of time, wisdom, and many have not had the experience of
warfare and soldiering. Nor have they had the benefit of an educational
system that taught &quot;Republic&quot; vs. &quot;Democracy.&quot; They believe their
country to be a democracy, and at the same time, know very well that it
is not. They have also been raised on a steady dose of unscrupulous and
lying governance, and this they know, as well.

Younger generations are not enamored with Capitalism, politics,
democracy, or faith. Today's younger generations are largely atheistic
and disgusted with leadership, religion, and their lies. Sometimes we
tend to think they are simply disinterested and apathetic, but the fact
is, they are all too savvy when it comes to the sick joke of
aristocratic governance.

The older generations, the ones who spearheaded the globalist protest
movement, are also disappointed people. We were betrayed by the ones we
elected — betrayed. It's a bitter pill to swallow, because much like our
younger countrymen, we did not act responsibly with our freedoms. We
took them for granted, and then became enamored of televised entities,
which turned out to be liars, thieves, cheaters, and conquerors. We also
raised and supported the fully corrupt 2-Party system.

We, the older generations, and the largest voting body in America,
elected and re-elected the men and women who, year by year, Executive
Order after Executive Order, Act by Act, disassembled the united States
of America and the American Constitution. And now, the younger
generations think of us as ignorant, manipulated, and corrupted fools.
Truth hurts, doesn't it?

The Greatest Generation and the Baby Boomers have a heavy burden to
bear, because it was under our watch that the deceivers smiled and
grinned their way into full-blown destruction mode. We elected the
Socialist globalists into our nation's most powerful positions, or to
put it more honestly and plainly, we elected the Trilateral Commission
and the Council on Foreign Relations over and over and over again, to
our economic and historic demise.

Equally, and in many ways, the Greatest Gen and the Boomers sold their
souls for appearances, credit, retirement, and in imitation of the
elite. It's a sad state of affairs, a bitter story, and a guilt that is
undeniable. But, forward we must go, and we need our youth to help us,
though they have every substantial reason not to trust our intellects,
our politics, or our decisions. After all, we dumped this terrible mess
on their shoulders and told them they were living the good life. Now
they are paying the price for our ignorance with their lives in foreign
nations. America did not start corroding 5 years ago. It's been
corroding for nearly 100 years, and that places the blame and the burden
on us. We were supposed to prize, cherish, and protect our freedom. We
were supposed to take care of our nation. Instead, we stood 100% behind
her destroyers. Many of us still do.

Many younger Americans believe America needs to change — completely and
permanently. Hence, the Socialists, who were always around our corners,
simply walked in and set up shop — as in the entire American public
school system and the &quot;environmental,&quot; land-stealing, land trust
movement. And many of the mid to upper-middle class Americans,
particularly those who instantly fell for the &quot;eco-friendly&quot; and policed
communities, are so financially polluted that they can think of nothing
but their dire straits, their pathological youth sports addictions, and
their pretend country clubs and day-spas. In my book, these people are
out to lunch, vacant, and unreachable. Equally, they live in America's
forthcoming wasteland (and I do mean forthcoming).

Again, I say to the Greatest Generation and the Boomers, we have an
impossible task before us — the United Nations, the World Bank, the
World Trade Organization, Agenda 21 and sustainability, the global land
trust scams, corporate and financial dictatorship, a fully ignorant and
gullible American population, and so very many global enemies — of
which, now, we know why. What are the chances to regain our Republic and
our Constitution, while we face &quot;internationalized&quot; policing forces,
super viruses, and breaking news pandemics? Slim chances...but try, we
must. America was slaughtered under our watch. She was.

So, the original question — do American people care if America ends?
Today, I'd say the answer is 50/50 at best, but that may be another
stupid assumption on this gray-haired lady's part. God knows I've made
more foolish political assumptions than this, but to my countrymen of
all ages, let us disappoint them, for they have always counted on our
ignorance, our apathy, our cultural addictions, and their media. We must
disappoint them. We have no choice. And to our younger American
generations, please accept our sincerest apologies. We were wrong —
albeit manipulated — and incredibly stupid. Please, don't follow suit.

(We have) The president we were warned about
Bush is above the law and accountability
by Robert Scheer
July 18, 2007
http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/18/EDGNNQ505C1.DTL

George W. Bush Bush is the imperial president that James Madison and
other founders of this great republic warned us about. He lied the
nation into precisely the &quot;foreign entanglements&quot; that George Washington
feared would destroy our experiment in representative government, and he
has championed a spurious notion of security over individual liberty,
thus eschewing the alarms of Thomas Jefferson as to the deprivation of
the inalienable rights of free citizens. But most important, he has used
the sledgehammer of war to obliterate the separation of powers that
James Madison enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.

With the &quot;war on terror,&quot; Bush has asserted the right of the president
to wage war anywhere and for any length of time, at his whim, because
the &quot;terrorists&quot; will always provide a convenient shadowy target. Just
the &quot;continual warfare&quot; that Madison warned of in justifying the primary
role of Congress in initiating and continuing to finance a war -- the
very issue now at stake in Bush's battle with Congress.

In his &quot;Political Observations,&quot; written years after he had served as
fourth president of the United States, Madison went on to underscore the
dangers of an imperial presidency bloated by war fever. &quot;In war,&quot;
Madison wrote in 1795, at a time when the young republic still faced its
share of dangerous enemies, &quot;the discretionary power of the executive is
extended ... and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those
of subduing the force, of the people.&quot;

How remarkably prescient of Madison to anticipate the specter of our
current King George, who imperiously is undermining Congress' attempts
to end the Iraq war. When the prime author of the U.S. Constitution
explained why that document grants Congress -- not the president -- the
exclusive power to declare and fund wars, Madison wrote that &quot;The
delegation of such powers [to the president] would have struck, not only
at the fabric of our Constitution, but at the foundation of all well
organized and well checked governments.&quot;

Because &quot;No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual
warfare,&quot; Madison urged that the constitutional separation of powers he
had codified be respected. &quot;The Constitution expressly and exclusively
vests in the Legislature the power of declaring a state of war ... the
power of raising armies,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The separation of the power of
raising armies from the power of commanding them is intended to prevent
the raising of armies for the sake of commanding them.&quot;

That last sentence perfectly describes the threat of what President
Dwight Eisenhower would describe 165 years later as the
&quot;military-industrial complex,&quot; a permanent war economy feeding off a
permanent state of insecurity. The collapse of the Soviet Union deprived
the military profiteers and their cheerleaders in the government of a
raison d'être for the enormous war economy supposedly created in
response to it.

Fortunately for them, Bush found in the 9/11 attack an excuse to make
war even more profitable and longer lasting. The Iraq war, which the
president's 9/11 commission concluded never had anything to do with the
terrorist assault, nonetheless has transferred many hundreds of billions
in taxpayer dollars into the military economy. And when Congress seeks
to exercise its power to control the budget, this president asserts that
this will not govern his conduct of the war.

There never was a congressional declaration of war to cover the invasion
of Iraq. Instead, President Bush acted under his claimed power as
commander in chief, which the Supreme Court has held does allow him to
respond to a &quot;state of war&quot; against the United States. That proviso was
clearly a reference to surprise attacks or sudden emergencies.

The problem is that the &quot;state of war&quot; in question here was an al Qaeda
attack on the United States that had nothing whatsoever to do with
Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Perhaps, to spare Congress the embarrassment of
formally declaring war against a nation that had not attacked America,
Bush settled for a loosely worded resolution supporting his use of
military power, if Iraq failed to comply with U.N. mandates. This was
justified by the White House as a means of strengthening the United
Nations in holding Iraq accountable for its weapons of mass destruction
arsenal, but as most of the world looked on in dismay, Bush invaded Iraq
after U.N. inspectors on the ground discovered that Iraq had no WMD.

Bush betrayed Congress, which in turn betrayed the American people --
just as Madison feared when he wrote: &quot;Of all the enemies of public
liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises
and develops the germ of every other.&quot;
