Did anyone notice how long it took James to realize that Schuey had
blown up.  Schuey was practically out of the car before James spit out
one word.

Probably because he was on a break as ITV were at the time. Lots more
coverage on the rerun program then the same coverage with James Allen again
after the break. I wonder if they did the commentary for new bits after the
race?

Are you in the UK? In the live transmission, we (in the UK) found out
Schumey had gone out after a break, so I assume it happened during the
break. Perhaps he was waiting for them to come back from a break before he
spoke? Perhaps they've changed the breaks in the 'delayed' transmission so
that it didn't happen during one of them?

up.

They always re-do the commentary after the race - for the highlights
show.  Watch it and you'll be surprised when you see James Allen being
spot-on with his facts and figures when he'd made a real gaff of them
in the live race (like stating the wrong driver had retired etc....)

In Spain, we saw Albers' car break during a break (in the small window
where they keep the race) and I thought it was Michaels' (well, the
Spykers and the Ferraris do look alike), but pity, it wasn't his car.

Then we saw live Schumacher's motor blow up. You should hear the remarks
of the commentators (die hard Alonso fans) :-)

He's just biased, horrifically so. Even called his son Enzo.  You do
have to feel some sympathy for the poor child - a cretin for a father
and a name like that... And Allen was the author of the comically-titled
"Michael Schumacher: The Quest For Redemption" (which was for many
years available for 99p or less in remaindered bookshops everywhere),
a wafer-thin and semi-literate piece of schufausxi apologetics based
around the 1998 season. Mind you, he's got a track record as an
author - he also ghosted Nigel Mansell's autobiography, and a book
more full of lies and misinterpretations of the truth I've yet to
read.

Put bluntly, James Allen is a sycophantic dickwad who adds nothing to
ITV's TV coverage apart from hot air.

James Allen's commentary can be avoided by listening to the BBC 5 Live
coverage. You do miss Martin Brundle, but losing Allen's onanistic drivel
more than makes up for it.

Well not everyone likes the ramming we usually see from schumacher, but in
theory schumacher can still ram Alonso damage his car and win the DWC, so
maybe James's upset was premature ? Maybe him and schumacher can punch the
air together when a broken Renault wishbone comes to the screen.

Alas, in the colonies here we don't have as preferable a choice: either Vic

and Martin Brundle show, or Bob Varsha and Co. on Speed Channel. Yum.

Mind you, the thought of some poor bastard with the name of Enzo Allen is

like Dave, and the perspective to appreciate it.

Then you are speaking of the race, not of the championship. Yes, I would
have preferred Alonso to overtake MS and win on the track in Japan.

But for the championship, I think it's only fair that the bad luck (I
mean, the part that Kimi doesn't keep for himself) is shared between the
two teams and drivers.

Wouldn't you consider disappointing that the championship were won
thanks to a clumsy mechanic, that managed by himself to strip Alonso of
12 points?

I met the poor little bugger with his parents at Johnny's karting
event. He seemed to be able to cope with it. Mind you, he wasn't 12
months old then. I can already see the 5 year old Williams and McLaren
fans taking the piss when he starts school...

Dave is a good name, that's a given...

&gt;&gt; Did anyone notice how long it took James to realize that Schuey had blown
&gt;&gt; up.  Schuey was practically out of the car before James spit out one word.

&gt;Probably because he was on a break as ITV were at the time. Lots more
&gt;coverage on the rerun program then the same coverage with James Allen again
&gt;after the break. I wonder if they did the commentary for new bits after the
&gt;race?

I actually dozed off for 15 minutes or so and then there it was,
Michael, engine failure. Pinched myself but it was no nightmare...

No. Just before ITV cut to the break, we caught a flash of a red car with a
plume of smoke coming out of the back, as it entered Degna 1.

&gt; I noticed a massive difference in the tone of his voice for the remainder
&gt; of the race, is he an ex Ferrari/FIAT employee or something ? He seems to
&gt; be overly complementry to the orange team, almost biased.

James worships the ground Schumacher walks on. It's fun to listen out for
Martin's responses - or (usually) complete silence on the matter.

I understand that F1 commentary specifically *isn't* available outside
the UK, though. I'm sure someone with an appropriately (mis)configured
realaudio proxy could work around that...
