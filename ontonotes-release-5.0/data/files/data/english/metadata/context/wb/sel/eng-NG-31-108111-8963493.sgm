Thank you Jack!  I was hoping I could post pictures of my own dogs too, just
in case anyone was interested in what they look like.

The one with the little boy, my grandson Jake, is Gracie.  The big goofy one
blue eye, one brown-eyed one is the infamous Merlin The Stubborn, and the
black dog is my beloved, now deceased,  Murphy-dog, was we lovingly referred
to her.

Why thank you Maui, although I have to say, if you really want *cute*, that
would be early pictures of my twin grandsons.  Now days, at 2 1/2 yrs., they
are known as *double trouble.*   But those early photo's of 'em, laying in a
crib and gazing at each other, those are cute.  ;-)    I found them little
tee shirts a couple months ago.  They say  &quot;My Name Is Trouble, Don't Make
Me Prove It!&quot;   Robin loved 'em.   I've got to get more photo's of Merlin.
He's goofy as all get out, but he's also beautiful.  In the neighborhood,
he's known as 'that pretty dog'.

Thanks, beth.  My two favorite *people* in the world.

Yes, it's a light, clear blue.  I told ya he was goofy looking.  That's the
photo I saw of him on criagslist.  Something about that face, expression.  I
kept going back to it, looking at it, knowing &quot;I've got to have that dog!&quot;

Me too, all the time.  Jake took me in to see the pups the other day and
asked me 'what is *you* favorite?'   I said I didn't know yet, and he said
'Dat is *my* favorite', pointing at the all black one.  I think I mentioned
his name for Kali is *murphy*, so naturally I guess, his favorite pup is the
all black one.  Robin wants to keep one of the darker brown pups, but Jake
is persistent about the all black one being his favorite.  So we shall see.

It's hard right now to tell, because their eyes aren't open yet, and
although they do display a tiny bit of personality, it's not enough to
really tell.  My first instinct though, is the darker of the two that look
like tiny little boxers.  One of them has a bit darker strip down the back
of his head and onto his back.  For some reason, he's the one I gravitate
towards.  That's the same one Robin likes too.  Although, it was the all
black one who was splayed out on her back yesterday, looking so damn cute.
The others were still sleeping on their stomaches, all four legs pulled in
tight looking like baby seals.

Little Hoss is a cutie pie too.  So laid back and has just an adorable
little face and pink nose.
