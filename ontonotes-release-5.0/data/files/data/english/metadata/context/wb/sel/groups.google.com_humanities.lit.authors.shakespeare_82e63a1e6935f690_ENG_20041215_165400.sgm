The Rape of Lucrece Stanza 135

'Time's glory is to calm contending kings,
To unmask falsehood and bring TRUTH to light,
To stamp the SEAL of time in aged things,
To wake the morn and sentinel the night,

SEAL

&lt;&lt;An incidental allusion in one of St. Augustine's letters (217 to
Victorinus) lets us know that he used a SEAL. The practice spread and
it seems to be taken for granted by CLOVIS at the very beginning of the
Merovingian period. At first they were only used for securing the
document from impertinent curiosity and the SEAL was commonly attached
to the ties with which it was fastened. When the letter was opened by
the addressee the SEAL was necessarily broken. Later the SEAL served as
an authentication and was attached to the face of the document. The deed
was thus only held to be valid so long as the SEAL remained intact.&gt;&gt;

Meroveus 400? - 458

&lt;&lt;The legendary founder of the dynasty of Merovingians. As first honest
king in our regions, he was the father of Childéric and the grandfather
of CLOVIS. He reigned from Tournai which became the capital of his
kingdom. His father, Clodion the Hairy, was pushed back by the Roman
General Aetius and had to stop his expansion towards the South. The
Romans, conscious of their military weakness, found it judicious to
recruit these former barbarians to defend the lines. This is how the
Francs settled along the border of the empire, in the South of the
Netherlands and the North of current Belgium. A rather peaceful
vicinity resulted from it and, when Aetius beat Huns of Attila
on the Catalaunic Fields in 451, he could count
on the support of Mérovée and his troops.&gt;&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;One of the great Merovingian kings, CLOVIS, struck a deal with the
newly nascent Roman church. He would subdue their enemies, the
Arian Visigoths and the pagan Lombards, in return for baptism into
the faith and recognition of his right to rule a new Roman empire as
&quot;Novus Constantinus.&quot; Yet one of his descendants, Dagobert II, was
murdered by A LANCE PIERCED THROUGH HIS EYE
(or POISON POURED IN THE EAR -- accounts vary)
at the orders of Pepin. The church endorsed the assassination,
flatly betrayed its pact with CLOVIS, and in turn recognized the family
of usurpers as legitimate, culminating with the crowning of Charlemagne
as Holy Roman Emperor. It was thought that the Merovingian lineage was
extinguished; in any case it was excised from the history books. But
there is some evidence that Dagobert's son, Siegebert IV, survived and
that a Merovingian principality continued to be ruled in Septimania by
Guillem de Gellone, a descendant &amp; ancestor of GODROI de BOUILLION.&gt;&gt;

Window to 'CLOVIS's' Altered Past

&lt;&lt;This image taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit shows a rock
outcrop dubbed &quot;CLOVIS.&quot; The rock was discovered to be softer than
other rocks studied so far at Gusev Crater after the rover easily ground
a hole (center) into it with its rock abrasion tool. An analysis of the
interior of the hole with the rover's alpha particle X-ray spectrometer
found higher concentrations of sulfur, bromine &amp; chlorine
compared to basaltic, or volcanic, rocks at Gusev.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;This might indicate that CLOVIS was chemically altered, and
that fluids once flowed through the rock depositing these elements.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;This spectrum, taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit's Mössbauer
spectrometer, shows the presence of an iron-bearing mineral called
GOETHITE in a rock called &quot;CLOVIS&quot; in the &quot;Columbia Hills&quot; of Mars.
GOETHITE contains water in the form of hydroxyl as a part of its
structure. By identifying this mineral, the examination of CLOVIS
produced strong evidence for past water activity [on Mars].&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Pictured above, the path of the robot rover Spirit on Mars can be
traced far into the distance. Spirit has now crossed kilometers of
plains covered with rocks and sand, approached the lip of a crater
200-meters across, and climbed a series of hills. The recent
discovery of GOETHITE, a mineral only known to form on Earth
in the presence of water, bolsters the case.&gt;&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Johann Wolfgang von GOETHE (August 28, 1749 - March 22, 1832) was a
German writer, politician, humanist, scientist, and philosopher. As a
writer, GOETHE was one of the paramount figures of German literature
and European Romanticism during and around the 18th and 19th century.
GOETHE was the author of Faust and Theory of Colors and inspired Darwin
with his independent discovery of the human premaxilla jaw bones.

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship (in German, Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre)
was a 1795 novel by GOETHE. While his The Sorrows of Young Werther,
his breakthrough success the previous year, featured a hero driven
to suicide by despair, the hero of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
went through quite the opposite journey: he went through a journey of
self-realization that led to an actualized adulthood. The story centers
upon Wilhelm's attempt to escape the restrictions placed upon his life
and find life as a writer and actor. Stories of this kind became very
influential, and later books created upon this pattern are called
Bildungsromans (stories of growth). GOETHE wrote an 1821 sequel,
titled Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre (Wilhelm Meister's Travels).

It is difficult to overstate the importance of GOETHE on the 19th
century in this era. In many respects, he was the originator of - or at
least the first to cogently express - many ideas which would, in time,
become familiar. GOETHE produced volumes of poetry, essays, criticism,
and scientific work, including a theory of optics and early work on
evolution and linguistics. He was fascinated by minerals and early
mineralogy (the mineral GOETHITE is named for him). As a philosopher
and writer he is one of the key figures in the transition from the
Enlightenment to Romanticism.

The short epistolary novel, Die Leiden des jungen Werther, or The
Sorrows of Young Werther, published in 1774 recounts an unhappy love
affair that ends in suicide. GOETHE admitted that he &quot;shot his hero to
save himself&quot;. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and is
referenced frequently in the context of the young disaffected and moody
hero - a Romeo figure. However, the form of the novel, and the ending in
death, were not uncommon in the day. It was the untrammeled expression
of longing for the unattainable which made it controversial, and also a
model for other novels and works.

The next work, his epic poem Faust, was to be completed in stages, and
only published in its entirety after GOETHE's death. The first part was
published in 1808 and created a sensation. The first operatic version,
by Spohr, appeared in 1814, and was subsequently the inspiration for
operas by Gounod, Boito and Busoni, as well as symphonies by Liszt and
Mahler. Faust became the ur-myth of many figures in the 19th century.
The basic plot of &quot;selling one's soul to the devil&quot; for power over the
physical world took on increasing importance and became a metaphor
for the victory of technology and industrialism and its human cost.

He was also widely quoted. Epigrams such as

&quot;Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he
must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him.&quot; and

&quot;Divide and rule, a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one&quot; and

The famous line from the drama &quot;Götz von Berlichingen&quot; (&quot;Er kann mich
im Arsche lecken&quot; - &quot;He can lick my arse&quot;) has become a vulgar idiom in
many languages and shows GOETHE's deep cultural impact extending
across social, national and linguistic borders. It may be taken as another
measure of his fame that other well-known quotations, like Hippocrates'

GOETHE's influence was dramatic because he understood that there was
a transition in European sensibilities, an increasing focus on sense, on
the indescribeable and the emotional. This is not to say that he was
emotionalist or excessive; quite the contrary: he preached restraint and
felt that excess was a disease. &quot;There is nothing worse than imagination
without taste.&quot; He argued that law developed out of the depth of a
people's culture and their connectedness to the land they live on, and
therefore rational laws could not be imposed effectively from above:
an interpretation that placed him in direct opposition to those who
attempted to form &quot;enlightened&quot; monarchies based on &quot;rational&quot; laws, for
example Joseph II of Austria or, later, Napoleon as emperor of France.

This change would, in time, become the basis for 19th century thought -
organic rather than geometrical, evolving rather than created, and based
on sensibility and intuition, rather than on imposed order. This makes
him, along with Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, Ludwig van Beethoven a
figure in both worlds. On one hand, devoted to the sense of taste, order
and finely crafted detail which is the hallmark of the artistic sense of
the Age of Reason and the neo-classical period of architecture, and on
the other, seeking a personal, intuitive and personalized form of
expression and polity, and believing firmly in self-regulating and
organic systems. Philosophers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson would take up
many of the same ideas in the 1800's. His ideas on evolution would frame
the question which Darwin and Wallace would provide the answers to.

&quot;You must be either the master or the servant, the hammer or the anvil.&quot;

&quot;Know thyself? If I knew myself, I'd run away.&quot;

&quot;When ideas fail, words come in very handy.&quot;

&quot;Men err as long as they strive.&quot;

&quot;There are two things children should get from their parents:
roots and wings.&quot;
