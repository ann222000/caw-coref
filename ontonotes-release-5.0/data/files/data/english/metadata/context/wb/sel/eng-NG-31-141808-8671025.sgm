GAUGING GROWTH: HOW TO JUDGE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND
Many policymakers feel pressure to claim that No Child Left Behind (NCLB)
is boosting student performance as Congress reconsiders the federal
government’s role in school reform. But how should politicians and
activists gauge NCLB’s effects? In the recent issue of Educational
Researcher, Bruce Fuller, Joseph Wright, Kathryn Gesicki, and Erin Kang
offer evidence on three barometers of student performance, drawing from
the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and state data
spanning 1992-2006. Focusing on the performance of fourth graders, where
gains have been strongest since the early 1970s, the authors find that
earlier test score growth has largely faded since enactment of NCLB in
2002. Gains in math achievement have persisted in the post-NCLB period,
albeit at a slower rate of growth. Performance in many states continues
to apparently climb. But the bar defining proficiency is set much lower
in most states, compared with the NAEP definition, and the disparity
between state and federal results has grown since 2001. Progress seen in
the 1990s in narrowing achievement gaps has largely disappeared in the
post-NCLB era. The fact that student performance has generally reached a
plateau raises the crucial question as to whether standards-based
accountability is sufficient to advance more effective and equitable
schools. The very slow rise in reading proficiency over the past 15 years
remains worrisome as well, especially when compared with the more robust
gains in mathematics, notwithstanding the slowing growth rate post-NCLB.
Recent analyses have sparked debate over whether the states can be
trusted to devise reliable gauges of achievement, particularly in how
they define proficient levels of achievement. Some reformers are calling
for national examinations, presumably pegged to standards set by the NAEP
governing board.

Summer of Fate

[IMAGE][ www.asbj.com/MainMenuCategory/Archive/2007/CurrentIssue/SummerofFate.... ]

On a sweltering July evening in 1967, Detroit police descended upon an
illegal saloon in one of the city’s largest black neighborhoods -- and
unwittingly unleashed a maelstrom. As a small crowd of onlookers
gathered, years of simmering racial and economic tensions -- fueled by
housing discrimination, rampant unemployment, and police harassment --
suddenly boiled over.

Angry men jeered and threw bottles and rocks. Others broke into a nearby
store. As word spread of events, the crowd swelled into the thousands --
and eventually whipped itself into a frenzy of mayhem and destruction.

What followed was one of the most brutal riots in U.S. history. Over a
five-day period, more than 2,500 buildings were put to the torch.
Innocent citizens, along with rioters and police, were struck down by
gunfire. As streets lined with shops went up in flames, family fortunes
were destroyed and thousands of jobs lost forever. It took the deployment
of the National Guard and 82nd U.S. Airborne Division to restore order.
By then, 43 people were dead, hundreds were injured, and 7,200 were
arrested. Property damage exceeded $54 million.

What does this 40-year-old tragedy have to do with public education
today? Quite a lot, actually.

The violence in Detroit -- as well as similar unrest in Newark, N.J. and
more than 100 other cities in the mid-1960s -- was sparked by powerful
social and economic forces at the root of a decaying urban America. Those
forces, says Myron Orfield, executive director of the University of
Minnesota’s Institute on Race and Poverty, fueled “the very powerful,
palpable force of racial segregation” that undermined the financial
resources of city schools and, at the same time, presented them with an
increasingly impoverished and troubled student population to serve. All
of this, he notes, was a “body blow” to urban education.

Some will tell you the wounds of that brief, if terrible, period are long
healed. Others disagree. But it’s worth noting that the conditions that
sparked the violence still linger in many of the nation’s urban centers.
The influences of racism, poverty, blighted neighborhoods, joblessness,
and hopelessness continue to make themselves felt.

These influences reach into classrooms and hinder student achievement.
They affect policy decisions at all levels of government and explain why
school reform has proven so intransigent and insolvable. They are the
reason that Max Herman, author of Fighting in the Streets: Ethnic
Succession and Urban Unrest in 20th Century America, reminds us of the
obvious: “Schools do not exist in a vacuum.”

Poverty’s power

Not far from the epicenter of the 1967 riots, the old-style brick edifice
of Detroit’s Thirkell Elementary School shows its age. But its hallways
are clean and bright, and energy can be felt in the classrooms. Here,
children are learning: Although an inner-city school with all the
perceived stereotypes that implies, more than 87 percent of fifth-graders
meet state standards in reading and math.

In Michigan, so much criticism has been heaped on the Detroit Public
Schools -- years ago, then-Gov. John Engler called them “broken” and
“corrupt” -- that it’s easy to forget that some very good and innovative
schools exist. Students attending the Bates Academy, Burton International
School, Cass Technical High School, or the Detroit School of Arts, to
name a few -- get a good education.

For all the problems confronting city schools, suggests Thirkell
Principal Clara Smith, “the quality of students we are producing today in
Detroit is much greater than the quality they produced in the 1960s and
1970s.”

The same can be said for many urban school districts. According to the
National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 66 of the nation’s
largest city school systems have posted gains in fourth- and eighth-grade
math and reading since 2002. Yet, you can’t overlook the fact that,
alongside these successful students, thousands of others continue to fall
short academically.

Although some blame the schools for not doing more, the underlying reason
for urban education’s failures can be seen outside Thirkell’s doors. The
streets are lined by tired-looking houses with rotting eaves, dilapidated
roofs, and sagging porches. A few blocks away, the commercial streets are
equally forlorn, with empty sidewalks, boarded-up buildings, and empty
lots guarded by chain-link fences and razor wire.

Poverty has a long history in Detroit. In the first half of the 20th
century, black families migrated to the city in search of a better life
than they could find amid the Deep South’s institutionalized racism. But
they could not escape the racial attitudes of the day. Up north, they
were segregated into the city’s poorest housing, and unions and factory
owners often denied black workers anything but the most menial and
dangerous jobs. And there were never enough of those.

By 1967, with the exodus of industry already well under way to cheaper
regions of the country, poverty and unemployment were stark realities for
black Detroit. Some estimate that as many as a quarter of black men aged
18 to 27 were unemployed.

The 1967 riots hastened abandonment of the inner city, but the effects on
Detroit’s schools were minimal, says Alberta Martin, who served on the
school board during the 1970s and early 1980s. If anything, Martin says,
the schools served as an important bulwark against the social and
economic trends buffeting the city at that time.

“It was not an easy situation,” she recalls. “But the children received a
good education.”

The full effects of the city’s declining economy and increasing
concentration of poverty gradually took hold. As the 1980s unfolded,
neighborhood blight, crime, and drug abuse frayed Detroit’s social
fabric, and in families that had known only poverty for generations, the
needs of children grew exponentially. With city social services
under-funded to the breaking point, schools found themselves on the front
line in serving children in great need -- and found themselves woefully
short funded to meet the challenge.

This is not a revelation to anyone in education. But a few miles from
Thirkell, the Rev. Richard Wilson of Tried Stone Baptist Church operates
an alternative school for hundreds of high school dropouts seeking a
second chance. He knows all too well about the effect of crime, drug
abuse, domestic violence, and pregnancy on young people, and he cannot
make sense of the lack of outrage among policymakers -- particularly
among those on the school board.

“If we’re not going to do something about the social ills facing these
kids,” Wilson says, “then how do we think these kids are going to be able
to embrace their education?”

Money talks

It’s questionable whether the nation has ever had the political will to
tackle the social ills that drag upon urban education. President
Johnson’s war on poverty fell victim to the cost of the Vietnam War, and
later federal anti-poverty initiatives were curbed by a political
backlash against affirmative action, entitlement programs, and the
“undeserving poor.”

President Bush called education the great civil rights issue of the 21st
century, but since 9/11, the federal government’s focus has been the war
on terror. To date, funding for the No Child Left Behind Act has fallen
$43.5 billion below what was originally authorized.

Some critics argue that more money isn’t the answer. Since the 1967
riots, billions in state and federal dollars have been invested in the
nation’s inner cities, but urban renewal, public housing, and economic
development programs have proven ineffective as a counterweight to
poverty or the social problems that flourish in impoverished
neighborhoods. The same can be said of Title I funding, which certainly
has made a huge difference in the education of urban students -- but has
not been enough to raise academic performance to that of their more
affluent suburban peers.

But, most urban school policymakers would argue, more money would help.
It costs more to educate students in an environment of poverty, high
mobility, and, in more recent years, limited English proficiency. Yet the
financial resources of urban schools rarely have matched those of their
suburban counterparts.

Where the riots were followed by severe enrollment declines, cities such
as Detroit saw revenue fall as the need for social workers, nurses,
tutors, and other support personnel soared. The Rev. Jimmy Womack,
president of the Detroit School Board, puts it bluntly: “We need
additional funding.”

Ultimately, educators say, schools can only do so much. The long-term
success of urban education is closely tied to the health of a city’s
economy. Study after study has shown that family income is a key
predictor of a student’s academic success, so until some success is
achieved in breaking the cycle of inner-city poverty, the ideal of No
Child Left Behind is a pipedream.

“You can improve schools, but those reforms are limited by things outside
the schools,” says Alan R. Sadovnik, professor of education, sociology,
and public affairs at Rutgers University. “If you don’t ... have an urban
policy that seeks to improve the quality of life for city residents, then
urban school reform is limited.”

The odds may be stacked against such efforts. Past racial attitudes still
shape today’s political environment. When white families left the cities,
the lines of segregation simply moved from neighborhoods to town
boundaries -- a more legally defensible and politically palatable
solution. This state of affairs perpetuates racial and economic
segregation while encouraging competition for resources that poorer
communities are ill-equipped to win.

“When you have 100 school districts in the metro area fighting for their
lives ... they’re all trying to exclude the poor and steal someone else’s
shopping mall” because of the tax base, Orfield says. “They want the mall
but not the people.” It ends up, he says, in a race to the bottom for the
poorer school districts. “It really crushes the African-American and
Latino kids, and it crushes the central cities.”

Some communities, such as Charlotte, N.C., and Nashville, have somewhat
managed to sidestep this problem by consolidating the city and county
school systems, but such solutions are the exception. The last real
opportunity to break the political and economic barrier on a nationwide
level came in 1975, Orfield says, when the federal district court ruled
that the only way to truly integrate the Detroit schools was with a
regional desegregation plan. But the U.S. Supreme Court overruled that
proposal in Milliken v. Bradley, a decision that he says was
“devastating.”

“It threw a cordon around the city, cutting the suburbs off from the
poor, and the cities became more deeply poor and deeply segregated,”
Orfield says.

Divergent paths

On a sunny morning in Newark, N.J., the streets surrounding First Avenue
School are alive with the sound of laughter. Older students talk in
tightly clustered groups as they make their way down the sidewalks; the
youngest grip the hands of mothers or older siblings as they head to the
school doors. On street corners, crossing guards shepherd this youthful
mob, warmly greeting the children as they pass and shouting out the
occasional stern warning to those straying too close to the curb.

It’s a cheerful scene -- and an appropriate one -- even though Newark
still has not shaken the traumas of its past. Less than a week before the
Detroit riots, three days of violence in Newark left 23 dead and caused
$10 million in property damage.

Today, four decades hence, there is cautious optimism about the future.
Mayor Cory Booker is trying to revive Newark’s economy, tackle a serious
crime problem, and encourage new downtown development. Of course, such
hopes have been raised before in the past two decades -- and proved
disappointing.

There also is cautious hope for the city schools. Much has been written
about the state’s takeover of Newark’s notoriously mismanaged school
district. But the more important state intervention came from the courts,
which in Abbott v. Burke mandated that per-pupil expenditures in the
state’s poorest districts should be equivalent to those of the wealthier
suburbs. That influx of money has allowed Newark to expand its
intervention efforts and attempt to counter some of the social and
economic deprivations that have dragged at student performance since the
1960s.

“Several years ago, you didn’t see the kinds of instructional supplies
and materials that we wanted in a classroom ... that allowed children to
learn better,” says Deputy Superintendent Anzella K. Nelms. The
Abbott money “has allowed us to build up our use of technology. It’s
allowed us to have social workers in every school. We can deal with many
social ills, family concerns, student concerns, and community concerns
that children bring into the school.”

That’s not to say that all is rosy. Many Newark students still struggle
academically. Street crime threatens students on the way to and from
school. Test scores have risen in recent years, but one in three children
live in poverty, and scores still lag behind the suburbs. As worrisome,
the state did not increase Abbott funds this year, leaving the city with
a loss in state aid after inflation is taken into account -- and some in
the state are complaining that the school system isn’t getting enough
results for the eye-raising $17,974 it spends annually on every child.

Some see that as a veiled attack on Abbott, which gets its funds through
the taxes of wealthier communities. School board member Felix Rouse
complains that critics -- always from predominately white, affluent
communities, he says -- seem unwilling to acknowledge the district’s huge
challenges or give Newark more time to show results.

“People want to see so much dramatic progress in five years, but it took
decades and decades of benign neglect of the cities to get where we are,”
he says. “No one cared about these children then. I didn’t hear them
complaining when the city wasn’t getting the money it deserved.”

At least Newark has money to fight over. Detroit policymakers also have
hopes for the city’s urban revitalization efforts, but the stark reality
is that the Michigan economy is still struggling -- and the city’s
population continues to slide. That, along with generous state school
choice and charter school laws, has cost the city school system nearly
60,000 students in the past decade -- including 14,000 who abandoned
Detroit’s city schools after a 16-day teacher strike last fall. The newly
elected school board, which assumed office last year after five years of
state control, is closing dozens of schools to make up a $215 million
budget deficit.

It’s the kind of turmoil that city leaders would have preferred to have
left behind 40 years ago. But Womack says the school board will continue
to fight. “Until we’re able to get more funding ... we’re going to do the
best with our children that we can.”

The legacy of history

For older residents of Detroit and Newark, those terrible days of 1967
are a distant memory. For the young, the 1960s are ancient history. Yet
the scars of that period can still be seen.

In Detroit, grassy lots line Twelfth Street, once-prized real estate
that’s gone untouched since rioters burned down the shops that made up
its commercial strip. In Newark, empty lots and dilapidated buildings
stand as silent witness to the city’s violent past. It also can be seen
in the lives that many city children live.

In the short term, the fate of the cities -- and their schoolchildren --
isn’t likely to change. Many students are trapped in the same poverty as
those angry young men who rioted 40 years ago. The harsh reality is that
many will not succeed academically -- and their schools cannot change
that.

But, on a hopeful note, the dedication of teachers, administrators, and
school board members hasn’t changed either. They’re not giving up on
their students, and despite the challenges, they will ensure that tens of
thousands of students will get a good education -- and earn their chance
at the American Dream. That also is a lesson from history that should not
be forgotten.

The Blurred Line

A half century after the Central High School protests, Little Rock still
struggles with issues of politics and race

Fifty years ago, it was obvious where the racial lines were drawn in
Little Rock, Ark. It took federal troops to escort the first nine black
students past an angry white mob protesting the integration of the city’s
Central High School.

Today, the lines are more blurred: This summer, the city’s school board
voted 4-3 along racial lines to oust its black superintendent -- but it
was the black majority that gave him the boot while white board members
rallied on his behalf.

Exactly what this vote says about race relations in Little Rock -- and
its influence on education policy -- depends upon whom you talk to. Some
suggest the dispute was about the division of political power, and the
vote highlights how the city’s various constituency groups fall along
racial lines. Others suggest board members voted their personal views
about the district’s leadership, but those views are influenced by vastly
different life experiences.

Katherine Wright Knight, who steps down this summer as president of the
Little Rock Classroom Teachers Association, suggests the vote has
garnered so much attention because last fall’s election gave the school
board its first black majority in history -- and the white community
hasn’t come to terms with that.

“The votes along racial lines ... it’s always been that way,” she says.
“The difference is, it’s not significant when the decisions are being
made by whites as opposed to African Americans.”

A discordant note

The debate over Superintendent Roy Brooks, who was hired in 2004 by a
white-majority school board, has played out against the backdrop of the
city’s historic role in school desegregation. In 1957, President
Eisenhower ordered federal troops to Little Rock after violent protests
against the integration of the school system. Older city residents still
remember the televised images of whites jeering at young blacks
surrounded by armed troops.

This year, the city was looking forward to celebrating how much has
changed over the years. Unlike many urban school districts, Little Rock
has retained a sizable white enrollment -- about one-quarter of its
26,000 students. This year, a federal judge released the school system
from federal monitoring of its desegregation efforts, and a special
commission has been planning activities to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the 1957 events.

Brooks’ ouster, however, has brought a discordant note to the
celebration. In the months prior to his removal, his opponents criticized
the district’s progress on student achievement and complained the
superintendent was brusque, a poor communicator, and hostile to elements
of the black community and the teachers union. Brooks’ supporters argued
that student performance had improved and that calls for his dismissal
were a response to politically unpopular staffing cuts that were
necessary to trim a bloated bureaucracy.

At some level, Brooks’ fate can be attributed to a more mundane problem:
an inability to build coalitions within the city’s various
constituencies. Two board members never supported Brooks’ hiring, and
during his tenure, the superintendent did not manage to win them over --
or avoid a rocky relationship with the teachers union. Last fall, with
union support, two new board members were elected -- giving the board its
first black majority and the anti-Brooks bloc a stronger position to seek
his removal.

As for the board’s split along racial lines, school board President
Katherine Mitchell says a partial explanation may lie in the information
board members were hearing. The effects of a district reorganization
conducted by Brooks fell disproportionately on black teachers and
administrators. Black parents in the inner city were more frustrated than
whites with conditions at their children’s schools and more impatient for
progress in boosting student achievement. Those teachers, administrators,
and parents felt more comfortable talking to black board members.

It’s little wonder, then, that black board members had a different
perspective of Brooks’ leadership, says Mitchell. “The only people who
supported Brooks were white people” who didn’t have personal experiences
with conditions in the inner-city school, she says. “So it was definitely
a separation or division in the community in that regard, simply because,
as I have said repeatedly, they don’t know what people in the inner-city
schools were suffering.”

In April, a majority of the board voted to begin dismissal proceedings
against Brooks. However, the dispute became more controversial when
Mitchell sent a letter to nine top administrators advising that their
status “may change during the next contract year should a new
superintendent be selected.” She also asked them “to refrain from taking
any action that would undermine the charges against Dr. Brooks.”

Mitchell later explained that state law required that administrators be
notified in advance of possible changes in their employment status in the
coming year. But Brooks apparently saw the letter as an attempt to
intimidate his staff, and he filed a lawsuit against the school board. A
judge dismissed the suit, and the school board subsequently opted, again
on 4-3 vote, to drop plans to suspend Brooks and instead buy out his
remaining contract at a cost that could reach between $400,000 to
$500,000.

Searching for stability

Some argue that patronage played its role in Brooks’ demise. The
superintendent’s decision earlier this year to cut about 100 jobs from
the payroll antagonized elements of the black community that, as reported
by the New York Times, “see the school system as an important source of
employment and middle-class stability.”

Jay P. Greene, head of the department of education reform at the
University of Arkansas, sees some truth in this assessment -- and
suggested that black board members were feeling some pressure to respond
to Brooks’ staffing decisions.

The school system “is a very attractive avenue for upward mobility and
middle-class employment for groups that were lacking in these
opportunities in the past,” he says. “What we’re seeing in Little Rock,
and what we unfortunately see in too many central cities, is that the
black leadership is torn between the demands of a middle class,
professional population that’s black and a student body that’s black and
whose interests may not be identical.”

Certainly, Brooks points to his reorganization efforts as a key factor in
his removal. “This is a city, but also a small community, and I think
people within the central administration who were displaced had long-time
friendships with some of the board members. And that created some
friction. I was hired as an agent of change ... and you face opposition
from people who for years and years had benefited from the status quo.”

Everyone in Little Rock has an opinion about what led to Brooks’
downfall. But it’s clear that attitudes about race muddied the debate.
Some members of the black community were suspicious about why some whites
rallied to Brooks’ cause when it became so obvious to them that the
superintendent had to go. The allegations of black patronage raised
concerns in the white community. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette didn’t shy
from coverage of the racial issues being discussed, and its motives and
perceived biases also came into question.

All of this was a shame, many agree. “It’s so racially charged that
people are afraid to fully engage in a debate about it out of fear of
being accused of being insensitive to the racial history of the city,”
says Greene.

Andre Guerrero, a community member who is serving on the Central High
School 50th Anniversary Committee, chooses to put a more optimistic spin
on the whole incident.

“For the first time, we have a black majority school board, and that
black majority is holding a black superintendent’s feet to the fire for
the lack of academic achievement of a black-majority, school-age
population.”

Most High-School Seniors Have At Least a Basic Understanding of
Economics, Study Finds
===============================================================

By LAUREN SMITH

A surprising eight out of 10 12th graders understand basic economics
concepts, according to a national study released on Wednesday.

&quot;Given the number of students who finish high school with limited
vocabulary, not reading well, and weak in math, the result may be as good
or better than we should expect,&quot; said Darvin M. Winick, chairman of the
National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees policy for the tests
conducted as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

The results are even more striking given that only one-third of states
require high-school students to complete an economics course to graduate.
Still, about 87 percent of high-school seniors reported some exposure to
economics in class.

A report [see executive suumary below] on the study
[ http://www.nationsreportcard.gov/economics_2006/ ], &quot;The Nation's Report
Card: Economics 2006: National Assessment of Educational Progress at
Grade 12,&quot; asked 11,500 12th graders in 590 public and private schools
last year questions about market economics, the national economy, and the
international economy. The students had racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic
characteristics that generally mirror American society. The results were
categorized into achievement levels of basic, proficient, and advanced,
as well as on a scale of 0 to 300 points. Seventy-nine percent of
students performed at or above the basic level, 42 percent reached the
proficient level, and 3 percent were advanced.

The average economic score of male students, 152, was four points higher
than that of female students, and more male students than female students
performed at the proficient and advanced levels. White and Asian/Pacific
Islander students scored 16 to 31 points higher, on average, than
African-American, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaskan Native students.
Hispanic students scored higher than African-American students by six
points, on average.

Students attending large city schools -- 14 percent of those tested --
had lower average scores than students at schools in middle-size cities,
large towns, and small towns. Students who reported higher levels of
parental education also scored higher.

&quot;I am pleased to see that our nation's economics report card is perhaps a
bit better than I would have guessed,&quot; said Gary H. Stern, president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and part of a five-member panel
that presented the report. &quot;We know that clear communication about public
policy and an economically well-educated public are crucial in sustaining
good monetary and regulatory policies and, in turn, a prosperous
economy.&quot;

The economics report card is a starting point, those on the panel said,
and there is plenty of room for improvement, both in teaching economics
in high school and in formulating the test's questions. Data collected on
the correlation between economics courses taken in high school and test
performance, for example, were described as an &quot;anomaly.&quot; While students
who participated in Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or
Honors economics courses in high school scored in the highest percentile,
students with no economics training did not score worst.

&quot;The results we have are puzzling,&quot; said Mark S. Schneider, commissioner
of the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education
Statistics, &quot;and we need some more work on this.&quot;

The next economics report card is slated for 2012.

Executive Summary

Knowledge of economics is important for individuals to function
effectively as citizens in an increasingly connected world economy.
Economic literacy includes understanding how economies and markets work,
what the benefits and costs of economic interaction and interdependence
are, and that people have to make choices because resources are limited.
In recent decades, the focus on economics content in the school
curriculum has increased.

Results

In this first NAEP assessment of economics at grade 12, the overall
average economics score, set at 150, fell within the Basic achievement
level. Seventy-nine percent of students performed at the Basic level or
higher, and 42 percent performed at the Proficient level or higher,
including 3 percent at the Advanced level. Results are based on a
nationally representative sample of 11,500 twelfth-grade students from
590 public and nonpublic high schools.

Some Key Findings Include

* The average economics score of male students was higher than the
average score of female students.

* White and Asian/Pacific Islander students scored higher, on average,
than other racial/ethnic groups.

* Students from large city schools had lower average scores than
students in other locations.

* Students whose parents had higher levels of education exhibited
higher performance in economics.

* Most students study some economics in high school.

Economics Content

Students answered questions representing a wide range of content from
three areas: market, national, and international economics. Market
economy—traditionally described as microeconomics—covers how individuals,
businesses, and institutions make decisions about allocating resources in
the marketplace. National economy—traditionally described as
macroeconomics—encompasses the sum of decisions made by individuals,
businesses, and government. International economy concentrates on
international trade—how individuals and businesses interact in foreign
markets. The questions described below and presented in this report
illustrate the knowledge and skills assessed in these three content
areas. The full assessment includes questions that cover a range of
topics and difficulty levels within each content area.

What students know about Economics

Market Economy
72% described a benefit and a risk of leaving a full-time job to further
one’s education
52% identified how commercial banks use money deposited into customers’
checking accounts
46% interpreted a supply and demand graph to determine the effect of
establishing a price control
36% used marginal analysis to determine how a business could maximize
its profits
National Economy
60% identified factors that lead to an increase in the national debt
36% identified the federal government’s primary source of revenue
33% explained the effect of an increase in real interest rates on
consumers’ borrowing
11% analyzed how a change in the unemployment rate affects income,
spending, and production
International Economy
63% determined the impact of a decrease in oil production on
oil-importing countries
51% determined a result of removing trade barriers between two countries
40% determined why industries can successfully lobby for tariff
protection
32% identified how investment in education can impact economic growth

THREE SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT MISTAKES (AND HOW TO AVOID THEM)
Despite having well-intentioned, thoughtful improvement plans, many
schools still struggle to raise student performance -- often because
their improvement efforts are doomed to failure from the very start by
three common, yet avoidable, mistakes. In the lead article of the latest
issue of Changing Schools, the free magazine from McREL, a Denver-based
nonprofit education research and development organization, Ceri Dean and
Bryan Goodwin assert that &quot;Mistake #1&quot; is &quot;treating the symptoms, not the
underlying problem.&quot; They write that, &quot;Everyone knows cough syrup doesn't
cure you; it just treats your symptoms. But all too often, like cough
syrup, school improvement plans attempt to treat the symptoms, but not
the root causes of low student achievement.&quot; The second mistake,
according to the authors, is &quot;Focusing only on tangibles and ignoring
intangibles.&quot; School culture, teacher attitudes and beliefs, and other
norms and values are at the heart of low school performance. Indeed,
recent McREL research suggests that a key distinction between high- and
low-performing schools is that high-performing schools work to create a
&quot;culture of high expectations.&quot; Finally, the authors warn against &quot;Biting
off more than you can chew.&quot; They note that instead of focusing on one or
two clearly defined efforts, many school improvement plans outline
sweeping efforts with multiple goals and several action items related to
each goal -- as many as 30-40 actions for a single year. &quot;That’s far too
many initiatives for school faculty and staff to keep in their heads or
take seriously. As a result, usually very little happens,&quot; conclude Dean
and Goodwin. The full article is available online at:

Some say schools giving Muslims special treatment

By Oren Dorell
USA TODAY

Some public schools and universities are granting Muslim requests for
prayer times, prayer rooms and ritual foot baths, prompting a debate on
whether Islam is being given preferential treatment over other religions.

The University of Michigan at Dearborn is planning to build foot baths
for Muslim students who wash their feet before prayer. An elementary
school in San Diego created an extra recess period for Muslim pupils to
pray.

At George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., Muslim students using a
&quot;meditation space&quot; laid out Muslim prayer rugs and separated men and
women in accordance with their Islamic beliefs.

Critics see a double standard and an organized attempt to push public
conformance with Islamic law.

&quot;What (school officials) are doing … is to give Muslim students religious
benefits that they do not give any other religion right now,&quot; says
Richard Thompson, president and chief counsel at the Thomas More Law
Center, an advocacy group for Christians.

Supporters of the accommodations say they are legal.

&quot;The whole issue is to provide for a religious foundation for those who
are observant while respecting separation of church and state,&quot; says
Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs
Council, based in Los Angeles. Many schools accommodate the Christian and
Jewish sabbaths and allow Jewish students to not take tests on religious
holidays, he says.

Barry Lynn, of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State,
says that the law is murky on these expressions of faith. And the
American Civil Liberties Union says overt religious symbols such as
crucifixes are not legal, but whether Muslim foot baths and prayer rugs
fall into that category is not clear.

&quot;That's a difficult one, and it's right on the edge,&quot; says Jeremy Gunn,
director of the ACLU program on freedom of religion and belief in
Washington, D.C.

At the forefront of the movement is the Muslim Students' Association,
which has formed a Muslim Accommodations Task Force to push for foot
baths and prayer rooms. At least 17 universities have foot baths built or
under construction, including Boston University, George Washington
University and Temple University, and at least nine universities have
prayer rooms for &quot;Muslim students only,&quot; including Stanford, Emory and
the University of Virginia, according to the MSA's website. The
association did not return calls seeking comment.

Zuhdi Jasser, a Muslim and chairman of the American Islamic Forum for
Democracy, which promotes separation of mosque and state, says he is
concerned about the accommodations. &quot;Unusual accommodations for one faith
at the cost of everybody else doesn't fall on the side of pluralism,&quot; he
said.

At George Mason University, non-Muslim students were asked to observe
Muslim rules in the prayer area, such as keeping men on one side and
women on the other and removing their shoes, according to Broadside, the
school newspaper. Alissa Karton, assistant to the vice president for
student life, said the article prompted the school to order students to
roll up prayer rugs when not in use and move the dividers.

The University of Michigan agreed to install foot baths after talks with
the MSA, said Terry Gallagher, director of public relations at the
campus. Some Muslims ritually wash their feet before praying five times a
day.

Daniel Pipes, founder of the Middle East Forum, a conservative think
tank, sees the requests as part of a movement to force the public to
acquiesce to Islamic law.

&quot;The goal of Islamists is the application of Islamic law,&quot; Pipes says.

In the San Diego case, a substitute teacher at Carver Elementary School
alleged that teachers were indoctrinating students into Islam. The San
Diego Unified School District determined that a teacher's aide was wrong
to lead Muslim students in prayer. Carver still has a special recess to
allow 100 Muslim students to pray.

The ACLU, which has often sued schools for permitting prayer, says it is
waiting to see what kind of policy the school settles on before deciding
whether to sue. It says promoting prayers is unconstitutional.

&quot;If you start carving out time in the school day that you would not do
but for the need to let students pray, then it begins to look like what
you're trying to do is to assist religion,&quot; says David Blair-Loy, legal
director for the ACLU in San Diego.

Thompson says such conflicts are bound to proliferate. He and other
Christians, he says, are preparing to ask for equal consideration such as
a Christian prayer recess.

&quot;What you're going to see out there is more of these kinds of cases as
the Muslim community tests how far it can go in the public school
system,&quot; he says. &quot;If this can happen for Muslims, it can happen for
Christians and other religions.&quot;

Giving pencils, paper and pride

http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070731/EDIT01/7...

&quot;It's not a 6-year-old's fault that he doesn't have a pencil or scissors
for school, but he's the one who suffers for it.&quot;

Linda DiBenedetto,

first-grade teacher

Pierce Elementary, Hamilton

Nearly one child in five in Ohio and Kentucky lives in poverty. Thousands
more dance along the line. So when schools send home lists of school
supplies needed for the coming year - which often ring up to $50 or more
- families panic.

So do teachers.

A student without supplies is a child who loses out on learning, worries
more about hiding his need than doing his work and, when he is
chronically scavenging for paper or a pencil, compromises his classmates'
learning as well.

Nationally, teachers spend on average $500 to $1,000 out of their own
pockets to provide supplies for their students or make up for budget
cuts. But Linda DiBenedetto and 16,000 local teachers like her shop for
free at Crayons to Computers, an extraordinary educational supply store
that matches donated goods to the teachers who need them.

In its 10th year, the Bond Hill store, begun by a Leadership Cincinnati
class, has given out more than $43 million worth of supplies to teachers
from 188 schools in a 15-county, three-state region. More than 75,000
students have benefited from the largesse of corporations, foundations
and individuals. To shop at the store, teachers must come from districts
with a high percentage of low income students, or volunteer at the store
for three hours to earn a shopping visit.

&quot;We're excited about the backpacks. Every year we have students who can't
afford them, and last year I had a student whose family lost everything
in a fire. I went out and bought him a backpack myself.&quot;

Nicole Lykins,

kindergarten teacher

Middletown Preparatory

and Fitness Academy

The backpacks are a stroke of considerable generosity, 10,000 of them
given by a local foundation. Crayons to Computers welcomes and receives a
bounty of materials, from hundreds of Estee Lauder makeup bags that
double perfectly as stylish pencil holders to batteries, wallpaper books
and even maracas.

Teachers love the rare and chance finds and turn them into creative
projects or behavioral incentives in their classrooms. But their bread
and butter is the seemingly bottomless supply of pencils, paper,
scissors, glue, markers, notebooks, rulers and the eponymous crayons that
are always available.

&quot;I've been teaching for 15 years, and every year I have more students who
can't afford the basic supplies. They're sitting there and the next kid
down has all the new things. The playing field isn't level from the first
day. But because of this store, on the first day I can figure out who
doesn't have things, and I can kind of slide the supplies to them. We
don't have to say a word. They just look at me and smile.&quot;

Liesl Roeder,

fifth-grade teacher

Loveland Intermediate School

As school districts face tighter budgets, they pass the squeeze on to
individual buildings, classrooms and families. Caught in the middle are
conscientious teachers, who should not have to dip into their own pockets
for basic classroom supplies - but often do because they see the hardship
not having such supplies places on their students. The teachers who shop
at Crayons to Computers use the same word when they sum up what the store
means to them - respect. They say it's not just a matter of the community
sharing their financial burden - which they appreciate - but sharing
their concern for their students.

With Every Woman, a Story
=========================

By MONICA CAMPBELL

Quixayá, Guatemala

Ana Orizabal's role in her Mayan village was ordained by a sacred vision,
and few here would deny it. Years ago she was startled awake in her
tin-roof shack by a vivid dream of receiving newborns, one after another,
from a single womb. The force of the image served as a message. &quot;The
saints,&quot; she thought at the time, &quot;are asking me to take this job, to
become a midwife.&quot;

Today the petite, dark-eyed 46-year-old is the village comadrona, or
midwife, a traditional role in rural Latin America, where ancient rituals
are valued and childbirth is considered both a natural event and a
ceremony. Thankful for her calling, Ms. Orizabal kneels for lengthy
prayers before each birth. Then, shamanlike, she surrounds her patient
with candles and incense.

Into this atmosphere of tradition and poverty, the kind that leaves
children barefoot and malnourished, 10 nursing students from the
University of San Francisco have arrived. In a cool, concrete room next
to Ms. Orizabal's bedroom, they unpack stethoscopes, prenatal vitamins,
antibiotics, and hemoglobin meters.

Looking on, Ms. Orizabal seems pleased. She runs her birthing service
with confidence but, amid poverty, she knows what can go missing. So when
a local nurse told her that the students would be coming to town, Ms.
Orizabal signed up and agreed to convert her home into a makeshift
prenatal clinic for their visit.

&quot;The Señora Walsh knows what we do,&quot; says Ms. Orizabal, shooing away a
spindly dog trying to make its way into the clinic. &quot;We understand each
other.&quot;

That's Linda Walsh, a nursing professor and midwife at the University of
San Francisco, and a familiar face in these parts. Seven years ago, she
founded the nursing-students' immersion program in Guatemala while on a
Habitat for Humanity mission a few miles away, in San Lucas Tolimán, a
town of 20,000 people on the jungly shore of Lake Atitlán. Community
leaders and health-care providers in this area, where doctors and
hospitals are few, asked her whether her nursing school would want to
collaborate and help tackle high maternal and infant death rates.

Ms. Walsh spotted opportunity. &quot;The comadronas, they are my peers,&quot; she
says. &quot;We share the same ideology,&quot; that birth, a natural event, requires
little medical intervention in the best cases. &quot;At the same time, we can
also warn them about women at risk and the wisdom of going to the
hospital.&quot;

In San Lucas Tolimán, local data suggest an infant-mortality rate of
about 41 per 1,000 live births, compared with the U.S. rate of 6.4 per
1,000. Pneumonia, diarrhea, and complications during birth are among the
leading causes of infant deaths here.

Now, twice a year, 10 students are selected from San Francisco's nursing
school for the two-week program. From the first day, they absorb the
local culture in a way tourists to the area — drawn by the Mayan
artisanry, volcanoes, and deep-blue lake — rarely do. After a morning
ride along narrow, winding roads in the back of a pickup truck, the
students arrive at remote villages and go to homes that double as walk-in
clinics. They unpack orange crates filled with medical supplies while
pregnant women slowly emerge from dirt-floor houses.

One student, Marisa Pegueros, a petite, 22-year-old senior of Mexican and
Salvadoran descent, says she is getting to know what the women she helps
treat in maternity departments in Northern California have talked about.
&quot;They're always telling stories about what it's like to live over here,
in the rural areas of Central America,&quot; she says. &quot;And now I'm seeing it
for myself, and I'm blown away by their limited resources. It makes me
want to see more. I'm certain I want to do international work.&quot;

During prenatal screenings and interviews, the nursing students form two
teams, accompanied by Ms. Walsh, a community nurse, or Catherine Carr, a
nursing professor and midwife at the University of Washington, who runs a
similar immersion program in San Lucas Tolimán and works closely with Ms.
Walsh. The students also assist during births.

&quot;The students will change, but we're building continuity with the faculty
and trust in the communities,&quot; says Ms. Walsh. When she started coming to
Guatemala and asked patients to lift their shirts for belly checks, the
women would nudge them up only a bit. &quot;Now,&quot; she says, &quot;they just yank up
their shirts. That's trust.&quot;

The program continues at a time when midwifery practice in the United
States, after a popularity boom in the past two decades, is faltering.
Faced with rising premiums for malpractice insurance, midwives are
closing shop. Health-care plans are listing fewer and fewer midwives. And
hospitals in the United States are treating an increasingly diverse
population, which includes immigrants from rural Latin America, where
midwives are common.

&quot;We need to take this knowledge back to the Bay Area,&quot; says Ms. Walsh.
&quot;So many medical books are coming out saying that with, say, a Guatemalan
woman you need to do this, this, and this. But you can't generalize every
woman. We're hoping that students will come away with the idea that every
woman brings her own story and history.&quot;

The previous morning, Yanette Salquil, 16 years old and eight months
pregnant with her first child, walked to one of the student-staffed
clinics, set up a few doors from her house. She has no desire to give
birth in a hospital, with its machines and, perhaps, a doctor unable to
speak her native Cakchiquel language. &quot;I want to have my baby at home,&quot;
she says. Her pregnant friends, in traditional wrap-around skirts and
plastic flip-flops, nod in agreement.

As lunchtime nears, some students feel the urge to snack. But nobody
does. In these villages it's considered bad luck to eat in front of a
pregnant woman; the belief is that doing so could trigger an abortion.
Other beliefs: Pregnant women must not step over a rope, or the umbilical
cord will strangle their baby. They must stay indoors during a lunar
eclipse. &quot;These are ideas from our ancestors,&quot; says Jesús Antonio Pérez,
a local health worker who recruits midwives to participate in the
university's program.

Later on, during a truck ride to another village, Tyler Garrick, a
26-year-old senior at San Francisco, grips a metal bar for balance with
one hand and his Spanish phrase book with the other. Most of the students
in the program have basic Spanish skills, but the language is new to him.
Turning to a fellow student, Svitlana Tahniyazova, he asks, &quot;Cómo te
llamas?&quot;

&quot;Me llamo Svitlana.&quot;

&quot;Good, good,&quot; says Mr. Garrick. Eager, he then skips to a more advanced
level. &quot;OK, how do I say, ‘Thank you for having us and for your trust?'&quot;

Liberalism, Democracy, and the Jewish State

By GADI TAUB

The future of the state of Israel is once again a topic of heated public
debate. For good reasons: The possibility of a nuclear threat from a
hostile Iran is one; deadlock in the peace process in the region, and the
chance of a gradual shift into chronic civil war between Israelis and
Palestinians, is another. But it has become common in some circles to ask
not only whether Israel can survive, but also if it has a right to.

Some commentators believe that &quot;the Jewish Question&quot; that has been
buzzing around in the West for some three centuries — the question of how
this ancient people, the Jews, should fit into a modern political order —
should be reopened. National self-determination for Jews in a state of
their own, such critics say, can no longer be part of a morally
acceptable answer. That is a telling development. As in the past, Western
attitudes to the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; are reliable indications of larger
political moods and of the shifting meanings of political concepts.

The first thing one senses about the framing of the topic today is hardly
a surprise: the growing unease with nation-states. The horrors of Fascism
and Nazism made us all wary of extreme nationalism. Until the 1970s,
national-liberation movements in rapidly collapsing Western colonies
still reminded the democratic world that nationalism is not always the
enemy of liberty but sometimes its ally. But the decline of colonialism
and the deterioration of liberation movements into third-world tyrannies,
combined with the rise of the European Union and globalization, changed
that. The postcolonial era gave rise to a hope of transcending
nationalism, and has relegated nationalist sentiments in the West's
political imagination to the parties of reaction. Current debates about
Israel's future clearly reflect that trend. But they also indicate a
less-obvious feature of the antinational mood: a growing rift between
liberalism and democracy.

A recent wave of books on the future of Israel offers a glimpse into that
tendency. The four discussed here (there are many others) are polemical
rather than scholarly, and they are vastly different from one another.
One is an autobiographical account, by Daniel Cil Brecher, a German Jew
who immigrated to Israel and then back to Europe; another is the work of
a French Jewish journalist, Sylvain Cypel, who spent more than a decade
in Israel; the third is a fiery anti-Zionist exhortation, by Joel Kovel,
a Jewish psychiatrist and now a professor of social studies at Bard
College, who challenged Ralph Nader for the presidential nomination of
the Green Party; and the last is an analysis of the challenges facing
Israel, by Mitchell G. Bard, a pro-Israeli, Jewish-American activist. It
is hard to imagine these four authors getting along around one dinner
table. But they do share something: All are, to various degrees, uneasy
with the idea of national identity.

Unease may be too strong a term for Bard's Will Israel Survive? A trace
of discomfort does appear, though, in his understandable anger, as an
American, toward those Israelis who insist that if you are Jewish and
consider yourself a Zionist, you must immigrate to Israel. Bard's
definition of Zionism is considerably more flexible. It includes all who
generally sympathize with Israel. That helps sidestep the core of the
original ideology: The founders of Zionism thought that under modern
conditions, Jews would preserve their identity and sense of &quot;peoplehood&quot;
only by shifting from a religious to a modern and national basis. They
insisted that Jews have a collective right, like other peoples (as
Israel's Declaration of Independence declared), to self-determination.
Bard does not object to that idea so much as he is ambiguous about it.
His justification of Zionism heavily accentuates anti-Semitism
(especially from contemporary fundamentalist Islam) and downplays
self-determination. His support of Zionism is thus more negative than
positive.

In Walled: Israeli Society at an Impasse, Cypel, a senior editor at Le
Monde, targets nationalism more directly. In his view, Israel suffers
from collective egocentrism. Both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict see themselves as victims, and both deny the victimhood of the
other. The key to any solution is therefore putting an end to denial. But
Israel, Cypel thinks, has gone the opposite way: It has built a wall, and
the wall is about blocking, not seeing, the other side.

Cypel greatly exaggerates denial. He takes little note, for example, of
the fact that many of the harsh truths he discusses, and which Israel, he
says, denies, were not unearthed from dusty archives by his own
journalistic efforts. He relies heavily on works of Israeli scholars and
on Haaretz, Israel's single highbrow daily newspaper. Those are hardly
clandestine sources. Contrary to Cypel's assertion that none of the works
of the Israeli historian Benny Morris, for instance, appeared in Hebrew
until 2000, Morris's seminal The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee
Problem, 1947-49 was actually published in Hebrew in 1991 and stirred a
lengthy, high-profile debate in the Israeli popular news media. For
someone who spent more than a decade in Israel, Cypel, now based in
Paris, is curiously out of touch with Israeli politics.

It is still true that Israel's public, like Palestine's, dwells more on
its own pains than on those of the other side. That is probably true of
all conflicts, but Cypel nevertheless makes it the center of his analysis
of this one. On that basis, he reasons that any resolution must first
cure both peoples of the inherent collective egocentrism of their
national narratives. Cypel, however, is a Frenchman, and France is both
strongly republican and decidedly national. He also remembers the
Algerian movement of national liberation. So he isn't easily tempted to
say that doing away with the desire for national independence is the key
to peace — or the necessary precondition for democracy. Instead he
classifies Israeli and Palestinian nationalism as the wrong kinds of
nationalism. The problem: They are &quot;ethnic&quot; national identities. Cypel
does not make clear exactly how the term &quot;ethnic&quot; applies to Israel's
national identity. But he clearly has in mind the contrast with France's
brand of republican nationalism, which formally (although not necessarily
in social practice) equates citizenship with national identity: If you
receive French citizenship, you automatically acquire, at least in
theory, a French identity.

A Stranger in the Land: Jewish Identity Beyond Nationalism, Brecher's
book, is written in a more minor key, and details his personal search for
an escape from the contradictions of identity. History and political
analysis are woven into biography here. Brecher's parents fled Europe in
the great upheavals of World War II, wound up in Israel, but never felt
at home there. They finally settled in Germany in 1953. Their son,
Daniel, however, was uncomfortable as a German Jew and immigrated to
Israel in 1976. But its very nature as a national Jewish state was
jarring to Brecher. His own humanistic view was shaped by the experience
of &quot;a minority group harmed by nationalism,&quot; and so he was uneasy with
what he saw as Israel's drive for an &quot;ethnically pure society.&quot; Falling
out of love with Israel began with minor political dissent, greatly
exacerbated after he served in a reserve unit in the first Lebanon war
(which began in 1982). Brecher's stationing seems in retrospect
singularly ironic: He served with other academics in a lecturers' unit
assigned to raise soldier morale.

The book's tone is uniformly morose. But it does have a happy ending,
with the author moving back to Europe and finding his home in the
cosmopolitan environs of Amsterdam. The personal is also the political
here: Brecher's reconciliation with himself, he believes, also applies to
Israel. Israel should transcend nationalism and become &quot;a state of all
her citizens,&quot; he says, one where &quot;the rights and development of the
individual citizen are protected and promoted regardless of race and
religion, where freedom and human rights stand in the foreground rather
than the dogmas of Zionism.&quot;

In Joel Kovel's Overcoming Zionism: Creating a Single Democratic State in
Israel/Palestine, nationalism is even more clearly equated with evil.
Kovel is a man of unequivocal judgments, and his verdict on Zionism, as a
particularly bad kind of nationalism, is fierce. Israel is, he says,
&quot;absolutely illegitimate,&quot; a &quot;monstrous venture&quot; of &quot;state-structured
racism.&quot; The history of the Zionist creed interests Kovel very little,
since the problem, in his view, begins with Judaism. Judaism, he says,
always had two opposing tendencies: exceptionalism and universalism.
Zionism is a direct descendant of the exceptionalistic side. Its origins
are in the idea that the Israelites were God's chosen people. According
to Kovel's slapdash Hegelianism, all forms of identity are negations of
others: If they do not negate negation, they do not achieve universalism,
and they are therefore malignant. Nationalism in general, and Zionism in
particular, fail on that count. They define themselves by excluding
others; thus they violate nothing less than natural justice (which Kovel
more or less equates with liberalism).

A more vigorous editor would have done the book a great deal of good by
tuning down Kovel's shrill evangelical tone and maybe counseling against
zoological metaphors. It would have been wiser, for example, not to court
charges of racism by comparing Jewish settlers to &quot;those insects who lay
an egg in the interior of the prey's body, whence a new creature hatches
as a larva that devours the host from within.&quot;

But the truth is that Kovel is not a racist, just an absolutist kind of
liberal zealot. His crusade for &quot;overcoming&quot; Zionism is militant because
there can be no compromise with absolute evil. He strives for complete
destruction of Zionism as a creed, by calling first for a blacklist of
all those who support pro-Israel lobbies in North America; then for
organizing cultural and economic boycotts of Israel; and finally for
overwhelming the Jewish majority with returning Palestinian refugees.
Only then can reconstruction begin. Kovel would have little truck with
the suggestions of a binational state currently circulating.
Reconstruction should aim for something like Brecher's non-national
liberal democracy.

Before Israel was founded, a Zionist leader who was to become its first
president, Chaim Weizmann, said Israel would be Jewish in the same sense
that England is English. What is it, then, that makes the idea of a
Jewish democratic state seem more contradictory to so many critics today
than an English democratic state?

The issue does not seem to be the connection of the state to Judaism as a
faith. From its outset, Zionism wrought a secularizing revolution in
Jewish identity. That is why most Orthodox Jews initially objected to it.
To this day, the large ultra-Orthodox minority in Israel, although it
takes an active part in Israel's politics, abhors Israel's national
identity. It is still true, however, that Zionism preserved many ties to
Judaism as a religion, and often made concessions to the Orthodox. The
result is no clear separation between church and state. Is that what
singles Israel out as nondemocratic? Probably not. England has a state
church, as do Denmark and Norway, and that doesn't seem to constitute
evidence of a nondemocratic character. The Greeks identify their
religious with their national identity; the Poles don't clearly separate
Roman Catholicism from theirs. But those states, too, are considered
democratic. Moreover, a strict separation of church and state — as, for
example, in France — is not necessarily more egalitarian. France is
extremely aggressive toward minorities whose religion has a public
dimension (like Muslim women who cover their heads in school). Israel's
Muslim minority is, in that respect, better off: Israel has a publicly
financed Arab-language school system, for example, and a state-sponsored
system of Muslim courts for marriage and family status. Arabic is one of
the official languages of the state.

But then there is the Law of Return. The law grants automatic citizenship
to immigrating Jews. Is that what makes Israel nondemocratic? Hardly.
Many other countries with diasporas have such laws: Finland, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, and Poland, to name a few.

Or is the core of the problem, as Cypel says, that Zionism is an &quot;ethnic&quot;
national identity? The term &quot;ethnic democracy&quot; is often used in the
controversy over Zionism, ever since the Israeli sociologist Sammy
Smoocha coined it to describe Israel in 1996. Smoocha was short of clear
on what the term indicates, but he certainly did not mean what today's
critics insinuate and what Israeli law clearly forbids: confining full
civil rights to Jews only.

Despite repeated usage, it is still not clear why the term &quot;ethnic&quot; is
useful for describing Israel, which is far less ethnically homogeneous
than, say, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Poland, or Sweden. In what
sense does &quot;ethnic&quot; describe the common identity of Israeli Jews from
Argentina, England, Ethiopia, Germany, Morocco, Russia, and Yemen? And
how does one classify the ultra-Orthodox, a large group that does not
share Israel's national identity but is nevertheless Jewish? Are they
part of the ethnos but not of the nation? The real dividing lines in
Israel are national — between those who do and those who don't share the
national Jewish identity. And apart from adding a pejorative ring,
substituting &quot;ethnic democracy&quot; for &quot;national democracy&quot; does not
accomplish much.

Nor does the existence of national minorities within Israel's boundaries
present any unique problem to its democracy. Other nation-states also
have national minorities that want to preserve their separate identities:
the Basques in Spain and the Germans in Poland, say. Few observers,
however, make that grounds for denying the rights of the majority in
Poland or Spain to national self-determination. Granted, Israel's
situation is peculiarly complicated by the fact that the state is in
conflict with the Palestinian nation, to which a minority in Israel
belongs. But that, too, is not the root of the intuitive feeling that the
Israeli state is inherently malignant. The origin of unease has more to
do with four decades of Israeli occupation in Gaza and the West Bank.

The alleged contradiction between &quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;Jewish&quot; is thus, at
bottom, a reading of the occupation back into Zionism. Increasingly,
Israel's most vehement critics tend to see things this way: Zionism is a
blood-and-soil ideology that postulates that the land belongs exclusively
to Jews. Therefore the occupation is its natural extension. And so an end
to the occupation may alleviate some of the symptoms but not cure the
disease. That is why Kovel and Brecher, along with many others, believe
that the only way to make Israel fully democratic is to make it
non-Zionist — that is, not a nation-state.

It is ironic that such a reading comes at a time when the most important
change Israel has undergone is best described as the triumph of Zionism
over the occupation. Contrary to the blood-and-soil theory, such a clash
was inevitable. For the founders of Zionism, the idea of
self-determination preceded — logically, and often historically — the
decision to realize it in Zion. They considered Argentina, Australia, the
Crimea, Madagascar, North America, and Uganda, among other places, for a
homeland. None of those locations was more politically feasible than
Zion, and none had Zion's nostalgic draw. But for mainstream Zionism, it
was nevertheless clear that the land of Israel was the means, while
democratic self-determination was the goal.

Hence, in Israeli public opinion, the &quot;two-state solution&quot; to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict has won over the ideology of a Greater
Israel. Shortly after the occupation began, the left (which by the early
1990s had grown to about half the electorate) insisted that the
occupation undermined the very moral grounds on which Zionism rests, the
&quot;natural right&quot; of all peoples to self-determination. Then, in recent
years, many on the political right, which for decades had supported
settlement in the territories, began to realize that the occupation would
drag Israel into binationalism. In that case, without a clear Jewish
majority, Israel would eventually have to give up democracy to preserve
its Jewish identity. Very few on the right were ever willing to consider
that possibility. And so the preservation of Israeli democracy
necessitated turning against settlements.

It was precisely the interdependence between national identity and
democracy that led even staunch hawks like Prime Ministers Ariel Sharon
and Ehud Olmert to turn their backs on the occupied territories. What is
commonly referred to as &quot;the demographic question&quot; (extensively treated
in Bard's book) is also &quot;the democratic question,&quot; which, in turn, is the
question of national self-determination. That is something Israel's
current radical-liberal critics find so hard to imagine: that national
sentiments can act to maintain and protect democracy; that Israel's
national identity was the force that gave the final blow to support for
the occupation. For them nationalism is, at best, an unpleasant bedfellow
for democracy — at worst, its simple opposite.

But nationalism and democracy were born together, and that was no
coincidence. In fact, it was the rise of modern nationalism that made
modern democracy feasible.

Most 18th-century political thinkers were dubious that large states could
be republics. Shaped by classic republican ideas, they believed that
republics had to be grounded in the virtus of their citizens. Only a
stern political education would train citizens to overcome their private
egotistic passions and act in the name of Reason, for the public good.
Such education was problematic in large states, the political thinkers
believed. The great revolutions in America and France proved them wrong.
It was passion, not its overcoming, that sustained republics: Love of
one's country — patriotism — would transcend egotism and make citizens
jealous guardians of their nation's interests, as well as of the
liberties of their fellow citizens.

That love, revolutionaries believed, also transcended national
chauvinism. It fueled what the French revolutionaries called the War of
All Peoples Against All Kings. Still, the Terror that followed swiftly on
the revolution in France gave republicans pause. Today, especially after
the horrors of the 20th century, we remember well how extreme nationalism
can turn against democracy. We easily forget, however, the extent to
which democracy is functionally dependent on the nation-state.

Although some of the authors discussed here are European, today's unease
with national sentiments has a distinctly American flavor. That has less
to do with any short-lived hope in Europe that the European Union has
transcended nationalism than with globalization. The winds of
globalization have spread an American form of liberal principles around
the globe, casting today's discussion in largely American terms. That
includes America's tendency to misunderstand the nature of its own
national democracy.

Americans often tend to believe that they have a &quot;pure&quot; liberal
democracy — that is, a democracy above and beyond the &quot;identity&quot; (the way
the term is used in the multicultural paradigm). To be sure, identity is
in vogue in America: In the mantra of multiculturalism, a plethora of
hyphenated self-definitions are created and re-created. But the
unarticulated premise is that &quot;identity&quot; is what comes before the hyphen;
what comes after — &quot;American&quot; — somehow stands for democratic procedures
that form a universal liberal framework.

Not only does that ignore how much &quot;American&quot; is a strong identity, it
also confuses the procedures of liberal democracy with that identity.
Ever since the late 18th century, blindness to their own strong
nationalism has led many Americans to believe that imposing the American
Way on others is tantamount to liberating them. From Jefferson's vision
of an &quot;empire for liberty,&quot; to Woodrow Wilson's determination to &quot;teach&quot;
South Americans to &quot;elect good men,&quot; to George W. Bush's badly conceived
war in Iraq, that streak has persisted. At its best, America was and is a
true champion of liberty. But it is not at its best when liberty is
confused with Americanization.

So when Joel Kovel lays out his plan of attack against Zionism, or when
Daniel Brecher demands that Israel renounce its Jewish character in favor
of an American-style liberal democracy, or when far more sophisticated
intellectuals like New York University's Tony Judt propose, as he has
repeatedly, a &quot;one-state solution&quot; to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
(one neutral political entity encompassing both nations), they are
reiterating the same old blunder: For all their sometime criticisms of
American foreign policy, they, too, confuse Americanization with
liberation.

Imposing America's model of one liberal state between the Jordan River
and the Mediterranean Sea would mean suppressing the aspirations of both
Jews and Palestinians to self-determination. It may be noble of such
writers to shoulder what was once called the White Man's Burden, and take
it upon themselves to teach the natives the right form of
self-determination. But from the point of view of the natives, that does
not seem like a way to promote democracy. It seems more like an assault
on self-determination with a liberal accent.

Kovel, and, for that matter, Judt on Israel are closer to Bush on Iraq
than they would like to believe: American notions of democracy are what
count, not what Iraqis, or Palestinians, or Israeli Jews want. And, as in
Iraq, such a solution would mean civil war. If anyone needed a
demonstration of that, Hamas's military takeover of Gaza has supplied it.
If Hamas and Fatah cannot reconcile their differences without resorting
to force, then throwing a Jewish minority into the mix is unlikely to
produce a peaceful liberal democracy.

If the foreseeable future holds stability for Israel's democracy,
democratization for Palestine, and peace for both, that future will be
tied to national self-determination. It will have to rely on stable
nation-states. Transcending nationalism would be, in this case, promoting
civil war.

Looking beyond the case of Israel and Zionism, one wonders if the rising
anti-national mood does not indicate a more general flaw in contemporary
liberal logic: Liberalism and democracy may be drifting apart.

Reducing democracy to liberalism's protection of individual rights, and
positing them in opposition to nationalism, may indeed be a step on the
way to transcending nation-states. But transcending nation-states may
prove to transcend democracy along with them. Some very important
individual human rights may be increasingly guarded, but citizens may
lose control over their institutions and political fates.

Institutions that transcend the nation-state — whether one looks at
multi-national corporations, the International Court in the Hague, the
World Bank, or the European Union — may stand at the vanguard of the
liberal faith. But the same institutions also exercise great influence,
even jurisdiction, over people and peoples who have little or no
democratic control over them. The liberal assault on nationalism is also
beginning to look like an assault on the principle of government with the
consent of the governed. That is worrisome, because liberalism without
democracy is likely to be just as unsustainable as democracy without
liberty.

What If Your Campus Housing Looked Like This?

Houses
EcoVillage at Ithaca

Ithaca, NY — There is something timeless about the houses in an unusual
neighborhood just outside of Ithaca’s tiny downtown. They’re placed close
together and sit lightly upon the land, as homes did in early American
settlements or medieval villages. But the time-warp feeling one gets at
the EcoVillage at Ithaca may have more to do with the fact that the usual
trappings of suburban development — multi-car garages; wide, paved
streets; vinyl siding — are nowhere to be found. Where there might be
driveways in a conventional development, the EcoVillage houses have
front-yard gardens of peppermint, basil, and butterfly flowers of all
sorts.

Professors and administrators attending a community-college conference
here got a tour of the EcoVillage, one of the better-known intentional
communities in the country. The whole idea of the EcoVillage is to turn
the current trends in housing development upside down: Build small, build
efficiently, build close together, and leave the surrounding land
undeveloped, or preserve it for agriculture.

The EcoVillage stands on 175 acres that were originally slated for bland,
suburban housing. Ninety percent of the land would have been taken up by
houses, and 10 percent would have been left green. When the EcoVillagers
got their hands on the land, they turned those figures around. Ten
percent would be taken up by development, and the rest left alone. Car
parking is on the perimeter of the development, leaving the areas between
and around the houses open for pedestrians and playing kids. Much of the
open land could be used for agriculture; there are two organic farms on
the site, and the villagers would like to have more.

About 100 adults and 60 children live here. Liz Walker, a resident who is
one of the founders of the village, said that a population of 300 is
probably the upper limit that the community could support.

The houses range from 600 square feet to 2,400 square feet. A tour of a
1,100 square-foot home owned by Monty Berman, a 78-year-old adjunct
professor of psychology at Empire State College, revealed a humble but
warm interior. The walls are superinsulated, the windows are
triple-glazed, and the features inside seem to be low-cost and
low-maintenance. (Floors in one room were sealed sheets of plywood.)

The kitchen is tiny, but that might be because residents of EcoVillage
eat in a common house a few times a week. Laundry facilities and
playrooms for the children are also located in the common house.

Those living in the EcoVillage make decisions communally — process that
the residents admit is frustrating at times. Anyone working in higher
education would be able to relate.

The EcoVillage, in fact, works closely with the colleges in the area.
Students from both Cornell University and Ithaca College work on projects
at the EcoVillage, and the villagers are active in leading seminars about
sustainability.

During the tour, Ms. Walker led the crowd to the edge of the village,
which looks out toward Ithaca. On the opposite side of the valley sit
Cornell, on one hilltop, and Ithaca College, on another.

“I like to think that we have these various educational institutions on
these hills,” Ms. Walker said, “and we are one of them.”
