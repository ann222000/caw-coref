Claudio Abbado &amp; RAI-Milano Orchestra at Teatro alla Scala, Milan,
4/15/1967 - Mahler : Symphony Nr. 6.  This is taken straight off the
mono RAI tape, as opposed to the Cetra edition of the same perfomrance
which is tarted-up with loads of echo and phony stereo.  Neither is it
the same as the one from Vienna on May 24th of the same year, somewhat
filtered on the Hunt label and even worse on Movimenti Musica.  This
has better sound than all of those.  It is also available and cheaper
at $5.00.

Franz Bruggen and the Orchestra of the 18th Century at Avery Fisher
Hall, 3/15/92 - Beethoven: Symphony Nr. 7; Schubert: Symphony Nr. 9.

L'Enfance du Christ - &quot;The Holy Family Resting by the Wayside&quot;;
Stravinsky: Suite from The Firebird.  One disc off of AFRS vinyl

Charles Munch leading the Philadelphia Orchestra, 1/31/1965 in a
pension-fund benefit concert.  Berlioz: Symphonie Fantastique;
Debussy: La Mer; Ravel: Daphnis et Chloe - Suite Nr. 2.  Stereo witrh
a very slight amount of overlaod in original source at the end of
Berlioz.  2 discs - $8.00.

1/8/49 Bartok: BLUEBEARD'S CASTLE - American Premiere, w/Dallas
Symphony under  Antal Dorati, w/Desire Ligeti &amp; Olga Forrai.
Transferred off the only known set of discs of the broadcast, sound is
very fine if not excellent - recorded off of WNBC-FM in New York, but
carried to it &quot;live&quot; via telephone lines, hence AM-network line
sound.  With announcements, whole affair is only 51 minutes long, so
$5.00.

5/29/74 Queen Elizabeth Hall, London - Rameau: LES FETES d'HEBE -John
Eliot Gardiner dir. Monteverdi Chorus&amp; Orch. in the first complete
performance in modern times, w/Jill Gomez, Dale Duesing, Christopher

Pinnock and Jonathan Hinden, harpischord continuos, and Marilyn
Sansom, 'cello continuo.  Cast includes: Jennifer Smith, Emma Kirkby,
Paul Elliot, Jean-paul Orliac, Christopher Booth-Jones, Alain Fondary,
Pierre-Yves Le Maigat, and Anne-Marie Rodde.  3 stereo CDRs with
absolutely complete announcements as broadcast.  There is a tiny
amount of multi-path distortion here, but it intrudes not at all.
$12.00.

Juan;  3/18/47 Corelli: Concerto Grosso, Op.6, Nr.8; Mozart: Symphony
Nr.35; Wagner: Siegfried Idyll; 3/25/47 Mahler: Symphony Nr. 4 in G-
major, with Desi Halban (with songs she recorded with Walter for CBS

2/22/53 Walter-NY Phil. - Vaughan Williams: Fantasia on a Theme of
Thomas Tallis; Mahler: Das Lied von der Erde, w/Set Svanholm &amp; Elena
Nicolai - 1 CDR w/announcements &amp; in excellent sound.  $6.00

12/10/64 Steinberg-NY Phil. - Strauss: ELEKTRA, with Astrid Varnay,
Phyllis Curtin, Regina Resnik, Walter Cassel, Margaret Roggero, Arturo
Sergi, Lillian Garabedian, Louann Wyckoff, John Fiorito, &amp; Marybeth
Hyer..  2 mono CDRs - I believe the performance was compiled from
several performances and rehearsal.  Milton Cross indicates that the
reading is &quot;a special pre-recorded performance&quot; - meaning in this
case, apparently, that it is a composite from several.  The applause
sounds added-on, in the same way that it often does w/Philadelphia in
this time period - but I think it's all from this series of per-
formances &amp; is the way it was broadcast.  A short interview w/Regina
Resnik is included. $8.00.

Music Anniversary concert.  Rossini: Overture to William Tell;
Leoncavallo: I PAGLIACCI - Prologo; Rossini: LA DONNA DEL LAGO - &quot;Mura
Felice&quot; and BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA - &quot;Dunque io son&quot; - the vocal items
with Marilyn Horne and Cornell MacNeil.  Then, after intermission:
Gershwin: Piano Concerto in F, w/Lorin Hollander and An American In
Paris.  2 CDRs in excellent stereo.  The duet from Barbiere is utterly
fabulous. $10.00.

2/12/79 bcast - Robert Page leading the Cleveland Orchestra - Bloch:
Sacred Service (w/Robert Merrill); J.S.Bach: Cantata Nr. 150; Florent
Schmitt: Psalm Nr. 47.  All with Cleveland Orchestra Chorus.  2 discs
