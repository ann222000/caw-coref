The War-Torn History of Israel

In the near future, the country of Israel is going to take a prominent
role in world affairs, so let's take a brief look at their historical
development to see why tensions are going to continue to increase in the
Middle East.

The northern kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrians around
722 BC, and the threat of captivity and slaughter forced them to flee.
Those people became known as the &quot;ten lost tribes.&quot; The other two
tribes, Benjamin and Judah (where the word &quot;Jew&quot; came from), remained in
the south. Through the years, Jerusalem and Palestine became one of the
most overrun areas in the world: Babylonian (587 BC-536 BC),
Medo-Persian (536 BC-533 BC), Greek (331 BC-301 BC), Egyptian (301
BC~198 BC), Syrian (198 BC-63 BC), and Roman (63 BC-395 AD). Most of the
Jews had fled from the land, and only a small group remained in
Jerusalem until 70 AD, when the Romans burned the city. By 135, all of
the Jews had been driven out. Still the area continued to be the subject
of contention as it was conquered by the Byzantine (396-638), Mohammedan
(639-1099), Crusader (1100-1291), Moslem (1292), Egyptian-Mamaluke
(1292-1917), and Turks (1917).

In 1895, Theodor Herzl, an Austrian Jew, wrote a book called _The
Jewish State _(_Der Judenstadt_) that began the movement towards the
establishment of an independent Jewish state. In 1897, he arranged the
first World Zionist Congress in Basle, Switzerland. Now known as
&quot;Zionists&quot; (for Mount Zion in Palestine), a fund was started to raise
money to buy land, and a blue and white flag was chosen, the colors of
the tallith prayer shawl. Herzl traveled around the world, especially in
Europe, to lobby for his group. In 1903, a year before he died, England
offered the Jews the African country of Uganda, which they rejected,
because they knew that Palestine was their country. According to the
Bible (Gen. 15:18), Israel's promised land stretches from the Nile River
in Egypt to the Euphrates in Syria, and includes the countries of Syria
and Lebanon.

In 1904, Dr. Chaim Weizmann (who would become Israel's first
President), was made Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at the
University of Manchester in England. The Polish-born Jew had studied
Chemistry in Germany, and taught in Switzerland and England. During
World War I, Germany was producing 250,000 shells a day, while England
was only producing 2,500, due to a shortage of acetone because of the
lack of wood alcohol. Weizmann isolated an organism capable of
transforming the starch of cereals, most notably that of maize, and
later chestnuts, into acetone butyl alcohol. Because of these advanced
experimentations and the contribution of explosives (TNT) to the allied
cause, Weizmann was credited with saving the British Army. The only
thanks he wanted, was for Palestine to be established as a national
homeland for the Jews.

The Sykes-Picat Agreement was a secret wartime agreement between
England and France to divide between them the lands of the Ottoman
Empire once World War 1 ended. Among the terms was the establishment of
an Arab state in &quot;southern Palestine.&quot; However, the Arabs became upset
that Britain decided to instead engineer its own rule over all Palestine
through the League of Nations. England essentially ruled Palestine as a
colony until 1948.

On November 2, 1917, the British Foreign Secretary Lord Arthur James
Balfour sent this declaration to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild:

&quot;His Majesty's Government views with favor the establishment in
Palestine of a national home land for the Jewish people, and will use
their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it
being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice
the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in
Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any
other country.&quot;

On December 9, 1917, Gen. Edmund Allenby marched into Jerusalem, and
when the Turks heard that he was on his way, they interpreted &quot;Allenby&quot;
to mean &quot;Allah Nebi&quot; (&quot;Prophet of God&quot;), and took it as a sign that God
was against them. They were also worried about the accompanying
airplanes (from the 14th Bomber Squadron of the Royal Flying Corp),
which they had never seen before. They were thinking about the promise
in Isaiah 31:5: &quot;As birds flying, so will the Lord of Hosts defend
Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will
preserve it.&quot; The Turks left the city.

An interesting fact to add to this narrative can be found in Daniel
12:12. Some believe that the 1335 &quot;days&quot; may refer to the actual date
that Palestine was delivered from Moslem rule. Since the land in
Daniel's day was under Moslem rule, the date given would most likely be
in Moslem terms, not Jewish or Gregorian. A coin minted in Turkey showed
the Gregorian date of 1917 on one side, and the Moslem date of 1335 on
the other side. Is this a fulfillment of prophecy?

After the War, the 1919 Paris Peace Conference at Versailles
established the League of Nations, who approved the Balfour Declaration
and granted a mandate for Great Britain to govern the Palestine area.
Within a couple of years, a Select Committee on Estimates, of the
British House of Commons, reported that &quot;large numbers of Jews, almost
amounting to a second Exodus, have been migrating from Eastern Europe to
the American zones of Germany and Austria with the intention in the
majority of cases of finally making their way to Palestine. It is clear
that it is a highly organized movement, with ample funds and great
influence behind it, but the Subcommittee was unable to obtain any real
evidence who are the real instigators.&quot; A U.S. Senate War Investigating
Committee report said that a &quot;heavy migration of Jews from Eastern
Europe into the American Zone of Germany is part of a carefully
organized plan financed by special groups in the United States.&quot; Even
though nobody was to leave the Soviet Union without government
permission, many Jews were allowed to leave, so they could return to
their homeland.

In 1937, a Royal Commission was established by England which divided
the country of Palestine into three sections: Jewish, Arab and English.
With the increased tension, the UN Security Council later went soft, and
the Truman Administration reversed their earlier support, urging that
the partition proposal be suspended, in lieu of a &quot;trusteeship.&quot; Jewish
terrorist groups, such as the Stern gang, and the Irgun Zvai Leumi (led
by Menachim Begin), worried that a Jewish State would not materialize,
began attacking Arabs. _Time_ magazine reported that they &quot;stormed the
village of Deir Yasin and butchered everyone in sight. The corpses of
250 Arabs, mostly women and small children, were tossed into wells.&quot;
Rather than risking the possibility of further massacres, the Arab
settlers fled the country to live in neighboring countries.

On April 29, 1947, the UN took on the responsibility of settling the
Palestinian situation. Facing a Jewish refugee crisis because of mass
emigration into Palestine that they could no longer control, England
acceded to resolution 181 of the newly-founded United Nations which
called for a partition of the British-ruled area into separate Jewish
and Arab states, with Jerusalem as a separate entity administered by the
UN. Palestinian Jews approved the plan, but Palestinian Arabs and
neighboring Arab countries rejected it.

On May 14, 1948, the British Union Jack in Jerusalem was lowered, and
at 4 p.m., David Ben-Gurion (the first Prime Minister) read the
Declaration of Independence over the airwaves in a radio broadcast from
the Tel Aviv Museum. At 6:10 p.m. President Truman made an official
statement of recognition, making the United States one of the first
countries to extend diplomatic recognition to the new independent state
of Israel.

In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Andrei A. Gromyko, the Russian
Ambassador, announced his support for an independent Jewish State in
Palestine, and urged the Arabs to accommodate them. The entire Communist
bloc voted to support Israel. They followed their show of support with a
strong program which included financial support and military equipment.
The Soviet Union was hoping that Israel would become another communist
satellite. When it became apparent that Israel would not go communist,
Russia discontinued diplomatic relations with them on February 23, 1953,
and the Cominform denounced Zionism as an &quot;agency of American imperialism.&quot;

Another variation of one of the numerical theories given earlier,
purports to indicate the foretelling of the establishment of Israel as
an independent Jewish State, and the end of the dispersal of the Jewish
people throughout the world. The calculation goes like this: 2,520
biblical years X 360 biblical days = 907,200 days, divided by our
calendar year of 365.25 days = 2,483.8/ /calendar years, which added to
the end of the Babylonian captivity in 536 BC, leads us to the year of
1948.

When British troops left the area, they said it would be a matter of
weeks before the Arabs would take over the new country. On May 15th, the
official date of statehood, when Ben-Gurion was broadcasting Israel's
appreciation to the U.S. for their recognition, an explosion sounded,
after which he said: &quot;A bomb has just fallen on this city from an enemy
aircraft flying overhead.&quot; An Arab alliance of Egypt, Iraq, Saudi
Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and Jordan had attacked Israel. Even
though the newly formed nation was poorly armed, they survived, and
actually increased their territory by 600 miles. The 1949 Armistice gave
them 21% more land than they had originally been given by the United
Nations.

Prior to 1948, the Jewish people were known as &quot;Palestinians.&quot; There
was a _Palestinian Post_ newspaper, a Palestinian Brigade of Jewish
volunteers in the British Army during World War II, and an all-Jewish
Palestinian Symphony Orchestra. Arab inhabitants living in the new
country of Israel wanted to differentiate themselves from the Jews, and
began called themselves Palestinians. However, the underlying purpose
for this was to generate the misconception that it was a distinct
nationality, and that &quot;Palestine&quot; was their ancestral homeland, when in
fact, they are actually similar in language and customs to the Arabs of
Syria and Jordan, where their ancestors probably came from.

On July 26, 1956, Gamal Abdel Nassar, President of Egypt, seized
control of the Suez Canal, and announced that the profits would go
towards building the Aswan Dam. Egypt moved into a close alliance with
Russia as billions of dollars worth of military equipment, along with
Soviet advisors, poured into the country. On October 29th, Israeli
forces overran the Gaza Strip, and had it not been for the UN Resolution
that ordered a cease fire, Egypt would have fallen to Israel.

On November 7, 1957, the _Jerusalem Post_ reported that at 6:03 a.m.,
Moshe Dayan radioed to twenty of his soldiers stationed in the Sinai
Desert, that three Egyptian divisions, 18,000 men, were on their way.
They men bowed down, and prayed to the &quot;God of their Fathers&quot; to have
the strength to die, rather than face being captured. When they got up,
they saw the Egyptian strike force engaged in retreat. Behind these
lines was a car, which the Israelis captured. Inside the car was one of
Nassar's commanding generals, who said that they were retreating because
they had been surrounded by an army dressed in white. Israel had no such
army there. The 18,000 soldiers were never heard from again. A six-week
search in Israel, the Sinai Desert, and Egypt failed to turn up any
clues. Since it was already established that Israel did not have the
resources to capture such a large number of men, what could have
happened? _National Geographic_ reported that on November 7, 1957, at
6:33 a.m. there was an earthquake of substantial proportions on the
Sinai peninsula, which lead to the speculation that the army could have
been swallowed up by the earth. Most certainly this was a sign that the
Jews were indeed God's chosen people.

The Soviet Union began sending equipment to Iraq and Syria, while they
continued to interfere in the internal affairs of other Arab nations
through military coups and political assassinations. Only U.S. and
British intervention prevented Communist takeovers in the Middle East,
as in July 1958, when the Marines landed in Lebanon; and British forces,
supporting King Hussein, landed in Jordan.

On March 16, 1965, Nassar promised the Arabs an all-out offensive
effort against Israel, if they would unite under him, as he hoped to
become the President of the United States of Africa. He said: &quot;We must
arm 5,000,000 men and overwhelm the Israelis by sheer military might.&quot;

In 1967, Russia sent exaggerated reports to Egypt and Syria that Israel
was preparing for war against Syria. This was a move by Syria to unify
the Arab bloc countries. In a book written by Nassar, he revealed that
his chief goal was to eliminate Israel as a nation, and to push them
into the sea. On May 26th he said: &quot;The Arab people want to fight. We
have been waiting for the right time when we will be completely ready.&quot;
On May 28th he said: &quot;We will not accept any co-existence with Israel.&quot;
On June 4th he said, concerning Israel: &quot;We are facing you in battle and
are burning with desire for it to start to obtain revenge.&quot; The source
of Nassar's hatred for Israel can be traced back to a statement he made
back in December, 1962: &quot;We feel the soil of Palestine is the soil of
Egypt, and the whole Arab world. Why do we mobilize? Because we feel
that the land of Palestine is part of our land, and we are ready to
sacrifice ourselves for it.&quot;

Nassar ordered the UN to remove their troops, which they did; and he
closed the crucial port of Eliat, on the Gulf of Aquaba, and blockaded
the Tiran Straits. The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon
surrounded Israel on all sides. Joining them were Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait,
Sudan, and other Arab nations, which represented 25 times more manpower
than Israel could field. On the evening of June 4, 1967, Nassar moved
his Russian-made tanks and artillery into position. He knew, that with
America caught up in the Vietnam War, there would be no help for Israel.

As daylight broke on June 5th, Israeli jets flew low from the north and
began bombing the Egyptian Air Force. Israeli ships traded fire with
Egypt's naval power, and Israeli tanks rolled into the Sinai. As the
events unfolded, Russia warned the major countries of the world to
back-off, so the world sat back and waited, expecting a swift Arab
victory. The victory never came. By the second day, Arab leaders watched
their military being ground to bits. After six days, the Arab alliance
was in retreat as Israeli soldiers captured the Sinai, the Golan
Heights, and reclaimed the city of Jerusalem. Schlomo Goren, Ashkenazic
(of Eastern European origin) Chief Rabbi of Israel, carried the Scrolls
of the Law, and sounded the ram's horn of repentance. In Hebrew,
&quot;shofar&quot; (ram's horn) is the word that &quot;jubilee&quot; is derived from. In
Leviticus 25:8-9, a &quot;jubilee&quot; is represented as 49 years. There was a 49
year difference between 1917, when Gen. Allenby entered Jerusalem, and
1967, when the Jews took complete control. Gen. Moshe Dayan said: &quot;We
have returned to our holiest of holy places, never to be parted from it
again...No power on earth will remove us from this spot again.&quot;

Seeing that their plan was failing, Russia called for a ceasefire. In
those six short days, the Arabs lost three billion dollars of military
equipment, and the Israelis captured $700 million in new Soviet military
hardware. Over 15,000 Arab lives were lost, but only 700 Israelis.
Israel increased their territory from 8,000 to 34,000/ /square miles.
Moshe Dayan, Israel's Minister of Defense, said afterwards: &quot;Our next
war will be with Russia.&quot;

After the Israeli victory over the Arabs in 1948, Jordan maintained
possession of Judea, Samaria, and the eastern part of Jerusalem, and
expelled all the Jews and destroyed their synagogues. They renamed the
area the &quot;West Bank.&quot; Their purpose was to convince the world that these
territories were the ancestral lands of the Jordanian Kingdom, when in
fact it is well documented that the land belonged to the Jews. Even
after the Arabs were driven out of this area during the 1967 war, they
still referred to this territory as the West Bank in an effort to
continue swaying public opinion.

In the years that followed, Russia continued to arm Egypt, Syria, and
other Arab countries. However, by 1972, Enwar Sadat, the President of
Egypt, felt that Russia was trying to control the Middle East, and he
ended his country's alliance with them. Egypt and Saudi Arabia joined
forces so they wouldn't have to rely on Russia. Syria then became the
main recipient of Soviet arms.

In 1973, Egypt's War Minister announced that the headquarters for all
Arab fronts would be established in Cairo. On October 6, 1973, which was
Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and eight
other Arab nations attacked Israel. Israel again prevailed, taking even
more territory. Again Russia urged the UN to order a ceasefire. Sadat's
terms for a ceasefire was for Israel to withdraw from all territory it
took during the 1967 war. American and Soviet pressure turned this
Israeli victory into a negotiated compromise. The Arabs punished the
world for their support of Israel by initiating an oil embargo against
all the nations, such us the United States, who were partial to Israel.
This move created worldwide economic chaos.

In 1977, Israeli Chief of Staff Mordechai Gur said publicly that Egypt
was again preparing for war, basing his assumption on an unprecedented
military buildup that was part of a two-year $6 billion arms
modernization plan. However, in 1988, President Carter was able to get
Prime Minister Menachem Begin (Israel) and Enwar Sadat (Egypt) together
to sign the Camp David Peace Accord, which led to the return of the
Sinai to Egypt.

On November 5, 1978, the 21-nation Arab League met in Baghdad and
established a $3.5 billion war fund &quot;to continue the armed confrontation
with the Jewish State&quot;; and in 1980, a 37-nation Islamic Summit called
for a &quot;Holy War&quot; to liberate all Arab land, including Jerusalem, to
establish an independent Palestinian state, with an Arab Jerusalem as
its capital. The proposal was rejected by Egypt because of their
commitment to the Peace Accord.

During 1980-81, Israel passed two key laws that changed the nature of
the Middle East conflict: they named Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem
and the Old City (captured from Jordan in 1967) as Israel's Eternal
Capital (although most of the world still maintains embassies in Tel
Aviv); and annexed the Golan Heights (captured from Syria in 1967).

In June, 1982, while responding to a P.L.O. attack from a terrorist
base in southern Lebanon, Israeli Intelligence discovered that Russia
had enough arms and foodstuffs in huge caves under the town of Sidon to
supply a million-man army, including uniforms, assault rifles,
ammunition, shells, missiles, and tanks. They found two huge digging
machines that were used to dig the underground fortress. The smaller one
of the two can dig a hole 30 feet wide, 24 feet high, and 60 feet deep,
in eight hours. They were part of a six-machine shipment to Austria by a
U.S. manufacturer. The whereabouts of the other four are not known. The
shocking implication of that discovery, was that the shelf life of the
K-rations (meal packets) were only six months, which led many to believe
the Israel thwarted a Russian invasion of Israel that was planned for
the fall of 1982.

In 1993, in the Norwegian capital of Oslo, Rabin (Israel) and Yassar
Arafat (Palestinian Liberation Organization) reached an agreement in an
attempt to end its armed struggle in exchange for gradual Palestinian
autonomy over parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which was later
extended to nablus, Jenin, and Hebron in 1995. Rabin, like Sadat before
him, paid with his life. In 1994, Israel and Jordan signed a Peace Treaty.

Billed as Camp David II, in 2000, hoping for a final settlement before
he left office, President Bill Clinton hosted a meeting between Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat. For the first time, Israel offered
part of East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital, and most of the West
Bank. The talks failed because of Arafat's demand for the &quot;right of
return&quot; for Palestinian refugees living abroad.

Today, the Israeli military force is probably the most respected in the
world, despite its small size. They have a fighting spirit that can not
be denied. Their military officers are sworn in with a ceremony at the
ancient fortress of Masada, where in 70 AD, unable to hold off the Roman
attack any longer, 950 men, women, and children committed suicide,
rather than be captured. Part of their oath says: &quot;Masada shall never
fall again.&quot; This commitment has nurtured that incredible fighting
spirit, making them the most elite fighting force in the world -
literally unbeatable. They are God's chosen people, and because of that,
Israel will never fall, but that won't stop someone from trying.

Who Will Be Involved

To get some background on the mechanics of this section, you need to
know that Israel is referred to as &quot;a nation and a company of nations&quot;
in Genesis 35:11, and it is believed that this references the initial
migrations of the sons of Noah, as well as the result of the Assyrian
captivity of Israel. It is important to see how these migrations
impacted the ancestry of those nations which are named in prophecy.

The Table of Nations: The Sons of Noah

The line of Shem produced-

Elam (Elamites), Asshur (Assyrians), Arphaxad (who produced the line of
Eber, the progenitor of the Hebrews), Lud (Lydians, Akkdians), Aram
(Aramaeans, Syria).

The line of Ham produced-

Cush (Babylonians, Ethiopians, Nubians in the area the Lower Tigris and
Euphrates, then to southern Arabia and Ethiopia)

Ashkenaz: Germans, Ararat

Riphath: Celts, northern shores of the world

Togarmah: Turkey, Armenia

Magog (Scythians, north of the Black Sea)

Madai (Medes, Iranic, south of Caspian Sea)

Elishah (Greeks, northwest Asia Minor, Sicily)

Tarshish (Tartessus, Iberians, Spain)

Kittim or Chittim (Grecians, Cyprus)

Dodanim (Grecians, Aegean Islands)

Tubal (Russians, northeast of Cilicia, east of Cappadocia)

Meshech (Russians, northeast of Cilicia, east of Cappadocia)

Tiras (Teutons, Thracians, northern shores and islands of the Aegean Sea)

In 1 Chronicles 1:19 it says: &quot;And unto Eber were born two sons: the
name of the one was Peleg; because in his days the earth was divided:
and his brother's name was Joktan.&quot; Peleg was born around 2248 B.C. and
the confounding of speech took place at the Tower of Babel around 2234
B.C. The text in Chronicles could be referring to people dividing up
into various groups- according to language similarity. However, some
researchers believe that this passage reflects the fact that prior to
Peleg, all the continents were connected. This confirms the scientific
concept known as the Continental Drift Theory, and illustrates that the
descendants of Noah were able to migrate to lands all around the world
on natural land bridges.

The Sons of Jacob

The patriarch Jacob produced twelve sons, each of whom became the
father of one of the tribes of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,
Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. They
each settled in a different part of the land of Canaan on each side of
the Jordan River.

After the death of King Solomon, Israel was split into two Kingdoms,
along territorial and political lines. Judah and Benjamin in the South
remained loyal to the House of David; while the rest of the tribes to
the North were ruled by a succession of monarchies.

In 722-721 BC, Shalmanser V, the King of Assyria conquered the Northern
Kingdom of Israel, captured Samaria, and took these ten tribes to
Assyria where they were imprisoned in Halah, and on the Habor (the river
of Gozan), and in the city of Medes (the upper Mesopotamian area of
modern Iraq and Syria). For all intents and purposes, these tribes
seemingly disappeared, and they became known as the Ten Lost Tribes of
Israel. It is believed, for the most part, that the southern tribes of
Judah and Benjamin make up what is known as the Jewish people of today.
However, Biblical evidence points to the fact that it was known where
these tribes were.

In 2 Chronicles 30:1-10, recorded many years after the exile of the
Northern tribes, you'll find this passage: &quot;And (King) Hezekiah sent to
all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh,
that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the
passover unto the LORD God of Israel...So they established a decree to
make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan,
that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel
at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it
was written. So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the
commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto
the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the
remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of
Assyria...So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn,
and mocked them.&quot;

This indicates that the King knew where the tribes were and was able to
send them a letter, so they were never really lost at all.

The Impact of the Migration of the Ten Tribes

Down through the years, many stories have circulated about where the
various Jewish tribes immigrated to, and have led to suppositions such
as the British Israel Theory and other similar conjectures. However, the
following evidence will illustrate the migrations of Noah's progeny,
Hebrew presence in various places all over the world, as well as the
movements of the ten exiled tribes.

The Biblical book of Genesis relates that Cain made his way to a land
where he &quot;builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
name of his son Enoch.&quot; (Genesis 4:17) Although there has been extensive
archeological research around the area where Eden was believed to have
been located, no remains of such a city has been found. But there is a
city that bears the name- Tenochtitlan. However, this was the capital of
the Aztec empire, which later became known as Mexico City.

The Incas of Peru have been connected to the ancient land of Ophir,
where Solomon was believed to have a substantial gold mining operation.
Linguistic clues provide a probable link to the King. In his book _Gods
of the Cataclysm_, Hugh Fox talks about a connection between the
Quechuans of Peru, and the Phoenicians, who transported Solomon's gold
over the seas in 1000 BC. Peru was named after the Pirua dynasty, which
is sometimes pronounced with the sound of an &quot;f&quot; as in &quot;Phirua,&quot;
creating a linguistic connection to Ophir.

In 1165, Benjamin of Tudela (son of Jonah), in Spain, set out to
explore the world, recording his adventures in his _Book of Travels_.&quot;
In the mountains of Persia, he ran across Jewish tribesmen who he
believed were descendants of the tribes of Dan, Zebulun, Asher, and
Naphtali. In Arabia, he discovered the largest Jewish settlement in the
region- the Jews of Kheibar, who he identified as being from the tribes
of Reuben and Gad.

In the early 16th century, Bartholeme de Las Casas, wrote of the
Indians in the West Indies, Peru, and Guatemala: &quot;Indeed, I can bring
proofs from the Bible that they are of the Lost Tribes.&quot; A report 120
years later by Portuguese traveler Antonio Montezinos indicated that
there was an Indian tribe living beyond the mountain passes of the Andes
that represented a remnant of a Jewish tribe. He wrote: &quot;I myself heard
them recite the She'ma (the expression of Jewish faith) and saw them
observe the Jewish rituals.&quot;

Following the Trail and Playing the Name Game

The producer of the video _The Quest for the Lost Tribes_, Simcha
Jacobovici, believes that he located Israelite tribes scattered around
the area of central Asia. In 2 Kings 18:11 is says that &quot;the king of
Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in
Habor, by the river of Gozan...&quot; In the border area between Afghanistan
and northwest Pakistan is the Kyber Pass. The word &quot;Kyber&quot; is similar to
&quot;Hybor.&quot; But also in the area is a river named Gazni, and a city named
Harat.

In this border land of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kashmir, can be found
the world's largest tribal group, the Parthans. Among the 15 million
Parthans are about 60 tribes who say they are Musa'ha, or the people of
Moses, and some even claim descent from Kish, an ancestor of King Saul.
They follow a pre-Islamic code known as the Puchtanwalli, which is very
similar to Old Testament law, perform circumcision on the 8th day, wear
a fringed garment similar to the Jewish tzizit, light candles on Friday
night, and observe strict dietary laws. Among their many tribes are
names like Ephriedi (Ephraim), Rabani (Reuben), Levani (Levi), Shinwari
(Shimon, similar to Simeon), and Gadun (Gad).

In South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique, tens of thousands of the
country's natives have declared themselves to be the descendents of one
of the Lost Tribes. The South African tribe known as the Lemba are very
familiar with Old Testament law and avoid marriage outside their tribe.
They say that they were cut-off from mainstream Judaism hundreds of
years ago. They perform ritual sacrifice of animals, which is clearly
not an African tradition. From Judea, they went to Sena (originally
believed to be Sanaa, Yemen or nearby Sayhut, on the southern coast of
Arabia; but was actually located at the end of Wadi Masilah and called
Sena in South Yemen), and crossed over to Africa via Pusela.

There are Ethiopian Jews known as Falashas (Amharic word for
&quot;landless&quot;) that, according to tradition are descendents of one of the
ten tribes. Their religious practices are transcribed in the Orit, or
the Torah translated into the Gez language. They have become associated
with the tribe of Dan.

There are thousands of words and names of places that have no real
etymological meaning in Japanese, but they do correspond to Hebrew words.

Japanese: daberu = &quot;chatting&quot; (Hebrew, daber = &quot;to speak&quot;)

Japanese: gai'jeen = prefix for &quot;foreigner&quot; (Hebrew, goi = &quot;foreigner&quot;)

Japanese: koru = &quot;to freeze&quot; (Hebrew, kor = &quot;cold&quot;)

Japanese: kensei = &quot;constitutional government&quot; (Hebrew, knesset =
&quot;parliament&quot;)

Several artifacts found in Japan have been traced to Assyrian and
Jewish sources, such as a well in Koryugi, that has the words &quot;well of
Israel&quot; inscribed on its side.

Among the Samurai (similar to word &quot;Samaria&quot;) class is a tradition that
their ancient ancestors immigrated to Japan from western Asia around 600
BC. It has been said that Mikado, the Japanese emperor, was a descendent
of the tribe of Gad. The name &quot;Mikado&quot; is similar to the Hebrew word
&quot;Malchuto&quot; which means &quot;his majesty the king.&quot;

The Japanese name of &quot;Sakai&quot; is similar to &quot;Sakka,&quot; and could possibly
explain why there are a lot of strange customs of unknown origin that
indicates to some researchers that the east Jordan tribes of Manasseh
(most prominent), Reuben and Gad, made their way to the island of Japan.

In Isaiah 49:12, the prophet wrote: &quot;Behold, these shall come from far:
and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land
of Sinim.&quot; He prophesied the return of Israel from all over the world.
Sinim is the Hebrew word for China.

In fort-like villages in the mountains of the Chinese-Tibetan border,
live the Chiang-Min of West Szechuan, who, it is believed, are the
descendents of the descendents of ancient Israelites who arrived in
China, hundreds of years before Christ. They believe in one God, and in
times of agony, cry out the word &quot;Yawei,&quot; which sounds like &quot;Yahweh,&quot;
the Hebrew name for God, according to the Scottish missionary Rev.
Thomas Torrance, who visited them in the 1920's. Their priests wore
girdles to bind their robes, just like ancient Israelite priests, and
also carried sacred staffs shaped like a serpent that was reminiscent of
the brass serpent fabricated by Moses in the wilderness.

Some of these migrations may have taken place as late as the 17th
century when members of the tribe of Manesseh said that the Atlantic
trip to Plymouth was prophesied (Isaiah 49:20) to the leadership of the
House of Israel - Ephraim (England).

In the Bible, the Book of Ezekiel, chapters 38 and 39, describe an
invasion of Israel, and identifies the enemy as Russia. In 1930, the
Soviet Union released a 14 kopek postage stamp to commemorate their
future invasion of Palestine. According to Ezekiel 38:8, 11, and 14,
this invasion will not occur, until Israel has been placed under the
protection, of what seems to be some sort of diplomatic treaty. Israel
already has a Peace Accord with Egypt, and a treaty between Israel and
the P.L.O. was worked out. In October, 1994, a peace accord was signed
with Jordan. Yet these don't seem to fit the all-encompassing protection
insinuated in this passage.

This invasion will be World War III, and will include the Arab nations
(Esau's descendants) who will go against Israel (Jacob's descendants)
for stealing their birthright. In order to decipher the line-up of
participants given in the 38th chapter of Ezekiel, we need to analyze it
geographically, and this involves a detailed look at the list of the
sons of Japheth, who was a son of Noah: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan,
Tubul, Meshech, and Tiras, who repopulated the Earth after the Flood
(3rd chapter of Genesis).

In 1847, Sir Henry Layard discovered the Assyrian capital city of
Nineveh, and the Royal Palace, which contained over 23,000 clay tablets
describing all kinds of things. These reports give the names used by the
Assyrians for the different groups of Israelites that were planted as a
buffer between them and their enemies. The &quot;Royal Letters&quot; date back to
707 BC, which is about 14 years after the defeat of Samaria. Letters
#1079 (describes the defeat of the Urartians), and its follow-up #197
(which says it occurred in the land of Gamir) were written by
Sennacherib to his father, King Sargon. Letter #112 talks about a people
that &quot;went forth&quot; from the midst of the Mannai, into the &quot;land of
Urartu,&quot; while another letter distinctly separates the Urartians, the
Mannai, and the Gamera (or Gimira), which means the people in Letter
#112 are Gamerraan, or in English, the &quot;Cimmerians.&quot;

The &quot;Iskuza&quot; (Amos 7:16, House of Isaac?) apparently lived among the
Mannai. Isaac is believed to be the foundation for the name &quot;Scythian&quot;
(which is what the Israelites were known by in Media in 600 BC). The
Iskuza were called &quot;Shuthae&quot; by the Greeks, &quot;Sacae&quot; (Saka or Sakka) by
the Persians, which refers to a nomad, wanderer, or one who lives in a
tent or &quot;booth.&quot; The word &quot;booth&quot; in Hebrew is &quot;succoth.&quot;

Magog's descendants settled in the area of Armenia, which is in
southern Russia, after being driven north through the Caucasus mountains
by the Medes. This race came to be known as the Scythians, and were
called 'Magogites' by the Greeks. The Chinese name for the Caucasus
mountains running through Russia mean 'Fort of Gog,' while the Russians
call their peaks, the 'Gogh.' The Arabic term for the Great Wall of
China is 'the wall of Al Magog,' because it was erected with the
intention of keeping out the armies of Magog. Their descendants include
the Tarters, Cossacks, Kalmuks, and the Mongols. The _Kesses HaSofer_, a
Jewish Commentary, indicates that the word 'Mongol,' which identifies
the Siberian-Russian people, comes from the word 'Magog.'

Between 525-300 BC, those driven out of southern Russia by the
Scythians, moved north-west between the Oder and Vistula Rivers to the
Baltic, and became known as the Cimbri. Between 250-100 BC, when
southern Russia was invaded by the Sarmatians from the east, the
Scythians were driven northwest through Poland into Germany. After 450
AD, the Romans called the Scythians &quot;Germans,&quot; meaning &quot;genuine,&quot; to
distinguish them from the Sarmatians in Scythia. Between 450-600 AD, as
Anglo-Saxons (it has been said that &quot;Saxon&quot; means &quot;Isaac's son&quot;), they
went to Britain; while others settled in Gaul, becoming known as
Normans, and ultimately the people of France. Immigrants from Gaul went
to England, Ireland, Scotland, as well as Southern Italy and Sicily.

The tribe of Dan declined to accept their land when Joshua divided it
up, and they marched up the Jordan valley to the city of Laish,
conquered it, and called it the city of Dan. They made their way to what
is now known as Greece, where they dominated the people who were living
there, the Pelasgians. They became known as the Danaoi. They established
the settlement of Ionia on the Ionian Isles. A branch migrated to
Ireland and were known as the &quot;Tuatha de Danaan,&quot; then went to Denmark
as the Danes, eventually making their way to Britain.

In the Septuagint (Greek) translation of the Bible, it describes 'Gog'
as the 'prince of Rosh.' Rosh was the name of a tribe living in the area
of the Volga. In some languages, Rosh is the word for the country of
Russia. The ancient form of the name Russia, is 'Ros.' The Chinese had
called the Scythians 'Rosh.' The King James Version translated 'Rosh' to
mean 'chief prince,' because in Hebrew it means 'head'; but in the
Septuagint version, 'Rosh' is used as the proper name it is believed to be.

An interesting fact from the Oxford Paperback Encyclopedia (from Oxford
University Press) is that there is a British legend that identifies Gog
and Magog as the survivors of a race of giants destroyed by Brutus the
Trojan, the legendary founder of London. They were depicted in statues
erected at London's Guildhall during the reign of Henry V, but were
destroyed by the Fire of London in 1666. Reconstructed, they were again
destroyed during the air raids of the Blitz in 1940. The current statues
were created in 1953. Models of these &quot;gods&quot; are carried through the
streets during the Lord Mayor's annual procession.

The descendants of Meshech (known to the Assyrians as 'Mushku'),
settled in western Russia, where they established a city called Meshech,
later known as Mosach, then Moscovi (Muscovy or Moscow), which is the
capital of Russia.

Tubal's descendants lived in the area of the Black Sea, then moved
north, settling in the eastern part of Russia, establishing the city of
Tobolsk. Their descendants include the Iberians, Georgians,
Cappadocians, as well as other Asiatic and European peoples.

The Behistun Rock was found in the 1700 foot high Zargos mountains in
northwestern Iran, 300 foot above the ground on a sheer face, The relief
had been commissioned by Darius the Great in 515 BC, and lists the
peoples and nations he defeated and ruled over as part of the
Medo-Persian Empire. It is interesting to point out, that while he was
putting down the Israelite insurrection, he was helping the Jews to
rebuild the Temple.

The Rock (confirmed by Darius' tomb, as well as a golden tablet that
talks about the &quot;Sakka&quot;) is inscribed in three languages, is 100 feet
high, and 150 feet wide. By 1840, it had been deciphered by Sir Henry C.
Rawlinson. The name &quot;Kana&quot; (Canaan) appears 28 times. &quot;Sakka&quot; in Persian
and Elamite, &quot;Sacae&quot; in Greek, is &quot;Gimri&quot; in Babylonian. Assyrian and
Babylonian are nearly the same. &quot;Sakka&quot; comes from &quot;Isaac,&quot; (pronounced
&quot;e-sahk&quot; with emphasis on the last syllable) and became &quot;Saxon.&quot; &quot;Gimri&quot;
comes from the Assyrian &quot;Khumri&quot; (after Biblical House of &quot;Omri,&quot; 6th
King of Israel) and became Ghumri, Gimira, Gimmira, the Greek
&quot;Kimmeroii,&quot; or English &quot;Cimmerian.&quot; According to 2 Esdras 13:40-44 of
the Apocrypha, they migrated to Europe.

Gomer's desecendants (known to the Assyrians as 'Gimirrai' or
'Cimmerians') settled in central Asia Minor, north of the Black Sea, in
southern Russia, then moved west along the Danube River, to the area now
known as Germany. He was the father of Eastern Europe. Old world maps
identify this area as Gomer, Gomerlunt, Gomeria. Their descendants
include the Galatians, Phrygians, Gauls, Celts (Greek &quot;Keltoi&quot;),
Germans, French, Welsh, Irish, Britons, and other Anglo-Saxon peoples.
In addition, Togarmah (known to the Assyrians as 'Tilgarimmu'), a son of
Gomer, is singled out. His descendants occupied Turkey and Asia Minor,
and another branch settled in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which were
later taken over by the Soviet Union. They were granted independence in
September, 1991.

Togarmah's 'bands' could also refer to Armenia and Syria, whose
ancestors claimed that Haik, the father of their race, was the son of
Togarmah. The descendants of another son of Gomer, Ashkenaz, settled in
Germany and Austria.

Between 650-500 BC, the Cimmerians in Europe moved up the Danube and
became known as Celts. After the Celts attacked Rome in 390 BC, and
lived in northern Italy for 200 years, they migrated to Asia Minor, then
west to France and then Britain.

After being defeated, taken captive, and exiled to an area below the
Black and Caspian Seas, the Assyrians used their prisoners as a buffer
against the Medes. While the main body of prisoners remained in the area
about a hundred years, the Israelites slowly began moving to the east
and the north. When the power of the Assyrians was broken, there were
several migrations, with the two main groups moving west under the Black
Sea, north through the Dariel Pass of the Caucasas Mountains into the
steppes of southern Russia. A large group also migrated east. They were
called Sakka (Saka) and Iskuza by the Medes and the Persians.

What this all seems to indicate, is that the main attack force will
emanate from Russia, and that they will be accompanied by their former
communist satelites (&quot;bands&quot;), which could include the Baltic states,
Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, and Yugoslavia (perhaps including Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and Macedonia). These countries represent a total military
force of nearly 6,000,000 men. In light of Russia's past history, they
have never been able to be trusted. It is likely that during this
period, when democracy seems to be taking root in the former Soviet
Union, it may only be an illusion. Even though drastic changes have been
made, maybe they were done only to project the image of weakness, so
they can regroup and retool their military machine in preparation for
their biggest assault yet.

In Russia, there was a growing anti-Jewish sentiment, which was
enflamed by nationalist leader Vladimir Zhrinovsky, who seemed to be
building the support needed to win the presidency of Russia. He had been
compared to Hitler. In his book _The Final March to the South_, he
stated that it was Russia's destiny to capture all of the lands to the
south- including Israel.

This attack will also include Persia (the descendants of Madai, son of
Japheth; which includes Iran, Iraq, and possibly Syria and Afghanistan),
Ethiopia (the descendants of Cush, the son of Ham, another son of Noah),
and Libya (the descendants of Phut, the son of Ham). These nations may
represent the radical element of the Arab world.

Salah Khalaf Abu lyad, Yasir Arafat's chief deputy, said on January 1,
1991: &quot;Now we accept the formation of the Palestinian state in part of
Palestine, in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. We will start from that part
and we will liberate Palestine, inch by inch.&quot; In a September 9, 1993
letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Arafat renounced his
terrorist activities and said: &quot;The P.L.O. recognizes the right of the
state of Israel to exist in peace and security.&quot; On September 13th, a
Declaration of Principles was signed with Israel during a ceremony in
Washington, DC. Yet, on September 19th, P.L.O. Chairman Arafat said
before a group of 19 Arab ministers meeting in Cairo: &quot;Our first goal is
the liberation of all occupied territories...and the establishment of a
Palestinian state whose capital is Jerusalem. The agreement we arrived
at is not a complete solution...it is only the basis for an interim
solution and the forerunner of a final settlement, which must be based
on a complete withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian lands, especially
holy Jerusalem.&quot;

In October, 1994, Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the P.L.O.'s political
department and their foreign minister, said in a speech: &quot;There is a
state which was established through historical force and it must be
destroyed. This is the Palestinian way.&quot; Arafat later told Rabin, the
Israeli Prime Minister, that his comment did not reflect the view of the
P.L.O. It is obvious that this is a very fragile peace. In October,
1998, a peace accord was signed by Arafat and Netanyahu, that
surrendered 13% of Israeli land to the Palestinians as part of a land
for peace agreement brokered by the U.S.

A corresponding passage can be found in Daniel 11:40-43/, /where the
Russian confederation is referred to as the &quot;King of the North&quot; (the
only military power north of Israel). History has shown that Russia has
supported the Arab nations in their quest to conquer Palestine, and the
aforementioned group of nations will join the Russian invasion force
that will sweep across the mountains of Lebanon into Israel.

It is also important to note that there is evidence of Israelites in
this country before the Assyrian deportation. There have been
paleo-Hebrew inscriptions found in Tennessee that are 3,000 years old.
How about the unusual custom of the American Indian tribes referring to
themselves as nations. In North Carolina, the Machapunga Indians
circumcise their babies and have some traditions that are similar to the
Jews, as do the Savanna Indians from the banks of the Mississippi River.

Feast of Tabernacles. In _True Discoverers of America_ William

Los Lunas Decalogue Stone

Carved into the flat face of a large boulder on the side of Hidden
Mountain, (also known as Mystery Mountain) in the desert near Los Lunas
(about 35 mils south of Albuquerque), New Mexico, is an ancient stone
inscription known as the Los Lunas Decalogue Stone. This inscription is
an abridged version of the Ten Commandments, written in the old Hebrew
alphabet, with a few Greek letters mixed in. Professor Frank Hibben, a
local historian, and retired archaeologist from the University of New
Mexico &quot;is convinced that the inscription is ancient and thus
authentic.&quot; It is done in old Hebrew or Phoenician letters. The old
Hebrew alphabet was virtually identical to the mid-Phoenician alphabet
from the 10th to 6th century B.C. It was only after the Jewish return
from the Babylonian exile in 539 B.C. did their scribes begin developing
their own script known as square Hebrew.

The old Hebrew and Phoenician characters used are most like those used
between 1100 and 600 B.C. Some of the known Middle Eastern inscriptions
which are similar are those from the Eshmunazar Sarcophagus (4th century
B.C.), Jewish Seals, the Nerab Stelae, and the Bar Rakab Inscription.
George Moorehouse, a professional geologist, concluded that 500 to 2000
years would not be an unreasonable estimate of its age. The consensus is
that it can be dated somewhere between the 3rd and 1st century B.C.,
which lines up with a date given to the nearby Zodiac Calendar Stone.

People knew of the inscription in 1850, but couldn't read it. Indian
tradition said that it predated their tribes coming to the area. In
1949, Robert H. Pfeiffer of Harvard University made the first known
translation of the inscription and indicated that it was the Ten
Commandments. He believed it was written in Phoenician, Moabite and
Greek; and local native Americans began referring to it as the
Phoenician Inscription Rock (as well as the Ten Commandments Rock).

Early speculation was that it may have been carved by one of the lost
tribes of Israel. Others believed that it was a Mormon forgery, yet it
had not been exploited by the Church as proof for the existence of the
ancient Nephites in America.

The inscription contains the Greek tau, zeta, delta, and kappa
(reversed) in place of their Hebrew counterparts taw, zayin, daleth, and
caph, which indicates a Greek influence, as well as a post-Alexandrian
date, despite the archaic form of aleph used. The letters yodh, goph,
and the flat-bottomed shin have a distinctly Samaritan form, which
suggests that the inscription may be Samaritan in origin. In 1995, Cyrus
Gordon suggested that it was a Samaritan mezuzah. Where the Jewish
mezuzah referred to a tiny scroll placed in a small container and
mounted on the entrance of a house; the Samaritan counterpart was
commonly a large slab bearing an abridged version of the Decalogue or
Ten Commandments. He said it dates back to the Byzantine period.

In 1989, another researcher said that the inscription was made by a
person whose primary language was Greek, but had a secondary
comprehension of Hebrew.

In 1995, Gordon pointed out that wealthy Samaritan shipowners were
known to have lived in Greek communities at the time of Theodosius I
(circa 390 A.D.). One Samaritan synagogue in Palestine, at Sha'alvim, in
Judea, northwest of Jerusalem, is simultaneously inscribed with
religious inscriptions in Samaritan letters and secular inscriptions in
Greek. Another synagogue at Tell Quasile in Tel Aviv shows considerable
Greek architectural influence.

In August, 1998, Professor Reinhard Plummer said that he didn't think
that the inscription was Samaritan, but instead said that it was
actually closer to the Masoretic standard Jewish text.

Assuming that the inscription is Hebrew, it can be proven that the Jews
had shipbuilding ability to make vessels capable of overseas travel. In
the Bible, Phoenician King Hiram of Tyre (1 Kings 10:22) and King
Solomon (1 Kings 9:27) used ocean-going ships around 1000 B.C. They were
based in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, and had access to the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans.

The inscription is translated as the following:

&quot;I am Jehovah your God who has taken you out of the land of Egypt, from
the house of slaves. There must be no other gods before my face. You
must not make any idol. You must not take the name of Jehovah in vain.
Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. Honour your father and mother
so that your days may be long in the land that Jehovah your God has
given to you. You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You
must not steal. You must not give a false witness against your neighbor.
You must not desire the wife of your neighbor nor anything that is his.&quot;

The site also contains three occurrences of the Tetragrammaton,
inscribed in old Hebrew letters, and may be one of the oldest surviving
written samples of the Tetragrammaton in the world. It is composed of
four Hebrew consonants- yod, he, waw, and he, and signifies the divine
name of God, which is commonly rendered as Jehovah. One of the
inscriptions is found on the south pinnacle, which may have served as an
altar. The Tetragrammaton is written in paleo-Hebraic letters similar to
the Decalogue, but is more eroded.

The Newark Decalogue Stone and Keystone

The Johnson-Bradner Stone

In November, 1860, in a burial mound about ten miles south of Newark,
David Wyrick of Newark, Ohio discovered a sandstone box that had been
hollowed out, and inside he found an engraved fine-grained black stone
(identified as a limestone). It had been inscribed on each side with a
condensed version of the Ten Commandments in a strange form of
post-Exilic square Hebrew letters; with a robed and bearded figure on
the front, which has been identified as Moses.

The lettering begins at the top, runs down the left side, around every
available space on the back and sides, then back up the right side of
front to where it begins. It measures 6-7/8&quot; long, 2-7/8&quot; wide, and
1-3/4&quot; thick.

Earlier, in June, in a developed section of Newark, at the bottom of a
pit adjacent to the extensive ancient Hopewellian earthworks, Wyrick had
found a &quot;keystone&quot; shaped stone which was also inscribed with Hebrew
letters. The four sides have been translated to read: &quot;Holy of Holies,&quot;
&quot;King of the Earth,&quot; &quot;The Law of God,&quot; and &quot;The Word of God.&quot; The
letters are in standard Hebrew, compared to the lettering on the
Decalogue Stone. These letters were already developed by the time of the
Dead Sea Scrolls (200-100 B.C.) and are consistent with any time frame
from the Hopewellian era to the present. For the past 1000 years or so,
Hebrew has most commonly been written with vowel and consonant points,
which are missing on both the Keystone and Decalogue Stone (also known
as the Newark Holy Stones). The absence of points is therefore
suggestive, but not conclusive, of an earlier date.

In 1867, David M. Johnson, a banker, found a stone in the same mound
group south of Newark. Though the original stone was lost, a lithograph
of it is still in existence, and can be found in the
Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum at Roscoe Village (300 Whitewoman Street,
Coshocton, Ohio), co-founded by Johnson and Dr. N. Roe Bradner of
Pennsylvania; which also contains both the Decalogue Stone and Keystone.

The letters on the lid and base are in the same unusual alphabet as the
Decalogue Stone and wraps around in the same manner, but the lithograph
is not clear enough for a reliable translation. However, this discovery,
by reputable people, helps confirm the authenticity of Wyrick's discovery.

The Migration Mystery

It can be determined that there was an ancient Hebrew presence in our
own country, and that the same tribes have left their mark in different
locations throughout the world. While there were indeed migrations from
the point of their Assyrian exile, it's obvious that, in some cases, the
tribes branched off and were assimilated into existing populations. It
is difficult to determine to what extent they became dominant, and
further migrated; so it would be highly improbable that an accurate
determination can be made in regard to how individual tribes impact
prophecy.

Focusing on Israel

A map drawn by monks during the Crusades, still hangs in the Herford
Cathedral, and identifies Jerusalem as the geographic center of the
world, which is so marked on the floor of the Holy Sepulcher. The
attention of the world will become more focused on this area of the
world as this nation becomes prosperous.

The Dead Sea, located between Israel and Jordan, which is 1,296 feet
below sea level, is the lowest spot on the surface of the Earth. It is
fifty miles long and eleven miles wide (about 500 square miles), and has
a depth of 1,200 feet at its deepest point. Known as the 'Sea of Salt,'
because it is ten times saltier than ocean water, it is fed by the
Jordan River, and has no outlet. Its waters have evaporated for hundreds
of years in the extreme heat, at a rate of 280 million cubic feet per
day, leaving behind a variety of minerals. It is made up of 30% of solid
ingredients, mostly sodium chloride (salt), while regular ocean water
has only 3.5% to 4%.

The water contains potassium chloride, or potash, which is used as a
fertilizer and for making explosives. It is of high quality becomes it
doesn't come from rock. It is believed that this ingredient will become
a very valuable commodity.

The water also contains magnesium bromine (used to make plastics and
rubber), magnesium chloride (used in magnesium metal production and in
the manufacturing of a cement used for heavy duty flooring), and
hydrogen sulfide (used in chemical laboratories as an analytical
re-agent). Because of its sulfuric content, the water is said to have
therapeutic properties.

Solar ponds have been built on the Sea. The sun heats the shallow salt
water, and the heat is trapped in the dense salt layer on the bottom,
and becomes hot enough to turn a turbine, thus producing electricity.

Scientists have also discovered an algae, known as Dunaliella, which
can survive in, and has adapted to, the extremely salty conditions. It
is being grown in algae farms where they double their numbers every two
days. The algae is used to produce a green paste, which, when dried,
makes an excellent animal feed because of its high protein content, and
it is easy to digest because the algae have no cell walls. It also
yields beta carotene (a pigment which gives carrots its color), which is
used for food coloring; and also glycerol, which is used for eye shadow
and other cosmetics, paints, resins, and toothpaste. When the algae
decomposes, it forms the raw material that nature uses to form oil.

The value of the mineral deposits in the Dead Sea has been estimated at
over a trillion dollars. However, the Dead Sea has been shrinking in
size as the sea level has fallen. The Mediterranean Dead Sea Co.
initiated a $1.4 billion project to funnel water to the Dead Sea from
the Mediterranean, which is about 70 miles away.

Geological surveys have indicated that there is plenty of steam under
Israel to provide power through the harnessing of geo-thermal energy,
which is a very economical source of energy. Oil and natural gas
deposits have also been discovered. Cutting diamonds is a major
industry, as is the exporting citrus fruit to Europe and Japan.

With Russia experiencing financial hardships, there are plenty of
resources in this small country that could be garnished for their benefit.

After the Attack Begins

No doubt, Israel will offer tremendous resistance, causing Russia to
change their plans, and circle around Israel. Daniel mentions that
&quot;Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon&quot; will not be
overrun. Ironically, they, along with the Israelites, Arabians,
Ishmaelites, and Midianites were the descendants of Arphaxad, the son of
Shem, the middle son of Noah. Their land was on the eastern shore of the
Dead Sea, in an area now occupied by the country of Jordan, who on
September 14, 1993 signed an agenda for peace with Israel, which
culminated with Peace Treaty that was signed in October, 1994./ /This
seems to be an indication that even though they sided with Iraq during
the Gulf War, they will stick to their treaty with Israel and not become
part of the invasion.

Russia will then double-cross their allies, and strike the country of
Egypt, in order to control the land bridge, giving them a three-way
advantage to attacking either Europe, Africa, or Asia. Egypt, along with
Saudi Arabia, were the two main Arab countries who broke their military
ties with Russia; plus, since they are not mentioned, they may also
continue to honor their Treaty with Israel, and not join in the attack.
The target most likely will be Saudi Arabia, and the world's oil supply.
At this point, the West will probably mobilize. Nixon said: &quot;If Russia
disturbs the balance of power in the Middle East, the United States will
move to assure Israel's security.&quot; Jimmy Carter, in a 1978 meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, said: &quot;I can say, without
reservation, as President of the United States of America, that we will
continue to do so (remain committed to Israel's security), not just for
thirty years, but forever.&quot;

The nations that will protest and respond to this action are identified
as Sheba (also Saba), an ancient kingdom in the area of the southwestern
edge of Saudi Arabia which became known as the British colony of Aden,
until achieving independence as South Yemen (who united with North Yemen
in 1990). This was the traditional kingdom of the Queen of Sheba who
ruled over the Sabaeans (who dominated all of southern Arabia), and was
labeled in Matthew 12:42 as the 'Queen of the South.' The historian
Josephus referred to her as the &quot;Queen of Egypt and Ethiopia.&quot; Dedan was
the name of a Sabaean oasis in the northern part of Saudi Arabia, which
was one of their many colonies in northern Arabia.

Another identifying indication again comes from Biblical genealogy.
Cush, the son of Ham, was the father of Ethiopia, and other tribes who
settled south of Egypt, in Arabia, Babylonia and India. Cush's sons are
identified as Seba (who in Psalms 72:10 is associated with the kings of
Sheba, and in Isaiah 43:3 are mentioned with Ethiopia, which indicates
that he is the father of the Sabaeans); Havilah (a name associated with
the area of the Sinai and northwestern Arabia); Sabtah, Raamah, and
Sabtechah (all three of which were associated with tribes in southern
Arabia). Sheba and Dedan are listed as sons of Raamah. Thus, the
reference to Sheba and Dedan actually identifies the country of Saudi
Arabia (and also the countries of Oman, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, and Bahrain). They were an ally of the Coalition against Iraq
during the Gulf War, and will not be part of the Russian invasion force
against Israel.

As the Russian juggernaut appears to be heading their way, Saudi Arabia
will appeal to the &quot;merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions
thereof.&quot; According to Jeremiah 10:9, Tarshish is identified as a land
rich with precious metals; and in other passages, such as Isaiah 2:16,
are associated with possessing a prominent shipping empire which was
used to export goods to places all over the Mediterranean. Some
researchers have tried to connect Tarshish with Tartessus (located in
the Guadalquivir Valley) in southwestern Spain, where the Phoenicians
founded colonies to capitalize on the wealth of minerals found there.

The Phoenicians established the city of Carthage on Africa's northern
coast (in what is now Tunisia), and it was these Carthaginians who began
colonizing Spain in 654 BC (until they were driven out by the Romans in
206 BC), and exploring the Atlantic coastline from western Africa to
Britain. Recent archaeological evidence has shown that they possessed
sailing capabilities far beyond what was originally known. An
inscription discovered in 1780 on a cliff above Mount Hope Bay in
Bristol, Rhode Island, which was written in Tartessian Punic, reads:
&quot;Voyagers from Tarshish this stone proclaims.&quot; It is believed that this
inscription was made about 533 BC. Howard University's Dept. of
Archaeology has found five other areas in the United States where
Tarshish had colonies 2500 years ago.

Tarshish was a great-grandson of Noah, whose descendants migrated to
the areas which later became Spain and Great Britain. Ezekiel 27:12
indicates that Tarshish was a source of tin, and the word 'Britain'
means &quot;land of tin.&quot; Both Spain, with their Armada, and England, became
major naval powers. An analysis of these facts indicate that Tarshish
probably refers to western Europe, and by extension, the ten major
nations who will make up the European Community at the time; and the
&quot;young lions&quot; refer to the United States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, their possessions and allies. This represents a total military
force of about 3,000,000 men.

Once the Arab world realizes that they have been betrayed by the
Russians, they will solidify into a military force similar to the Arab
League, which was formed in Cairo in March, 1945; and the Federation of
Arab Republics which was formed in April, 1971, and are identified as
the &quot;King of the South.&quot; This confederation, will include the twelve
princes (sons) of Ishmael (Gen. 25:16), which scholars have identified
as Egypt, Persia (Iraq and Iran), Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Yemen, Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia; plus the countries
of Ethiopia, Bahrain, Djibouti, Kuwait, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar,
Somalia, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Cyprus, Afghanistan, Pakistan and
the Palestine Liberation Organization. This represents a total military
force of about 3,000,000 men.

The Arab nations will be soundly defeated. According to the 35th
chapter of Ezekiel, where they are referred to as Mount Seir (because
Esau dwelt in that land, Deut. 2:4-5), they will be destroyed because of
their hatred of Israel.

After their defeat of the Arab nations, Russia will receive reports
concern troop movements in China, and the initiation of retaliatory
strike by the coalition of Western nations; and they will regroup to
attack Israel again. They will position themselves in the &quot;valley of the
passengers on the east of the sea,&quot; which is east of the Sea of Galilee
and the Dead Sea. Ezekiel's description of &quot;the fire of my wrath...a
great shaking...great hailstones, fire, and brimstone&quot; directed at the
Russian army appears to be the result of a one day (Ez. 39:8) nuclear
attack by the coalition of nations from the West, that destroys 5/6 of
the Russian forces. So many men will die, that it will take seven months
to bury the dead bodies. They will be burning the weapons for seven
years. It was reported that Russia was producing war equipment out of
wood treated with lignostone, a chemical that had been developed in
Holland as a fuel substitute. It makes wood as strong as steel, yet
remains pliable. Since it is wood, and not metal, it doesn't show up on
radar. It was reported that the British are using a similar substance
for gears in their large vehicles. Material treated with this chemical
burns brightly with intense heat, and will make it easier for the
weapons to be burned.

The incredible defeat of the Russian military machine, will make a star
out of the leader of the Western European Alliance (who will take the
credit for orchestrating and leading the attack), just as the Gulf War
did for Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. It is possible that this man may be the
Antichrist. He will appear to be a man who will finally be able to bring
peace to the world. He will claim that Israel has a special place in his
heart, and he will make a seven-year treaty (Dan. 9:27) with them to
guarantee the Jew's national security. This treaty will allow Israel to
rebuild their Temple, and during the next 31/2 years, the man who will
become the protector of the Jews will quickly gain popularity, and power.

If, according to certain indications, this man does come from the
Prieure' de Sion, and claims to represent to bloodline of Jesus, this
revelation will greatly increase his international stature.

Even though there were 300 specific predictions concerning Jesus, the
Jewish people didn't accept him because they were expecting a great
conqueror to deliver them from the Romans. However, it won't take long
for this western European leader to be heralded as the Messiah they have
been waiting for.
