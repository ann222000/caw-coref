Pretty interesting - the article manages to get a lot of angles in but
fails a bit to stress what I call the &quot;hindsight factor&quot;. You can only
judge actions and people by what was known back when the decision was

On what basis are you judging Iraq a &quot;failure?&quot;

It seems to me that there are exactly two such bases, the absence of
which would lead instantly to the judgement that Iraq was a stunning
success:

(1)  Some 4,000 troops having been killed in four and a half years.

(2)  The high level of violence Iraq still sees.

Remove these two things, and make Iraq quiet and the USA losing zero
soldiers, and everyone would be delighted.

Now explain to me how, say, the Philippines Campaign of 1944-45 can
possibly be considered a &quot;victory&quot; if you're calling Iraq a &quot;failure.&quot;
I mean, three times the KIA in one-quarter the time, all to capture an
isolated island of no strategic or economic importance.

I dunno, dude.  It almost seems like a great many things you military
types call &quot;great victories&quot; are going to have to be re-cast as utter,
total, blackest defeats using that *nouveau* military yardstick that
calls Iraq a &quot;failure.&quot;

Shit, D-Day caused US casualties to go fucking bananas - and pushed
western Europe into a thundering spasm of violence that was felt for
generations.

Failure?  Giant one?  Eisenhower should have been shot and Roosevelt
impeached?

But you can also see the errors in your logic at the time.  I
supported the war.  I did a lot of &quot;if X then Y&quot; reasoning back then.
I'm a computer programmer, I had laid out a lot of the case logic
pretty exactly.

For instance, the beancounting argument.  I figured that a certain
number of Iraqis were &quot;dead to history&quot; no matter what happened.
Either Saddam would kill them under his regime, or we would kill them
as collateral damage.  I thought we would kill a lot less guys than
Saddam would.  Absent WMDs, I now think I was wrong.  Heard a NPR
report about a fairly credible scientist, who get a Nobel Peace Prize
for his work on estimating deaths in Rwanda and the Belgian Congo.
He` used the same methodology in Iraq and was pretty much shut out of
the press.  He came up with ~100K deaths most likely, in the middle of
his bell curve.  But his bell curve had a huge range, like 8K deaths
minimum and 250K deaths maximum or something like that.  Not a
certainty.  But enough to suggest that *lots* of people have died.
More than Saddam may have gotten around to in the next decade or so.

I don't think the numbers broke out who was supposed to die either,
i.e. combatants vs. innocent bystanders.  But it's enough to suggest
that I probably lost the beancount.  I  think I had naive ideas about
how many people were going to die.  I also think the gov. wants to
keep us as naive as possible about the issue, so that we won't object.

Another area where I was clearly naive is I assumed some kind of post
WW II Marshal Plan.  I assumed there would be a lot of troops to keep
stability and aid to get the Iraqis back on their feet.  Bullshit!
The USA only likes democracy on the cheap.  The cost of the war was
clearly softpedaled so that it would be approved by Congress.  That
was a big lie.  The USA was never going to do a &quot;first class&quot; job of
putting Iraq back together again, it was going to bargain basement the
whole thing and the results, in hindsight, were predictable.  Some
people predicted it with foresight and they were ignored because you
couldn't get the war approved that way.

I thought we were going to find WMDs and we didn't.  I think there's
only a small chance they were all buried in Syria or mysterious places
in Iraq.  I think it unlikely that such a thorough burying could have
left no trace, no squealers.  And if there were squealers, and stuff
was found, it wasn't in the Administration's interest to shut them
up.  They would have said, &quot;See!  See!&quot;

Leading up to the war, I had a bleeding heart liberal friend of mine
that I debated every week at the local pub.  He was always adamant
about how full of shit Bush was, how it was all a big lie, etc.  I
said he was making those statements without proof.  I think I was
correct to say it.  I think my friend was right about Bush for the
wrong reasons, because he didn't like him.  Hindsight has certainly
vindicated what he had to say about him though.

I am ready for the troops to come home.  Let the Iraqis have their
civil war.

I think the French, the Germans, and the Russians were right.  Bush
wanted &quot;automaticity,&quot; and it was not necessary for containing
Saddam.  More UN Weapons Inspectors could have kept him down for
awhile, if not indefinitely.

I am glad Saddam is dead.  Liberals never wanted to talk about what a
horrible despot he was.  Never wanted to blame him, it was always
about the USA.  Nevertheless, the price of killing Saddam was probably
~100K Iraqi dead and plunging the country into civil war.  Who's gonna
benefit other than Haliburton?

but we also see the world is full of nasty assholes. but we aren'y invading
them now are we? why? no oil.
as for WMDs there already is an islamic bomb. pakistan has it.
and the main reason iraq was invaded was because it didn't have the bomb. if
it had nukes we woulsn't have done it.

I was just using the common whiticism as shorthand.

The bottom line is that the US military got surprised by what it found
in Iraq and it got surprised because it had forgot many hard-fought
lessons of history.  Now everyone wants to say &quot;I saw it coming all
along.&quot;  That's bullshit.  Hardly anyone saw it coming, or we would

That is all I was trying to say with my quote.  We will only fail in

No.  I meant that seriously.

My point is that only by the new &quot;we-must-achieve-success-in-thirty-
days-at-a-cost-of-100-or-so-killed&quot; rules of war can anyone conclude *at
this point* that Iraq is anything like a &quot;failure.&quot;

See, I'd argue that point.  The real problem is not so much that the
military forgot anything, but that the home front had ridiculously high
expectations of &quot;zero casualties, zero troubles, home-by-Xmas&quot; exactly
because *they* forgot - if they ever knew - what the history of war is
like.

The old saw says that military machines are always ready to fight the
last war.  The truth is that the public always *expects* the last war.
In 1991, we expected Vietnam.  In 2003, we expected a quickie in-and-
out, casualty-free Gulf War.  Next time out, we'll expect to be able to
knock of an enemy regime at the cost of a company of troops and pacify
the place at the cost of a regiment.

My concern is how all these &quot;analyses&quot; of the Iraq War *while the war is
ongoing* affect the conduct of that very ongoing war.  Particularly when
one side of the &quot;analysis&quot; is heavily invested in an American defeat.

We argued *lots* of things about the Iraq war before it happened, for
a good 6 months.  Lots of homework.  Lots at stake.  Lots of soul
searching about whether we were personally going to take activist

Yes, they did.  The affordability of the war was emphasized over and
over again.  Congress went along with it hook, line, and sinker.  I
would never believe such a thing in the future, but at the time, I
didn't really have a basis of comparison.  I hadn't paid good
attention to the cost overruns of previous wars, nor am I sure that
any were billed as &quot;cheap wars.&quot;  Mind you, this is a war that had to
be justified by saying things like &quot;it'll be cheap, don't worry.&quot;
There wasn't an inherent moral justification like &quot;damn the cost,
we've been attacked!&quot;  It was preemptive, with appeals to terrorism
that sounded like lies to lots of people even then.  I didn't support
the war because of Al Qaeda, I supported it because I thought Saddam
should be knocked off and the Iraqis set free.

Just in case you think you're smarter than everybody else, and know
everything that happened about Iraq that us noobs missed.  Do you
realize that Saddam deliberately bluffed us into thinking he had
WMDs?  He believed the &quot;maybe I have them, maybe I don't&quot; tack was the
only thing keeping him alive.  He seriously misread the Western
diplomatic stance, mainly because he'd shot and killed anyone with an
independent opinion in his cabinet.  Diplomatically he was pretty much
flying blind.  Saddam acted like maybe he had WMDs, and Bush sure as
hell wanted him to have WMDs, so that he'd have a legitimate reason to
knock Saddam off.  Perfect storm.  Saddam got a war that he couldn't
win, because diplomatically he was an idiot.

Ask your liberal friends what the USA is supposed to do if a country
is acting like it really does have WMDs?  It's a puzzler.

You're arguing with an ex-cop who was perfectly prepared to use deadly

&gt; &gt; correct to say it.  I think my friend was right about Bush for the
&gt; &gt; wrong reasons, because he didn't like him.  Hindsight has certainly
&gt; &gt; vindicated what he had to say about him though.

&gt; typical, you were wrong, but for the right reasons.
&gt; and your friend was right, but for the &quot;wrong&quot; reason
&gt; maybe the reasons you were wrong and he was right is that he can see through
&gt; the propaganda and knows bullshit when he hears it and you dn't
">

One problem is, this particular friend of mine was strident as hell.
Like a lot of activists, he does a lot to undermine his own
credibility by frothing at the mouth.

Another problem is, when you live in a city as liberal as Seattle, you
hear the liberals go on and on about everything in the same way,
always ignoring the nasty evil despot side of the equation.
Everything is Vietnam this, Vietnam that, and there's no such thing as
a winnable war to them.  All wars have to be unwinnable and futile,
otherwise their hippie world view collapses.  You tell 'em that maybe
the Neo-Cons have a point, that a stable Muslim democracy in the
Middle East is strategically advantageous to us no matter how
imperialistic it is, and they don't wanna hear it.  If you bring up
things like &quot;well Saddam killed 80K Kurds at a pop, how much
collateral damage are we really gonna do by comparison?&quot; they don't
wanna hear it.  A consensus mantra isn't thinking.  And the consensus
mantra you get in Seattle, is liberal.

In hindsight, they were far more right than wrong.  Hm, what were they
wrong about, if anything?  The American casualties have been pretty
low.  In that respect, it isn't Vietnam.  A lot of Iraqis are thankful
for their free elections.  We haven't gotten any oil out of the deal
yet.  Saddam did have some ambition towards WMD &quot;breakout&quot; capability
in the form of better missile systems.  Saddam did have a nuclear
program once upon a time, so clearly, he would have tried to gain WMDs
*at some point*.  Now that we've wrecked their country, they won't be
able to for a long time.  That may be the only thing that we get out
of this war.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I am glad Saddam is dead.  Liberals never wanted to talk about what a
&gt; &gt; horrible despot he was.  Never wanted to blame him, it was always
&gt; &gt; about the USA.  Nevertheless, the price of killing Saddam was probably
&gt; &gt; ~100K Iraqi dead and plunging the country into civil war.  Who's gonna
&gt; &gt; benefit other than Haliburton?

&gt; liberals never said saddam wasn't a nasty asshole.
&gt; but we also see the world is full of nasty assholes. but we aren'y invading
&gt; them now are we? why? no oil.
">

Despots like oil just as much as the USA does.  Most people don't
fight wars for freedom, they fight wars for resources and money.
Promoting freedom is something you do as a sideline.  You can make the
world a better place using impure methods.  You can have purer motives
and lose your ass, like in Somalia.  Somalia is why we didn't go into
Rwanda and are dragging our feet about Sudan.  It's why we mostly
bombed Kosovo instead of getting our hands dirty with a ground war.  I
protested the Kosovo bombings; yet they ended a genocide.  I'm not
convinced I took the right stance on that at the time, and I was
thinking about that when it came to Iraq.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; as for WMDs there already is an islamic bomb. pakistan has it.
">

Currently they're allies.  Their WMDs are aimed at India, also
allies.  We're in good shape.  Ideally we help them keep the peace; or
regrettably, they blow each other up instead of us.

Saddam was never an &quot;Islamic&quot; bomb anyways.  He was a secularist that
we backed against the Shiites in Iran, once upon a time.  Previously
we let him use his WMDs on Iranians, we didn't have a problem with
that.  Of course, we were still smarting from the US embassy hostages.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and the main reason iraq was invaded was because it didn't have the bomb. if
&gt; it had nukes we woulsn't have done it.
">

That's kind of the point, to do it before they get the capability.
Otherwise you get stuck dealing with Kim Jong Il.  In that respect,
Bush had the right idea.  He was just an &quot;automatist&quot; about it, he
wanted his Haliburton contracts now now now!  We could have done it
the French / German / Russian way.  Keep harassing with UN Weapons
Inspectors, hampering Saddam's programs, until a clear moral mandate
was available to take him out.  Or, who knows!  maybe his regime would
have changed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; every little country saw that. they all want it now.
&gt; the idiot war hasn't made us safer.
">

Wanting isn't having.  Let's say you don't currently have a nuclear
weapons program.  You wanna start one from scratch and risk the wrath
of the USA?  We've proven we'll gut entire countries on flimsy
evidence when WMDs are involved.  No, I don't think you're gonna do
that.  Not unless your WMD program was already well underway.  Then
you might race to finish it while the USA is overstretched in Iraq.
That's not so many countries.

The Western Industrial Democracy model is better.  If you're Germany
or Japan, you work on civilian nuclear technologies.  You amass so
much expertise and industrial base that if you needed to switch over
to WMDs, it would be pretty trivial and quick to do so.  Meanwhile
you're good trade partners with us, it's what we like to see in a
country.  We figure if you're happy just making and selling stuff then
you're not a threat to the world.

That's an utter fallacy and the voting public ain't gonna buy it

did things the way we did because the people in power got it to happen

power had enough certainty about what was going on to oppose them.
Some did; they were sidelined.  Some were rather vocal about their
opposition and the liberals certainly listened to them, functioning as
the brain trust of the Vietnam war.  It's not an apples to apples
comparison, as the liberals would have you believe, but in hindsight
they were a lot more right than wrong.

The moderate chunk of the country didn't start paying attention until
no WMDs were found and the war wasn't in fact easy and cheap like
they'd been promised.  Then it started occurring to them that hm,
maybe the liberals were right and we've been manipulated from the get-

the war room as the planes were hitting the skyscrapers.  Terrorism

clearly took too long to do it, policy changes were made too late.  So

Unless you've got a way to stop civil wars, we've lost.  It's been a

The way the nuclear arms industry works, is that French / German /
American companies sell components to dictators like Saddam to make
nuclear bombs.  When the dictator gets close to getting something
built, the Americans or the Israelis bomb the crap out of it.  Then
the dictator buys components from the French / German / American
companies all over again.  It is very profitable for Western
corporations, it is like selling light bulbs that burn out quickly!
The American and Israeli militaries like it because it justifies their
budgets and trains their bomber pilots.

So yes, absolutely, &quot;it worked.&quot;  It only stops working when the
dictator actually succeeds in building a bomb and tells the industrial
democracies to shove off.

In my opinion, the Vietnam war was *not* winnable with the strategy
chosen by the Pentagon and backed by a succession of Presidents,
though it might have been winnable some other way.  The strategy that
was adopted, that of attrition, where superior American firepower
killed great numbers of enemy combatants looked good on paper, but was
futile in a situation where the enemy had a seemingly inexhaustible
number of combatants to sacrifice and no checks on their power to
sacrifice them.  LBJ had to get re-elected, Ho Chi Minh did not.
After the war, several NVA generals openly bragged about their ability
to sustain casualties and continue fighting.  They were unanimous in
pointing out that they could have kept up the war indefinitely
regardless of their losses.  The only thing that North Vietnam had
going for it was manpower.  The one point where American military
might could never prevail was the point we chose to contest; a huge
mistake!  In short, we played to their strength; always a bad idea.

The unhappy American electorate surely had *some* impact on the course
of events, but the popular mythology that the anti-war movement was
responsible for the American withdrawal is just plain naive.  It was
Nixon's realization that the US had painted itself into a corner and
could not get out except by a huge escalation of the war that
compelled his administration to radically alter the terms of US
engagement.  His &quot;Vietnamization&quot; program was just a sham, nothing
more than window dressing.  The ARVN were completely ineffective as a
combat force in 1963-64 and no one really thought they would be any
more effective in 1972.  Note that Nixon could simply have ended US
involvement much earlier but cynically waited until he could use the
issue of peace in Vietnam (or &quot;Peace with Honor&quot; as he disingenuously
called it) to get himself re-elected in '72.  Only then did he pull
out.  Outraged voters?  Marchers in the streets?  &lt;yawn&gt;

Actually, Eisenhower's Domino Theory came true, it's just that its
consequences were not quite what he envisioned, and it just might very
well be that US involvement in Vietnam is what *prevented* the worst
aspects of that theory from occurring.  Demonstrating to the world
that the USA would fight for its friends against the spread of world
Communism, even if those 'friends' were those of expedience, had
several beneficial effects.  It let our allies in Europe who lived
under the shadow of the Iron Curtain know that they could count on us
if it came to war, and it let the Communist bloc know we would not
hesitate to fight and that war with us would produce a terrible cost
for them.  Those are not insignificant effects.  Obviously it would
have been far better had we established our intentions and
capabilities through diplomatic means, but the Vietnam war was surely
a stark and undeniable example of American willingness to fight the
advance of Communism.  Misguided or misled though we may have been,
*willing* we surely were.

&quot;The world can survive a Communist country or two&quot; looks true only if

I suppose we'd have to whip out the lawyers and go over UN Resolution

possible interpretation and thus ended any possibility of a UN

One of the duties we have to history, is to remember how all of this
actually went down.  So that if we did screw up, and trust / follow
greedy people when we should not have, that we can warn future
generations.  They may make the same mistakes all over again, but at
least we'll reduce the odds of it, and we may control the damage to a
better degree.  Really, where would we be today without the Vietnam
war protesters?  They couldn't stop this, but their message of &quot;we

I actually thought that the main reason there was no _UN_ coalition
(thought there was a multi-national coalition) was that France, Russia

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, they did.  The affordability of the war was emphasized over and
&gt; &gt; &gt; over again.

&gt; &gt; It was?  Over and over again?  Cite?

&gt; To be honest I don't have time for a reconstruction of all the events
&gt; or sources I ran into, leading up to the Iraq war.  I'm going on my
&gt; memory and I don't think I've falsified it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't support
&gt; &gt; &gt; the war because of Al Qaeda, I supported it because I thought Saddam
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be knocked off and the Iraqis set free.

&gt; &gt; Hmmm.  Saddam *has* been knocked off,

&gt; Yep.

&gt; &gt; and the Iraqis *have* been set free.

&gt; You call that chaos freedom??  They don't know where the money's
&gt; coming from or whether they're gonna live or die from day to day.
&gt; They don't know if the insurgency will ever abate, or worse, take over
&gt; and do mass killings when we pull out.  Actually the government could
&gt; do mass killings when we pull out for all we know.  They're not free
&gt; yet.  In the short term, they're quite a bit worse off than they were
&gt; under Saddam.  We've yet to save them from anything and we've
&gt; inflicted great misery upon them.

&gt; &gt; Saddam was give a dozen years to prove to the world he was clean of
&gt; &gt; WMDs.  That he failed to do so isn't *our* problem, it was his problem.

&gt; Yeah but if we'd kept pushing with the UN Weapons Inspectors for
&gt; another year, we might not have ~100K Iraqi dead, and Saddam would
&gt; still be under thumb.  Should you use a bullet if you're not in
&gt; imminent danger and you can solve it with pepper spray?  Do you go
&gt; after a perp by spraying a whole crowd with gunfire?

&gt; Let's say you'd have to shoot Saddam sooner or later anyways.  The way
&gt; it was done does not smell like a righteous shooting.  It smells like
&gt; Bush's cronies wanted their Haliburton contracts, and that they were
&gt; willing to lie to us to get them.  We certainly sacrificed our moral
&gt; legitimacy in the eyes of the international community, we do not
&gt; appear to be law abiding.

ignore his cite crap. he does that whenever he's getting beaten. and when
you give him the cites he jusy ignores them and just restates the same
bullshit in the next thread.
this week he made the totally wrong assertion that the u.s. spends as much
on porn as it does on the war.
i put up the figures showing the monthly expenditure in iraq is higher than
the tearly porn take.
but giftzwad will continue to make that claim. he lives by the rule that any
lie repeated often and loud enough becomes true.

The $10 Billion Industry That Isn't

&quot;Whether we like it or not, pornography has become a part of society. This
industry, with an estimated yearly profit of $10 billion, has moved out of
the shadows and peep shows into the mainstream fabric.&quot;
-- Martin Renzhofer, Salt Lake Tribune, April 9

&quot;William Lyon, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition. . Said the
adult entertainment industry, which is largely based in the San Fernando
Valley, had a gross profit last year estimated at between $10 billion and
$12 billion.&quot;

-- Los Angeles Daily News, April 17

&quot;The most current estimates of the war's cost generally start with figures
from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which as of January 2006
counted $323 billion in expenditures for the war on terrorism, including
military action in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Just this week the House approved
another $68 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which
would bring the total allocated to date to about $400 billion. The Pentagon
is spending about $6 billion a month on the war in Iraq, or about $200
million a day, according to the CBO. That is about the same as the gross
domestic product of Nigeria.&quot;

but gifty will just keep claiming we spend more on porn.

accuracy in his and briarfruits post is not very good.

Why?  Sending our aid isn't sending our conscripts.

Where did the Russians and the Chinese send their conscripts?  They
never had the logistical capacity that we did, there's all kinds of
places all over the world that they were never going to get to in
force.  How does Russia stage a Vietnam-scale war in the Western
Hemisphere?

I think what Vietnam and Afghanistan really prove, is that if a
country has a *lot* of people willing to die, they'll bleed you dry.
America wasn't the deterrent, Russia wasn't the deterrent.  The
Vietnamese and the Afghanis were the deterrents.  So both Russia and
the USA went after easier prey.

If you want to argue that we spent Russia and China into the ground, I
don't have a problem with that.  But we didn't scare them off by
bleeding.  The Russians and Chinese didn't do the dying, the
Vietnamese did.  Actually it would seem to be a really good business,
to start a major war somewhere and watch the Americans come to bleed
themselves.

The point is that in the nuclear age, no winner can take all.  Let's
say the USSR was the only Communist country left on the globe.  Look
at the size of the place!  They're not lacking for resources, they
could last indefinitely if they had to.  The Americans like to think
they won WW II, but 80% of the casualties occurred on the Eastern
Front and they have a different perspective over there.  Sure they
benefited from lend/lease, but once they got their industry ramped up
nothing was going to stop them.  And all that happened before they
became a nuclear superpower, under the thumb of 1 dictator who did
tons of things that weren't so efficient to do.  Clearly a modern USSR
could have done a lot better if they were cornered.

Perhaps when you say my statement is &quot;meaningless,&quot; you're saying the
Cold War was about ideology.  Well, yes it was, but wars are *always*
about resources.  Colonies, spheres of influence, same difference.
The primary reason we propped up Israel was to have influence in the
Middle East, so that the oil wouldn't just all flow to the
Communists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, Eisenhower's Domino Theory came true, it's just that its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences were not quite what he envisioned, and it just might very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well be that US involvement in Vietnam is what *prevented* the worst
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aspects of that theory from occurring.  Demonstrating to the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the USA would fight for its friends against the spread of world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Communism, even if those 'friends' were those of expedience, had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; several beneficial effects.  It let our allies in Europe who lived
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under the shadow of the Iron Curtain know that they could count on us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if it came to war, and it let the Communist bloc know we would not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hesitate to fight and that war with us would produce a terrible cost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for them.  Those are not insignificant effects.  Obviously it would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been far better had we established our intentions and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capabilities through diplomatic means, but the Vietnam war was surely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a stark and undeniable example of American willingness to fight the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; advance of Communism.  Misguided or misled though we may have been,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *willing* we surely were.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the domino theory came true????? give your reasoning on that whopper.

&gt;&gt; The successful Communist take-over of Laos and Cambodia illustrates
&gt;&gt; what I meant; likewise, their failure in Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia,
&gt;&gt; and Thailand illustrates what I meant when I spoke of the effect of

Why the focus on the *Western* hemisphere?  In any case, they seem to

Ridiculous!  Few or none of their people *wanted* to die.  Don't
mistake their leaders' willingness to accept casualties with a
&quot;willingness to die.&quot;  They are not the same thing at all!  Since
manpower was their principle weapon, the Vietnamese Communists were
forced to use it.  Had they had a large professional army with all the
weaponry of the USA, they might well have adopted a much different
strategy.  The Vietnamese and the Afghans just used the tools they had
- human beings.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&lt;laughter&gt;  You're *way* out of your depth here!  The US went into
Vietnam to oppose the spread of Communism.  It was not a form of
&quot;colonialism&quot; nor was it any sort of quasi-religious mission to bring
the 'primitive' natives into the arms of Western Capitalism.
Similarly, the Soviet Union went into Afghanistan for much the same
reason in reverse.  They invaded to 'rescue' the Communist government
which had been overthrown by a group of local warlords.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; to start a major war somewhere and watch the Americans come to bleed
&gt; themselves.

You are apparently unaware that the Chinese suffered over a million
casualties in Korea!  But the point is that the Russians and Chinese
didn't have to suffer or bleed, they only had to be aware that the
*possibility* was there, that the US was not just a 'paper tiger.'
You underestimate the effect of US involvement in Vietnam *because*
its effect was so successful.

One of the reasons that the USA was able to outspend them on defense
measures was because we repeatedly demonstrated our willingness to
engage in combat, first in Korea and later in Vietnam.  The Communists
felt compelled to match us.  Why was that if they weren't worried we
might use our arms, somewhere someday?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  We send spooks, we send aid, but we

&gt;&gt;&gt; and thailand is not communist it was a monarchy/republic kind
&gt;&gt;&gt; of like england until the recent coup which made a rather fascist state
&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; rather low on the repression scale.

&gt;&gt; Which confirms my point, you idiot.  Can't you follow your *own* train
&gt;&gt; of thought from one end of a post to the other?  &lt;boggle&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; once again you have no clue what you are going on about.

&gt;&gt; LOL!   If you possessed even a smidgen of self-awareness, you'd die

&gt; why not just admit you can't back up your absurd claim about the domino

Because... watching the Communists overrun Vietnam was good for the
morale of democratic freedom fighters?

Reading a Wikipedia entry, I don't see that American escapades in
Vietnam contributed to a positive outcome in Malaysia in any way
whatsoever.  The Brits simply had an easier situation to deal with.

Indonesia looks like it's more about a coup and spook ops than about
standing toe to toe with Communist forces.

&gt; &lt;laughter&gt;  You're *way* out of your depth here!  The US went into
&gt; Vietnam to oppose the spread of Communism.  It was not a form of
&gt; &quot;colonialism&quot; nor was it any sort of quasi-religious mission to bring
&gt; the 'primitive' natives into the arms of Western Capitalism.
&gt; Similarly, the Soviet Union went into Afghanistan for much the same

You need to see the big picture of controlling world resources.

&gt; &gt; If you want to argue that we spent Russia and China into the ground, I
&gt; &gt; don't have a problem with that.  But we didn't scare them off by

&gt; &gt; Vietnamese did.  Actually it would seem to be a really good business,
&gt; &gt; to start a major war somewhere and watch the Americans come to bleed
&gt; &gt; themselves.

&gt; You are apparently unaware that the Chinese suffered over a million

Korea was a stalemate and didn't prevent Vietnam.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But the point is that the Russians and Chinese

&gt; You underestimate the effect of US involvement in Vietnam *because*
&gt; its effect was so successful.
">

Vietnam didn't prevent Afghanistan.

Here's a competing theory.  For the Russians and the Chinese, Asia is
what's worth fighting over.  It's next to them.  They took what they
could.  It's not worth enumerating &quot;great successes&quot; in the Western
Hemisphere.  It's not as strategically important to them and it's a
PITA to get over there in force.  They left it to the Cubans etc. to
hassle us.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One of the reasons that the USA was able to outspend them on defense
&gt; measures was because we repeatedly demonstrated our willingness to
&gt; engage in combat, first in Korea and later in Vietnam.  The Communists
&gt; felt compelled to match us.  Why was that if they weren't worried we
&gt; might use our arms, somewhere someday?
">

First, because after a time the Russians and the Chinese didn't
exactly like each other and had to consider their home defense.
Second, because when you base a society upon corrupt military regimes,
they keep extracting resources to aggrandize themselves at the expense
of &quot;the butter.&quot;  One general maneuvers to get this, another general
maneuvers to get that.  Why did we go into Iraq?  So that Haliburton
could make money.  The report on the corrupt contracts is coming out
at the end of the year, I read in the paper today.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The correct word is indirectly.  American fighter pilots in Vietnam
&gt; &gt; shot down Russian fighter pilots in Vietnamese planes.  Russians
&gt; &gt; manned Vietnamese SAM batteries.  I can think of no war in which plain
&gt; &gt; marked Russian and American militaries went head-to-head.

&gt; The same thing happened in Korea, and both sides knew it was going on.
&gt;   That *is* directly.  You are also apparently unaware of the 'staring
&gt; contest' between the US Navy and Russian Navy in the Atlantic.  Our
&gt; subs versus their subs, etc.  And didn't you hear about the Chinese
&gt; fighter plane that 'bumped' into one of our electronic intelligence
&gt; gathering aircraft a few years back?  Just because it hasn't been a
&gt; shooting war, doesn't mean it hasn't been a direct confrontation.

Yawn.  Wake me when half the fleet is on the bottom of the Atlantic,
WW II style.  Or when an American tank division obliterates a Russian
infantry division.  All that cat-and-mouse stuff is just training.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The point is that in the nuclear age, no winner can take all.

&gt; Only if it is evident that one or more nuclear power is willing to
&gt; push the button.  The US willingness to engage in combat in Vietnam
&gt; illustrated that we might just be willing to go the limit.
">

Apples and oranges.  Conventional wars in Third World countries don't
obliterate the human race.  I'm quite sure that if either side
believed they were being nuked, they'd nuke back.  So the question is
who shoots first?  And is it deliberate or an accident?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  Let's
&gt; &gt; say the USSR was the only Communist country left on the globe.  Look
&gt; &gt; at the size of the place!  They're not lacking for resources, they
&gt; &gt; could last indefinitely if they had to.  The Americans like to think
&gt; &gt; they won WW II, but 80% of the casualties occurred on the Eastern
&gt; &gt; Front and they have a different perspective over there.

&gt; You've forgotten the Pacific Theater.

No I didn't actually.  Previously, I didn't realize so many Chinese
died.

&gt; &gt; Perhaps when you say my statement is &quot;meaningless,&quot; you're saying the
&gt; &gt; Cold War was about ideology.  Well, yes it was, but wars are *always*
&gt; &gt; about resources.

&gt; Sheer nonsense.  Wars are about a lot of things, greed is just one of
&gt; them.  Look up &quot;xenophobia, racism and religious intolerance.  You
&gt; don't really think the Arabs want to fight Israel just because they
&gt; want the &quot;resources&quot; do you?  &lt;boggle&gt;

Yes they do.  There isn't enough land or water.  Historically, Jews
did *very well* in Muslim empires, much better than in Christian
empires where their money was often seized.  The hatred between
Muslims and Jews is a 20th century phenomenon.  The product of the
Zionist movement in a &quot;holy&quot; land with scarce resources.

&gt; ROTFLMAO!  That's the stupidest thing you've said yet!  How much oil

It's sitting near Saudi Arabia and other places that have tons.  I
said &quot;influence.&quot;  The more influence you have in the Middle East, the
more you can control where the oil goes.  Preventing 1 Middle Eastern
country from taking over and getting all the oil is pretty core to US
strategy.  Ergo, back the best army in the region.

&gt; &gt; A false accusation.  I do feel it is necessary to cite references, and
&gt; &gt; I said why I wasn't going to.  I am currently pinging my liberal

&gt; &gt; will post about it.  Don't hold your breath though, I don't consider
&gt; &gt; proving things in *.war-historical to be an urgent matter.  Really
&gt; &gt; I'll do it because I expect I'm going to run into the same debate in

Nevertheless a book reference would be more definitive and

In the real world it will take more time than that.  My patience for
Google hunting and pecking, of something that isn't making me money,
is about 15 minutes.  I just spent it, and I didn't get what I was
looking for.  It's hard to search the past and present at the same
time.  I did get an interesting article framing some issues, though:
