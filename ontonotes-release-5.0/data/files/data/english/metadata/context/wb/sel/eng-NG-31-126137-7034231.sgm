BOOK REVIEW
'Leni: The Life and Work of Leni Riefenstahl' by Steven Bach
She overlooked the evils and emphasized the romance of Nazi power.

By Richard Schickel

Leni: The Life and Work of Leni Riefenstahl
Steven Bach
Alfred A. Knopf: 386 pp., $30

Leni Riefenstahl was a slut. Steven Bach is too graceful a writer and
too nuanced a psychologist to summarize this life so bluntly, but, for
the reader of his brilliant biography of the Nazi filmmaker, that
conclusion is inescapable.

We are not speaking primarily of her sexual life, though it was
relentlessly busy (her taste ran to hunky jock types and, equally, to
men who could advance her career). That epithet applies also to her
blind - and blinding - ambition. There was no one she would not try to
seduce, in one way or another, in pursuit of fame, fortune and power -
including, of course, smitten, impotent Adolf Hitler, who was über
alles among her admirers.

With "Triumph of the Will" (about the Nazi party rally at Nuremberg in
1934) and "Olympiad" (about the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games),
Riefenstahl, it's not an exaggeration to say, created almost every
significant visual image that we now retain of National Socialism in
all its evil pomp. Later, when the Thousand-Year Reich turned out to
have a rather shorter life span than its propagandists predicted and
she lived rather longer than normal (she died at the age of 101 in
2003), she devoted most of her energy to litigious self-justification
of her years as Hitler's willing executioner of imagery. In essence,
she fought her 58-year defensive battle in the same way that she had
pursued her more meteoric advance to global fame - under the flag of
artistic purity. As she would have it, she aspired only to the
sublime, and that shining light blinded her to rumors of concentration
camps, Gestapo torture chambers and the gas ovens.

Riefenstahl claimed, probably truthfully, that she was never a Nazi
party member and evaded the worst punishments of the postwar
denazification process, though she never again made a significant
film. Over these later years, she attracted the support of gaga
cinephiles, who inanely insisted, as one of them put it, that
"politics and art must never be confused." It is biographer Bach's
business to demolish that nonsense while also creating an almost
novelistically compelling narrative of a life endlessly obfuscated by
lies.

The daughter of a plumber, Riefenstahl began her public life as an
"interpretive" dancer in the Modernist vein and then did a turn (which
she later denied) dancing semi-nude in the film "Ways to Strength and
Beauty." She achieved eminence first as a star, then as a director, of
"mountain films," a popular, peculiarly Germanic genre in which wild,
primitive people dare to scale beautiful yet menacing Alpine peaks,
achieving death and transfiguration at the end of their exertions. At
the time, most people viewed these movies as escapist, though
Siegfried Kracauer (a mere critic at the time, not yet the eminent
historian of German film he would become) saw in these films something
"symptomatic of an antirationalism on which the Nazis could
capitalize."

There was perhaps more to it than that. As Susan Sontag wrote in her
seminal essay "Fascinating Fascism," the mountain films offered "a
visually irresistible metaphor for unlimited aspiration toward the
high mystic goal, both beautiful and terrifying, which was later to
become concrete in Führer-worship." The would-be Führer saw this. And
Riefenstahl, his would-be acolyte, was paying attention too. She read
"Mein Kampf" and, typically, pressed that noxious rant upon a Jewish
lover, saying, "Harry, you must read this book. This is the coming
man."

Adolf and Leni were mutually enthralled from the moment they met - to
the point that the world's tabloid press kept ludicrously hinting at a
sexual liaison. They had something better; they were soul mates. To
her dying day, she insisted that "Triumph of the Will" was cinéma
vérité, a morally neutral record of a great historical event. But
Albert Speer, Hitler's kept architect, was essentially her art
director, the occasion was staged with her camera positions always in
mind, and the film was financed entirely with government funds. The
same was true of her Olympic film. She always claimed that Joseph
Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, was her enemy, but Bach is
particularly good at unraveling that whopper. Goebbels resented her
direct line to Hitler - she was the only German director not obliged
to submit to his dictates - but their squabbles were mainly
bureaucratic, and Goebbels' diary entries about her are mostly
admiring.

Why would they have been otherwise? "Triumph" and "Olympiad" celebrate
the official Nazi message: "Strength Through Joy." The former offers
heroic shots of young Aryans larkishly bathing in their encampments
before assembling into impressive masses, their individuality welded
into anonymous yet strangely glamorous menace. The Olympic movie was
more in the spirit of the mountain films: In company with a beamish
Hitler, gorgeous and graceful athletes (Leni, incidentally, was having
an affair with an American decathlon winner) idealistically strain for
metaphorical mountaintops. The "purity" of their efforts sends an anti-
intellectual, or blood and iron, message to sausage-stuffed
flatlanders - and, of course, to Jews, who were viciously scorned by
Goebbels and company.

In short, Riefenstahl's two major films aestheticized and romanticized
fascist values. The dazzling geometries of masses on the march may
have been in the cinematic air just then: Look for Riefenstahl's
sources in Busby Berkeley's musical extravaganzas as well as in the
1932 German communist film "Kuhle Wampe" (co-written by Bertolt
Brecht). But backed by the full faith and credit of an evil government
providing thousands of malleable extras, she could provide grand
spectacle on an unprecedented scale. Why Riefenstahl's work would
continue to impress critics - even Sontag, Riefenstahl's most
implacable critical enemy, calls them the two greatest documentaries
ever made - is a mystery, given the corruption of their origins and
the fact that they are visibly not documentaries at all.

With world war looming, the international film community was
titillated but ultimately shunned Riefenstahl's gifts while her chief
patron was, shall we say, distracted by more pressing matters. She was
a silent witness to an atrocity in Poland early in the war (though she
later claimed to have protested the massacre), and during the filming
of "Tiefland" blithely employed as extras some Gypsy slave laborers
who later perished in death camps. It was a sort of neo-mountain film,
personally financed by Hitler but released after the war to a numbed
response. By then, she was fighting tigerishly to distance herself
from Hitler, though Bach has uncovered much damning gush from her to
him. At the end of her life, Riefenstahl discovered a primitive
African tribe, the Nubia, and found in them the noble savagery she had
celebrated in the Alpine films. She published a beautiful, disturbing
picture book about them which had a certain rehabilitative effect on
her reputation - though not for Bach or this reader.

It is difficult to overpraise Bach's efforts: Living the biographer's
nightmare, trapped for a decade with a loathsome subject, Bach is
determined to present her coolly, ironically, without loss of his own
moral vector. What emerges is a compulsively readable and scrupulously
crafted work, not unlike Klaus Mann's "Mephisto," that devastating
novel about the actor Gustav Gründgens, another of Hitler's several
semiconscious cultural ornaments-apologists. I do not believe this
fundamentally ignorant woman ever perceived the inherent evil in
Nazism. Her anti-Semitism was less virulent than reflexive - the
common coin of many realms (including the United States) at the time.
The disguise she wrapped around her ambition was that absurd, often
unpleasant and peculiarly European one of the Grand Maestro, all art
for art's sake - hysteria and narcissism mixed with contempt for her
collaborators, grandiose graciousness to her groveling fans and
patrons, and a talent that was all technique, no soul. She stood
deluded at the center of evil and saw it only as a source of funding.

Bach ends his book with a quotation from Simone Weil: "The only people
who can give the impression of having risen to a higher plane, who
seem superior to ordinary human misery, are people who resort to the
aids of illusion, exaltation, fanaticism, to conceal the harshness of
destiny from their own eyes. The man who does not wear the armor of
the lie cannot experience force without being touched by it to his
very soul."

Which brings me back to the point at which I began. Leni Riefenstahl
used and was used heedlessly and amorally. That would have been true
even if she had functioned in a liberal democracy, where she would
have acted just as she did in Hitler's Germany, insisting that her
aspirations were for only the finest things. What she received for her
efforts were the metaphorical mink coats and diamond bracelets of the
whoredom that never speaks its name - because it cannot imagine the
word applying to an artiste of such impeccable idealism.

So she would have been Capra or Spielberg? She would have been a whore
for the American capitalist regime whose major films aestheticized and
romanticized liberal-capitalist values, backed by the full faith and
credit of an evil corporate elite providing enormous resources to
stage grand spectacle on an unprecedented scale (like, say, Lost
Horizon or Saving Private Ryan)? Interesting.

Richard Schickel is a sexist creep.  I believe that point should be
made at once in response to a vicious, self-righteous diatribe that
begins with the following: "Leni Riefenstahl was a slut."  Had
Schickel started his review by calling her an opportunist or a morally
compromised woman, his comments would at least not have so baldly
placed gender prejudice at the heart of his tirade.  But by using a
term that is demeaning to women and to women only in characterizing a
brilliant though controversial artist of the female gender, he
revealed, once and for all, the ugly strain of sexism that has always
been near the forefront of Schickel's criticism with his fawning
glorification of dominating masculine authority figures and his
contempt for the feminine, including those male artists, like Griffith
whom he despises as having been a man ensnared by powerful women.
Schickel's use of the term "slut" in this context is, in my opinion,
as gross a slur as Ann Coulter's similar employment of the "f" word in
order to demean gay people.  Indeed, keeping this on the subject of
film history, I feel Schickel's line of attack is no different from a
critic who would write of another brilliant filmmaker placing his
genius at the service of a totalitarian regime, "Sergei Eisenstein was
a faggot."  In this case, the use of such a hate-filled slur to denote
the artist's sexual preference would be just as obvious an indication
that the critic was even more obsessed with the director's personal
identity than his specific political associations.  While Leni
Riefenstahl's gender is far from irrelevant to the issue of her place
in history, to single it out with such a vile, sexist term is, in my
view, a critical stance that is beneath contempt.
Over the years, I have tended to avoid a.m.s. threads on Miss
Riefenstahl for several reasons.  First of all, it is not a subject I
have studied so thoroughly that I would feel qualified to be any kind
of expert.  Also, while I do admire her as a great film artist and
remarkable woman, due to the present critical and political climate, I
have been apprehensive my appreciation might be misinterpreted as some
kind of sympathy or at least neutrality toward the absolutely
horrendous regime with which she was tragically involved.  In
addition, I have felt her ablest defenders had, over the years,
mounted a very effective case in her behalf.  However, I think the
kind of strident denunciation that Schickel has launched with such an
obvious expression of sexist, anti-female bigotry calls for some kind
of response.  I should mention, too, that Richard Corliss had already
pointed out in an article on Leni Riefenstahl for "Time" that many of
the attacks on her are clearly reflective of an anti-female bias.
Schickel's sexist nonsense has been a blight on film history for
decades, as in his trashy attack on Lillian Gish some years ago and
many other negative or dismissive comments he has made on women in
cinema over the years.  These woman-hating trantrums stand in sharp
contrast to his mash notes to male stars like John Wayne.  Even when
he professes to admire a female star, it seems to come at a steep
price.  For example, he subtitled his Turner network documentary on
Myrna Loy, produced in the early '90s, "So Nice to Come Home to," a
clear signal that he sees woman's "proper" place as a wife and mother
and a patronizing perception of the star that was ultimately an insult
to the witty, strong, independent woman that Myrna Loy was both in
reality and on the screen.
That sexism continues to be a scourge in our society and that it
has particularly deformed our approach to film history is an argument
I have been making for years.  Often, my thesis has been met with
angry replies. Usually they come from the kind of man who is quick to
denounce the perceived sexism of the "Orientals," whether Muslims,
Hindus, Chinese or Japanese, but who loftily insists that we, the
white Christian/secular humanist West, are entirely free of male
dominant bias and that such criticisms are merely the whining of some
frustrated, man-hating females, those reviled feminists.  But I think
the record speaks for itself, whether it is the kind of denigration
and caricaturing that have been posthumously meted out to strong,
powerful women like Joan Crawford (Joan, incidentally, had impeccable
anti-Fascist credentials, a fact totally ignored by those who persist
in maligning her), or a policy of neglect for other women of the early
cinema who challenged male rule.  I am currently writing the first
full-length biography ever done on Pearl White, who just happened to
be the biggest star in the entire world during the 1910s, with a wider
public at that time than either Chaplin or Fairbanks.  However, she
has been almost completely forgotten, thanks, in no small part, to
male-oriented critics like Schickel who have been only too happy to
ignore the contributions of this supremely talented, emancipated
woman.
Not having read Steven Bach's book on Riefenstahl, I am not prepared
to render a judgment on it, except to say that, as a critic of many
biographies and one who is now writing one himself, I doubt that it
comes close to telling the full truth about its subject.  She did,
after all, live to be 101 and I very much doubt that a book less than
400 pages could do real justice to its subject. Judging from what Bach
has said in an interview and what others, including Schickel, have
written, it appears to be an exercise in scapegoating and selective
use of facts to tarnish the reputation of the filmmaker with an
interpretation suggesting a sexist bias. In a broader sense, Bach's
book seems to belong to the class of high-profile biographies of film
people which have dominated the field in the last 15 years or so.
Inevitably, these books are presented as revisionist accounts,
generally negative in tone, of artists who, late in life, had
published their autobiographies.  Targets of this line of revisionism
have included Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Capra, Lillian
Gish, and Katharine Hepburn.  Instead of offering deeper, more complex
views of the subjects that shed real light on the artists and their
achievements, writers of these books seem to be primarily obsessed
with challenging the integrity of the memoirs with their own limited
and biased presentation of facts they trumpet as "The Truth."  These
kinds of revisionist works are eagerly snapped up by the major
publishers who usually ignore biographies of those who either never
went on to write a full-length autobiography in later years or have
largely been forgotten.  Consequently, small niche publishers like
McFarland or Bear Manor Media have had to take up the slack, while the
big-name revisionist biographers, in effect, opportunistically benefit
from the existence of the very autobiographies that they profess to
scorn.
Getting back to what I said at the outset, while I don't advocate
everything published being monitored by language police for
infractions of P.C. codes, I do believe that a reviewer professing
high-minded morality should be careful to avoid hurtful slurs like
"slut."  Otherwise, like Schickel, they reveal themselves for the
hypocrites and bigots that they are.  "Slut" is a word applied
exclusively to females, used to condemn women for sexual behavior that
is condoned, even applauded when undertaken by men.  Trying to excuse
it by saying it's metaphorical will not do.  It clearly indicates
Schickel's elemental, sexist view as surely as if he had said "cunt"
or "bitch."  But while terms like "slut" and "whore" are far from
gender neutral, there certainly are males who have prostituted
themselves to the highest bidder.  And if anyone should know about
that type of person, it is Schickel.  As is noted at the end of his
vivisection of Riefenstahl, he is the author of a book on Elia Kazan,
the glorification of one of the most shameless opportunists in film
history.  During the height of Uncle Joe's terror, when he was
slaughtering millions in the USSR, Kazan enthusiastically joined the
American Communist Party, either because he genuinely believed the
Soviet system was the wave of the future or (more likely) because he
saw it as a chance to build his power in the theatre at a time when
pro-Stalinist sentiments were rampant in those circles.  Even after he
left the Party, he continued to support the Soviet Union from a safe
distance.  Later, during the McCarthy Era when professing pro-
Communist views became an obvious career liability, Kazan suddenly
discovered Stalin's crimes and turned on his old comrades by very
publicly naming names.  The reward for this treacherous conduct on his
part was more and greater power in Hollywood.  Schickel has
continually parroted the line in recent years that Kazan's careerism
and moral cowardice was some sort of principled opposition to
totalitarianism.  I don't dispute that Kazan was a skilled director
who should be respected for his well-crafted films.  However, if I may
say so, I think Griffith, Eisenstein, and Riefenstahl were far greater
cinematic artists than Mr. Kazan.  In any case, gifted director though
he was, "Gadge" was no moral hero. For Schickel to represent him in
such an exalted, misleading manner while subjecting Miss Riefenstahl
to the most disgusting abuse, is further proof of this establishment
critic's duplicity, hypocrisy and sexism.
