*a useful piece of information.. *
*

Never, put your banana in the refrigerator!!! **
This is interesting.
After reading this, you'll never look at a banana in the same way again **.
*
*
Bananas contain three natural sugars - sucrose, fructose and glucose
combined with fiber. A banana gives an instant, sustained and substantial
boost of energy.

Research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for a
strenuous 90-minute workout. No wonder the banana is the number one fruit
with the world's leading athletes.

But energy isn't the only way a banana can help us keep fit.

It can also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses and
conditions, making it a must to add to our daily diet. *
*
Depression:** According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND amongst people
suffering from depression, many felt much better after eating a banana. This
is because bananas contain tryptophan, a type of protein that the body
converts into serotonin, known to make you relax, improve your mood and
generally make you feel happier. **

PMS:** Forget the pills - eat a banana. The vitamin B6 it contains regulates
blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood. **

Anemia:** High in iron, bananas can stimulate the production of hemoglobin
in the blood and so helps in cases of anemia. **

Blood Pressure:* *This unique tropical fruit is extremely high in potassium
yet low in salt, making it perfect to beat blood pressure. So much so, the
US Food and Drug Administration has just allowed the banana industry to make
official claims for the fruit's ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure
and stroke. *
*
Brain Power:* *200 students at a Twickenham (Middlesex) school were helped
through their exams this year by eating bananas at breakfast, break, and
lunch in a bid to boost their brain power. Research has shown that the
potassium-packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils more alert. **

Constipation:** High in fiber, including bananas in the diet can help
restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem without
resorting to laxatives. **

Hangovers:** One of the quickest **
ways of curing a hangover is to make a banana milkshake, sweetened with
honey. The banana calms the stomach and, with the help of the honey, builds
up depleted blood sugar levels, while the milk soothes and re-hydrates your
system. **

Heartburn:** Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body, so if you
suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana for soothing relief. *
*
Morning Sickness:* *Snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep blood
sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness. **

Mosquito bites:* *Before reaching for the insect bite cream, try rubbing the
affected area with the inside of a banana skin. Many people find it
amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation. **

Nerves: **Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the nervous system.
*
*
Overweight** and at work? Studies at the Institute of Psychology in Austria
found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like chocolate and
crisps. Looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found the most obese
were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. The report concluded that, to
avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to control our blood sugar levels
by snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two hours to keep levels
steady. **
Ulcers:* *The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal
disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness. It is the only raw
fruit that can be eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases. It also
neutralizes over-acidity and reduces irritation by coating the lining of the
stomach. **

Temperature control:** Many other cultures see bananas as a "cooling" fruit
that can lower both the physical and emotional temperature of expectant
mothers. In Thailand, for example, pregnant women eat bananas to ensure
their baby is born with a cool temperature. *
*
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):* *Bananas can help SAD sufferers because
they contain the natural mood enhancer tryptophan. **

Smoking &amp; Tobacco Use:* *Bananas can also help people trying to give up
smoking. The B6, B12 they contain, as well as the potassiu! m and ma gnesium
found in them, help the body recover from the effects of nicotine
withdrawal. **

Stress:** Potassium is a vital mineral, which helps normalize the heartbeat,
sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body's water balance. When we
are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby reducing our potassium
levels. These can be rebalanced with the help of a high-potassium banana
snack. **

Strokes:** According to research in "The New England Journal of Medicine,
'eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the risk of death by
strokes by as much as 40%! **

Warts:** Those keen on natural alternatives swear that if you want to kill
off a wart, take a piece of banana skin and place it on the wart, with the
yellow side out. Carefully hold the skin in place with a plaster or surgical
tape! *
*
So, a banana really is a natural remedy for many ills. When you compare it
to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three
times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice the other
vitamins and minerals. It is also rich in potassium and is one of the best
value foods around So maybe its time to change that well-known phrase so
that we say, "A banana a day keeps the doctor away!" **

PASS IT ON TO YOUR FRIENDS **
PS: Bananas must be the reason monkeys are so happy all the time! I will add
one here; want a quick shine on our shoes?? Take the INSIDE of the banana
skin, and rub directly on the shoe...polish with dry cloth. Amazing fruit. *

Care for Colds and Flu
Very good detailed information about colds and flu. Hope it helps people
around you and yourself.

Colds and the flu or influenza are similar in many ways, yet the flu can
sometimes lead to more serious problems, such as pneumonia. Colds and flu
are the most common and communicable and spread easily between people. They
are more likely to strike when a person's immune system is low. The common
cold is an acute (short-term) viral infection of the upper respiratory
tract.

Symptoms of a cold include runny or congested nose, sneezing, fatigue,
headache, body aches, cough and general feeling of malaise. A sore throat is
sometimes a (differential) symptom of a more serious condition distinct from
the common cold (such as strep throat) that may require medical diagnosis
and treatment. A cough can be further differentiated by the sound of the
cough and the ability to expel or not to expel the phlegm. The color of the
phlegm is also looked at. (See Traditional Chinese Medicine).

The flu typically affects 20%-50% of the U.S. population each winter. It's a
highly contagious disease, spreading mostly by direct person-to-person
contact and coughing is the most effective method of transmission. The flu
virus can linger in the air for as long as three hours. In close quarters,
conditions are ripe for the spread of the virus.

Symptoms of a flu are very similar to that of a cold, but the signs of a flu
can be much more severe, especially at the oneset. A fever, characteristicly
high (102-104 F); that lasts 3-4 days, a severe cough that gets worse, with
chest discomfort or pain can be signs of pneumonia. Severe body aches and
fever/chills are side effects of the body doing its job of trying to fight
off an infection.

Colds can be spread through the air, such as when a person sneezes, or by
contact with contaminated objects.

Those most at risk are children in 5 to 14 year range, who spend much of
their time in school, in close contact with their classmates. More serious
complications occur in elderly adults and those with compromised immune
systems.

The remedies for a cold or flu are sleeping, resting, plenty of clear
fluids, and avoiding sugar, which will assist your immune system to
recuperate. There is no proven cure for colds or flu, but time.

*Managing Your Cold*

1. Stay home and rest, especially while you have a fever.

2. Stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke, which can make cold symptoms
worse.

3. Drink plenty of fluids like water, fruit juices and clear soups. Fluids
help loosen mucus. Fluids are also important if you have a fever because
fever can dry up your body's fluids, which can lead to dehydration.

4. Don't drink alcohol.

5. Gargle with warm salt water a few times a day to relieve a sore throat.
Throat sprays or lozenges may also help relieve the pain.

6. Use saline (salt water) nose drops to help loosen mucus and moisten the
tender skin in your nose.

7. Consider supplements such as Vitamin C, 2,000 to 4,000 mg in divided
doses (based on bowel tolerence). Vitamin E compliments C, 400 IU.
Echinecea, Goldenseal, Garlic and Licorice root all help in fighting viruses
and strengthening immunity.

8. Chicken soup has been shown to have healing properties. Enjoy this great
old remedy.

9. Keep washing your hands, cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze and
cough in order not to spread the virus to others in your household.

10. Pay attention to good hygiene and skin care. Eat a proper diet.

*Tips For Avoiding A Cold*

1. Wash your hands often. This is the number one preventative measure you
can take. You can pick up cold germs easily, even when shaking someone's
hand or touching doorknobs or handrails. You should lather up your hands
well for at least 20 seconds, then rinse-off the soap thoroughly for another
20 seconds. Be sure to include the areas under you nails when you wash your
hands, as they are a lurking ground for germs. Drying your hands, studies
have shown, is also an important step in removing germs.

2. Keep your immune system strong. Get good quality sleep, eat nutritious
food and stay strong with moderate exercise.

3. Limit airborn risks by keeping your nose clear and hydrated. Usually, we
infect ourselves by placing our own virus contaminated hands to our faces.
Less frequently, we can catch them from airborne sources.

4. Sneeze or cough into a tissue and then throw the tissue away.

5. Clean surfaces you touch with a germ-killing disinfectant.

6. Don't touch your nose, eyes, or mouth. Germs can enter your body easily
by these paths.

7. Any season is cold and flu season but the most prevelant time tends to be
in the fall and winter, when people are together in close surroundings.

8. Avoid large crowds in enclosed areas as much as possible, especially
during cold and flu season.

9. Keep your feet and neck warm. Cold feet and a chilled neck cannot cause a
viral infection. When the feet or neck are cold, cold contracts, that
includes the mucous membranes in the nose. When mucous membranes contract,
they dry out and cause the glands to stop
functioning. This easily allows dust and bacteria in, as the nose stops it's
filtering function, making your entire system more vulnerable.

10. Sometimes even when we do our best to avoid these situations, they occur
regardless. Just being aware is half the battle.

*Nutritional Advise*

Water is essential in any healing process. Distilled water is the best. 6-8
eight ounces glasses per day.

In addition to eight glasses of water, clear juice, tea, and other mostly
clear liquids are advised. This will replace important fluids lost during a
cold and help flush out impurities that may be preying on your system.

Sip chicken soup. A long-time folk remedy is now a proven fact. A cup of hot
chicken soup can help unclog your nasal passages. Researchers at Mount Sinai
Medical Center in Miami Beach found that hot chicken soup, either because of
its aroma or its taste, "appears to possess
an additional substance for increasing the flow of nasal mucus." These
secretions—what comes out when you blow your nose or sneeze—serve a first
line of defense in removing germs from your system, the researchers say.

Zinc lozenges can cut colds short, to an average of four days. Zinc can also
dramatically reduce symptoms such as a dry, irritated throat.

At first onset, do a dropperful of Goldenseal and/or Echinacea directly in
the mouth three to four times a day. **Do not take Goldenseal for more than
seven days.***

The very fact that you have a cold in the first place may point to your
eating "too congesting a diet" that puts a strain on your body's metabolism.
Counteract it by eating fewer fatty foods, meat and milk products, and more
fresh fruit and vegetables.

*What You Should Avoid:*

Limit foods that have little or no fiber such as ice cream, cheese, meat,
snacks like chips and pizza, and processed foods such as instant mashed
potatoes or already-prepared frozen dinners. Too much white flour and
refined sugar.

What you don't eat may be even more important than what you do eat. Avoid
alcohol, caffeine and sugar, because they tend to worsen the situation.

Reduce Processed and Refined Foods:

Avoid fried foods, white pasta, white rice, full fat dairy, white potatoes,
white bread (baguettes, bagels, pita).

Processed food can rob your food of nutrients and vitamins that your body
needs to fight off stress and promote good health. Try to buy whole foods,
unprocessed foods and try and stay away from "instant" foods, preservatives,
artificial flavors, saturated fats, refined foods, hydrogenated food and
MSG.

Reduce Sugar Intake:

Too much sugar can rob our body of essential nutrients. Simple carbohydrates
from baked goods, pastries, most crackers and cookies must be limited to a
very small portion or completely removed from the diet.

*Supplements*

Alpha Lipoic Acid is a unique antioxidant that is both water and fat
soluble, which allows it to enter all parts of the cell to neutralize free
radicals. Alpha Lipoic Acid contributes to and is important for the
production of energy inside the cell by utilizing sugar to produce energy
contributing to mental and physical stamina, reducing muscle fatigue and
neutralizes free radicals. Alpha Lipoic Acid recycles and enhances the
effects of both Vitamin C.

Lysine an amino acid, can have a general antiviral, tonifying effect that
fortifies the immune system. Take 1,000mg daily in divided doses.

Probiotic A probiotic will fortify your intestinal flora, which are
essential for proper digestion and nutrient absorption. This is key to good
health and a strong immune system. Studies have shown that patients who
begin a course of probiotics with fiber a few days prior to surgery are less
likely to pick up a post-operative infection during their hospital stays.
This demonstrates a strong connection between intestinal flora and immune
function. The fiber – which provides the friendly bacteria both food and
sanctuary – can be as simple as an apple or banana.

Omega-3 : This fish oil has been shown in many studies, to reduce your bad
cholesterol levels and reduce plaque buildup in your blood. By reducing your
bad cholesterol, you are helping your body to fight off stress and relieve
anxiety, tension and even prevent heart disease! Fish that are high in
Omega-3 are excellent ways to help your blood stream.

Vitamin C acts primarily in cellular fluid. Vitamin C scavenges free
radicals and cleans up waste products. In addition to its anti-oxidative
activities, vitamin C benefits many other body functions. Vitamin C is
necessary for the synthesis of collagen, which is an important component in
the structural make up of blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and bone.
Vitamin C also plays an important role in the synthesis of the
neurotransmitters and norepinephrine.
Neurotransmitters are critical to brain function and are known to affect
mood. Vitamin C, even in small amounts, can protect molecules in the body,
such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA)
from damage by free radicals. Vitamin C helps in the fight against
free-radical formation caused by pollution and cigarette smoke and also
helps return vitamin E to its active form.

Vitamins B6,12 Foods rich in the B vitamins, which help regulate metabolism,
are also beneficial, as diets high in sugar tend to burn these vitamins at a
faster rate. These foods include wheat germ, yogurt, and liver.

*Herbal Remedies*

Adaptogens: which include Eleuthero (Siberian ginseng), Asian ginseng,
Astragalus, and Schizandra, are thought to help keep various body
systems—including the immune system—functioning optimally. Take Siberian
ginseng in tincture, herbal granules or in capsules. Capsule doses of 500mg
three times a day. Another immune stimulant, Boneset, helps fight off minor
viral infections, such as the common cold.

Echinacea: Patients primarily use echinacea to prevent and treat the common
cold. The alkylamide, alkaloid, and polyacetylene fractions are thought
responsible for stimulating leukocytes and increasing the release of TNF and
interleukin 1. A double-blind, randomized studies for the treatment of the
common cold suggest that, if initiated within 24 hours of onset, echinacea
may shorten the duration of colds, but may not reduce the severity of
symptoms. More research is needed. Fresh pressed juice of the flowers of
Echinacea (E. purpurea) preserved with alcohol and tinctures of root of
echinacea (E. pallida) have been shown to reduce symptoms of the common
cold. Echinacea (E. angustifolia) root tinctures has been shown to reduce
symptoms of the common cold. The minimum effective amount of
Echinacea tincture or juice that is necessary to take is 3 ml three times
per day. More (3–5 ml every two hours) is generally better and is safe, even
for children. Encapsulated herbs may also be effective, generally 300–600 mg
capsules three times per day are used. Recent
studies indicate that regular use of Echinacea to prevent colds does not
work. Therefore, it is currently recommended to limit use of echinacea to
the onset of a cold and to use it for only 7 to 10 days consecutively.

Elderberry: is derived from the dark purple berry or from the white to
light-yellow flowers of the black or common elder tree. Elderberry, a
relative of the blueberry, has been found to have powerful anti-viral
properties. Elderberry extract may be used to treat a cold or flu, or taken
as a prophylactic which fortifies the immune system.

Horseradish has antibiotic properties, which may account for its easing of
throat and upper respiratory tract infections.

Goldenseal: In traditional herbal medicine, Goldenseal root is often taken
with Echinacea. The pharmacological action of goldenseal is attributed to
both hydrastine and berberine. Berberine has been shown to have
anti-microbial activity against certain pathogens such
enterotoxigenic E. coli and V. cholera. However, due to small amounts in the
root, it is unlikely that these effects would occur.

Goldenseal soothes irritated mucous membranes in the throat, making it
useful for those experiencing a sore throat with their cold. Goldenseal root
extract, capsules, or tablets are typically taken in amounts of 4–6 grams
three times per day. Using Goldenseal powder as
a tea or tincture may soothe a sore throat. Caution: Goldenseal root should
only be used for short periods of time, up to 7 consecutive days.

Garlic: The intact cells of garlic contain an odorless, sulfur-containing
amino acid derivative known as alliin. When the cells are crushed, alliin
comes into contact with the enzyme alliinase located in neighboring cells
and is converted to allicin. Allicin is a potent antibiotic, but it is
highly odoriferous and unstable. The ajoenes are apparently responsible for
the antithrombotic properties of garlic. Allicin is described as possessing
antiplatelet, antibiotic,
and antihyperlipidemic activity.

Ginger: An anti-inflammatory. Ginger has been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese
medicine as an anti-inflammatory. Taking 6–50 grams of fresh or powdered
ginger per day indicated that ginger might be helpful. Suggested
Dosage: 0.5to 1 mg of powdered ginger daily

Licorice Root is anti viral, anti-inflammatory, soothes gastric mucous
membranes. The root cleanses the colon, increases fluidity of mucous in the
lungs and bronchial tubes. Licorice is used extensively in Traditional
Chinese Medicine for a variety of conditions and ailments. Almost all
clinical studies on licorice have been performed in combination with other
herbs. Alone, licorice is used primarily to manage gastric complaints. A
number of active chemicals are thought to account for its biologic activity.
Due to the adverse reaction profile of licorice, many studies have been
performed using the deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) extract, which is free
of glycyrrhizin and has had no significant reported adverse effects.

Mucilage herbs, such as Slippery Elm and Marshmallow, are often helpful for
symptomatic relief of coughs and irritated throats. Mullein has expectorant
and demulcent properties, which accounts for this herb's historical use as a
remedy for the respiratory tract,
particularly in cases of irritating coughs with bronchial congestion.

Red Raspberry, Blackberry and Blueberry leaves contain astringent tannins
that are helpful for soothing sore throats.

Sage tea can be gargled to soothe a sore throat.

Yarrow has been used for sore throats. All of these remedies are not
supported by modern research at this time, but are traditionally used.

Wild Indigo also stimulates the immune system, which might account for its
role against the common cold and flu.
