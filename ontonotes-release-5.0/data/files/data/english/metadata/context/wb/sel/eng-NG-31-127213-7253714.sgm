Okay, I knew New Mexico (9th in the MWC) and Penn State (11th in the
Big Ten) were completely done with, but I figured Washington would at
least get an NIT bid.  I guess I'm going to have to re-adopt New
Mexico State, who was my #2 team before I went to graduate school at
PSU.  Too bad I don't see any way they will get past Texas.

Speaking of the NIT, now that they both have the automatic bids for
the regular season champs and shrunk the field back to 32, it really
is tight getting a bid.  Used to be that .500 record from one of the
big six conferences was a guarantee.

I'm a bit of a fan of the Aggies myself, because of the Lou Henson
connection.

Yeah, it was surprising not seeing some teams get bids.  Gotta get
used to the new setup.
