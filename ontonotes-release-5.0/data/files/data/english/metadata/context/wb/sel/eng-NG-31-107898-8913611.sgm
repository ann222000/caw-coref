Peter Frost's explanation for high average Ashkenazi Jewish IQs:
Attempts to come up with a Darwinian explanation for the high average
IQ of European Jews go back at least to Norbert Weiner's 1953
autobiography, in which he argued that arranged marriages between the
shetl's brightest young rabbi and the richest merchant's daughter
would lead to large numbers of smart children having enough money to
survive. In 2005, Greg Cochran, Henry Harpending, and Jason Hardy put
forward a sophisticated theory pointing to selection for the mental
demands of traditional Ashkenazi occupations such as moneylender. In
Commentary, Charles Murray recently suggested the Babylonian Captivity
could have played a role.

For a number of years, anthropologist Peter Frost has been privately
advocating a fourth theory. Frost is the author of the 2005 book Fair
Women, Dark Men: The Forgotten Roots of Color Prejudice, which I
reviewed in VDARE.com. On Wednesday, Frost posted in the comments to
Mahalanobis' item on economist Greg Clark's new book showing that the
prosperous had many more surviving children than the poor in medieval
and early modern England. The comment summarizes Frost's theory of the
evolution of Ashkenazi intelligence:

The same process was going on in other European nations, but to
varying extents. I commented on this point in the following letter to
Commentary (which was never published):

In &quot;Jewish Genius&quot; [April] Charles Murray states that selection for
intelligence has historically been stronger in some occupations than
in others, being notably stronger in sales, finance, and trade than in
farming. Insofar as he is right, the reason lies not in the occupation
itself but in its relations of production.

In the Middle Ages and earlier, farmers had little scope for economic
achievement-and just as little for the intelligence that contributes
to achievement. Most farmers were peasants who produced enough for
themselves, plus a surplus for the landowner. A peasant could produce
a larger surplus, but what then? Sell it on the local market? The
possibilities there were slim because most people grew their own food.
Sell it on several markets both near and far? That would mean dealing
with a lot of surly highwaymen. And what would stop the landowner from
seizing the entire surplus? After all, it was his land and his
peasant.

The situation changes with farmers who own their land and sell their
produce over a wide geographical area. Consider the &quot;Yankee&quot; farmers
who spread westward out of New England in the 18th and 19th centuries.
They contributed very disproportionately to American inventiveness,
literature, education, and philanthropy. Although they lived primarily
from farming, they did not at all have the characteristics we
associate with the word &quot;peasant.&quot;

Conversely, trade and finance have not always been synonymous with
high achievement. In the Middle Ages, the slow growth economy allowed
little room for expanding a business within one's immediate locality,
and expansion further afield was hindered by brigandage and bad roads.
Furthermore, the static economic environment created few novel
situations that required true intelligence. How strong is selection
for intelligence among people who deal with the same clients, perform
the same transactions, and charge the same prices year in and year
out?

This point has a bearing on the reported IQ differences between
Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews. Charles Murray, like others, believes
that the Ashkenazim were more strongly selected for intelligence
because they were more concentrated than the Sephardim in sales,
finance, and trade, especially during the Middle Ages. Now, we have no
good data on the occupations of medieval Ashkenazim and Sephardim. But
the earliest censuses (18th century for Polish Jews and 19th century
for Algerian Jews) show little difference, with the bulk of both
groups working in crafts.

There was, however, one major demographic difference. While the
Sephardim grew slowly in numbers up to the 20th century, the
Ashkenazim increased from about 500,000 in 1650 to 10 million in 1900.
The same period saw strong population growth among Europeans in
general. This boom used to be attributed to falling death rates alone,
but demographers now recognize that rising birth rates were also
responsible, in some countries more so. In England, the rise in
fertility contributed two and a half times as much to the increase in
growth rates as did the fall in mortality, largely through a decline
in the age of first marriage.

This trend toward early marriage coincided with growing use of roads,
canals and, later, railways to distribute goods over a much larger
geographical area. The baby boom was particularly concentrated among
semi-rural artisans who produced on contract for urban merchants and
who could ably exploit these larger, more elastic markets. &quot;They were
not specialized craftsmen in life-trades with skills developed through
long years of apprenticeship; they were semi-skilled family labour
teams which set up in a line of business very quickly, adapting to
shifts in market demand&quot; (Seccombe 1992. A Millennium of Family
Change. p. 182). Their workforce was their household. In more
successful households, the workers would marry earlier and have as
many children as possible. In less successful ones, they would
postpone marriage, or never marry.

In Western Europe, these cottage industries were concentrated in areas
like Ulster, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Brittany, Flanders, Alsace,
Westphalia, Saxony, the Zurich uplands, the Piedmont, and Lombardy. In
Eastern Europe, they were concentrated among Ashkenazi Jews. Selection
for intelligence among the Ashkenazim may thus have been part of a
larger European-wide selection for intelligence among cottage industry
workers. These entrepreneurial artisans had optimal conditions for
selection: 1) a tight linkage between success on an intelligence-
demanding task and economic achievement; 2) considerable scope for
economic achievement; 3) a tight linkage between economic achievement
and reproductive success; and 4) considerable scope for reproductive
success. Such artisans were a minority in Western Europe. Among the
Ashkenazim, they appear to have been the majority.

In the late 19th century, cottage industries gave way to factories and
the tight linkage between economic achievement and reproductive
success came undone. Entrepreneurs could now expand production by
hiring more workers. Henry Ford, for instance, produced millions of
his famous Model T but had only one child.

In conclusion, Charles Murray errs in thinking that selection for
intelligence is driven by the type of occupation. The relations of
production seem to be more important, in particular whether the worker
owns the means of production, whether there is scope for economic
achievement, and whether increases in production are driven by
increases in family size.

By the way, it's quite sad how anthropologists have gone from glamour
boys and girls in the 1950s to being almost ignored in the 2000s.
Cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, for example, was the Steve
Levitt of the post-war era, an omniscient seer consulted on every
topic imaginable. (For example, a fictionalized version of her named
&quot;Margaret Mader&quot; has a sizable role as a space-traveling
anthropologist in Robert A. Heinlein's 1957 sci-fi classic Citizen of
the Galaxy. She explains to the young hero the complex family
structure of the Free Traders' spaceship.)

But the rival school of physical anthropologists led by the two-fisted
Carleton Coon could also generate celebrities. Coon, for instance, was
a regular panelist on a high-brow TV gameshow called &quot;What in the
World?&quot; that ran from 1951-1964. On it, Coon and a couple of other
anthropologists would be shown some random object from a museum
collection and then try to guess whether it was a Neanderthal's
sternum or whatever.

Coon's specialty was &quot;The Wilder Whites:&quot; Berbers, Albanians, and
other tough mountain peoples who found the macho Coon to be their kind
of man. During WWII, Coon served in the OSS and his chief assignment
was to prepare to be &quot;Lawrence of Morocco&quot; -- if Franco ever let
Hitler's armies have right of passage through Spain, they could land
on the North African coast behind the Anglo-American forces fighting
Rommel's army in Libya and roll them up. If that happened, Coon would
disappear into the Rif Mountains and rally the wild Berber tribes to
fight a guerilla war against the German occupiers.

My guess is that what went wrong was that the Franz Boas / Margaret
Mead school of cultural anthropology succeeded in demonizing their
enemies like Coon. Without rivals anymore to keep them on their game,
the cultural anthropologists got complacent and politically correct,
and thus boring. The subject is still fascinating, but you'd only find
that out these days from a handful of anthropologists, such as Frost,
Harpending, Stanley Kurtz, and Peter Wood.

That's too bad because anthropology ought to be the foundational
social science, what physics is to the hard sciences.

That may be some people's view to be sure, but it isn't precisely
mine. I am not hateful to or for harming Blacks, Jews or gays.  I am
for  acknowledging reality: we can't have equal outcomes in education
for Blacks and whites on average because on average they are not
capable of it without attenuating the potential of Whites (and
spending inordinate sums along the way): Jews are on average very
smart, and have great group cohesion and therefore the rest of us must
seek to improve ourselves in those regards too: and gays have to be
held to the same standards of decorum and responsibility as all of
us.

There is a sizable Black underclass in the United States that likes
being what it considers Black, seeks to differentiate itself from, and
comes into little contact with Whites. Whites need to understand that.
Whites need to stop subsidizing it too.  At the same time, there are
Blacks in America that are smarter than I am: I know that and it
doesn't upset me. Many Blacks are in some ways better athletes than
Whites: that doesn't upset me either. If you really want hate, I'm
afraid I'm a poor specimen for you.

Most of the gays are no trouble, but there are some spreading the
notion they have extra rights: the right to make you like them, the
right to make you deal with them, the right to flagrantly defy others'
standards on those others' property. A landowner does NOT have,
morally, to rent to gays-or straights-or blacks-or whites.  A person
has a right to not like homosexualiity. A person has a right to think
it's wrong, just as they have a right to think it's immoral to eat
meat, of all animals, or just some like pigs or cows. They don't have
a right to accost gays in the streets or harass them. Personally I
have no beef with them: but I don't want to be subjected to indecent
public displays of affection, nor do I really want to deal with
excessively effeminate males no matter what they do in bed. It's like
people with BO, halitosis or FVO (yes ladies, we know what that is.)
Stink all you want, but not in my space.

&gt; &gt;  Most of the gays are no trouble, but there are some spreading the
&gt; &gt; notion they have extra rights: the right to make you like them, the
&gt; &gt; right to make you deal with them, the right to flagrantly defy others'
&gt; &gt; standards on those others' property. A landowner does NOT have,
&gt; &gt; morally, to rent to gays-or straights-or blacks-or whites.

&gt; That's an easy statement to make when you are in the majority.

Well yes; but consider gay establishments that bar mixed-sex couples.
It can be an embarrassing thing.

&gt; &gt;  A person

&gt; Of course.  A person has a right not to like people with blue eyes, as

Yes. They do.

&gt; &gt; A person has a right to think

&gt; &gt; a right to accost gays in the streets or harass them. Personally I
&gt; &gt; have no beef with them: but I don't want to be subjected to indecent

&gt; &gt; excessively effeminate males no matter what they do in bed.

Most women want their males excessively, and upstandingly, masculine
in bed. Unless they prefer women of course. Steve Sailer exposes the
dirty little secret of sapphism: lesbians aren't really very sexual.

I don't believe in &quot;gay marriage&quot; because I think there should be a
different term for it. I'm okay with &quot;civil union&quot;.

I believe most of the rabblerousing by gay organizations is motivated
by a in-your-face determination by them to make disagreement with them
illegal, or at least socially odious. If a gay individual is
transgressed upon we have laws for that transgression-murder, assault,
etc. are already illegal. I support enforcing those laws. But a person
has a right to NOT LIKE gay behavior-or fishing, lowriding or tube
rolling, to me a particularly idiotic pastime. And they have a right
to say so.

Believe me, I don't care what you do in your private space. It does
not concern me either way. But if you get your way, if some religious
bozo holds up a sign in front of a gay parade saying &quot;BIBLE SAYS GAY
IS SINFUL&quot;, he will be thrown in jail for what I consider free speech-
the Bible does in fact say that, and though I consider the Bible just
another old book of manmade blather, he has the right to believe it's
TRVTH-or at least he will get the shit beaten out of him, even if he's
an old geezer, and you won't be sad to see it.

(An aside: Why don't gays beat the hell out of Phelps? For that
matter why don't military men at funerals he pickets do so? Phelps and
his brood are good with their fists, and the gays know it. The
military men are or should be too, but they are as cowed as the gays
today. If either were MEN they would beat the fuck out of Phelps no
matter what their superiors would say, and if the gays-without courts-
martial to answer to-did I'd at least have to respect them for that.)

**That's Evolution for ya. The reasons why are probably bloody complex,
but, I suspect, that climate and Australia's generally poor soils have a
lot to do with it. Marsupials have essentially filled the niche, in
Australia, normally occupied by large mammals in the Americas and
Europe, due to their superior ability to deal with very poor nutrition
provided by native fauna. As a result, smaller critters were able to
evolve their particular traits. Just a guess, mind you. You really
should ask a biologist. I can tell you that, for instance, kangaroos are
stunningly well adapted to the Australian envronment. They cover large
distances, using far less energy than almost any other large land
animal. Females can 'store' a foetus for extended periods, 'till
conditions are right. She will then allow the foetus to develop/ she
gives birth early and the baby (a 'Joey') is then kept in her pouch,
thus allowing her to copulate and make more Joeys. Koalas have an
alternate scheme. They feed exclusively on certain species of eucalypt,
that are not eaten by other critters. Though, since the leaves are very
difficult to digest, the koala must 'sleep' up to 20 hours per day.
Wombats operate on a similar basis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; God have it in for you Trevor?
">

**There is no God. The notion of a God is really rather niave and
childish. I note that most Americans believe in such a thing. However,
you neglected to add that Australia has no large, deadly mammals either.
I'd much rather face a red bellied black snake (and I have, along with
funnel web spiders, several times) than a hungry grizzly. Snakes and
spiders are not all that intelligent and will usually try to avoid a
large animal, rather than attack just for the sake of it.

**Dunno. I'm part of the group labelled athiests. For the record: I have
a mate who always used to put he, his wife and child down as 'Druids'
(Pagans) when he filled out a census. It was his way of bucking the
system. I suspect he was not the only one.

Scottie is against the government nosing around in your private business
-- unless you're a suspected terrorist or traitor. For them, whatever
the government does is OK with him.

(The irony of Scottie's &quot;thinking&quot; may appear watery to you. I'm not
familiar with the civil rights you Ozzies enjoy.)

**How's that Patriot Act working for you? I guess as long as you are
white, Anglo Christian, things are pretty good? Tough luck if you are a

**Pretty much the same as what you guys enjoy. Except we can legally
travel to Cuba. Our PM, looking at the US Patriot Act, decided that
seemed like a good idea and enacted similar legislation in Australia.
Amusingly, however, the first test of the legislation has been an abject
failure, as the judiciary appears to feel that it is complete bullshit
(which it is) and is against the fundamental rights of Australians. Our
PM, like your President, seems to feel that the so-called 'War on
Terror' is a vote winner. It makes him look all tough and manly. It's
taken awhile, but Aussies seem to have finally realised that this is
just like the Cold War re-dressed. If there is no, actual enemy, then
policians have to manufacture one. The weird thing is this: The US DOES
have an actual enemy - OBL. Yet that blithering idiot who runs your
country seems Hell bent on not catching him. Curious.
