Democrat candidate for Governor, Bill Ritter, yesterday showed his Democrat roots and misplaced priorities: Ritter said that if he becomes governor, he'll devote his first year in office to coming up with a plan to solve the health care crisis.

What crisis, you might ask?

"Seventeen percent of our population has no health insurance, one of the worst rates in the nation," Ritter said. "It's a spiraling problem."

Uh, Bill, what percentage of those with no health insurance are illegal aliens? How many of them are healthy young people who have looked at the cost and decided, rationally, to take the gamble? If you remove those numbers, is it really a crisis? (I thought PERA was the crisis).

We on the right side of the political aisle say that your body and health are your responsibility, not the government's. Health insurance, which did not exist really before WWII, is not a right. Free medical care (other than emergency) should never have become a welfare type benefit that the government mandates and requires other people, mainly those who are responsible enough to pay for their medical care, to pay for the irresponsible. Medicare and Medicaid will probably bankrupt us. Bill Ritter wants to expand the free medical coverage?

Mr. Ritter has proven his magnanimous character by working for Catholic Charities in Zambia. That was his own time and money. Now it seems that his charitable nature wants to require others to be as generous with their money.

As much as I personally like Bill Ritter, I could never vote for him.

Roger,

I take exception to this comment. If you are going to bring up the subject of illegal aleins, then cite the % as opposed to waving the bloody shirt.

"How many of them are healthy young people who have looked at the cost and, decided, rationally, to take the gamnble?" The Book of Common Prayer reminds us that "In the midst of life we are in death."

You know and I know b/c we pay premiums that the costs of health insurance is high. You know and I know b/c we see our clients' bills and sometimes our own, that the cost of health care is high and like a hawk catching thermals, spiraling higher.

You on the right ("right" as in direction as opposed to "right" as in correct) side of the aisle should occasionally refrain from knee jerk reactions and piously toeing the consrevative line and ask the following question: "Notwithstanding past failures, is there anything the state of Colorado can do to make health care more affordable so as to decrease the number of uninsured people thereby decreasing the burden of the public to pay for health care?" Instead of intoning personal responsibility for body and health, which in this instance closely resembles the southern product of a north walking horse, what about recognizing the problem and working on a solution? Or is it just easier to bury your head in the sand?

The No Fault Law sunsetted out of existence on July 1, 2003. The system had its flaws, however, since that time publlic and private hospitals have provided millions of dollars of auto accident related health care services for which they will never be paid. Maybe requiring a modest mandatory med pay policy would help.

Roger, the United States and the rest of the world was a different place b/f WW II. Just b/c health insurance did not exist does not mean that it is not a good idea.

Getting cancer is not a matter of the exercise of free will and personal responsibility. Smoking is irresponsible, but many people become ill even though they lead blameless lives.

The RMN article to which you provided a link stated Mr. Ritter would work on a solution to provide affordable health insurance to the uninsured. It did not say he proposed expanding free medical coverage.

Yes, PERA is a crisis but don't you think that health care is also?

Call me dreamer (I am certain that those on the right side of the aisle will call me other things, some more pointed) but I think it possible that government can exist to provided benefits beyond basic physical security.

You need to understand soomething. Many of us view the philosophy of the "right side of the aisle" as "Nothing is a problem provided you are rich and if you are not rich, well take a little personal responsibility, Buddy, okay? The only reason why you are not rich is you."

Unfortuantely, Mr. Beauprez and Mr. Holtzman could not attend the forum sponsored by the Colorado Coalition for the Medically Underserved. Maybe they had prior commitments. Certainly, both recognize that that the medically underserved are unlikely to be big campaign contibutors. I rather suspect that the Republican solution to this problem is placing more carts on the streets to be pushed by people who cry: "Bring out your dead." Or more likely, "Bring out your dead but only if you can show proof of citizenship or legal residence."

Shame on you Roger. You mischarcterized a candidate's position--at least as stated in the article to which you provided a link--and then you took an untenable position in your implication that personal responsibility can avoid ill health.

Over here, you have to pay for medical insurance as part of your taxes. You have the normal income tax, then social security, and health.

Sure, taxes are high, but when you figure what an American with an average salary pays for private insurance, it is about the same. The difference is here, there is no co-pay. They even gave me free crutches after my (free) knee surgery.

I agree with Tony about the "rich right". Basically, the arguement is that private health insurance is preferable because for high income people, it represents a small percentage of their income. This is just plain selfish.

There are no easy answers for universal health care, especially since the cost-reimbursement system has sent costs spiraling out of control. No single-payer could possibly afford to take on those kind of costs at this point. Hell, y'all spend more on health care than the GDP of most countries.

But it isn't going to get any better. Sure, the care is great (if a bit impersonal) but there will come a day when even middle-class Americans can't afford it.

Going without insurance is a risk that I took as well. Had I had an accident, however, my whole life would have changed. No Europe, no mortagage, just endless debt. That is a prospect that amongst citizens of industrialized nations only Americans enjoy.

But hey, Q1 GDP is coming in at 1.7% to the upside, so everything is okay, right?

All Roger is saying is, let's debate the issue using real numbers and facts and not resort to some artificial percentage that is simply not reflective of the true scope of the problem. Who could be opposed to that?

I have to disagree with you too, Roger.

As human being, I personally believe that both healthcare and education are not a privilege, but a right.

As a businesswoman, I believe it
makes good economic sense for a civilised nation to invest in the health and education of its citizens.

A healthy and educated population will be , in the long term, a benefit to the country, and will also save the nation money in the future.

By investing in healthcare and education, you invest in the future well-being and development of your nation.

But, of course it`s down to the individual pennies in the individual pockets, and some individuals are loathe to part with those relatively few pennies.

I can never understand the short-sighted approach of the right wing on this issue.

Unless of course, you`re planning ahead for conscription for war, in which case they`re all going to be seen as just more cannon fodder anyway.

The US goes off around the world to save the lives of other people....

so why not help save some of it`s own..?

clzdwh,

I read your response w/ interest. Was it possible that I misread Roger's comment? Perhaps I read a comment by his evil twin, Bruce. So I reread what Roger wrote and determined that I had read it correctly the first time.

I refer all and sundry to an Aricle by Amy Fletcher that appeared in the February 17, 2006 edition of the Denver Business Journal which discusses a study that no doubt was the source of Mr. Ritter's figures.

I did not seee a figure on % of uninsured illegal aliens. In fact, 39.5% of uninsured workers are ages 18-34. W/o the raw data, I cannot translate this into a % of the uninsured population.

Another figure: The average family pays $934 annually to fund uninsured healthcare. That's about 155 6 packs of premium beer; it's close to a month's mortgage; it's &gt; than 26 tanks of gas @ the price I paid at the pump today.

I don't want tofund uninured healthcare to this extent. A British/Canadian system is not the answer. So what can government do to find a solution. The right side of the aisle says: "I got mine, Jake, how are you fixed?"

Read the article, then advise whether you think there is a problem.

Too much to respond to cogently. Tony, there should be mandatory 5k med pay for the ER rooms. I did not misrepresent what my old friend Bill Ritter wants to do. His solution will not be for the government to back out and provide less free stuff to people who can't afford it. You don't believe he will offer a conservative solution. "That government governs best which governs least." (TJ) The scariest words in the Universe are: "We're with the government; we're here to help" (Reagan)
I don't want the government to take my money so they can save it for me (cause they don't). I'm not the most generous person, but I give some of my money to poor people (I like to help ARC when I can) I don't want the government to take my money to give to other poeple who didn't work as hard at school or at their job.
Zep, we give a free education (ever declining in quality apparently) to our citizens because it is in the interest of society to have educated people. Likewise we do what we can to prevent people from dying in the streets. But I don't think it is in the government's interest to provide free non-emergency care to anyone who darkens the hospital door (citizen or not). That's socialism, which either has failed or is in the process of failing every place it has been tried. Thanks for the long and cogent comments. Mike, the free crutches are nice, it's the exorbitant taxes that are a bitch. Are you paying both to Czech Republic and the US of A? Man, that's got to hurt, if you are.

R,

What about mandating that H&amp;A carriers must permit smalll businesses and individuals to pool themselvers. i know this exists to some degree at present. Insurance is about spreading risk.
Insurance companies--well you know what they're about.

Gotta eat. The Big Easy is on. Great soundtrack.

Tony,

Can't small businesses pool for health insurance now? (I prefer health savings accounts with a catestrophic chaser myself) and you and I both know the banality of the evil that is insurance companies. I liked The Big Easy OK. Ellen Barking must be well past her best used by date by now.

R,

Well, I pay about 35% with health insurance here. The law is I get to earn the first $70,000 overseas without paying tax in the states. That is plenty. They will probably change that law soon to match the EU which is to pay full tax either at home or in the country where you live.

Right now the corporate guys from the US have it great because they can earn up to $70,000 tax free if they get paid in dollars to their US account. That is probably going to change.

I hate giving the government my money to hold for me as well, but if I have to choose between the government and the insurance companies, I'll hold my nose and pick the former. At least I can vote them out, but dealing with insurance companies always make me feel like I'm in a Kafka novel.

I think small business are able to pool to a certain extent but there is a ways to go before the system is truly up and running.
