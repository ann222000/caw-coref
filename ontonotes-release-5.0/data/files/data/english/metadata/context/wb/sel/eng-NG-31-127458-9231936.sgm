Wonder how the shares in Squeegie leather sponges are fairing. Normally the
shelves would be being emptied around now as we furnish that Landrover
dashboard with a new one in readiness.

Nice and toasty here today, wonder how long this will last and if we'll get
a butt kicking winter.

Just starting to warm up, looks like a long hot summer coming up as the
drought (now in its seventh year) tightens the screws. There's been less
than an inch of rain since early June. Near total crop failure expected
unless it rains in the next two weeks (and there is none forecast) - and
the price of wheat has alreadydoubled since March.

I hope so, I want to try the pinz out in the snow!  It can handle
three foot drifts without problems according to the yanks, not so sure
about that myself, but haven't seen even a 1-foot drift since I left
Scotland so doubt I'll find out soon.

I suppose I ought to get around to fitting that truck cab to the
landy, the canvas is going to get chilly..

I guess you won't be wanting a squeegie leather sponge either then. I rest
my case.

Don't worry dude. If it's owt like our predicted summer you'll be wishing
you'd cobbled together an Ark in a month or two.

Its not so toasty anymore - its still sunny but not that hot (just
pleasant imo!). The weather was like this last year too. It changed
after the october half term.
I remember bacause my car MOT is the week before the half term week
and i always have to put in some late nights outside fixing it after
it fails...

Well I've just been outside chopping wood and it felt bloody hot to
me!  Had to move everything around the garden, chasing the shade.

Arrgh!  Don't remind me of MOTs, I got made redundant on Tuesday,
followed closely by a water bill, car insurance on the landy and the
audi, MOT time and tax disc for the pinz and landy, new tyres needed
for the audi, audi service light comes on, house contents insurance
needs renewing and all this just after the house building insurance
was renewed..  Feck!  September is going down as a bad month.

Cheers, it's my second time in 6 years, been expecting this one for a
year, so have my own business up and running, will either sink or swim
now.  Might end up living in the pinz ;-)

I'd quite like that actually, a six-wheeled hobo, the pinz with no
name, roving the land, killing for money (OK perhaps not the bit about
killing).

Let's just hope this heat keeps up, the central heating in this house
costs a bomb to run..

With a chainsaw?  The axe bit comes in an hour or so, now that it's
even hotter..

In case anyone's wondering why I'm chopping wood in this weather, I
need to dry it out, I'm not totally mad..

I was bought up on the west coast of Scotland, not sure if we had sun
up there!

Last time I remember snow was about 3 years ago, and I remember it
because I was in the Audi, not the Landy, and was trying to get home
from Basingstoke to Dorset on a Friday, peak A303 traffic time.  Took
me 5 hours..  Usually took 1.5 hours.  Couldn't risk the snow-covered
routes because the audi wheels were spinning on some hills, didn't
want to risk sliding down a hill out of control so after getting some
soil out of a nearby field so I could get up the hill I rejoined the
A303 which was salted but moving at walking pace.

Its cheating using a chainsaw!

and i actually managed to get a tan yesterday so it must have been
quite warm - i take it all back... though it could have been the
complete exhaust system i welded up! ;)

It hasnt started peeling yet as welding tans always have on me in the
past so it might have been a proper tan..

I still managed to get a blister from the axe, mind you I did fill a
bunker with wood, that's about a week and a half's supply during the
cold weather.  I've still got about 5 tonnes of wood to chop yet..
About half of it a foot-and-a-half in diameter.  Won't quite fit on my
tiny fire like that ;-)

I wonder what the legality is of nabbing fallen wood from woodland
spotted during green-laning trips..  NO is almost certainly the
official answer, but if a tree falls in the woods without a sound and
no landowner is there when I scarper with it, is it really stolen...
I went to ask my cat but when  I looked in its box, it was dead.

Do you have a darth-vader shaped white patch covering your head and
neck?

Lovely hot day today, no wood to chop, but do have F1 race to watch
and loads of computer work to do before Monday so looks like I'm
inside all day :-(
