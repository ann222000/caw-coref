I just came back from visiting the XPS site. It cost me almost $500, but I
feel better now not having to worry about 2.4 GHz problems.

I bought two combo packs and some accessories. The combo packs are for my JR
radios.

The Spektrum stuff goes up for sale on eBay some time this week. I'm going
to hold on to the Futaba FASST system for smaller models. I've gotten back
into flying smaller Diesel powered models lately. I'm sure the Futaba stuff
will work just fine for that purpose.

Once one reads the specs of the XPS gear, it is hard to imagine buying
anything else.

What is XPS? What is the website?

I have just bought one XPS module and 8 channel receiver to check out
the system.  I have been following all 2.4 systems for the last year
and am most impressed by the way they have responded to the few reports
of problems while I have not appreciated the way others have attempted
to hide low voltage  problems.  I know that there will be problems with
any new technology and rate the manufacturers with how they respond to
reports of problems.  Whatever the reported problems, the majority are
usually caused by a loose stick nut flying into the ground or  stupid
installations.  Been that way since I flew my first RC model in 1956.

Wow! You don't mess around!

Ed, I would have advised you to wait just a wee bit. The 6 ch RXs are due
out in a few days and they will be field programmable (software not
firmware) Currently the 8 &amp; 10 ch RXs are not field programmable but I
understand you'll be able to upgrade them when the time comes. Remember the
6ch RXs have limited range. Up to 1000' they communicate bi- directionally
just as the 8 &amp; 10 ch RXs do. Past 1000' they lose the bidirectional
capability but they are OK out to at least 2500' (I think). The 6chs are
designed for park flyers etc.  I have 2-8ch RX (because they are smaller,
lighter than the 10s, I don't need a 10) and a JR module and I'm waiting to
buy a couple of 6 chs. Unlike 72MHz RXs, mounting position is more critical.
i.e *nothing* metallic or electrical may touch the RX antenna and there
should be a 2&quot; diameter hemisphere above the unit through which there are no
wires, connections, etc.  Most aren't having any problems complying but
there are always the oddballs who claim they don't follow the rules and
everything still works. unit should be mounted as high in the airframe as
possible. etc.

The glider troops are complaining because it won't work completely
encapsulated in a carbon fuselage. (what does?) Some are getting around that
by drilling a hole in the fuselage/canopy area through which the little nub
antenna may protrude and *see* better. etc. Remember 2.4GHz is not new
technology but the application to RC stuff is.

Early adopters are inevitably faced with problems. However, unlike the
Spektrum troops who probably don't have the ability to communicate directly
to the head honcho via email, we XPS types do.  As I said Jim hangs out on
his forums (RC Groups) listens *and* makes changes. BTW, Check out the
manual available at the web site. One more thing, Jim periodically has had
problems with the e-commerce functions on the site although I think he has
ironed them out.

From all I've read the Futaba FASST systems haven't developed any serious
problems yet and I hope they don't. Futaba makes excellent systems.  I went
JR after years of inactivity (former Kraft type) because I *can* feel the
difference. ;-)) Good luck -

I have a Futaba 2.4 gig FASST system and have been following the
flight reports on RC Groups.  I know nothing about low voltage problems.
Care to expand on that?

I was under the impression that the low voltage problem was particular
to the Spektrum 2.4 GHz systems. Not true?
