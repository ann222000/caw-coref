Harshman Cuts and Runs Yet Again; what will he do when Ray publishes his Magnum Opus?

In a fairly interesting thread about biological classification schemes
and what they might tell us about how populations are related Harshman
feigned ignorance and simultaneously played the part of the three
iconic monkeys:  See no evil,   Hear no evil,   Speak no evil. Almost
poetic justice given the fact that Harshman believes he shares a
common ancestor with them.

He was given every opportunity to identify his best post within the
thread countering my position but just couldn't bring himself to
commit.  I agreed to address which every post he chose and concede to
a better position if forced.   Nonetheless Harshman  cut &amp;
ran----again.

It mattered little to me whether Harshman was afraid of being
embarassed by a rank amateur or whether he just lacked conviction in
his underlying atheistic world view conjoined to evolutionism.

This shows clearly and unequivocally how very fragile the atheistic
positions (and their adherents) are when they are not shielded by the
normal protections of the orthodoxy.  Today Harshman's elitist
arrogance was his undoing yet again.

I'm done.

T Pagano

What's really sad is that we all share a common ancestor with you.

When Ray publishes his magnum opus there will be no one here to see it
and the sun will have long gone cold. No matter where you side
(although I KNOW where you side) in the evolution discussion, you
cannot seriously believe Ray is going to ever PRODUCE anything.

Robert Jordan will get his next novel done first. And he's dead.

Well, scientist and Atheist really have the sense to see through
evils, as presented by the evil christianity, bible, advocation of
killing, slavery, grab lands belong to indigenious people, etc etc...
You on the other hand continue with all the evil acts. Tell you what,
sooner or later, all people will wake up to your evilness.

Why do a sensible person such as Harshman run? I believe he has talk
enough but you are blind to reasoning. So, why should he bother any
more......

Tony, the three monkeys are fictional or mythical characters.
Harshman agrees that he shares ancestors, back in the Carboniferous,
with the birds he studies, but you are the one claiming common
ancestry with individuals, like Noah, who never technically actually
existed.

No, he offered you a choice: pick any reply he made to you.  Can you
not see the irony in complaining that Harshman &quot;cuts and runs,&quot; when
you get a free choice of which post to respond to -- and you cannot
work up the courage to address ANY of them?  Pick the first post by
Harshman you come  to, or read them all and pick the one that seems
weakest: if you had anything to offer besides bluster, you'd be
responding to one of his posts now, not starting a new thread before
running off to hide.

Again, he offered ANY of his posts up to your &quot;harsh criticism.&quot;  Who
is it who lacks conviction: the man who says &quot;take your best shot at
anything I've written in this thread,&quot; or the man who insults his
opponent and yet assumes that not one post is weak enough for him to
refute?

Are you so lacking in insight that you can't see how stupid and
dishonest this makes you look?

Still, it's your problem, not anyone else's.
