THE ATTIC 36 REGAL BUILDING. TEL 23746050

tuesday 11 september

6.30 pm - '9/11 Mysteries', 'The Great Conspiracy', '911 Revisited', 'Why
the official story can not be true'

4 Documentary films presented by Come Carpentier de Gourdon

I got as far south as the federal courts buildings, where they were keeping
people out, thank goodness.It is 6 years to the day that 4 commercial
airliners were hijacked and flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade
Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. The official '9/11
Commission Report' was released in July 2004. This should have put an end to
the controversy and conspiracy theories that surround this event. It hasn't.
There is now an increasing body of scientific, technical and financial
evidence that gives the lie to the official version.

Last year we showed the film 'Loose Change' which was also shown on
television to up to 50 million people in 12 countries on September 11 2006,
including state outlets in Belgium, Ireland and Portugal and 100,000 DVDs of
the film have been sold. According to one poll at least (Zogby's) 86%
Americans believe that the Government is not telling the truth about 911.

Larry Silverstein gets a 99 year lease and a specific, unusual insurance
policy against the risks of two terrorist attacks just 7 weeks before 9/11.
'Tall buildings shatter in 10 seconds, steel beams buckle as if crushed by
Superman. A volcano of ash darkens the sky. Can jet fuel perform such a
feat?' 'A 757 dives into the Pentagon, penetrating to its core. Invisible
Arabs hijack airplanes, passengers make history and untraceable phone
calls.' And questions about the integrity of television broadcasts over CNN,
CBS and Fox News. These four documentaries raise doubts, answer questions
and give detailed information on why the official 9/11 Commission Report
should be treated with great skepticism.

Come Carpentier is currently the Convener of the Editorial Board of the
World Affairs Journal, a quarterly publication dedicated to international
issues. In 1999 he co founded the Telesis Academy in Switzerland dedicated
to the study of the ancient wisdom of East and West in the contemporary
scientific context. He has been associated with the Nuclear Disarmament
Forum and the Foundation of Global Dialog in Switzerland, the Global
Commission to Finance the United nations, the Business Council for
Sustainable Development in Paris amongst many others.
