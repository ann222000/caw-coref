Summary:

Editor's note: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has a passionate desire for a
sustainable future. The economic, the political, and the personal
worlds are all part of this evolving vision. So too, is our spiritual
life. Kennedy views the corporate assault on the environment as &quot;a
moral assault on future generations.&quot; And he has worked tirelessly to
defend and preserve the common ecological birthright of our children.

In the 1990s, Kennedy helped lead the fight to turn back the
anti-environmental legislation during the 104th Congress. The New York
Watershed Agreement, which he negotiated on behalf of environmentalists
and New York City watershed consumers, is regarded as an international
model in stakeholder consensus negotiations and sustainable
development. Currently, he acts as Chief Prosecuting Attorney for
Riverkeepers, Senior Attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, and is President of the Waterkeeper Alliance. In addition to
work on environmental issues across the continent, Kennedy has assisted
several indigenous tribes in Latin America and Canada in successfully
negotiating treaties protecting traditional homelands.

In this article, the author warns us of the attack underway on our
natural heritage, of the dangers of domination of the government by
large corporations, and of the spiritual implications of our plunder of
the Earth.

Five years ago, if you asked the leaders of the major environmental
groups, 'What's the gravest threat to the global environment?', they
wouldn't have said, &quot;George W. Bush&quot;.
I have been an environmental advocate for twenty years, and I've been
disciplined during that period about being nonpartisan in my approach
to this issue. The worst thing that can happen to the environment is if
it becomes the province of a single political party. Most of the
environmental leaders in our country agree with me. Five years ago, if
you asked the leaders of the major environmental groups in America,
What's the gravest threat to the global environment?, they would have
given you a range of answers: overpopulation, habitat destruction,
global warming. Today, they will all tell you one thing: it's George
W. Bush. This is the worst environmental president that we have ever
had. You simply cannot speak honestly about the environment in any
context today without speaking critically about this president. If you
go to the Natural Resources Defense Council's web site you will see
over 400 major environmental rollbacks that have been promoted by this
administration over the last three and half years. It is a concerted,
deliberate attempt to eviscerate thirty years of environmental law. It
is a stealth attack, one that's been hidden from the public.

We found, in 2003, a memo from Frank Luntz, the president's pollster,
to the president saying that if you go through with the evisceration of
America's environmental law, you are going to alienate not just
Democrats but the Republican rank and file. Eighty-one percent in both
parties want clean air, they want stronger environmental laws and they
want them strictly enforced. Luntz said that to the president, and he
said, if we do this we have to do a stealth attack. He recommended
using Orwellian rhetoric to mask this radical agenda: They want to
destroy the forest, they call it the Healthy Forest Act, they want to
destroy the air they call it the Clear Skies Act. Most insidiously,
they have installed the worst, most irresponsible polluters in America,
and the lobbyists from those companies, as the heads of virtually all
the agencies and sub-secretariats and even Cabinet positions that
regulate or oversee our environment. The head of the Forest Service is
a timber industry lobbyist who is probably the most rapacious timber
industry lobbyist in American history. The head of public lands is a
mining industry lobbyist who believes that public lands are
unconstitutional. The head of the Air Division at the EPA is a utility
lobbyist who has represented the worst polluters in America for twenty
years. The head of Superfund is a woman whose former job was advising
companies how to evade Superfund. The second in command of EPA is a
Monsanto lobbyist-these are not exceptions, these are the rules
across the agencies. I think it's a good idea to bring business
people into government, to bring that experience and expertise. These
individuals did not enter government service for the purpose of
promoting the public interest, but in each of these cases, rather to
subvert the very laws that they are now charged with enforcing. We are
seeing the impacts of this already. This year, for the first year on
record, the EPA announced that the dead zone in Lake Erie-you
remember Lake Erie was declared dead prior to Earth Day 1970-is
growing. Our water in this country, according to EPA, is getting dirty
for the first time since the Clean Water Act was passed.

The rollbacks from the Bush administration have affected the lives of
millions and millions of Americans adversely. Consider just one
industry: the coal-burning utilities. One out of every four black
children in New York now has asthma. I have three sons who have asthma.
We don't know why we have this epidemic of pediatric asthma, but we
do know that asthma attacks are caused primarily by two components of
air pollution: ozone and particulates. In the Los Angeles Times
recently there was a description of a study that's about to be
published in the New England Journal of Medicine that shows that even
small amounts of ozone pollution do permanent damage to children's
lungs. In San Bernardino, for example, ten percent of the children have
lungs that are permanently damaged, that will never recover; and that
lung injury precipitates in human beings a whole host of other diseases
throughout their lifetime.

We know that the principal source of ozone and particulates in our air
is coming from 1,100 coal-burning power plants that are burning coal
illegally. They were supposed to install controls over fifteen years
ago. The Clinton administration was prosecuting 75 of the worst of
those plants. But this industry gave $48 million to President Bush
during the 2000 campaign, and they've contributed $58 million since.
One of the first things that President Bush did when he came to office
was to order the Justice Department to drop all 75 of those suits. The
Justice Department lawyers were shocked. This has never happened in our
history before, where somebody running as a presidential candidate
accepts money from a criminal and then lets that criminal off the hook.
Many of you remember what happened when President Clinton pardoned Mark
Rich and how indignant the press and the public was at that action. But
Mark Rich was one person, and he never killed anybody. According to
EPA, these 75 plants, just the criminal exceedences from these plants,
kill 5,500 Americans every year. After letting these criminals off the
hook, the president then went and rewrote the Clean Air Act, illegally
we believe. We're suing him, we'll win the suit, but it may take
ten years, and in the meantime they'll discharge what they want.

I live in New York State. Most of the fish in New York are now unsafe
to eat from mercury contamination. I live two miles from the state of
Connecticut; in Connecticut every freshwater fish is now unsafe to eat.
Last week, the Fish and Wildlife Service announced that in 19 states it
is unsafe to regularly eat any freshwater fish, and in 48 states at
least some fish are unsafe to eat. The mercury is coming, largely, from
those same 1,100 coal-burning power plants. We know a lot about mercury
that we didn't know five or ten years ago. We know that one out of
every six American women of childbearing years now has so much mercury
in her womb that her children are at risk for a grim inventory of
diseases: cognitive impairment; mental retardation; autism; blindness;
kidney, liver or heart disease. I have so much mercury in my body, I
was told by Dr. David Carpenter, who is the national authority on
mercury contamination, that if I were a woman of childbearing years and
produced a child, that the child would have cognitive impairment, and,
he estimated, a permanent IQ loss of five to seven points. There are
630,000 children born in this country every year who have been exposed
to dangerous levels of mercury in the womb.

Recognizing this threat to the American public, the Clinton
administration reclassified mercury as a hazardous pollutant under the
Clean Air Act; that triggered the requirement that those companies
remove 90 percent of that mercury within three and a half years. It
would have cost, according to EPA, less than one percent of the
revenues of those plants for them to do that. That's a great deal for
the American people, but it's still billions of dollars for that
industry. Eight weeks ago, Bush announced that he was scrapping the
Clinton-era rules and substituting, instead, rules that were written by
the industry's lobbying firm Latham and Watkins. On their face, they
say that they have to clean up, within fifteen years, 50 percent of the
mercury. But they've woven so many loopholes into the new rule that
they will literally never have to clean up. The chief lobbyist for the
firm who wrote it is now the head of the Air Division at EPA.

We are living today in a science fiction nightmare, a world where,
because somebody gave money to a politician, our children are brought
into a world where the air is too poisonous for them to breathe. This
is a world where, because somebody gave money to a politician, my
children and the children of millions of other Americans can no longer
enjoy the seminal, primal activities of their youth-which is to go
fishing with their father or mother and come home and eat the fish. I
live two hours south of the Adirondack Mountains. This is the oldest
protected wilderness area on the face of the Earth; it's been
protected since the 1880s. Today, one-fifth of the lakes in the
Adirondacks are sterilized from acid rain which is coming from those
same coal-burning power plants, and this president has put the brakes
on the statutory requirement that those companies remove the materials
that are causing the acid rain.

I flew recently over the coalfields of the Appalachians. I saw
something that if the American people could see there would be a
revolution in this country. We are cutting down the mountains,
literally cutting them down. The coal companies blow off the tops of
the mountains, using 2,500 tons of dynamite in West Virginia alone
every year. They fire the workers: When my father was fighting strip
mining in West Virginia in 1968 there were 114,000 coal miners digging
coal out of West Virginia. He told me that strip mining was not only
going to destroy the economy of West Virginia in the long term but it
was designed to destroy the jobs so that they didn't have to employ
union labor. Now, there are only 12,000 miners left to get the same
amount of coal. They do it by blowing off the tops of the mountains,
and they take that rubble and they dump it into the adjacent river
valley. They've already covered up 1,200 miles of our streams. We are
destroying, flattening this landscape that is a part of American
history. It's the source of our values, our virtues, our character as
a people; the landscapes, the mountains where Davy Crockett and Daniel
Boone roamed, and we are cutting them to the ground. Of course it's
illegal, you cannot take rubble and debris and toxic waste and dump it
into a river without a Clean Water Act permit, and the Clean Water Act
could never let you get a permit to do that. So we sued. Joe Lovett,
the attorney from West Virginia, sued the Bush administration and the
Army Corps of Engineers for allowing this practice to happen. We won
the lawsuit, and the judge enjoined all mountain top mining. Two days
from that victory, the Bush administration rewrote the Clean Water Act
to allow mountain top mining to continue forever; not only that, but
changed the structure of the act so that anybody can dump rubble and
debris simply by getting a rubber stamp permit from the Corps of
Engineers.

If you ask the people in the White House who are promoting this
legislation, Why are you doing this?, what they'll say is: We have to
choose between economic prosperity and environmental protection-that
is a false choice. In 100 percent of the situations, good environmental
policy is identical to good economic policy. We want to measure our
economy based upon how it produces jobs and how it preserves the value
of the assets of our community. If, on the other hand, we want to do
what the Bush administration has been urging us to do, which is to
treat the planet as if it were a business in liquidation, to convert
our natural resources to cash as quickly as possible, to have a few
years of pollution-based prosperity, we can generate an instantaneous
cash flow and the illusion of a prosperous economy. But our children
are going to pay for our joy ride. They are going to pay for it with
denuded landscapes and poor health and huge cleanup costs that are
going to amplify over time and that they are never going to be able to
pay. Environmental injury is deficit spending. It's a way of loading
the costs of our generation's prosperity onto the backs of our
children.

There is no stronger advocate for free-market capitalism than myself.
The free market spawns efficiency, and efficiency means the elimination
of waste. Waste is pollution, so in a true free-market economy you
would eliminate, as nearly as you can, pollution. In a true free-market
economy you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors
rich and without enriching your community. Polluters make themselves
rich by making everybody else poor. They raise standards of living for
themselves by lowering the quality of life for everybody else, and they
do that by escaping the discipline of the free market and forcing the
public to pay their production cost. You show me a polluter, I'll
show you a subsidy. Corporations are externalizing machines; they are
constantly trying to figure out a way to avoid their own costs and
foist it out on the public.

I'll give you an example. When the coal companies, the utilities,
discharge mercury into the air they are avoiding one of the costs of
bringing their products to market, which is the cost of properly
disposing of a dangerous processed chemical. When they avoid the costs
they can out-compete their competitors, they can out-compete gas and
oil and wind power. But the costs don't disappear. They go into the
fish, they make children sick, they permanently injure children's
lungs, they put people out of work, they acidify the lakes in the
Adirondacks and they've destroyed the forest cover of the Appalachian
Mountains all the way from Georgia up into Quebec. Those impacts impose
costs on the rest of us that should be reflected in the price of that
product. All of the federal environmental laws are meant to restore
free-market capitalism in America. I don't even consider myself an
environmentalist anymore. I'm a free marketeer. I go out into the
marketplace, I track down the polluters and I say to them, We are going
to force you to internalize your costs the same way that you're
internalizing your profits. Americans have to understand that there is
a huge difference between free-market capitalism which democratizes our
country, that brings us prosperity and efficiency, and the kind of
corporate crony capitalism which is as antithetical to democracy in
America as it is in Nigeria.

I work a lot with farmers trying to fight industrial hog meat
production, which is not only one of the primary threats to the
American environment but also one of the primary threats to the
American worker. It's allowing a few monopolies to control our food
supply and to put farmers out of business. Fifteen years ago there were
27,000 independent hog farmers in North Carolina, today there are none.
They have been replaced completely by 2,200 hog factories, 1,600 owned
or controlled by Smithfield Foods, one large corporation. They produce
such huge amounts of waste they have to dispose of it illegally, and so
they have to corrupt political officials in order to continue
operating.

I gave a speech a group of 1,200 farmers in Clear Lake, Iowa, and I
said that I am more frightened of these large multinationals than I am
of Osama bin Laden. I got a standing ovation from all the farmers in
the room, but I got six months of abuse from the farm bureau. I stand
by what I said. It's the same thing that Teddy Roosevelt said, that
our country was too strong and too committed to ever be destroyed by a
foreign enemy, but our democratic institutions would be subverted by
what he called &quot;malefactors of great wealth,&quot; who would destroy
them from within. Another great Republican, Abraham Lincoln, during the
heat of the Civil War in 1863, said, I have the South in front of me,
and the bankers behind me and for my country, I fear the bankers more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the beginning of American history our greatest political

"/>

leaders-Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, John Adams and Andrew
Jackson-have warned America against allowing large corporations to
dominate our political systems and our lives. Another Republican,
Dwight Eisenhower, the most famous speech he made was warning America
against the domination by the military-industrial complex. Franklin
Roosevelt said that the domination of our nation by large corporations
is the definition of fascism. I have an American Heritage Dictionary,
and the definition, if you look up fascism, says, &quot;the domination of
government by large corporations driven by right-wing ideology and
bellicose nationalism&quot;-that's getting to look pretty familiar.
The problem with letting large corporations dominate our government is
that it erodes democracy, it erodes our capacity to participate in
public life, our capacity for dignity, and it allows these entities to
squander resources that belong to our children. But the thing that
we've squandered worst of all is our natural heritage: the air that
we breathe, the water that we drink, the wildlife, the lands-all
these things that make us proud to be American. This administration has
taken the conserve out of conservatism. They claim to like the free
market, but what they are really embracing is corporate welfare
capitalism, socialism for the rich. They claim to love property rights,
but only when it's the right of a polluter to use his property to
destroy his neighbor's property or to destroy the public property.
They claim to like law and order, but they are the first ones to let
the large corporations and their corporate contributors violate the law
at public expense. They claim to love local control and states'
rights, but it's only in those instances when they're taking down
the barriers to large corporations.

They claim to embrace Christianity while violating the manifold
mandates of Christianity: that we are stewards of the land, and that we
are meant to care for nature. They have embraced this Christian heresy
of dominion theology, which James Watt was the first to enunciate when
he told the Senate, I don't think that there is any point in
protecting the public lands because we don't how long the world is
going to last before the Lord returns. The woman he mentored for twenty
years, Gale Norton, is running the Department of the Interior.

The reason that we protect nature is because it enriches us. It
enriches us economically, yes, the base of our economy, and we ignore
that at our peril. But it also enriches us aesthetically and
recreationally, culturally and historically, and spiritually. Human
beings have other appetites besides money, and if we don't feed them
we're not going to become the kind of beings that our Creator
intended. When we destroy nature we impoverish ourselves, we diminish
ourselves and we impoverish our children. We're not protecting those
ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest, as Rush Limbaugh loves to
say, for the sake of a spotted owl. We are protecting those forests
because we believe that the trees have more value to humanity standing
than they would have if we cut them down. I'm not fighting for the
Hudson for the sake of the shad or the sturgeon or the stripped bass
but because I believe my life will be richer; my children, my community
will be richer if we live in a world where there are shad and sturgeon
and striped bass in the Hudson. Commercial fishing on the Hudson is 350
years old. Many of these people come from Dutch families that learned
the same fishing methods that they're using today from the Algonquin
Indians during the Dutch colonial period. I want my children to be able
to touch them when they come to shore to repair their nets or wait out
the tides, and in doing that, connect themselves to New York history
and understand that they are part of something larger than themselves.
I don't want my children to grow up in a world where it's all
Unilever and 400-ton factory trolleys 100 miles offshore strip mining
the ocean with no interface with humanity, and where we have no family
farmers left in America; where we've driven the final nail into the
coffin of Thomas Jefferson's vision of an American democracy rooted
in tens of thousands of freeholds owned by family farmers, each with a
stake in our democracy. I don't want a world where we've lost touch
with the seasons and the tides and the things that connect us to the
ten thousand generations of human beings that were here before there
were laptops, and that connect us ultimately to God.

I don't believe that nature is God or that we ought to be worshiping
it as God, but I do believe that it's the way that God talks to us
most clearly. God talks to human beings through many vectors: through
each other, through organized religion, through the great books of
those religions, through wise people, through art, literature, music
and poetry-but nowhere with such clarity, texture, grace and joy as
through Creation. We don't know Michelangelo by looking at his
biography, we know him by looking at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
We know our Creator best by studying Creation, which all of the
religious texts mandate us to do. If you look at all of the great,
central epiphany in every religious tradition in mankind's history,
the revelation always occurs in the wilderness. Buddha had to go into
the wilderness to experience self-realization. Mohamed had to go to the
wilderness of Mount Hira in 629 and wrestle an angel in the middle of
the night to have the Koran squeezed out of him. Moses had to go onto
the wilderness of Mount Sinai to get the Commandments. The Jews had to
spend 40 years in the wilderness to purge themselves of the 400 years
of slavery in Egypt. Christ had to spend 40 days in the wilderness to
discover his divinity. His mentor was John the Baptist, a man of the
wilderness who lived in a cave in the Jordan Valley and dressed in the
skins of wild animals.

All of Christ's parables are taken from nature: I am the vine; you
are the branch; The Mustard Seed; the little swallows the scattering,
the seeds on fallow ground. He called himself a fisherman, a farmer, a
vineyard keeper, a shepherd. That's how he stayed in touch with the
people. He was saying things to them that contradicted everything that
they had heard from the literate, sophisticated people of their time.
They would have dismissed him as a quack but they were able to confirm
the wisdom of his parables about the fishes and the birds through their
own observations of the natural world. They were able to say: He's
not telling us something new, he's simply illuminating something
that's very, very old.

When we destroy these things, we're cutting ourselves off from the
very things that make us human, that give us a spiritual life. And for
these people on Capitol Hill to be saying that they are following the
mandate of Christ by liquidating our public assets-what they are
really doing is a moral affront to the next generation. That's why we
preserve nature. Not for our sake, but for the sake of the future. That
obligation is expressed by the term sustainability. All that word means
is that God wants us to use the things we've been given, to enrich
ourselves, to improve our quality of life, to serve others-but we
can't use them up. We can't sell the farm piece by piece in order
to pay for the groceries; we can't drain the pond to catch the fish.
We can't cut down the mountain to get at the coal. We can live off
the interest; we can't go into the capital that belongs to our
children.

As we go to press, the Bush Administration looks likely to reject ocean
reform recommendations set forth by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy
last year, despite warnings that the nation's ocean territories are
facing an ecological crisis. In addition: the White House seems poised
to increase logging in the Pacific Northwest; drilling in the Arctic
Wildlife Refuge is yet again being brought up for a vote in Congress by
the administration; a review of the Clean Air Act, one of history's
most successful environmental laws, is being brought up for review by
Republican lawmakers, as are the Endangered Species Act and the
National Environmental Policy Act, which requires that major
development projects detail their effect on the environment before they
can proceed.

and opportunities for action.
