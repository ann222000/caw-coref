I think, but am not sure that Luce will donate apps. The initial response
was a little chilly, but I could see his mind working out what to give us by
the time Susan and I finished dinner. Unfortunately, I have to call him
Tuesday morning for a definite answer. I will do this and keep you all
posted.

Joanne

Thanks Joanne!
I'm not sure who did the final produce run (I think Anne Marie), but should
I bring cucumbers tonight from my garden?  I'll have to come late to The
Bridge because I have a client at 5 and at 6, so I should be there just
after 7.  Let me know - I can also bring cherry tomatoes if you think we can
use them.
