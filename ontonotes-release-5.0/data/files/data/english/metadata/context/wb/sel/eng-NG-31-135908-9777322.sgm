As in &quot;Xpensive&quot;. I would hope that these same machines will surface
under a more reasonably priced listing or that these folks would
consider a reasonable offer. I'd almost dare to make them one, but I'm
not sure I want to foot the shipping bill right now.

My collection of 9585-X machines is getting quite large. Most of them
are transplanted Texans. I have enough to run a pretty wide card of
OSes...OS/2, Win95, NT4, Linux, and NT 3.1. There is at least one
&quot;duplicate&quot;, so I could probably squeeze in a Win98SE machine. That
would leave only DOS and Windows 3.1x...and I'm not sure I'd want to
waste an 85 on that.

Just curious.  Are they running with the 83mhz pentium overdrive?

Mmm, since the X uses a soldered on 486SX33, and you wandt to put in
another cpu in the upgrade socket, does that make you bi-curious....

The X upgrade socket is not Socket 3 (19x19) but only 17x17. That would
be a helluva interposer, fer sure...

No doubt.  The shipping was double the selling price, and that was
over five years ago.

I had a serious irrational desire for those machines, but the time my
basement in North Carolina was already full of 8595/9595/A beasts.

No. The &quot;X&quot; can't take such a chip, since it has only an &quot;SX upgrade&quot; socket
and not the Socket 2 or 3 that the POD requires.

I have at least one that is still running the soldered SX. All the others
have AMD 486-133 processors.

Well I have seen a 9585 with the socket like the lacuna had and just
wondered if there were similarities.

When I was in the salvage yard I saw a blue socket 9585 that could
take a POD 83mhz.  I thought they didn't have that.  As I looked at
the bunch of 9585's on the pallets I thought I saw one that could take
the 100mhz DX4 like the lacuna.  I vaguely remember it but I thought I
saw it.  At the time I thought they were common because they were so
many..........a shame to think that way now.
