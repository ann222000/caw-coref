Then why not either start discussing astrology and raise that number, or
(preferably) simply fuck off? Oh, I forgot - there's no one here to
discuss astrolgy with /you/, since you've systematically insulted and
alienated all of the actual astrologers for having the nerve to not toe
the Wollmann Party Line.

Which is sad, really, since even as a skeptic I see astrology being
discussed here in between volleys. What a shame that, rather than focus
on and improve those areas, you've chosen to try and fill King Pyrrhus'
shoes.

Fuck off, Ray.

So you planned to spark astrological discussion by making a lot of noise
and asking to get your ASCII ass paddled, while at the same time
slagging on what few actual astrologers are here. From anyone else I'd
say that a ridiculous non sequitur, but from you its about the speed
I've come to expect.

So you'd rather be the focus of the skeptics than Ed? Pretty
weird, Ray. The noise level is up, since you've been here,
taking heat for him. That's how you're going to reclaim aa?
I guess it makes as much sense as anything else you've said.

By the way, since you don't seem to know this: people mostly
don't talk *to* Ed when he's not here. They might talk
*about* him, but that does eventually die out. Except that
he loves to come back and assert his &lt;snarf!&gt; ownership.

&gt;&gt;&gt;up and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;said:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RM: You might have noticed that so far, no astrologers have disagreed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with my claim about how many posts they would read on the average
&gt;&gt;&gt;day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Point noted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's called 'trolling'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course no astrologer (or non-astrologer) has disagreed with him.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There aren't 200 new posts here on the average day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Often when both Raytard and Eddy are posting there is often over 200
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;articles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;per day. But none of those articles posted by Raytard nor Eddy contain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;astrological discussion...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen as high as 5-600, but it's been years. And it definitely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wasn't the passion of a good astrological discussion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Eddy is unable and unskilled in the art of discussion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What's worse is that I think he has the skill. He just doesn't use it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't think he is able to discuss. Discussion is the art of give and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;take. it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;allows that both people might learn from each other. Eddy is un-able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;take. he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is unable to learn anything from anyone else. (it is in his chart)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's a close call, not really knowing that much about his 'other'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;life... But he's made a mess here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ray is just a putz...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He plays this game- two, actually. The one he thinks he's playing, vs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what it is. It does increase the post count, but not the astrological
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;content.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and ends up counter productive in the end.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The big question is why?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Same thing he gets upset with the skeptics about- it's his form of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;entertainment. He thinks it's a 'loftier' purpose, but 'Sagittarius
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speak with forked tongue'. He pulls the same shit in aamod.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RM: I'm intrigued about this claim. Give us an example

&gt;&gt;&gt;You've consistently refused to acknowledge that you do indeed include
&gt;&gt;&gt;provocation as one of the methods you use to 'increase participation'.

&gt;&gt;RM: That's quite ridiculous. My aim at aamod ever since I first found
&gt;&gt;it was to increase the turnover rate because it was too slow, and I
&gt;&gt;could see Tropical astrology could go ahead rapidly if a lot more
&gt;&gt;participation occurred.
&gt;&gt;This has been done by:
&gt;&gt;* Introducing lots of new threads
&gt;&gt;* Encouraging lurkers to come in
&gt;&gt;* Advertising aamod on a.a.
&gt;&gt;* Sharing research results
&gt;&gt;* Assisting with moderation

&gt;Those work.

&gt;&gt;* Pointing out ridiculous astrology

&gt;That doesn't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Christine, Heather, Sharyn, myself, and maybe others (in aamod), and
&gt;&gt;&gt;*everyone* in aa, have pointed this out a number of times.

&gt;&gt;RM: I'll leave alt.astrology out for the moment and focus on aamod.
&gt;&gt;Your silly claim about me generating more posts through &quot;provocation&quot;
&gt;&gt;on aamod doesn't make sense because the records show that I generate
&gt;&gt;more *participation* because of the variety of topics I introduce.
&gt;&gt;I doubt very much if what you say is true about Christine, Heather,
&gt;&gt;Sharyn and yourself mentioning on aamod that provocation is present in
&gt;&gt;my posts there, but if you can find any, then post them here for our
&gt;&gt;perusal.

&gt;'Lilith in Synastry' thread.

&gt;You're just like Ed, in that you appear absolutely unwilling to take
&gt;responsibility for your actions. Yeah, it's the other person's problem
&gt;if they get upset, but if you're noticing that this is a pattern, then
&gt;it's probably worth investigating.

&gt;You're certainly willing to ask others to do the same.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But the end justifies the means, eh?

&gt;&gt;RM: On Alt.Astrology it does.

&gt;Then you are no better than those you criticize.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To me, the sign that he was actually doing what he says is that he'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be a catalyst in higher post count, not the reason. iow, it would stay
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;higher when he wasn't around. But it doesn't look like that really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;happens.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RM: What are you saying -- that the post count at aamod is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;considerably higher when I'm posting there frequently?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Provoking (as opposed to inspiring) people is one way to guarantee
&gt;&gt;&gt;higher post count.

&gt;&gt;RM: It's your imagination.

&gt;It's my observation.

&gt;&gt;My chief focus is on the advancement of Tropical Astrology, and this
&gt;&gt;means encouraging wide participation from all people, and the
&gt;&gt;challenging of some of ridiculous rubbish in it, and the pissing- off
&gt;&gt;of bullies and con-artists.

&gt;the pissing-off and challenging is counterproductive. Which is okay,
&gt;if you're okay with it. But you claim you're not. And it does run new
&gt;people off.

&gt;&gt;My ego is tied up with the credibility of Tropical Astrology -- and
&gt;&gt;not my own abilities.

&gt;Still an attachment to outcome.

&gt;&gt;This is why I respect Ed Wollmann so much -- because he is the ONLY
&gt;&gt;astrologer who has suffered spinics and pedantic fools like you for
&gt;&gt;year after year, in order to allow astrology to be discussed on MAIN
&gt;&gt;meeting point on the planet -- Alt.Astrology.

&gt;Nice rant.

&gt;First, my understanding is many mailing lists have more participants,
&gt;and certainly more astrology, than aa. Web forums are popular. Usenet
&gt;isn't.
">

I've had trouble getting people I meet on web forums, irc, etc. to
come to Usenet...something about getting insulted, account nuked,
mailbombed,  and/or sued is just not that appealing ;)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My head hurts trying to follow this one...

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RM: Let me explain further:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Spinics are on a.a. mostly to have fun ridiculing astrologers and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;driving them away with offensive language.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. There are no &quot;spinics.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;It is a pseudologism, a made up word.
&gt; &gt;&gt;It's not an &quot;industry&quot; word. It doesn't appear in the online
&gt; &gt;&gt;astrological dictionary.
&gt; &gt;&gt;2. The only astrologer who seems to be driven away is your gooroo
&gt; &gt;&gt;Eddieeeeeee (Buttboi) Wollmann.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;Is what was removed
&gt; &gt;&gt;Ray, you should have indicated a Snip here... you editing and snipping may
&gt; &gt;have
&gt; &gt;&gt;been an attempt to change a persons meaning.

&gt; &gt;&gt;How can you stand to be that dishonest?

&gt; &gt;&gt;You can take the un-necessary time to ad the stupid &quot;RM:&quot; in front of what
&gt; &gt;you
&gt; &gt;&gt;say, but you are too lazy or stupid to indicate a simple &lt;snip&gt; of a quote?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RM: Denial is futile.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Mindlless repetition is futile. It doesn't change the fact the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the word &quot;spinic&quot; doesn't exists outside the febrile
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;imaginations of your and Eddieeeeeee's single shared
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;synapse.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Eddy admission was it is created word which am mount to a pseudo

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've noticed by plotting this activity in the &quot;Microsoft Access&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;program, that if astrologers respond below a certain level, then that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;annoying behaviour never ends. If however astrologers respond very
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;frequently, the spinic (in most cases) goes away fairly quickly.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We (tinw) are not interested in driving away astrological discussion
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;from a.a. I'm confident you've been told this.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RM: Your insane cross posting indicates that you're not being honest.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Non sequitur

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The cross posting was initiated by Eddieeeeeee in order to troll
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;for validation, or try to find suckers for his astrological &quot;counsel.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The current list of my personal favorite newsgroups is as follows:

&gt; &gt;&gt;That is a true fact.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;alt.astrology.metapsych = This is a group Eddieeeeeee formed
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and later abandoned. Without the cross posts, the mighty post count
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;count would drop below that which would allow the group to continue
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;to exist. It is an homage to Eddieeeeeee that we contribute to the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;effort to keep it going.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Formed according to his own admission as an attempt to entrap people and
&gt; &gt;what he
&gt; &gt;&gt;thought would be a method of removing them from the net.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;alt.paranormal = Astrology and the paranormal are closely related.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Search Google for the explanation and rationale. Both Bruce
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Daniel Kettler, and Flagship1 of the Paranormal explained all.

&gt; &gt;&gt;and don't forget BDK was a &quot;certified Psychic&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Alt.bonehead.edmond-wollmann + Relevance is explained
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;by the group's name.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Alt.usenet.kooks = Eddieeeeeee and his antics are always on
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;topic in this group. He is one of the holders of multiple awards,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and his exploits are a source on interest and amusement.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Alt.fucknozzles = the group was originated just for Eddieeeeeee.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Your characterization of my cross posting as &quot;insane&quot; is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;hoist by its own petard, in this instance. Try a different whine.

&gt; &gt;&gt;and Eddy is the king of cross posting.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Our (tino) purpose here
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is to keep Eddieeeeeee from ruining this group by the non-stop abuse
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of astrologers in &quot;his&quot; newsgroup.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RM: It is spinics like yourself who have damaged alt.astrology.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Since there are no &quot;spinics,&quot; this statement has a truth value of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;false.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;Actually Eddy and Pete did more damage to AA, than any of the people that
&gt; &gt;&gt;have been called &quot;spinic&quot;. Ray has busy doing more damage.

&gt; RM: More damage from a spinic's point of view, because posts from
&gt; Astrologers on a.a. are now increasing at a nice rate, and the number
&gt; of astrologers visible in any bunch of 500 posts is much higher than
&gt; it was several weeks ago.

Meanwhile there are no allied tanks in Baghdad, Oceania has always been

&gt; &gt;&gt;an oversight on his part.

&gt; &gt;Or just plain cowardice. Not unlike his failure to show up for a
&gt; &gt;luncheon to which he had been invited, and at which he would have
&gt; &gt;been a guest. He even promised to bring along a police escort,

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;(although I will disagree: I'm

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;still an astrologer (does he is a psychologist, since he uses psychology:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;that's another story!). French astrologers know my position on this: *use
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;psycho if, and only if, you are a psycho*!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I bet that still sounds stupid in French.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;So, for the nuts that are poasting here: &quot;je les ai dans le cul&quot; (sorry I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;couldn't translate that in plain English). Or &quot;I have them in my asshole&quot;

&gt; legal action and threatening to 'crush' his critics (comments he's

&gt;&gt;I certainly do, and you are one of the perpetrators,

&gt; Give me a fucking break. All he's ever had to do is filter my posts.

&gt;&gt;and an embarrassment to Tropical astrologers.

&gt; Yeah, I know. You're willing to overlook massive misbehavior on his
&gt; part because he's an astrologer, but think I and some of the other
&gt; astrologers are out of line for calling him on it.

&gt; maybe if you'd been around the whole time it would have turned out
&gt; differently, but you weren't and it didn't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I respect Ed Wollmann for having the tenacity to deflect and defeat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those mad bastards for so long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I respect his right to express himself. I don't often respect his
&gt;&gt;&gt;expression.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These constant attacks on one person are the equivalent of the felony
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of aggravated assault

&gt;&gt;&gt;In your fevered imagination, unless you have some e-v-i-d-e-n-c-e.

&gt;&gt;RM: There is plenty of medical e-v-i-d-e-n-c-e  to support my claim.

&gt; Medical evidence about a legal claim? Concerning comments made in a

Ray denies that Eddy killed a teenaged boy; since Eddy is the one
that made the claim, Ray is calling Eddy a liar and therefore commiting
aggression against Eddy.  I think Ray should do the right thing and turn

He also seems to be excluding the fact that the definition quoted above

&gt;&gt;Magnetic recording media for high bit density
&gt;&gt;-How can high bit density be achieved in magnetic recording?-
&gt;&gt;Yoshihisa NAKAMURA
&gt;&gt;OYO BUTURI, vol.63, No.3, pp.240-247 (1994)

&gt;&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
&gt;&gt;--------
&gt;&gt;Areal bit density has remarkably increased in recent magnetic
recording
&gt;&gt;devices. This area per bit gas reached about 1 micro m2 , and it will
&gt;&gt;become less than 1 micro m2 within a few years/ Ultimately, magnetic
&gt;&gt;recording should be called spinic data storage, which has the
capability
&gt;&gt;of writing a binary digital signal on each single-domain fine magnetic
&gt;&gt;particle, which is a cluster of parallel spins of electronics.
Magnetic
&gt;&gt;recording technology is steadily developing toward spinic storage
&gt;&gt;because recent magnetic media realizing a high bit density consist of
a
&gt;&gt;single layer of fine magnetic particles closely spread over the
&gt;&gt;substrate. If we are to realize spinic storage devices in the future,
a
&gt;&gt;recording method utilizing the perpendicular magnetization mode will
be
&gt;&gt;free from the demagnetizing field preventing high bit density in a
&gt;&gt;recording utilizing the longitudinal magnetization mode. At least,
with
&gt;&gt;perpendicular spinic storage media, it will be possible to achieve a
bit
&gt;&gt;density of 1 Gbit/mm2, corresponding to the area of sevelal 10
columnar
&gt;&gt;magnetic particles of 10nm diameter, which is about 1000 times higher
&gt;&gt;than that of the current magnetic recording devices.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's another thing.  The only two morons who steadfastly refuse
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;acknowledge what spinic really means.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RM: The meaning of spinic is well documented on usenet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The term and definition existed long before Edmo started trying to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hijack the meaning.  Such integrity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RM: But let me guess, the dog ate your paperwork which confirms
&gt;&gt;this?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually no, I thought I'd give you adequate time for the lard to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ferment between your ears.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Magnetic recording media for high bit density
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-How can high bit density be achieved in magnetic recording?-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yoshihisa NAKAMURA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;OYO BUTURI, vol.63, No.3, pp.240-247 (1994)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;&gt;--
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Areal bit density has remarkably increased in recent magnetic
&gt;&gt;recording
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;devices. This area per bit gas reached about 1 micro m2 , and it
will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;become less than 1 micro m2 within a few years/ Ultimately, magnetic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recording should be called spinic data storage, which has the
&gt;&gt;capability
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of writing a binary digital signal on each single-domain fine
magnetic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;particle, which is a cluster of parallel spins of electronics.
&gt;&gt;Magnetic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recording technology is steadily developing toward spinic storage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;because recent magnetic media realizing a high bit density consist
of
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;single layer of fine magnetic particles closely spread over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;substrate. If we are to realize spinic storage devices in the
future,
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recording method utilizing the perpendicular magnetization mode will
&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;free from the demagnetizing field preventing high bit density in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recording utilizing the longitudinal magnetization mode. At least,
&gt;&gt;with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;perpendicular spinic storage media, it will be possible to achieve a
&gt;&gt;bit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;density of 1 Gbit/mm2, corresponding to the area of sevelal 10
&gt;&gt;columnar
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;magnetic particles of 10nm diameter, which is about 1000 times
higher
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than that of the current magnetic recording devices.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Spinic Storage Systems, ISSS

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The aim of the International Symposium on Spinic Storage Systems
&gt;&gt;(ISSS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2003) will be todiscuss high-density and high-speed storage and
its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;applications, and to foresee the emergence of novel information
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;storage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;technologies and applications, including those for multi-media
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;andbroadband networks. Spinic storage will be the focus of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;symposium. Using spin-clusters asbits, spinic storage extends the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;concept of perpendicular magnetic recording. It's impact
onrecording
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;systems, devices, and material technology development will be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discussed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Novel applications of high-density storage will be another
important
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aspect of the symposium. Typicalexamples for discussion will be:
new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Audio/Video applications and related technologies;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;medicalapplications;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and personal storage applications in areas such as entertainment
and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;education.Ubiquitous storage systems with high-speed wireless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;communication will be applied widely,using the capabilities of
high-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;density small form-factor storage systems.In this symposium, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;intermediate results from the “Development of Ultra-High Density
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SmallHard Disk Drive” project, supported by the IT-program
(Research
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Revolution 2002) of JapaneseMinistry of Education, Culture,
Sports,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Science and Technology, will be reported

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RM: You seem to be excluding the fact that languages have more
than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one meaning for some words.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not at all.  Just noting that the nutwit version by Wollmann isn't
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;initial coinage of the word in question.

&gt;&gt;&gt; RM: It doesn't  m-a-t-t-e-r , and Ed's version will be in use long
&gt;&gt;&gt; after &quot;moving part data storage technology&quot; is discarded.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Ironically Wollmann, deja/google has become your &quot;spinic data
storage&quot;
&gt;&gt;monument to moronic behavior for all eternity.&quot;

&gt; RM: Google won't be carrying garbage for &quot;all eternity&quot;. The internet
&gt; is only just starting to get warmed-up and they are already starting
&gt; to dump stuff because it's too costly.
">

Eternity as far as you and Edmo are concerned.  You'll both be worm shit
before this stuff ever disappears.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;easy it is for people to have their mind  fooled.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The simpler the mind, the quicker and more easily it is fooled.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You should examine waht I have actually said and then do some careful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;homework.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In reality 70% of everything you utter on usenet is false or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;defective.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Such numeric accuracy! You posted the number knowibg it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a lie, and knowing that 97% of all statistics is made up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fuck off, Ray.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ed Wollmann was convicted

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fraternising with spinics in San Diego.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't let truth keep you from insulting Pam. You would, however, do

&gt;&gt;Lying AGAIN??!!!!??

&gt;&gt;Yesterday, I answered exactly _one_ post from Michael
&gt;&gt;Rideout. There was no threat in it. If you have a difference of
&gt;&gt;opinion, I'd deem, it a favor if you'd point it out.

&gt;&gt;As for you, I take the statement that &quot;Shit can happen,&quot;
&gt;&gt;to be what you're talking about. No threat. A simple statement of
