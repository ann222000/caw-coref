&quot;MIAMI (AP) - The spray of bullets that killed a police officer and hurt
three others this week came from something increasingly common on this
city's streets: a high-powered assault weapon, fast becoming the gun of
choice for gang members and violent criminals.&quot;

And when the guns, once found solely in the hands of soldiers, are aimed
at officers on patrol, there's little authorities can do to escape.
&quot;Another issue potentially at play is the 2004 expiration of the federal
assault weapons ban, 10 years after its passage. The legislation
outlawed 19 types of guns, including the semiautomatic AK-47.&quot;

&quot;The guns are readily available on streets, Baixauli said, or can be
ordered by mail for under $200.&quot;

http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070914/D8RLFAQO0.html

Note that the source of the assault rifles by mail for under $200 comes
from Carlos Baixauli, who is identified as an agent with ATF. Is he
lying, or is he just that ignorant? Either case doesn't speak well for
federal law enforcement. Also, notice that the article continues to
confuse semi-auto rifles addressed by the Assault Rifle Ban with
military weapons.

well i havent been able to find a receiverless ak kit for under $200
of course they can say whatever they want to further their agenda
without repurcussions

just like the misleading anti-smoking truth campaign i guess you are
allowed to  lie for the greater good

which is also why police are allowed to lie to suspects during
interrogations but if the suspect lies they get in trouble

There is a pattern developing here. Last month, some &quot;spokesman for the
ATF&quot; claimed explosives, grenades, and grenade launchers were easily
available in Arizona. There are also the efforts to close down all gun
shops in Idaho:

I thought Arizona was just a twit and Red was having trouble with a
single jerk, but &quot;three times is enemy action&quot;.

Mail order guns?  Pretty sure that stopped with the Gun Control Act of 1968.
The only ones selling semi-auto rifles through the mail that I know of are
CMP Garands and M1 carbines.

Semi-auto AK's for $200 each?  REALLY good price.

Sure it can be ordered by mail but legally must be delivered through an
Federal Firearms Licensee to make the transfer and to do the background
check and the buyer must fill out a 4473 form just in the same manner as if
the gun is bought over the counter.

AK-47 - very doubtful.   More likely a look-alike semi-automatic clone.
Not many true AK-47s were ever imported as that would be a select fire
weapon.   What passes for AK-47 is actually a semi-automatic copy made both
in the U.S., and also imported from other parts of the world.

A citizen can legally order a gun by mail but he cannot legally accept
delivery by mail without going through a dealer (FFL) to do the transfer,
paperwork, and background check.    The press puts out a lot of hype on gun
issues and many half-truths or falsehoods.   You are getting what is known
as gray propaganda.

FWIW,  c!

well,you can ORDER a gun by mail,but to RECEIVE it,it has to go thru a FFL
(and the necessary NICS check and 4473)in your state.

IMO,an intentional deception by the F-Trooper.

Either a lying bastard or an ignorant one.  Flip a coin to figure
which.  It's amazing that 40 years after GCA '68 that folks still
think you can order guns by mail with nothing else needed and have
them show up in your mail box.  Not too many &quot;gangstas&quot; out there with
FFLs.

And they keep saying that about long guns, &quot;weapon of choice on the
streets&quot;. Last stats I saw showed less than 1% use in crimes, anything
later out there?    Haven't seen too many FALs used in drive-bys
around here.  The gun control drums are beating, guys, the the anti-
gun tribes are restless ..

Confusion between semi-autos and machineguns is deliberate.

Show me a $200 assault rifle, available legally in the US.  I'll even
take a semi-auto version for that money...  Might be some beatup
surplus M16s that the government is willing to sell off to police
departments for that money, not much else.

While we talk to each other, we should also send our comments to the

Well I broke the code &amp; figured this one out.  If I &quot;give&quot; you my
$14,000+  &quot;real&quot; AK and we follow all the laws, when you file your
paperwork for legal transfer, that is when the $200 comes into play.
Not less then, but exactly $200.

So there you have it.  The infamous $200 Assault Rifle Urban Legend
demystified.  Now all we have to do is figure out whom is willing to
give them away.

At the gunshow in Tucson last Saturday new AK-47s were running over
$500.  There were a few beat up ones for less but I only saw SKSs for
under $400. These are all gelding rifles, not full auto.

It was past NRA President Charlton Heston who said &quot;AK-47s are
inappropriate for private ownership, of course&quot;   Who am I to argue with
the President of the NRA?   So I bought a 6.8 SPC AR-15 and a case of
ammo for it instead.   Surely Mr. Heston would consider it appropriate
to buy a US made rifle.  (I won't post here what I really think of Mr.
Heston's comment, there may be children reading this.)

I think he is  loosely  associating  the SKS with the AK-47 which uses the
same ammo. They (SKS) are semi-auto and can be bought for under $200.
Although there are versions that use ak-47 mags, most don't come that way.
Still, the SKS is a lot of fire power for the buck.
In my neck of the woods, several deerhunters now use the SKS as their
primary hunting weapon because it is an economical and reliable weapon...
The SKS is more of a &quot;battle rifle&quot; than an &quot;assault rifle&quot;, but
anti-gunners try to include it anyway...

This is what I just sent to him, courtesy of the NY Times website.  While I
couldn't find a direct email, they had a form that would deliver the message:

=== cut begins ===
Your recent gun article floored me.  Where can you buy AK-47s through the mail
for under $200?

I defy you to purchase one for that price through the mail and then get it
delivered to either your home or your place of business.  I suspect you'll
either be out $200 with nothing to show for it or will be under arrest for
falling for a sting operation.

There is NO WAY.  Sure, you can order guns through the mail or on-line.  The
catch is you have to have the weapon delivered to a licensed dealer, then you
get to fill out the federal paperwork, then you get to go through the NICS
check.  If you can pass all of that, THEN you get your gun.

If you can buy a gun as you have asserted, then you will have committed a
felony.

BTW, any semiauto copy of a real AK-47 (which is full auto) would cost three
times as much as you've suggested.  If you found one for $200, I'd imagine
you've committed another felony, as that one is HOT.

How can you expect to have any credibility when you publish such distortions of
the truth?  As it now, I'll have to associate your name with other journalistic
greats such as Jayson Blair and Stephen Glass.  You seem to share the same
regard for the truth that they employed in their work.  Nice job.
=== cut ends===

As an aside, I also found a webpage of his where he tries to drum up chicks.  He
looks like a teenager even though the site says he's 27.

Criminy.  I can't even order a replacement receiver for my 10/22 (a
simple cast/machined piece of aluminum) without having it shipped to
my local FFL and going through all of the associated bureaucratic
gymnastics.

&quot;Assault weapon&quot; is essentially meaningless.  Contrast that with
&quot;assault rifle&quot;, which has a relatively well-defined meaning:

You can own full auto in lots of states.  Here in Oregon we can, if you can
afford it.
Priced have gone through the roof since the passage of the &quot;Gun owners
protection act&quot;
in 86.

You can't order one through the mail, and you sure as Hell can't buy one for
$200--
although that is the price of the tax stamp for a transfer.   Shitload of
paperwork,
pictures and prints, sign-off by your local LE, and MAYBE in six months or a
year you will get your gun.

You can order AK kits for 100-170 thru the mail...

Not hard to tweak theose, but highly illegal

Seen prices on those kits lately?  Those USED to be current prices
about 6 months or a year ago.  They're not letting any more in, supply
is down, prices are UP.  And I doubt if gangbangers have the
skills(and tools) to fold, weld and rivet a receiver together, if they
did, they wouldn't be gangbangers.

# I don't believe those kits come with a receiver.

13 bucks for the receiver and easy to bend...

I buy them not for 99-169...
Matter of fact, got a 99 kit a week ago.

There is no Welding...
Takes a few hand tools to make them
And ya don't need rivets
