Muslim sisters kill uncle for wearing Western trousers:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/11/23/wbehe...

23-year old French Jew, Ilan Halimi was abducted by Muslim immigrants
and tortured for three weeks in a basement of an apartment building in
a southeastern suburb of Paris. Some Muslim neighbors came to the
basement to watch the torture and to participate in the torture. About
30 Muslim immigrants living in the building heard the screams of the
tortured Jew for three weeks, but none of them called the police. The
Jew was later found tied to a tree near a railway track. Cigarettes
were burned into his skin. He had multiple stab wounds. One ear and
one toe was severed. 80% of his skin was burned. He died on his way to
a hospital. While the Jew was held hostage, his torturers called his
family on the phone many times. They made ransom demands and quoted
Koran while tortured Jew's screaming was heard in the background. The
French police refused to trace the phone calls claiming that they had
technical problems. The police also claimed that there was &quot;no anti-
Semitism involved.&quot; The Jew's mother, Ruth Halimi was not happy with
the way the police handled the case. She said: &quot;We told the police
that there had been at least three other attempted abductions of young
Jews, but they persisted in considering the motives purely criminal
because they are afraid of reviving a clash with the Muslims.&quot; The
French interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, described the abduction,
torture and killing of the Jew as an anti-Semitic crime.

Two years earlier another Jew named Sebastien Sellam was savagely
killed in the eastern part of Paris by a Muslim. The Muslim cut off
the Jew's head and took out his eyeballs with a fork. He came home a
few minutes later saying to his family: &quot;Now, I can go to paradise. I
killed my Jew.&quot; The Muslim was sent to jail, then to an insane asylum,
and declared cured two years later.

&quot;I'll tell you about the twelve young impure men I saw executed at
Dacca at the end of the Bangladesh war. They executed them on the
field of Dacca stadium, with bayonet blows to the torso or abdomen, in
the presence of twenty thousand faithful who applauded in the name of
God from the bleachers... After the twelve impure young men they killed
a little boy who had thrown himself at the executioners to save his
brother who had been condemned to death. They smashed his head with
their combat boots... at the conclusion of the slaughter, the twenty
thousand faithful (many of whom were women) left the bleachers and
went down on the field. Not as a disorganized mob, no. In an orderly
manner, with solemnity. They slowly formed a line and, again in the
name of God, walked over the cadavers. All the while thundering Allah-
akbar, Allah-akbar. They destroyed them like the Twin Towers of New
York. They reduced them to a bleeding carpet of smashed bones.&quot; -

MODERATE ISLAM

&quot;Jihad is holy fighting in Allah's Cause with full force of numbers
and weaponry. It is given the utmost importance in Islam and is one of
its pillars. By Jihad Islam is established, Allah's Word is made
superior (which means only Allah has the right to be worshiped), and
Islam is propagated. By abandoning Jihad (may Allah protect us from
that) Islam is destroyed and Muslims fall into an inferior position;
their honor is lost, their lands are stolen, their rule and authority
vanish. Jihad is an obligatory duty in Islam on every Muslim. He who
tries to escape from this duty, or does not in his innermost heart
wish to fulfil this duty, dies as a hypocrite.&quot; sources:

&quot;To say that moderate Islam is the solution to radical Islam implies
several things: that moderate Islam exists; that it represents the
true (though perhaps currently disregarded) norm of Islam; and that
radical Islam is a departure from that norm.&quot; - Lawrence Auster

Muslim activists emphasize that Islam is a religion of peace. They say
that &quot;Islam&quot; is derived from the Arabic word &quot;Salam,&quot; meaning peace,
while Islam, in fact, means &quot;Surrender&quot; (to the will of Allah). To
prove that Islam stands for peace, Muslims often quote certain verses
out of the early period of the Quranic revelation. Here are some of
them. &quot;Let there be no compulsion in religion.&quot; Surah 2: 256 &quot;And have
patience with what they (opponents) say, and leave them with noble
(dignity).&quot; Surah 73:10 However, what Muslim advocates deliberately
fail to say is that the peaceful verses from the Meccan period have
been abrogated (nullified) and replaced by the militant verses of the
Medinan period. These verses were written after Mohammed moved to
Medina, abandoned his peaceful approach and resorted to using the
sword. As an example of the abrogation, 124 verses of the Quran that
call for tolerance, peace, and patience have been canceled and
replaced by this one single verse: &quot;Fight and slay the Pagans wherever
ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them
in every stratagem (of war.)&quot; Surah 9:5 source: &quot;The Islamization of
America&quot; by Abdullah Al-Araby, http://infidelnation.org/DOWNLOADS/TheIslamizationofAmericaTheIsl.zip

This idea of abrogation was concocted to deal with the many
contradictions in the Koran. source: http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/004246.php

&quot;There is no moderate Islam. There are Muslims who are passive, who
don't always follow the rules of Islam, but there's really only one
Islam, defined as submission to the will of God. There's nothing
moderate about it... How naive is the self-deception of the West to
continue to talk of moderate Islam? We're trying to appease Islam, but
we are headed for a terrible confrontation between fascist Islam and
Right-wing fascists who will step in when liberals fail to do so...
Islam is the new fascism... The Islamic vision is a caliphate - a
society ruled by Sharia law.&quot; - Ayaan Hirsi Ali (She lives in the USA
and is the first refugee from Western Europe since the Holocaust.)

&quot;The terror and death inflicted on humanity is not the work of radical
Islam, neither the political Islam, nor the militant Islam. It is
Islam, period... To be a moderate Muslim demands that a person
explicitly renounce much of the violent, exclusionary, and radical
teachings of the Quran. By so doing, the individual issues his own
death warrant in Islamic countries, is condemned as an apostate if he
lives in a non-Islamic land, and may even earn a fatwa on his head...
The so-called moderate Muslims, even if they exist, are complicit in
the crimes of the radicals either by providing them with funds,
logistics, and new recruits or simply by failing actively to confront
and unequivocally renounce them.&quot; - Amil Imani

&quot;There does not exist an identifiable body of Muslims, substantive in
number or an outright majority, who could be described as &quot;moderate&quot;
by their repudiation of Muslim extremists. Violence has been an
integral part of Muslim history, irrespective of whether it is
sanctioned by Islam, and Muslims who unhesitatingly use violence to
advance their political ambitions have created a climate within their
faith culture that any Muslim who questions such practice is then
deemed apostate and subject to harm. Consequently, what might pass for
&quot;moderate&quot; Muslims, the large number of Muslims unaccounted for as to
what they think, in practical terms constitute a forest within which
extremists are incubated, nurtured, given ideological and material
support, and to which they return for sanctuary.&quot; - Salim Mansur

&quot;I studied the Quran a great deal. I came away from that study with
the conviction that by and large there have been few religions in the
world as deadly to men as that of Muhammad. As far as I can see, it is
the principal cause of the decadence so visible today in the Muslim
world.&quot; - Alexis de Tocqueville

&quot;Christians believe that &quot;love conquers all.&quot; Well, love does not
conquer Islam.&quot; - Bill Warner

&quot;Just as cancer cannot be reformed... Islam can't be reformed either and
it must be eradicated for the world to be saved.&quot; - Ali Sina

&quot;Islam is more than a religion. It is an elaborate one-party state
punishable by death if you leave it.&quot; - Noni Darwish

&quot;The object of jihad is to bring the whole world under Islamic law... In
an Islamic state, there is in principle no law other than the shar'ia,
the Holy Law of Islam... The idea that any group of persons, any kind of
activities, or any part of human life is in any sense outside the
scope of religious law and jurisdiction is alien to Muslim thought.&quot; -
Bernard Lewis

&quot;Islam contains specific notions of martyrdom and jihad that fully
explain the character of Muslim violence.&quot; - Sam Harris

&quot;The golden age of equal rights was a myth, and belief in it was a
result, more than a cause, of Jewish sympathy for Islam. The myth was
invented by Jews in nineteenth-century Europe as a reproach to
Christians.&quot; - Bernard Lewis

&quot;Apologizing to the Muslims for the Crusades is a complete betrayal to
the Crusaders who sacrificed their lives to stop Muslim invasion.&quot; -
Galadriel (anonymous evangelical Christian)

&quot;Know your enemy and you will not be defeated.&quot; - Sun Zi

ISLAMIC SLAVERY AND RAPE source:
http://frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Printable.aspx?GUID=16027ED9-FF...

Islam does not enslave Muslims, only kafirs (non-Muslims). Since only
kafirs are enslaved, it assures that more of the world submits to
Islam.

Islamic slavery is based on the Trilogy of the Koran, the Sira
(Mohammed's life) and the Hadith (the Traditions of Mohammed). All
three texts say that slavery is permitted, ethical, desirable and a
virtue. There is not one single negative word about slavery.

Slavery is seen as a process that brings kafirs to Islam. It is a
virtue to free slaves, but Mohammed only freed slaves who submitted to
Islam. If the kafir slave does not submit, then their children will.
So given enough time, slaves convert to Islam. That is one of the
reasons that Islam sees slavery as a positive...

Arabic has more words for slaves than any other language. Both a black
African and a black slave have the same name, abd. The historical
reason for this is that African slavery was so important to Islamic
economics. Language reflects history. Islamic legal history is filled
with the complaints by African Muslim jurists about how Arabic Muslim
slave traders captured African Muslims and sold them on the auction
block.

History records around 11,000,000 Africans being sent to the Americas
and about 13,000,000 being sent to Islamic countries for a total of
24,000,000 African slaves. To get one slave, many others have to be
killed for the tribe to surrender to enslavement. The old, sick and
children are left behind to starve. These collateral deaths are
conservatively estimated to about 5 to 1. So that implies that over
1400 years, 120,000,000 million Africans have been killed to furnish
Islam with its profits.

The accepted history of race in the U.S. is that white men captured
Africans, brought them to the U.S. and sold them as slaves. This is
wrong. When the white slavers showed up on the west coast of Africa,
they didn't capture Africans. They looked them over in the pens, gave
the Muslim slave traders their money, took their bills of sale, and
loaded their purchases into their boats.

The Muslims had been plying the trade of war, capture, enslavement,
and sale for a thousand years. Mohammed was a slave trader. Long after
the white slave traders quit, the Muslims continued their African
slave trade. It still exists today.

And to put a fine point on it, many African slaves were castrated by
removing both testicles and penis. Castrated slaves brought more on
the slave block. Castrated blacks were the traditional keepers of
Mohammed's mosque in Medina.

African slaves were called abd; white slaves were called mamluk. Most
black slaves were used in mining and heavy fieldwork. White slaves
were used more for skilled trades. White slaves were even promoted to
leadership positions, if they converted. Only one black slave was
promoted to leadership. He ruled Egypt and was a eunuch.

Over a million white slaves were taken from Europe. Our word, slave,
comes from Slav. A white woman was the highest price slave for 1400
years on the Meccan auction block. The Muslim who could not afford a
white sex slave choose an Ethiopian woman at a third of the price.

The most revolting enslavement of whites was how Turkish Muslims took
as a tax, one out of five Christian children in Islamic ruled Eastern
Europe. These male children were taken back to Turkey where they
became the janissaries, elite soldiers for the sultan. The Turkish
sultans did not trust tribal Muslims to be the elite palace guards,
since they all harbored ancient tribal rivalries. We see the same
distrust of Muslim tribal politics in Afghanistan, where kafirs are
used as presidential guards.

The Hindus were enslaved, but we don't have the number. We do know
that jihad took half of ancient Hindustan and killed 80,000,000
Hindus. We have accountings of Hindus being enslaved by the hundreds
of thousands at a time.

Muslims enslave everyone, but no one enslaves Muslims. This knowledge
is part of Islam's arrogance and superiority. They know the history;
it is the dhimmis (kafir apologists) who are ignorant of the doctrine
and history of Islamic slavery...

The enslavement of Africans is happening today. The only reason that
Islam stopped enslaving whites and Hindus is that Islam is too weak to
resist the social pressure. The Sunna of slavery has not changed, just
the ability to use their law.

In the African countryside Muslims are still using jihad to enrich
themselves. I have spoken with a Sudanese slave who escaped. The
Muslims killed his parents and took him and his sister. Each night the
jihadists gang raped his sister. Remember, rape is Sunna.

When he met his new masters, they put him in the middle of a circle of
the family and each beat him with a stick. He was told that his new
name was Abd, black slave. He slept in the barn with the animals.

Our media and intellectuals are quick to punish the slightest insult
by a white against a black man, but they have not the slightest
recognition of murder, rape and enslavement of blacks by Islam. Our
media and intellectuals are dhimmis...

The criticism of whites because of their being involved in slavery is
standard fair in the media and the universities. Try to find a
university that even teaches about the killing of 120,000,000 Africans
for Muslims to profit from the 24,000,000 slaves...

One thing whites and blacks have in common is that their ancestors
were enslaved by Islam, and both are too ignorant to know it. Blacks
and whites have a secret shame buried under the denial of being slaves
inside Islam...

The ignorance of kafir intellectuals about Islam is profound. They
don't know about how jihad killed the 120,000,000 Africans, the
60,000,000 Christians, the 80,000,000 Hindus or the 10,000,000
Buddhists. Our intellectuals do not know about the Tears of Jihad
(detailed in all of our books). That is a lot of death and ignorance--
270,000,000 dead. Our intellectuals don't know, don't care and don't
bother. They deny.

University Islamic studies never mention the Islamic political
doctrine. The media discusses Islam in terms of political correctness,
and multiculturalism. History courses don't teach about the
civilizational annihilation due to jihad. Religious leaders placate
imams in public gatherings and have no knowledge what the imam
actually thinks of them. Political thinkers do not even know Islam as
a political force...

Our intellectuals and the media have only one view of Islam--a glorious
civilization. They have created the &quot;terrorist&quot;, a bogus term based
upon ignorance. And the &quot;terrorist&quot; is not even a &quot;real&quot; Muslim, but
an extremist fundamentalist. All of these terms are based upon a
profound ignorance of Islamic political doctrine.

Intellectuals cannot connect the dots of persecution of other
intellectuals and artists today, such as Salman Rushdie, Theo van
Gogh, the Mohammed cartoon riots, and Daniel Pearl. Their persecution
is part of a 1400 year Islamic tradition of keeping all intellectuals
and artists in line with the doctrine of political Islam. But for our
intellectuals, there is no history, no connection, no pattern, no
doctrine of Islam. Their only doctrine is the doctrine of denial.
These intellectuals write our textbooks. Then our tax dollars buy the
books to feed the ignorance...

Rape is not a sin. Rape is permitted and encouraged by Mohammed and
the Koran. Islam is the only political system in the world that
includes rules for rape and war. Rape is jihad. How good can it get? A
Muslim gets to rape a kafir girl and get heaven credits. All jihad is
a ticket to Paradise.

The most disgusting aspect of the Islamic rape of kafirs is not the
rapes, but the kafir response. Kafirs become dhimmis by ignoring the
rapes. I challenge you to find one, even one, mention of Islamic rape
in the history books...

Our so-called &quot;feminist&quot; scholars... are traitors to our culture and a
shame and a disgrace. They remain silent in the face of heinous crimes
against women.

HIJRA (source: http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/16649.htm )

The process of migrating and establishing a Muslim community in a non-
Muslim context has an important place in Islamic theology. The word
hijra is used to describe such a migration... Muslims see the
establishment of a Muslim community in the UK as a contemporary hijra...
Some are even calling for Muslim-majority areas to become like an
Ottoman millet i.e. to organise their own social, cultural and
educational life in accordance with their religious beliefs. In parts
of France, says Taheri, a de facto millet system is already in place,
seen in Islamic head-dress, Islamic beards, Islamic control of the
administration, and the elimination of cinemas, dance-halls and shops
selling alcohol and pork... Islam is a territorial religion. Any space
once gained is considered sacred and should belong to the umma for
ever. Any lost space must be regained - even by force if necessary.
Migrant Muslim communities in the West are constantly engaged in
sacralising new areas, first the inner private spaces of their homes
and mosques, and latterly whole neighbourhoods (e.g. in Birmingham) by
means of marches and processions. So the ultimate end of sacred space
theology is autonomy for Muslims of the UK under Islamic law... Most
alarming of all is the prospect of Muslim secessionist violence in the
UK as in Kosovo, the Philippines, Thailand and elsewhere (Huntington's
much-reviled &quot;bloody borders of Islam&quot;). Now this is happening -
apparently - in France... Islamic enclaves would be defined by Islamic
values, education, politics, religious practice, and above all law.
They would be &quot;cleansed&quot; of any non-Muslim presence. This cleansing is
already beginning by means of threats and violence to isolated
churches in Muslim-majority areas.
