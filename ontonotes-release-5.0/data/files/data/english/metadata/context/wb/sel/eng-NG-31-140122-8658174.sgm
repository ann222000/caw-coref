Can anyone imagine if this guy was a top five pick? And for that matter ,
last off season we singed two first rounders before camp, one being the 4th
overall selection. This year we can't sign the 14th.
And anyone who thinks this is over structure or money is not being
realistic.
The bracketing deals are so close, Tannenbaum can point to one or the other
as a deal to emulate which is actually what Revis's agent is doing while
Tannenbaum is making up his own deal.
Rule one in negotiations is if you want something, you have to give up
something. The trick is not to give away all your position.
I actually wonder if Tannenbaum has even spoken to camp Revis most of this
week.

Another thing is the Jets are not exactly capped out like we were for so
many years where the did get all the picks signed.
Maybe we should have signed a FA OG and use up the cap. Historically, Revis
would have been in camp.

That makes two of us.

If we use the money to sign a late cut who starts, I won't mind. But I

IMO, they really haven't made a whole lot of good personel choices.
Unless Da Brick turns into Ogden this season, he is looking like a reach,
Barlow, Coleman, Shlegel, And Miller is a great return guy, but I don't
think he was drafted for that, and I don't think Miller is doing as well in
camp as Mangini is saying.

OK Glenn,

What about

Mangold

Washington

Smith

Ferguson

ETC..

I'm not even sure that this FO drafted Miller?  Did they?

In any case, I believe we are in good hands.

Just let them do their jobs and enjoy

Just my opinion...........

You're right on Miller, he was drafted two years ago, but you need to stop
this already.
Mangold looks solid, but Brick was pretty ordinary and wasn't even the best
OT drafted last season, Washington just got a shot because we screwed up
trading for Barlow. True he did OK, but I wouldn't be very excited with the
prospect of him being the man, and what has Smith done?

How do you know Tannenbaum has never been unreasonable when Bradway had the
final say on all contracts until last season? Last season was his first time
as GM and he did a great job of getting everyones deals done, but one year
does not make you what Jimmy Johnson was on Dallas.

Its a fair bet that Tanenbaum had a large part in the Jets having

John do you think it might be the second year bonus money that is going
around the league. The money that cannot be recovered if a player holds
out or self destructs.

I agree with you that nothing makes sense. I hope that this is because
all the news is coming from Revis' agent and we are getting
misinformation.

But who knows?

Wait a second, who was better than Ferguson? I'm pretty certain that
Brick was the only rookie tackle to play all 16 games. Keep in mind,
too, that tackles face some of the most athletic players to step onto
a football field. Defensive ends are the power forwards of football.
Don't be so quick to pass judgment. This kid is improving, he's added
muscle and he's constantly learning. I think he's going be a very
good, if not great, NFL player.

&gt; Rule one in negotiations is if you want something, you have to give up
&gt; something. The trick is not to give away all your position.
&gt; I actually wonder if Tannenbaum has even spoken to camp Revis most of this
&gt; week.
">

Tannenbaum is not exactly a moron. If the Jets sign Revis for five
years, then he'll be a free agent in the same year as Chad Pennington
and D'Brickashaw Ferguson. I don't know if you've noticed, but
quarterbacks and left tackles make a LOT of money.

Tannenbaum will be able to sign him for six years if he offers him
more money up front. At some point, he'll probably sweeten the offer.
If the Jets' have their eyes on a couple of training camp cuts, then
this hold out might last a while. If Revis caves in the mean time,
then Tannebaum gets his man for less value than the market dictates.

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK Glenn,

&gt; &gt; &gt; What about

&gt; &gt; &gt;                   Mangold

&gt; &gt; &gt;                   Washington

&gt; &gt; &gt;                   Smith

&gt; &gt; &gt;                   Ferguson

&gt; &gt; &gt;                   ETC..

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not even sure that this FO drafted Miller?  Did they?

&gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, I believe we are in good hands.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just let them do their jobs and enjoy

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my opinion...........

&gt; &gt; &gt; A J

&gt; &gt; You're right on Miller, he was drafted two years ago, but you need to stop
&gt; &gt; this already.
&gt; &gt; Mangold looks solid, but Brick was pretty ordinary and wasn't even the best
&gt; &gt; OT drafted last season, Washington just got a shot because we screwed up
&gt; &gt; trading for Barlow. True he did OK, but I wouldn't be very excited with the
&gt; &gt; prospect of him being the man, and what has Smith done?

&gt; Wait a second, who was better than Ferguson? I'm pretty certain that
&gt; Brick was the only rookie tackle to play all 16 games. Keep in mind,
&gt; too, that tackles face some of the most athletic players to step onto
&gt; a football field. Defensive ends are the power forwards of football.
&gt; Don't be so quick to pass judgment. This kid is improving, he's added
&gt; muscle and he's constantly learning. I think he's going be a very
&gt; good, if not great, NFL player.
">

You would be wrong about your &quot;pretty certain&quot;! If you check, Marcus
McNeill of the Chargers played in all 16 games,
http://www.nfl.com/players/playerpage/416619 ,
and had a pro bowl caliber year (he was a reserve,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Pro_Bowl#Offense ). Many thought MM was
a better player but injury concerns dropped his draft status
( http://scout.scout.com/a.z?s=211&amp;p;=8&amp;c;=1&amp;nid;=2003645 )

Who knows, maybe his career will fall apart due to the injury issue
later. But right not, unlike Brick MM is not just about potential, he is
about being a very good if not great OT now.

harlan

But no one considered Brick for pro bowl last year.

Not likely.

1.  No one knows what franchise money for CBs will be in 2012. For NS to
sign a deal for Revis that locks him up for that season, the money needs
to be equal to that amount. Since we don't know what it is, he has to be
foolish to agree now.

2. Revis is 22 now
( http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls;=en-us&amp;q;=Darrelle+Revis+bi
rthday&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8). After 5 years, he will be 27. He will be
worth more in his second contract because he will be so young with at
least three or four young more years in front of him.

I predict no way he signs a 6 year deal unless the last year is voidable
if he starts.

One of the local rags claimed the Jets could get a six year deal if
they gave him top ten money. The writer seemed to imply that the agent
was on board. Grain of salt, I know.

I agree with your point on Revis' earning potential five years from
now and that's why the Jets will have to offer more money up front.
They have room under the cap, but to determine the proper incentive
will take time. You can't plop large increments down on the table.
That will only increase his incentive to hold.

The Jets are forging new ground with this negotiation but people
respond to incentives. Once Tannenbaum puts the right offer together,
he'll get the six year contract. I'm not concerned. Tannenbaum seems
to have a very good grasp of the team's fiscal well being and I think
this negotiation was determined by financial models.

Yeah, but McNeill played at an extremely high level and was probably the
steal of the entire draft.  I think there's a pretty good chance that he
becomes the next Ogden.  As for DBrick, the jury's still out.  He could
become a good player at the position, or he could be a bust.  It's really
hard to predict at this point.
