$19 billion spent on perks each year

WASHINGTON - Congress is considering a plan that would require doctors
to disclose the free trips, meals and drugs they receive from drug
makers.

At a recent hearing, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., told about how
doctors were routinely wined and dined at her brother's restaurant in
Springfield, Mo.

&quot;He said the most lucrative part of their business was the private room
that was reserved by the pharmaceutical companies four nights a week,&quot;
she said. &quot;And the wine consumed was unbelievably expensive, the dinners
were unbelievably expensive.&quot;

Amid fears that the medical judgment of doctors is being compromised,
McCaskill and Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., are proposing a national gift
registry for doctors, where physicians would be forced to report the
freebies they receive.

Opponents of the registry say the drug samples are aimed at helping
patients, not doctors. And they argue that it's important for the drug
industry to stay in close contact with doctors to keep them informed
about the latest drugs.

Minnesota and Vermont have registry laws, but critics say they don't go
far enough. Proponents of a registry say it would help patients
understand the oftentimes-cozy relationships between doctors and the
pharmaceutical industry.

&quot;If it becomes a public record, it will have a cleansing effect on what
I think is an insidious practice,&quot; McCaskill said.

Jerome Kassirer, professor at Tufts University School of Medicine in
Boston, said medical meetings for doctors have become &quot;mini-circuses,
replete with enormous glittering displays and hovering attractive
personnel.&quot; And many of the marketing efforts, he said, are &quot;thinly
disguised bribes&quot; that are couched as education.

&quot;The magnitude of drug promotion astonishes, as 100,000 drug reps visit
doctors, residents, nurses and medical students every day and ply them
with free gifts, meals and gadgets,&quot; said Kassirer, the former editor of
the New England Journal of Medicine, who has written a book on the
subject.

This year, the New England Journal of Medicine  reported that 94 percent
of physicians had received food, trips and free medicine from the
pharmaceutical industry. The New York Times  reported last month that
one company invited doctors to a weekend training session in Florida,
giving them information on asthma medicine along with free airfare, a
hotel room, a rental car and a $2,700 stipend.

In a three-year period in Minnesota, doctors received 6,238 payments of
$100 or more from drug makers, totaling $22.4 million. Vermont reported
2,416 payments of $100 or more over a two-year period, but a majority of
the payments were not disclosed because of claims of trade secrets.

Kohl, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said recent
studies have shown that the more doctors interact with drug marketers,
the more likely they are to prescribe expensive drugs that are being
marketed to them even if cheaper generics would do just as well.

Overall, Kohl said, the drug industry is spending $19 billion each year
on marketing to doctors in the form of gifts, meals, drug samples and
the sponsorship of educational programs.

&quot;Many of these gifts are not illegal, but we need them disclosed,&quot; he
said.

The American Medical Association has declined to endorse the idea,
saying it has yet to consider it. But the issue is prompting plenty of
debate among doctors.

Greg Rosenthal, a co-founder of Physicians for Clinical Responsibility,
said doctors are now living &quot;in an age of pharmaceutical influence,&quot; and
he expressed fears that medical research is being compromised.

&quot;The influence of Big Pharm, as we call it, is pervasive,&quot; he said.
&quot;Research used to be independently funded and designed, but with the
decrease in public funding, drug companies have moved in aggressively. .
. . Even good research is tainted by the possibility of bias, and it's
very difficult to know what and what not to believe.&quot;

&gt;makers.
">

I have frequently heard different drug reps, dropping off samples to
the doctor, ask him how his ski trip or some other trip went. Then I'd
hear the rep &quot;remind&quot; the doctor about the next trip. The door to my
room was open enough to hear this conversation and I was sorta
shocked.

Then again, my doc has given me TONS and TONS of those samples.
Anything from enebulizer meds to those expensive non-narcotic pain
meds so I am not upset that the doctor gets free trips.

Doctors however ARE prescribing more expensive drugs because of these
trips. I recall a man tell me he was spending $7-$10 per day on high
blood pressure meds, ONE drug. I told him about one that was much
older and he asked for it and got it. It now costs less than 50 CENTS
per day. THAT is the real problem with those drug reps visiting your
doctor.

Most people are being prescribed drugs that costs 50-75% more than
they should simply based on drug reps visiting your doctor. Much
older, some 30+ years old, drugs will do as good a job as newer drugs.

My dad is taking a diabetes drug that is one of those you see tv and
magazine ads about. He could be taking a drug that is about 15 years
older and does as good a job with actually fewer side-effects. The
savings would be on the order of 50% or more. But he doesn't ask for
that cheaper drug because he gets about 1/3rd of his meds as free
samples and the doc prescribes enough pills so his co-pay is for one
month yet the prescription covers 3-months.

This 'game' has positives and negatives and if we get rid of it then
some patients will benefit greatly while other patients will literally
have to sell their home or file bankruptcy to afford the drugs.

I have occasionally received free samples from my doctor, but outside of
that, I really don't see any other positives from all of the attention
and perks showered on doctors by drug company reps. Doctors should be
getting their information about new drugs from scholarly journals,
rather than from the meetings they don't attend while they are on the
free junkets paid for by the drug companies.

And it seems very unlikely to me that there would be very many patients
who would have to sell their homes or file bankruptcy if they could no
longer get free samples from their doctors, so I think the downside of
this cozy relationship between doctors and drug company reps is far
greater than the upside.

Actually you'd be surprised at the impact free samples has on people.

Myself, I have received NO LESS than $500 per month in free meds per
month for nearly 2 years. My Father has received nearly $1,000 in free
samples.

A good example in nebulizers. I didn't get a free machine but the
doctor did give me the liquid med samples for free for nearly 9
months, saving me nearly $500 again.

Like I said, not everyone will see a benefit but the ones that do end
up seeing a life changing benefit.

Plenty of 60s people own their house outright. It wouldn't take much
in medication bills to have then either sell their house or take out a
second mortgage.

Sometimes those most outrageous things do happen to people.
