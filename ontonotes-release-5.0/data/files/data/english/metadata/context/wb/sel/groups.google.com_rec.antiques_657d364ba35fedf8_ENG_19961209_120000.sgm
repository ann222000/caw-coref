GLOBE HUNTING TOOLS

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

How much can I make? As much as you can; it depends on availability
and your keen eye to find antique globes. Globes bring lots of money
- hundreds and thousands. Globes do sell for as much as $100,000(US).

What do I get? I will pay you a finders fee (10% of my purchase
price) to you in US$ for every globe you find for me and I buy.

What types of globes am I looking for? Any size, any country of
origin, any language. Globes may depict the Earth (terrestrial), the
constellations (celestial) or other planets. All are desired. I want
globes with age which you should be able to identify by the color
(dark or rich coloring). Look for something that appears older or
different from globes you might have seen in school or in stores
selling new globes.

Where do I find the right globes? Globes are found in the funniest
places. Maybe a relative has one in the corner of the garage, attic,
or basement. Antique stores often have globes. Schools often sell or
&quot;dump&quot; old globes. Make sure if you find a globe that the person who
is selling it is the rightful owner.

What do I do when I find a globe that fits your description?
Collect the globe statistics (found below) and report them to me. Do
not get globe statistics by asking others. You will have to examine
the globe yourself - if possible.
Get the owners information: name, phone, fax, address, e-mail. Get
business cards whenever possible.
If the globe is good for me I will need photos of the piece (spend no
money). Often, the owner (especially if they are an antique dealer)
will provide and send pictures at no charge. If the globe sounds good
to me, but the owner won't provide pictures, then I'll pay your
expenses to take pictures and send them to me. I will only do this if
prearranged. I will require receipts for all expenses.
If possible ask the owner to hold the globe at least until I can see
the pictures. If holding a globe is impossible, then I may ask you to
overnight pictures to me using my Federal Express number.

How old do the globes have to be? As old as possible, but you don't
need to know a globe's age to know if I want it. I'll teach you what
to look for.

How can I get other people to help me find them and still make money?
Tell your friends or your friendly neighborhood antique dealer to
look for globes for you. I consider the first person to contact me
per transaction my agent for that piece. Feel free to let others
contact me. Only you will be paid the commission. I only pay one 10%
commission per transaction. What you earn is yours to keep or share
as you see fit.

What type of globes should I avoid, what do you not want?
Globe reproductions - usually Italian-made. They may look old, but
notice a lack of written information on the land masses. Old globes
will be chock full of data and writing. However, if in doubt get a
picture anyway. Then you'll know for sure.
Very recent globes. Anything not illuminated and with the counry of
Israel on it is not of interest. If in doubt or if it seems unusual
couldn't hurt to ask. Email me before you go on.
Any globe made of plastic.

GLOBE STATISTICS
(or what you'll need to tell me)
Do not guess or rely on other's assessments. Little or no information
is always better than incorrect information.

Name or maker: Globe makers print their names on the globe itself in
a decorative spot called the cartouche *. Look just above or just
below the equator usually in the ocean. Correct and complete
information is vital to help establish value, where the globe is from
and age. Record everything in the cartouche, and transcribe it as it
is written. Often globe makers were families. Initials and name
suffixes (i.e. &quot;&amp; son&quot;) are important to include.

Age: The age is important for me to know, but not necessary for you
to determine. If the date is not easily determined, then don't worry
about the age right now. Sometimes a cartouche* or an analemma*
includes a date (record all information found within the cartouche).
If you dont see a date there may not be one. That is okay. Most
important then is to tell me if the state of Israel is named on the
globe.

Size: Globe size is measured by the diameter of the &quot;ball&quot; itself. Do
not include the horizon ring* or the meridian* in the size. The
standard sizes are 4&quot; - 20&quot; all even numbers. Sometimes a globe size
can be an odd number. The diameter is often located on the
cartouche*. If the size cannot be found on the globe, then measure
the globe by holding a tape measure close to it and &quot;eyeball&quot; the
size. Do not wrap the tape measure along the edge, that will give the
circumference not the diameter. Sizes other than the globe's
diameter are not important, except to note whether the piece is a
table of floor globe.

Condition: Very important factor, though not as vital as one might
think. Either a piece is repair-worthy or not. Identifying condition
has 4 factors:
Perfect - not a thing wrong with it.
Whole - may have surface imperfections but no holes, dents. Completely round.
Scratched or nicked are tolerated but how much and where is a concern.
Very bad. With few exceptions the very bad globes are left to rot.

Price: Globes may seem expensive or cheap to you. I will know if its
affordable for me. Generally, the more expensive the better, for I
am looking for the highest of quality (I still buy lower-end pieces).
Do not limit yourself.

What its made of: Whatever a globe is made of it will be covered with
a paper map called gores *. We are concerned here with what's under
the map. Globes are made of a variety of materials. With experience
you will identify material by tapping the surface. I will not mention
materials I don't want (see Frequently Asked Questions for that) I
want globes made of:
Glass - they will be illuminated and have an electric cord (1930s - 1950s)
Wood
Paper mache under gesso
Metal

The Base: What the globe sits in should not be neglected. It can make
a globe better or be more important than the globe. Take note of:
What it's made of.
Its design: carving, ornate, or plain
Period - many bases are reproduced from old furniture periods, but a
deco base for instance may identify the age as from the 20s or 30s.
Figures, faces, animals.
A horizon ring *.
Casters.

GLOSSARY *

Cartouche-printed area on the globe which provides maker name and
other information which varies (where made, when made, who is
responsible for discoveries - ALL DATA SHOULD BE COPIED DOWN
VERBATTEM AND SUPPLIED TO ME.
Meridian-a metal band attached to globe which runs along the North
and South poles. There are both half and full meridians.
Analema - (not on all globes and not required to be on my globes) an
oval or figure 8 shape on some terrestrial globes ofen placed in a
sea area which shows the declination of the sun at any given time for
any day of the year. Note: sometimes a manufacturers date will be
found in or near the analema.
Horizon ring - often attached to the base of a globe it lies at and
surrounds the equator. There is often paper on the top of the
horizon ring which gives horoscope information and sometimes
manufacturers data. Read it to add to globe statistics.
Terrestrial globe - a globe of the Earth
Celestial globe - a globe of the constellations. The terrestrial and
celestial were once made as pairs. True pairs bring the major money.
Gores - eliptically shaped printed sections of map applied to a globe.

I ALSO BUY

Brass telescopes - must be in good shape; must be able to focus on
distant objects. Note: 1. dents; 2. floor-mounted, table-mounted, or
hand held; 3. focusing: is it draw (focuses by pulling out stages)
or rack and pinion focusing (focus by twisting a dial). These are a
lot of details you don't need unless you find a telescope.
School solar system models - called orrery, telurium, or
planetaurium. These are rare, and valuable. They are delicate and
usually damaged. Any found are a score. Note the maker name;
condition (does it function and condition of globe - the rest is very
repirable); materials used.
Nautical Ware - passenger steam ship items, compasses. Because of
shipping costs I will probably pass on anything very large, but try
me.
Related and unusual items - All I can say is don't limit yourself.
Man cannot live by globes alone, so I buy and sell anything I can
make a buck on. If someone says, &quot;throw it out,&quot; but you know its
worth something ask me.

"/> As he said Globes can make lots of money either Celestrial or
Terrestrial or a matching pair will really increase the value. A pair
of Cary's on stands c1830 could make 30000 UKÂ£.

Globes in the UK are easily sold via one of the major auction houses
and I would assume the same applies in the US. So why take his 10%
when you could send it to a proper sale and get the full market value.

Does this guy think we people on this ng are stupid or something.
