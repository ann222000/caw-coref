Children in some Army families are vulnerable to abuse and neglect by
their mothers when their fathers are away at war in Iraq and
Afghanistan, a large Pentagon-funded study finds.

Mothers were three times more likely to have a substantiated report of
child mistreatment when their soldier husbands were deployed than when
the fathers were home, according to the research. Mothers at home were
nearly four times as likely to neglect their children and nearly twice
as likely to physically abuse them during deployment periods.

“She leaves the young child alone in the apartment, doesn’t get the
child off to school in the morning, doesn’t keep the house in a livable
condition,” said lead author Deborah Gibbs of the nonprofit RTI
International in Research Triangle Park, N.C., describing typical scenarios.

Army officials said the study confirms what they’ve seen at large
military bases for nearly two years, overwhelmed and depressed mothers
neglecting their children.

“This is another recognition of the stress that families are
experiencing with multiple deployments, and that shouldn’t be a surprise
to anyone,” said Rene Robichaux, social work programs manager for the
U.S. Army Medical Command.

Yet the military keeps robbing the single soldier (by AAFES) and using
the stolen money to provide cheap diapers.  The military pushes people
to have more kids.

There is also an extremely high rate of domestic violence and sexual

Actually, I'd say, from what I saw, that it's low life scumbag
breeders who enlist because it's the only way to support their
cuntnuggets.

Used to be that an enlisted man had to get permission from his CO to
get married--&quot;If the Army wanted you to have a wife, they'd issue one
to you&quot;
It's just more of the pronatalist agenda, pushing breeding by whatever
means necessary.

When I was in, it didn't take me very long to figure out the
'ticket-punching' mentality which pushed young officers into marriage
and subsequent children. I have a feeling a single Army lieutenant
colonel would have a nigh impossible chance of being selected by a board
of his/her peers to command a batallion, regardless of ability or intellect.

When the leader has a family, it sets an example to the subordinates who
want to have a family. I just wanted to stay single and unattached so I
didn't have that to worry about, Several others of us had the same
mentality, though.

It's kinda like a checklist of things that'll get the officer
considered for higher rank. I've never served but I have the
impression that some of them might be Ranger or Airborne schools,
going to a Protestant church, volunteering for 'working with
kids', having a stable marriage with a spouse that participates
in whatever activities that are held in high esteem by higher-
ranking spouses and isn't a drunk, having kids who don't get
into trouble, glowing reports from a superior about fitness for
higher rank, a successful tour in responsible staff positions,
not appearing too bright, not expressing any opinion that
contradicts one held by a superior, interest in manly activities
such as hunting or fishing, etc.

One of the most important blocks on the checklist is command
in a combat situation. ISTR that the 'standard tour' for
lieutenants and captains during Viet Nam was six months mainly
because that would maximize the number of junior officers who
would be able to check off that box. That it had deleterious
effects on the morale and survivability of the people under
their commands was immaterial.

It's just that one would have to do A, B, C and D in order to be
considered for E. A civilian example might have B being &quot;participate in
a quality internship while in college&quot; and D might be &quot;have a family&quot; to
be qualigied for E which might be &quot;get promoted to middle management&quot;.

Running around to get that internship and family would be like going to
the bus drivers or train conductors at each stop to get one's travel
ticket punched.

A former boyfriend of mine was a Marine officer. He was CF, had a
vasectomy, and said that the officer corps in the Marines was more
conservative than the other branches. One of his C.O.s had eight kids.
At social functions, when he said he had none (always got asked), they'd
be shocked.

He retired after 20 years as a Lt.Col.
