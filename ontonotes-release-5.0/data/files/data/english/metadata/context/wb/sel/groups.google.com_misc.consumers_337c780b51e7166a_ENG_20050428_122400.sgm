Who's Selling What on Amazon
Some Shoppers Are Confused As Independent Merchants Make Up More of
Site's Sales
By MYLENE MANGALINDAN
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Several months ago, Christy Serrato bought a iPod mini digital-music
player through Amazon.com Inc.'s Web site. When it failed to arrive,
she sent a number of e-mails to the seller, without a reply. Only after
another round of e-mails did she finally get a refund, roughly two
months after her purchase.

The challenge for Ms. Serrato, a software saleswoman in San Francisco,
was that, while she used Amazon's Web site -- the seller was actually
one of the 925,000 independent merchants that sell through Amazon. When
one of these purchases goes awry, consumers aren't always sure who is
responsible, or even where to complain.

In an effort to boost sales and broaden its offerings, Amazon has been
adding independent merchants to its Web site at a quick clip. The
sellers range from individuals hawking used books to discounter Target
Corp. Merchandise from these outside sellers represents a growing
portion of Amazon's sales; in the company's results released this week,
it accounted for 27% of unit sales during the first quarter, compared
with 23% a year earlier. During a phone call with analysts after its
earnings release, Amazon said its substantial investment in technology
is aimed in part at improving the services and infrastructure it offers
its third-party merchants.

The proliferation of independent merchants is creating confusion for
some customers. Some say they have a hard time knowing whether they are
buying from Amazon itself or another retailer that sells through the
site. This can become an issue if there are problems with the service
or the product being purchased, because different sellers have
different policies on returns and refunds.

Two other major Internet companies also host marketplaces for
independent sellers, eBay Inc. and Yahoo Inc. Yet Amazon has more at
stake when its customers complain, because unlike the other two sites,
it is also a retailer. Any negative experiences that Amazon's customers
have with third-party partners could taint their perception of buying
from Amazon's own store. Though Amazon doesn't disclose its revenue
from third-party sales, analysts estimate they account for 4% to 5% of
its revenue.

It is unclear exactly how many people have wound up dealing with a
third party over a customer-service issue when they expected to be
talking directly to Amazon. The site doesn't disclose the number of
complaints it gets about independent sellers, or the number of refunds
it hands out. But Amazon's dual role -- as a marketplace and a retailer
-- can present complexities: When a person buys on Amazon, for example,
it is Amazon that charges their credit cards. Yet the sellers
themselves control and ship the goods. No matter whom they buy from,
users &quot;blame Amazon when something goes wrong,&quot; says Carrie Johnson, an
analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.

Amazon started its independent-merchant program in 2000 to help
shoppers locate hard-to-find items, such as an out-of-print book or a
wildly popular toy. In those cases, &quot;these third-party sellers come to
the rescue,&quot; says Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO. They do a &quot;great job,&quot; he
says.

Currently, when customers complain to Amazon about items that haven't
been delivered, Amazon steers them to the seller. Amazon's policy is
that the customer and merchant have to at least make an effort to
resolve their dispute.

The various third-party merchants that sell through the site have
differing policies on refunds. J&amp;R Music &amp; Computer World, for example,
doesn't accept returns on TVs or computer products; other products can
be returned to J&amp;R within 14 days, but it charges a restocking fee. For
customers of Something Silver, a jewelry merchant on Amazon, pieces
must be returned with the postage prepaid. Another merchant, eBags,
will waive its initial shipping fee and restocking fee if the return
results from an eBags or manufacturing error, but customers must fill
out an online merchandise-return form.

To become a seller on Amazon, a candidate simply has to describe the
condition of the item for sale, set the price and sign up for online
payment from the buyer through Amazon's payments system.

Some of Amazon's largest retail partners, such as Nordstrom, Target and
Toysrus.com, handle their own returns and refunds, so Amazon doesn't
guarantee those purchases. In other cases, if the complaint isn't
resolved after a certain period of time, Amazon steps in. The Seattle
e-tailer says it stands behind the independent sellers, and in some
cases will issue refunds. Amazon says it monitors complaints and return
rates among sellers, and bans those with unusually high rates. It
declines to say how many retailers it has banned from the site, or name
any of those who have lost their selling privileges.

Ms. Serrato ultimately got her refund, but not without some effort. Ms.
Serrato, 39 years old, ordered the $199.99 iPod mini in early November.
The only information she had about the seller was an e-mail address.
When the iPod didn't arrive, she e-mailed the seller repeatedly,
without receiving a reply. After three weeks, she e-mailed Amazon, and
was told she had to wait 30 days to file a claim.

When that period had passed, she applied for a refund through Amazon's
guarantee program. About two weeks later -- at the end of December --
she got the refund.

Melody Chee also had problems recently during a transaction with a
third-party merchant. The 50-year-old executive recruiter in Piedmont,
Calif., bought a used college guidebook through an independent seller
on Amazon's Web site last fall. When she hadn't received the book two
weeks later, she called Amazon. A customer-service representative told
her to contact the seller directly. She also says Amazon told her that
Amazon's records showed the book had been shipped, which she disputed.
She demanded a refund, which Amazon later sent her.

Ms. Chee, a regular Amazon customer, says she now examines the Web site
more carefully because, &quot;I don't want to buy from a third party
anymore.&quot;

Amazon says it tries to mark its product pages so shoppers know whether
they are buying from Amazon or a independent merchant. A recent sample
search for an iPod on Amazon led to a page with five sellers offering
the digital-music player; Amazon itself was one of the sellers, listed
fourth, between TopDJGear and J&amp;R MusicWorld.

Third-party sellers that handle their own returns and refunds are
listed on Amazon's Web site (in the &quot;A-to-Z Guarantee Protection&quot; page
under its &quot;Help&quot; section). For all other merchants, &quot;we stand behind
every transaction,&quot; says Sam Wheeler, Amazon director of small-business
solutions.

That means buyers are entitled to a refund if a seller doesn't deliver
a purchased item, or if the item is damaged, defective or &quot;materially
different&quot; from the seller's description. But Amazon requires customers
first to try to resolve their dispute with the seller directly. If they
still are unhappy 30 days after purchase, customers can submit a claim
with Amazon.

After Amazon receives a claim, it asks the seller for an explanation,
then decides whether to issue a refund. If Amazon issues a refund, it
reverses the electronic payment it made to the seller for the product.

GETTING A REFUND

The steps to follow if there are problems with a sale by Amazon or one
of its merchants

· Buyers can apply for a refund through Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee in
two cases: If they have paid for an item that the seller failed to
deliver, or the item is damaged, defective or &quot;materially different&quot;
from the seller's description.

· Buyers must try to contact the seller to resolve their problems. If
after 30 days from the purchase, the problem still isn't resolved, the
buyer can file an online claim with Amazon.

· Buyers are generally eligible for as much as $2,500 of the purchase
price, including shipping charges, if they bought items from the
company's Marketplace, Auctions or zShops programs. Other buyers are
eligible for as much as $250 of the purchase price.

· After receiving a claim, Amazon will investigate it. It may contact
the seller or ask the buyer for more information.

I've bought a few items through their &quot;Amazon marketplace&quot; and have
been very pleased. For a cheap ass bastard such as myself, it's
wonderful, especially for books and DVD's. That being said, I don't
buy big ticket items this way. I turned a friend of mine on to this
and he's been very happy buying DVD's this way as well. I think the
main example used in this story is part of the problem. If you did
much research on Ipods, you would quickly find that they are extremely
popular, and are rarely discounted. Just pick someone reputable and go
for it. Trying to save big bucks on an in demand item is just asking
for trouble.

"/> This is an interesting article, but they (the article) really
doesn't differentiate between the marketplace (individual
sellers) and big companies (J&amp;R, Target, etc.) enough. To get to
the Marketplace seller items, you have to specifically click on
the &quot;New and Used&quot; link on the page. But for one of Amazon's
partners, like J&amp;R, you might be taken directly to their product
page rather than Amazon's listing for that product. Now, in
theory Amazon is showing you the lowest price, but since their
3rd party merchants do not offer free shipping, Amazon may be
the lowest delivered price even if the price of the item is not
the lowest. Plus if there is a rebate on an item through Amazon,
you MUST buy it from Amazon, but they may be showing you someone
else's listing by default. And they make it unnecessarily
difficult to see the Amazon listing. Yes, you can put it in your
basket from the other seller's page, but then you have to click
on the item once it's in your cart to see the Amazon listing.
You should be able to have some setting on your account that
says &quot;always show me the Amazon item&quot;, period.
