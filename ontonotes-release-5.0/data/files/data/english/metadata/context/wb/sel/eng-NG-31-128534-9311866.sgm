I believe this might be caused by the presence of the Calendar widget
on the Start Page. When it is placed in the fixed left-hand column the
widgets get confused, with the Calendar appearing in an incorrectly
labelled box *and* the widget that should appear in that box not
appearing at all.

It also occurs in reverse, with the new widget appearing in the
Calendar's box and the Calendar not appearing at all. Perhaps this is
to do with the order in which they are placed?

Apologies if this is not the correct place to submit bug reports; I
couldn't see anything more formal.

Bump.

Have checked the &quot;Known Issues&quot; pages and there's no mention of this.

There's a few of this having this problem, any chance someone from
Google can confirm its status as a bug (or if there's something else
going on here)?

The best place to file bug reports is here:

http://www.google.com/support/a/users/bin/request.py?contact_type=sta...

For what it's worth, I can't reproduce the issue entirely, but there
was one case whereby I added LimitNone's gXFER widget to the fixed
column and it disappeared for a while before returning spectacularly
by it's own accord. Â The Calendar and other widgets were just fine,
however.

Regards,

Martyn
