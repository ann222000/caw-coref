There are some posters that still bandy about the ID creationist scam
as if it ever amounted to anything.  I don't know why they do this
when the guys that perpetrated the intelligent design creationist scam
dropped it for a new scam that doesn't even mention that ID ever
existed.  When the perps that ran the scam have a new scam, what does
that say about the old scam?

What would science be like if ID hadn't been a dishonest creationist
scam?  What if it had really turned out to be something that could be
verifiable?  What discoveries would have to be made to give ID some
scientific credibility?

Behe put forward some experiment that might have tested his notion of
IC, but he nor any other ID perp ever bothered to try to do the
experiment in the more than a decade that they were claiming ID was
science.  The Behe experiment probably wasn't worth doing anyway.
Behe knew that he couldn't reproduce the conditions under which the
flagellum evolved, so it was just more bogus posturing.  Heck, he
didn't even know what the first flagellum looked like.  How would he
know what the bacterium needed to evolve a flagellum?  It is a no
brainer that it probably only evolved once.  It isn't like it is
expected to happen every day.  We have plenty of evidence that it
evolved after the first one made its appearance.  Some lineages seem
to be missing parts.  They might have lost them or they might never
had had them.  The other linages may have added the parts.  The parts
themselves have changed in the various lineages over a very long time
period.  Some original parts may have been swapped out for new parts.
So how would anyone design the Behe flagellum experiment?  Would it
tell anyone anything about intelligent design?  You have to recall
that IC isn't ID.  All IC is, is the assertion that if there are
irreducibly complex (no one knows what that means, not even Behe)
biological systems that the existence of these IC systems may under
certain circumstances tell us something about possible intelligent
design.  Behe still hasn't gotten past the demonstrating IC part, let
alone figuring out if he can tell anything about intelligent design
from what he finds.  So what if he sets up an experiment and some
bacterial species never develops a flagellum?  How would he know that
he was running the experiment properly?  Wouldn't it have to work
before he could say that he got an interesting result?  How could he
possibly try all the possible initial conditions in order to claim
that he had exhausted the negative possiblilities?

The Biologic Institute was set up by the ID perps after they had to
admit that they hadn't bothered to do any science to support the ID
scam.  They seem to be doing something with protein sequence
evolution.  What could they possibly find that supported ID?

We could find evidence of Alien exploration of our planet in rock
layers dating to over 500 million years ago.  The Aliens could arrive
and show us what our planet looked like billions of years ago before
they started messing with it, and show us how they manipulated life on
earth.  I don't know of a single ID paleontologist that got funding
from the Discovery Institute to look for Alien evidence in the
Cambrian.  Some of them wrote junk about Cambrian manipulation, but
they never tried to determine if it could have happened.  A lot of
them kept saying that possible Alien designers made their scam
scientific, but they never seemed interested in doing anything about
it.

So, what would the ID scam artists have had to come up with to make
their scam really scientific instead of just pretending?  It is
obvious that what they did do didn't amount to squat, but what could
they have done?

also exist in bacteria without flagella, but from entirely different
sources.

And, of course, other forms of &quot;motility&quot; have also arisen even in
bacteria ('gliding motility') as  well as in eucaryotes and
multicellulars by similar co-option of existing structures.

That said, it is quite true that flagella only needs to have evolved
very rarely (twice, maybe a few more if you include extinct groups, in
3.5 billion years).  After that, most niches where flagella are really
useful get filled by vertical or horizontal transmission of the

Intelligent design science is based on tracing back origins to the
decisions at which the things were determined to be.

Starting from nothing, we get an orange. Well so what decisions in the
universe at large went into making this orange?

So starting from that question we would trace back to some major
decisions in the universe, as they affect life in general, and
specifically oranges, and specifically that particular orange. What
were the alternative values for the result? What probability was an
orange coming to be before the decision, and what probability was it
after?

That is how we look at the intelligent design of anything, including
for instance human made things like motorcars, what were the decisions
that made them come to be?

And the same way we look at the environment presently. The environment
of tomorrow is the result of decisions today.

Intelligent design theorists have that keen sense of looking at where
in the system the most influential decisions are made. Be it a weather-
system, a system of forming planets, or even societial systems. That
key-sense of turningpoints in a system, in a background of overlapping
bigger systems that effectively control the system within limits.

&gt; Ron Okimoto

Well, for ID not to be a dishonest scam, there must first be a THEORY
of intelligent design. Let's suppose for a moment that this theory of
ID were exactly what real-world ID proponents squawk about: A
predictive, testable, and accurate method to distinguish between
products of unintelligent processes and artifacts of conscious
entities.

I have no idea what such a method would look like; after all,
everything put forward so far by real-world ID proponents has failed
to pan out. But if we did have a working theory of ID, the scientific
and commercial applications would be enormous. After all, our planet
is positively crawling with at least seven billion intelligent
designers, and we take a great interest in their doings.

First and foremost, the potential applications in the fields of
intelligence, counter-intelligence, and other &quot;spy stuff&quot; would be
enormous. And almost ludicrously profitable! What would the US
government pay for a foolproof method for detecting an intelligently
designed signal against a background of communications noise? Get in
on the ground floor, gentlemen, because espionage is about to see its
biggest revolution since the Enigma machine. Better still, could we
apply the theory of intelligent design to reverse-engineer a cipher
that doesn't meet the criteria to be detected as intelligently
designed? (And what would it mean if we could?)

For that matter, a working theory of ID would revolutionize
telecommunications technology almost overnight. Interference and
signal-to-noise considerations would instantly go the way of the
vacuum tube! Any receiver could achieve perfect, crystal-clear
reception by mathematically filtering out the background noise from
the intelligently designed signal. Communications companies like
Sprint and Verizon would fight it out to have the best ID-recognition
algorithms, permitting a clearer signal with fewer towers and lower
total power cost.

Forensic sciences would benefit as well. Never again could a murderer
disguise his deed as an accident; nor would accident deaths be
mistaken for murder. Law enforcement officers could tell what aspects
of the crime scene are vital bits of evidence, and which are simply
circumstance. If the theory of intelligent design can distinguish
varying levels of design, we could even determine whether a crime was
premeditated or impulse-driven.

The &quot;pure sciences&quot; wouldn't be left behind, either. No doubt
anthropologists would eagerly apply the theory of intelligent design
to anything and everything, looking for clues they might earlier have
missed. (Some artifacts of civilization, such as arrowheads, are
notoriously difficult to distinguish from naturally-occurring
phenomenae.)

SETI would want to re-evaluate all astronomical data ever collected;
after all, it's possible that ET has been speaking to us but we simply
haven't heard or understood yet, but now we'd have a foolproof method
of knowing. We might find intelligent design in things we'd previously
overlooked; an open cluster might instead show unmistakable ID,
leaving us to wonder whether it's a cosmic &quot;Eat at Joes&quot; bulletin
board... or maybe an ideogram beaming a warning at us: &quot;Caution!
Berserkers are coming to destroy your civilization!&quot;

Better still, astronomers would be able to filter out things that look
like intelligence but aren't. So far, every sign of ID in the heavens
has turned out to be a false positive; remember that pulsars were
thought to exhibit &quot;intelligent design&quot; before we discovered there was
an explanation that didn't involve alien navigational beacons or
little green men.

A theory of intelligent design might even bring us closer to a true
artificial intelligence, if we could use ID theory to analyze
intelligence itself by its artifacts-- and perhaps discover what
&quot;intelligence&quot; really means in a quantitative sense.

I'm sure I've several items that would seem rather obvious to others.
A theory of intelligent design would transform our society as
completely and as subtly as the transistor did; the possible
applications are simply too numerous to list. That raises a
fascinating question, though... if ID isn't merely a political and
religious movement... if they really do have a working theory, as they
often imply... why aren't they following up with all the obvious and
lucrative implications?

Well the simple fact is, that by killing of intelligent design theory
you killed of looking at the universe in these enlightened terms of
decisionmaking. You've killed of understanding of what people
generally appreciate as true origins, and replaced it with
evolutionary sequences.

Bore me to death with another evolutionist just so story of one thing
following another thing. The bird followed from the dinosaur, you
don't say, whatever.

Unless we look at this from an intelligent design context it is
meaningless. We must trace back the probability of birds coming to be
to the decisions at which they were determined to be, and not
mindlessly fill our heads with one sequence after another.

&gt; &gt; had had them.  The other linages may have added the parts.  The parts
&gt; &gt; themselves have changed in the various lineages over a very long time
&gt; &gt; period.  Some original parts may have been swapped out for new parts.
&gt; &gt; So how would anyone design the Behe flagellum experiment?  Would it
&gt; &gt; tell anyone anything about intelligent design?  You have to recall
&gt; &gt; that IC isn't ID.  All IC is, is the assertion that if there are
&gt; &gt; irreducibly complex (no one knows what that means, not even Behe)
&gt; &gt; biological systems that the existence of these IC systems may under
&gt; &gt; certain circumstances tell us something about possible intelligent

&gt; &gt; alone figuring out if he can tell anything about intelligent design
&gt; &gt; from what he finds.  So what if he sets up an experiment and some
&gt; &gt; bacterial species never develops a flagellum?  How would he know that
&gt; &gt; he was running the experiment properly?  Wouldn't it have to work
&gt; &gt; before he could say that he got an interesting result?  How could he
&gt; &gt; possibly try all the possible initial conditions in order to claim
&gt; &gt; that he had exhausted the negative possiblilities?

&gt; &gt; The Biologic Institute was set up by the ID perps after they had to
&gt; &gt; admit that they hadn't bothered to do any science to support the ID
&gt; &gt; scam.  They seem to be doing something with protein sequence

&gt; &gt; We could find evidence of Alien exploration of our planet in rock
&gt; &gt; layers dating to over 500 million years ago.  The Aliens could arrive
&gt; &gt; and show us what our planet looked like billions of years ago before
&gt; &gt; they started messing with it, and show us how they manipulated life on
&gt; &gt; earth.  I don't know of a single ID paleontologist that got funding
&gt; &gt; from the Discovery Institute to look for Alien evidence in the
&gt; &gt; Cambrian.  Some of them wrote junk about Cambrian manipulation, but
&gt; &gt; they never tried to determine if it could have happened.  A lot of
&gt; &gt; them kept saying that possible Alien designers made their scam
&gt; &gt; scientific, but they never seemed interested in doing anything about
&gt; &gt; it.

&gt; &gt; So, what would the ID scam artists have had to come up with to make
&gt; &gt; their scam really scientific instead of just pretending?  It is
&gt; &gt; obvious that what they did do didn't amount to squat, but what could
&gt; &gt; they have done?

&gt; &gt; Ron Okimoto

&gt; Well, for ID not to be a dishonest scam, there must first be a THEORY
&gt; of intelligent design. Let's suppose for a moment that this theory of
&gt; ID were exactly what real-world ID proponents squawk about: A
&gt; predictive, testable, and accurate method to distinguish between
&gt; products of unintelligent processes and artifacts of conscious
&gt; entities.

&gt; I have no idea what such a method would look like; after all,
&gt; everything put forward so far by real-world ID proponents has failed
&gt; to pan out. But if we did have a working theory of ID, the scientific
&gt; and commercial applications would be enormous. After all, our planet
&gt; is positively crawling with at least seven billion intelligent
&gt; designers, and we take a great interest in their doings.

&gt; First and foremost, the potential applications in the fields of
&gt; intelligence, counter-intelligence, and other &quot;spy stuff&quot; would be
&gt; enormous. And almost ludicrously profitable! What would the US
&gt; government pay for a foolproof method for detecting an intelligently
&gt; designed signal against a background of communications noise? Get in
&gt; on the ground floor, gentlemen, because espionage is about to see its
&gt; biggest revolution since the Enigma machine. Better still, could we
&gt; apply the theory of intelligent design to reverse-engineer a cipher
&gt; that doesn't meet the criteria to be detected as intelligently
&gt; designed? (And what would it mean if we could?)

&gt; For that matter, a working theory of ID would revolutionize
&gt; telecommunications technology almost overnight. Interference and
&gt; signal-to-noise considerations would instantly go the way of the
&gt; vacuum tube! Any receiver could achieve perfect, crystal-clear
&gt; reception by mathematically filtering out the background noise from
&gt; the intelligently designed signal. Communications companies like
&gt; Sprint and Verizon would fight it out to have the best ID-recognition
&gt; algorithms, permitting a clearer signal with fewer towers and lower
&gt; total power cost.

&gt; Forensic sciences would benefit as well. Never again could a murderer
&gt; disguise his deed as an accident; nor would accident deaths be
&gt; mistaken for murder. Law enforcement officers could tell what aspects
&gt; of the crime scene are vital bits of evidence, and which are simply
&gt; circumstance. If the theory of intelligent design can distinguish
&gt; varying levels of design, we could even determine whether a crime was
&gt; premeditated or impulse-driven.

&gt; The &quot;pure sciences&quot; wouldn't be left behind, either. No doubt
&gt; anthropologists would eagerly apply the theory of intelligent design
&gt; to anything and everything, looking for clues they might earlier have
&gt; missed. (Some artifacts of civilization, such as arrowheads, are
&gt; notoriously difficult to distinguish from naturally-occurring
&gt; phenomenae.)

&gt; SETI would want to re-evaluate all astronomical data ever collected;
&gt; after all, it's possible that ET has been speaking to us but we simply
&gt; haven't heard or understood yet, but now we'd have a foolproof method
&gt; of knowing. We might find intelligent design in things we'd previously
&gt; overlooked; an open cluster might instead show unmistakable ID,
&gt; leaving us to wonder whether it's a cosmic &quot;Eat at Joes&quot; bulletin
&gt; board... or maybe an ideogram beaming a warning at us: &quot;Caution!
&gt; Berserkers are coming to destroy your civilization!&quot;

&gt; Better still, astronomers would be able to filter out things that look
&gt; like intelligence but aren't. So far, every sign of ID in the heavens
&gt; has turned out to be a false positive; remember that pulsars were
&gt; thought to exhibit &quot;intelligent design&quot; before we discovered there was
&gt; an explanation that didn't involve alien navigational beacons or
&gt; little green men.

&gt; A theory of intelligent design might even bring us closer to a true
&gt; artificial intelligence, if we could use ID theory to analyze
&gt; intelligence itself by its artifacts-- and perhaps discover what
&gt; &quot;intelligence&quot; really means in a quantitative sense.

&gt; I'm sure I've several items that would seem rather obvious to others.
&gt; A theory of intelligent design would transform our society as
&gt; completely and as subtly as the transistor did; the possible
&gt; applications are simply too numerous to list. That raises a
&gt; fascinating question, though... if ID isn't merely a political and
&gt; religious movement... if they really do have a working theory, as they
&gt; often imply... why aren't they following up with all the obvious and
&gt; lucrative implications?

The new scam is really not so new, but just the next step in the
progression that Henry Morris started.  First, under &quot;scientific
creationism,&quot; they took out mention of the Bible.  Then, under
&quot;intelligent design,&quot; they took out mention of a god.  Now, they are
taking out mention of creation altogether, teaching only against
evolution.  Or I should say, &quot;trying to teach&quot;; their true goals always
surface quite quickly.

The replacement scam was cooked up by the same dishonest perps that
ran the ID scam.  They did it back in 1999, so you know how much faith
they had in ID, but they forgot to tell their supporters that there
was a scam switch.  Santorum was fooled by the ID scam all the way up
to Dover and wasn't clued in until the ID scam was about to go to
court.  People that know how the IDiots used to bandy about Santorum
&quot;amendment&quot; that never was an amendment, know how the ID perps were
using it to further their ID scam.  That they wouldn't be honest with
someone like Santorum is sort of mind boggling.

http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id;=58

You have to pay to read the article, now.  It used to be free, but you
can get that they were talking about the &quot;teach the controversy&quot; scam
that far back.

We found out how they intended to use the replacement scam in Ohio in
2002.  If ID were worth anything they wouldn't have had to swap it out
for a new creationist scam that didn't even mention that ID had ever
existed.

http://www.ohioscience.org/L10-H23_Critical_Analysis_March.pdf

This is one of the later drafts of the teach the controversy scam.
They started calling it &quot;critical analysis&quot; because the teach the
controversy scam was linked too directly to the ID scam artists.  The
original draft that I saw had Wells' book listed in the references and
had the misfortune of putting the Wellsian lie about &quot;no moths on tree
trunks&quot; right in the lesson plan.  That stuff all got deleted as well
as the web links to creationist web sites, but the damage had been
done.  If the replacement scam had ever gone to court in Ohio it would
have been just like Dover except Icons of Evolution would have
replaced Pandas and People as the book that did in the scam, and a new
group of people that would either have to lie to support the scam, or
claim that they were only following the leaders and didn't know what
the scam was.

What gets me is that it is obvious that the same dishonest perps that
got caught running the ID scam are running the new scam, and that they
actually are running a &quot;bait and switch&quot; scam on any rube stupid
enough to have fallen for the ID scam.  Anyone that wanted to or wants
to teach ID is now given the replacement scam instead.  The rubes soon
find out that the replacement scam doesn't even mention that ID ever
existed, but some of them still fall in line to help perpetrate the
dishonest scam.

It may be the new game in town, but they are drowning in their own
dishonesty.  What is there that is left to support?

A good post, but they don't need a complete theory of intelligent

out.  They aren't even testable hypotheses at the moment, but if they
ever get them off the ground they might actually be applicable.  Just
think if we could use CSI to figure out more about the immune system
and could apply it for human health research.  The saddest thing is
that anything like that would have to happen by accident because they
only cooked up those notions to scam the rubes into thinking that
there was something to ID.  They never tried to test the notions to
determine if they were viable.  Some of them had the excuse that they
couldn't figure out how to test them, but what did Behe and Minnich
have to admit in court?  No scientific testing had been done and none
was being done that they knew of.  It had all been bogus fluff to scam
the rubes.  Some of it like CSI was put forward after the ID scam
artists had decided that they needed a replacement scam for ID.  Heck
places like ISCID and ARN were only started after the ID scam artists
had figured out that ID didn't make the grade as science, but they
never told their supporters or ever tried to make it clear why ID was
failing and what had to be done to bring it up to the level that it
could compete.  They just left the rubes to flounder around and be
used to help perpetrate the bait and switch scam that they ended up
running on any rube stupid enough to try and teach ID.

Yeah they already developed &quot;evolutionary psychology&quot; in the thirties
and forties of the last century but under a different name. It's
delusional to think that Darwinists / atheists would simply disregard
darwinism for psychology for about 150 years. They already tried it,
and the results were very bad. Now they try again, pretending that
they never tried before, for obvious reasons.

&gt; scam?  What if it had really turned out to be something that could be
&gt; verifiable?  What discoveries would have to be made to give ID some
&gt; scientific credibility?

&gt; Behe put forward some experiment that might have tested his notion of
&gt; IC, but he nor any other ID perp ever bothered to try to do the
&gt; experiment in the more than a decade that they were claiming ID was
&gt; science.  The Behe experiment probably wasn't worth doing anyway.
&gt; Behe knew that he couldn't reproduce the conditions under which the
&gt; flagellum evolved, so it was just more bogus posturing.  Heck, he
&gt; didn't even know what the first flagellum looked like.  How would he
&gt; know what the bacterium needed to evolve a flagellum?  It is a no
&gt; brainer that it probably only evolved once.  It isn't like it is
&gt; expected to happen every day.  We have plenty of evidence that it
&gt; evolved after the first one made its appearance.  Some lineages seem
&gt; to be missing parts.  They might have lost them or they might never
&gt; had had them.  The other linages may have added the parts.  The parts
&gt; themselves have changed in the various lineages over a very long time
&gt; period.  Some original parts may have been swapped out for new parts.
&gt; So how would anyone design the Behe flagellum experiment?  Would it
&gt; tell anyone anything about intelligent design?  You have to recall
&gt; that IC isn't ID.  All IC is, is the assertion that if there are
&gt; irreducibly complex (no one knows what that means, not even Behe)
&gt; biological systems that the existence of these IC systems may under
&gt; certain circumstances tell us something about possible intelligent
&gt; design.  Behe still hasn't gotten past the demonstrating IC part, let
&gt; alone figuring out if he can tell anything about intelligent design
&gt; from what he finds.  So what if he sets up an experiment and some
&gt; bacterial species never develops a flagellum?  How would he know that
&gt; he was running the experiment properly?  Wouldn't it have to work
&gt; before he could say that he got an interesting result?  How could he
&gt; possibly try all the possible initial conditions in order to claim
&gt; that he had exhausted the negative possiblilities?

&gt; The Biologic Institute was set up by the ID perps after they had to
&gt; admit that they hadn't bothered to do any science to support the ID
&gt; scam.  They seem to be doing something with protein sequence
&gt; evolution.  What could they possibly find that supported ID?

&gt; We could find evidence of Alien exploration of our planet in rock
&gt; layers dating to over 500 million years ago.  The Aliens could arrive
&gt; and show us what our planet looked like billions of years ago before
&gt; they started messing with it, and show us how they manipulated life on
&gt; earth.  I don't know of a single ID paleontologist that got funding
&gt; from the Discovery Institute to look for Alien evidence in the
&gt; Cambrian.  Some of them wrote junk about Cambrian manipulation, but
&gt; they never tried to determine if it could have happened.  A lot of
&gt; them kept saying that possible Alien designers made their scam
&gt; scientific, but they never seemed interested in doing anything about
&gt; it.

&gt; So, what would the ID scam artists have had to come up with to make
&gt; their scam really scientific instead of just pretending?  It is
&gt; obvious that what they did do didn't amount to squat, but what could
&gt; they have done?

&gt; Ron Okimoto
">

As you know, ID, and the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; creationism that gave
birth to it (e.g early &quot;Panda's&quot; drafts) were never meant to be
anything but a scam, even if the classic creationisms (&quot;scientific&quot;
YEC and OEC) had some element of honesty behind them. YEC and OEC
failed miserably as science, so a drastic change in strategy was in
order *before* it became imperative to omit the designer's identity.
And as you keep noting, it took at least 12 more years (1987-99) for
it to sink in that even an unnammed designer is too risky for public
schools.

Nevertheless, since the &quot;evolution&quot; of a scam parallels the evolution
of species, there probably is some &quot;exaptation&quot; involved. I think that
Behe was initially impressed by the &quot;self-organization&quot; ideas, and was
hoping to frame it as an alternative to Darwinian evolution (as
opposed to complementary, as Kauffman envisions it). Kauffman was also
very clear to note that his ideas were at best hypotheses, whereas
Behe wanted to sell it more as a &quot;paradigm shift.&quot; From his
perspective as a biochemist, Behe knew it was absurd to deny the
antiquity of life or common descent. But a radically new paradigm
emphasizing the insufficiency (real or imagined) of natural selection
would have been a great compromise between the &quot;special
creationists&quot; (YECs and OECs who deny common descent) and theistic
evolutionists who were not &quot;wedded to Darwin.&quot; Behe probably naively
thought that if rank &amp; file creationists were willing to accept OEC,
that they would concede common descent too, as long as they could be
assured that a designer is involved and &quot;Darwinism&quot; was refuted.

Unfortunately the lure of YEC and OEC as both apologetics and
pseudoscience - not unlike the lure of astrology - was too great, and
Behe's compromise would not likely sell for the foreseeable future. So
by the 90s, certainly after Phillip Johnson came along, it became
clear that there was no middle ground. There was science, including
minority ideas like Kauffman's, and there was pseudoscience. With at
least one group (IDers) trying their best to get as many diverse
viewpoints under the pseudoscience big tent.

&gt; &gt; A nit to pick.  Rotary flagellae in bacteria have evolved at least
&gt; &gt; twice, the eubacterial flagella that Behe talks about and at least one
&gt; &gt; kind of archaebacterial flagella.  In both cases, the whip and motor
&gt; &gt; have been co-opted from existing whip-like and motor structures that
&gt; &gt; also exist in bacteria without flagella, but from entirely different
&gt; &gt; sources.

&gt; Are you talking about cilia?  Someone once corrected me that they
&gt; weren't flagella.  Sometimes the two words are interchanged (long
&gt; cilia are sometimes called flagella).
">

No.  Cilia are related to eucaryotic flagella.  Unlike the rotary
motility of both the eubacterial and archaean flagella, eucaryotic
cilia flagella work by slip-slide mechanism rather than a rotary one.

The archaean flagella is composed of a solid whip-like pilin which,
unlike the eubacterial whip is built up from the inside and gets
pushed out.  The eubacterial whip is a hollow tube and gets added to
at its distal tip by proteins that are exported through the tube.  The
motor/stator of the eubacterial flagella uses movement of H+
(sometimes Na+) ions across the cell membrane to generate the
propulsive activity.  The archaean motor/stator uses ATP cleavage.
The co-opted proteins of both whip and motor/stator are quite
different in the two groups.  So, like the wings of insects and bats,
the two types of flagella are analogous to each other, not homologous
by common descent.  Both do, however, work by the motor causing the
whip to rotate.  In the case of the eubacterial flagella at least,
whip motility is indirect: the stator moves the pore that contains the
whip.

The Wiki article is pretty much in agreement with the above and is
easier to read than all the technical articles.

It isn't that they won't stop lying and that they know that they are
lying.  You could have said that about the scientific creationist
too.  The IDiots that were running the ID scam actually plotted and
ran a bait and switch scam on the rubes that they were conning.  We
call what they did and are doing &quot;the bait and switch.&quot;

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_and_switch

Wiki calls it a fraud, but fraud is too PC a word for what the IDiot
scam artists did and are doing.  You have to understand that they were
not just running the scam on any old rubes that came off the street
for a bargain.  They manipulated the targets religious beliefs (and if
you believe them the people that have the same religious beliefs that
the scam artists hold), and used those beliefs to further their scam.
Heck, in the bait and switch example for Wiki, a product of higher
value is substituted for the advertised sale item.  In the case of the
Intelligent design bait and switch something more dishonest was
substituted for the original advertised product.  It didn't have a
higher value, it was just harder to swallow because it obviously
didn't do what the rubes wanted it to do, and they would have to rely
on sneaking in what they really wanted to teach.

There is no doubt that the Ohio State board of education creationist
rubes had bought into the teach ID scam.  A majority of the
creationists on the board accepted the switch that came from the guys
that they had just caught lying to their faces about the science of
ID.  The Ohio rubes had creationist web links in the original drafts
of their model lesson plan.  There is no reason to guess why they
accepted the teach the controversy obfuscation scam from the dishonest
ID perps.  The old adage that you can't con an honest man holds for
the guys accepting the switch.

The evidence indicates that the ID perps knew that ID didn't measure
up years before they had to openly admit that fact, and anyone can
look up what they were planning and have 20:20 hindsight as to exactly
what they did and are currently doing.

The ID perps sold the ID scam and they are still selling the ID scam.
What they are giving the rubes to teach is just a dishonest
obfuscation scam that can't even mention why they are obfuscating.
Currently, all ID is being used for is as smoke to make the
creationist rubes believe that there is some controversy that they
want to teach.  Some of them are still ignorant of the fact that
creationism and/or ID cannot be referred to or mentioned in the
replacement scam.  It doesn't matter, enough want to go on with the
scam even when they find out how they were conned.  Scam is too nice
of a word for what is being perpetrated, but it is exactly what ID is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; A nit to pick.  Rotary flagellae in bacteria have evolved at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; twice, the eubacterial flagella that Behe talks about and at least one
&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of archaebacterial flagella.  In both cases, the whip and motor
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been co-opted from existing whip-like and motor structures that
&gt; &gt; &gt; also exist in bacteria without flagella, but from entirely different
&gt; &gt; &gt; sources.

&gt; &gt; Are you talking about cilia?  Someone once corrected me that they
&gt; &gt; weren't flagella.  Sometimes the two words are interchanged (long
&gt; &gt; cilia are sometimes called flagella).

&gt; No.  Cilia are related to eucaryotic flagella.  Unlike the rotary
&gt; motility of both the eubacterial and archaean flagella, eucaryotic
&gt; cilia flagella work by slip-slide mechanism rather than a rotary one.

&gt; The archaean flagella is composed of a solid whip-like pilin which,
&gt; unlike the eubacterial whip is built up from the inside and gets
&gt; pushed out.  The eubacterial whip is a hollow tube and gets added to
&gt; at its distal tip by proteins that are exported through the tube.  The
&gt; motor/stator of the eubacterial flagella uses movement of H+
&gt; (sometimes Na+) ions across the cell membrane to generate the
&gt; propulsive activity.  The archaean motor/stator uses ATP cleavage.
&gt; The co-opted proteins of both whip and motor/stator are quite
&gt; different in the two groups.  So, like the wings of insects and bats,
&gt; the two types of flagella are analogous to each other, not homologous
&gt; by common descent.  Both do, however, work by the motor causing the
&gt; whip to rotate.  In the case of the eubacterial flagella at least,
&gt; whip motility is indirect: the stator moves the pore that contains the
&gt; whip.

&gt; The Wiki article is pretty much in agreement with the above and is
&gt; easier to read than all the technical articles.

Gee, if it's a scam then where is all the profit? It's not there.
Intelligent design is just a bunch of people who honestly and
sincerely seek to bring belief in well... intelligent design into
science. That is a great benefit to science certainly. It is simply
not possible for anybody to not be completely and utterly bored to
death by science without context understanding of creation, creator,
creativity, intelligent design, origins, consciousness, choosing,
freedom, purpose, spirit etc.

if your view of 'understanding' (sic) isn't science then it's

You need to do your own research.  Nonprofit doesn't mean that noone
makes money.  They give fellowships at the Discovery Institute even if
you've never got one.  I doubt that guys like Meyer or Luskin work for
free.  What has anyone of the recipients ever done with the money?
Dembski is known to brag about how much he makes on his books.  He is
also on the board of the FTE (the publishers of ID scam book Pandas
and People).  Guys like Meyer are on the board of directors of places
like ARN.  Just go to ARN and look at all the junk that they hawk.

Not only that, but a scam doesn't need to entail monetary profit.  ID
is mostly a religious political scam.  There is money involved, but it
has more to do with political will and power over others than it does
with the money.  Why would they have had to lie to their supporters
for years if it were not a dishonest political scam?  Did you believe
what they claimed about ID all these years?  Why don't you believe
them when they are now admitting that there never was a scientific
theory of intelligent design, or as Philip Johnson admits, nothing
equivalent to what science has.  Even Meyer has been recently claiming
that teaching ID is &quot;premature.&quot;  So where did all the wonderful
science go?  Why is teaching ID premature today, but it wasn't a
decade ago?  They ran a dishonest scam, and got caught.  To get out of
it they ran and even more bogus bait and switch scam on any rube
stupid enough to believe what they told them about ID.  They are
currently running the bait and switch on anyone that still hasn't
gotten the message that ID was bogus.  Have you seen what the new scam
is?  Why is the new scam being perpetrated by the same guys that
perpetrated the ID scam when it doesn't even mention that ID ever
existed?  If ID was not a scam why do the perps need a replacement
scam?

If they did, then why don't threy back up their pretense of being
scientific, and of being &quot;not creationism,&quot; and devote &quot;equal
time&quot; (or more) to criticizing classic creationism. If Behe is any
indication of a &quot;default&quot; ID position - and he must be because no
other IDers criticize him directly - then ID tacitly admits that YEC
and OEC have far more problems than evolution.

BTW, why do they insist on caricaturizing evolution as &quot;Darwinism&quot; if
it's not a scam? Why all the inconsistencies (e.g.&quot;Darwinism&quot; is
unfalsifiable and falsified&quot; if it's not a scam?

Don't get me wrong, just because it is s scam does not necessarily
mean that money is their primary goal. Rather, political control is,
and I think that they'd do it for free if necessary. I have no reason
to doubt that they sincerely believe that the &quot;masses&quot; ould not behave
properly if they knew the truth about evolution. So they misrepresent
it at all costs.

Yea, I forgot the fees they get for speaking.  The IDEA scam clubs
that were supposed to exist to discuss the nonexistant science of ID,
but had the requirement where the club officers had to be Christians
(it was all about the science;-)) had the suggested price tag for
getting one of the IDiots to come speak at their University as
something like 3 or 4 thousand dollars plus expenses.  They used to
have that kind of information posted on their web site.  Not only do
they get a group of rubes together, but they even have to tell them
how much to pay for the worthless junk.  Casey Luskin is supposed to
have been instrumental in starting the IDEA clubs, and he is now one
of the paid propagandists over at the Discovery Institute intelligent
design scam outfit.  Is that some kind of conflict of interest or just
good business management to create a campus club where the various
chapters can pay you to come speak to them?  Isn't it kind of like
selling stock in a company that is supposed to be selling perpetual
motion machines?  These guys are supposed to form the clubs to descuss
intelligent design theory, but no such scientific theory exists.

Ron, you know the answer, but for the lurkers' benefit:

After Edwards v. Aguillard and &quot;cdesign proponentsists&quot; they took the
greater risk - leaving &quot;some&quot; designer in. Although I would imagine
that even then a &quot;large minority&quot; of them must have objected, and
argued for leaving any mention of any designer out of any public
school lesson (but promoting it elsewhere of course). This is just my
speculation, but the ones that argued to leave the designer in, and
won out at least until Ohio, probably figured that any court case
would establish the connection between the designer-free arguments and
the &quot;evidence of design&quot;, IOW all the same authors. So either option
was risky in some way.

Even if the Dover board had caught up to the new scam, it's almost
certain that they would have been caught, and the designer-free scam
would have been ruled unconstitutional.

You have finally given us your reason for drifting away from science and
into that strange and mysterious whatever domain of yours:  Science is
boring.

Some of us do not find it boring:

&quot;I have never imputed to Nature a purpose or a goal, or
anything that could be understood as anthropomorphic.
What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that
we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must
fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility.
This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing
to do with mysticism.&quot;

1954 or 1955 Dukas and Hoffman

I don't know if this has been mentioned in t.o. before, but H. Allen Orr
has a nice review of Kitcher's book in the 16 August edition of the _New
York Review of Books_. I attach the teaser, but unfortunately, it's only
available online to subscribers to NYR's electronic version (and I,
alas, only get the print version, which is still enough to prove I'm a
comsymp freak). It can be purchased, apparently, all 4009 words of it,
for three bucks, but I think one might just kick in the extra seventeen
and buy Kitcher's book.

It was a nice review of what appears to be a succinct and powerful book.

----- begin include -----

A Religion for Darwinians?
By H. Allen Orr
Living with Darwin: Evolution, Design, and the Future of Faith
by Philip Kitcher
Oxford University Press, 192 pp., $20.00

Darwinism seems to occupy a special place at the intersection of
science, philosophy, and religion. One result is that evolution gets
featured in controversies as different as those over theism versus
materialism and nature versus nurture, to mention just two. In America,
any discussion of evolution typically turns to the subject of
creationism, the idea that an intelligent agent played a part in
designing life. (According to this definition, creationism includes, but
is not restricted to, the biblical account of life's origins.) Though
some of us doubt that creationism provides an ideal vehicle for serious
discussion of science and religion, the topic won't go away. In his
latest book, Living with Darwin, Philip Kitcher considers creationist
claims and uses them as a springboard for discussing subtler issues...

I'd like to reiterate a point I tried to make a couple of weeks ago
about the nature of scams in general. You have two bunches of people:
the VERY MUCH LARGER bunch of people who get scammed, and still don't
know it, or are unwilling to face it. I think these people, in large
part, represent what Nando refers to as, &quot;a bunch of people who honestly
and sincerely seek to bring belief in well... intelligent design into
science.&quot; The problem there, of course, is that they may honestly and
sincerely want that, but they're ignorant. Just as people who honestly
and sincerely want astrology brought into astronomy, or who want the
history of Atlantis to be brought into geography, are ignorant.

There's nothing wrong with being ignorant: nobody can know everything.
But it's important -- and sometimes difficult! -- to recognize when one
is talking bullshit. Unfortunately, a lot of people who hear about ID
and buy it simply don't know any better.

What's worse, though, is the much smaller group of people who really do
know better and continue to spout the bullshit anyway. I'm willing to
believe that a couple of them are just confused, but I'm certain there
are at least a few who know darn well that they're lying and just don't
care, and in fact, think it's A Good Thing to lie, because they're lying
for A Good Cause. For such cretins I have nothing but scorn, spittle,

As before, that darwinists / atheists are right, depends on it being
right that the future and freedom are no more than concepts in the
brain, that decisions only occur in brains, that love and such is an
electrochemical process in the brain.

There is no doubt in my mind that Darwinists / atheists are wrong, and
that deep in their heart they also know they are wrong when they say
such things as that love is an electrochemical process etc. The liars
are all on your side very clearly to me.

&quot;evolutionists&quot; keep talking about &quot;the creationists&quot; as if the
scammed and scammers are all of the same mind. Granted, there's no
&quot;hard line&quot; that separates them. That's why I either talk about &quot;anti-
evolution activists&quot; or &quot;rank &amp; file creationists.&quot;

If I do slip in haste - I tend to say &quot;IDers&quot; a lot - let it be known
here that, unless I say &quot;rank &amp; file&quot; or &quot;on the street&quot; I mean the
activists, either the professionals or the obsessed amateurs.

Bottom line when arguing against any feel-good pseudoscience: they can
afford to be sloppy with terminology. We can't.

That statement is fascinating. I would bet that by 9th grade (when
most activists want to &quot;teach the controversy&quot;), mosy students have
all the major misconceptions in place. Especially today, when they
have access to the web, and have surely come across misleading
sensationalist headlines. Thus the only reason that anti-evolution
activists demand the phony &quot;critical analysis&quot; is to reinforce those
misconceptions, and drive at least the most vulnerable students closer
to their childhood myths, or at least to some new-agey &quot;jury's still
out&quot; nonsense.

One of those misconceptions that the activists have been exploiting
for their own gain is that, just because we object to their plans to
change the curriculum, we are defending the status quo. That is of
couse wrong, and even if it weren't, simply doesn't follow.

&gt; some of us doubt that creationism provides an ideal vehicle for serious

That part sadly gets lost in all the interest in getting religious
ideas out of science class. But students *will* learn about ID and
classic creationism from various sources, *and not* the rebuttals from
mainstream science (or mainstream religion). First, the rebuttals are
rather technical - which alone make it virtually impossible for them
to compete with anti-evolution feel-good sound bites. Second, they are
hard to find, and the anti-evolution activists and the sensationalist
media will do everything in their power to keep it that way.

Science class is not the proper place, but if they don't learn the
whole story from us, they will learn the *censored* version from the
activists.

Hey, here's an idea, what if you're wrong and the creationists are
right? What then? What responsibility, what punishment? Oh yeah I
forget, you all take no responsibility whatsoever for anything, no
matter you are right or wrong. You all actually abide by a principle
which makes irresponsibility a virtue. When push comes to shove you're
all slave automatons to a delusional scientific method, and take no
responsibility for anything.

So you see, you can easily tell what the good side is and what the bad
side is. The Darwinist side no responsibility so.... that's the bad
side, it's as simple as that.

Which creationists would be right? They can't all be because the
creationist positions are mutually contradictory.

Yeah, I guess we non-Muslims all share that sin.

You don't want to say that too loudly to the Christian creationists
around here, though.

No. We're just &quot;slaves&quot; to the only method that works. Invoking
supernatural &quot;explanations&quot; *and* using that as an excuse to not test
one's ideas, and even retreat from saying what they are. Now *that's*

So are those Christian creationists &quot;Darwinists&quot; per your definition?
They certainly seem not to take any responsibility to develop a theory
of their own that could justify their pathetic pot shots.

Evolution is true regardless of this. Why do you combine the theory

Gee, intelligent design theory depends a lot on what consciousness and
such is. The fact is that evolutionists oppose intelligent design
theory, and for that opposition they use their darwinist / atheist
notions of consciousness. So you know, the false ideas about
consciousness, such as that love is an electro-chemical process, are
inherent to Darwinism / atheism, as it is.

Why, the theory of natural selection was conceived in opposition to
the theory of creation. Furthermore natural selection was contrasted
with artificial selection, which was conscious. So you see, natural
selection theory was conceived on some suppositions what consciousness
is, and then contrasted away from those suppositions. But the
suppositions were entirely false. They were just humanism, atheism,
darwinism, scientism, ideology, and not in line with Christianity or
Islam.

It does not. Even slightly. Give ONE reference where ID theory
(regular ID, not your version) links consciousness to design. You
can't. Because THEY can't. They haven't.

You reckon I'm lying? Dembski has not once been able to show that his
notions of specified complexity can be linked to intelligence in any
way. In fact, as defined, his notion of intelligence actually covers
natural selection! (Part of the definition is an ability to choose
between choices, without any proof that this must be an intelligent
choice.)

Funnily enough, the last person who brought this up on Uncommon
Descent, Dembski's ID blog, was BANNED simply for asking about this.
And you say ID isn't a scam?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; theory

No. That implies that ID actually exists. We oppose a bunch of frauds
claiming to have a scientific theory, trying to force it into schools,
trying to push out a legitimate field of inquiry for clearly religious
and political reasons, and not actually having what they claim to have
at all. It is deeply dishonest and wrong.

Deceptive comparison of evolution theory and atheism noted again.

If you have evidence that supernatural forces have guided evolution,
kindly post them. Frank J is currently asking for evidence of design
events. His threads go unanswered. Still think ID isn't a scam?
