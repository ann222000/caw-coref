Hello All!
Again, line everyone's favorites up, what's left on the card get's spent!
Sooooo, after having had to put the sporty into storage since about 2004
due to some health problems, I've decided it's time to try and breath some
life back into it! Besides the obvious engine maintenance, replacing some
bad plug wires, etc., I've got a lot of cosmetic stuff that needs to be dealt
with. The bike is a 91 Sporty, was in above average condition at the time
it was stored, although not completely indoors, but with good cover from
most of the elements except down at the ground level where I now find
a lot of surface rust on the rims, forward's, and anything else that's been
chromed.
So far, I've tried a few spots with &quot;TurtleWax Chrome Polish and
Rust Remover&quot;. It seems to be working ok, however I seem to remember a
lot of folks here swearing by (or at?) products such as Mother's Chrome
Polish. The only Mothers Chrome product I could find here (I'm up on
Vancouver Island in the land of the Canuuk), didn't mention anything about
rust removal. There's tons of &quot;rust conversion&quot; products around, but I'm
pretty much guessing that's NOT what I want.
So, any wise, reasoned, and practical experience with any other
products that would possibly work better than the TurtleWax product?
I've tried so far by hand, but with the large amount of area that needs to
be done, as well as some limitation as to my dexterity (I've had two simple
strokes in both my left and right hand/arms), I'm going to need to rely on
some electron-enhanced motion controlled application devices, i.e. I have
a 8 inch orbital polisher, and then one of those &quot;applicator balls&quot;, basically
an enclosed wand that fits to a drill and has a wad of strips that will whirl
around in tight places (I hope none of this talk is getting anyone &quot;excited&quot;
in a &quot;wrong or inappropriate&quot; way)..
So, with the gazzilions of working man years of cycle knowledge
that resides here, I'm hoping for a brief opening into all this insight that
someone has really got this down and can maybe steer me in the right
direction before I manage to scuff all the shiny stuff off the last thing
(besides my kids) that I value most.. And God hoping, I may get to ride
her again, very very soon!! Oh, as I am wearing my welcome out, one
last one: As these polish's leave behind a protective coating, what's going
to be the outcome when it comes time to do my pipes? I've got a pair of
Cycle Shack slip on's and there is just a bit of rust on them, would like to
get them off, but don't want to possibly bake on something worse!!
Sorry again for the long rant, another round on anything consumable!!
And if anything good comes of this, the same bit of luck with my finances
that is allowing to get the bike up and running again is also going towards
powering up the lasers, so there may yet be some goodies for the EKIII
fund yet this year!!

Thanks again, and again..
Regards.

Hey Doug, you might not like this, but just ride th' sucker.  Once th'
rust starts, yer pretty much doomed anyway.  I'd just clean it with
Nevr-dull and replace th' rusted stuff later.  Who cares what it looks
like, if someone doesn't, tell 'em to kiss *my* ass &lt;g&gt;.

Glad to hear that some good luck is headed in yer direction!  Now go
take a well deserved ride.  We're havin' a leetle bar-b-que this

Well, I figure if I let it get much worse, the wheel's will need to get
rebalanced... I dunno, I guess I turned into too much of a metalhead to be
able to just let the stuff rot. If I can't be a fanatic about the chrome on my
bike, I ain't going to do much of a job on anyone else's chrome when I get the
laser back up and going..

Thanks! Yeah, been working on that. Just lining up all the stuff I need for
my passport (not that I need that for riding), but I gotta make sure that I'm
still welcome in the US.. When I moved back up here, I had a lot of
splainin' to do re all my work over in the ME, and a possible employer
here has an immigration attrny. looking into for me. I might be down there
ALOT in the future, got a good job offer as part of a chopper (Jetranger)
LIDAR flight crew, nothing like whizzing over power lines at 90+mph 80
ft off the ground, and get paid for it!! Now if I can only find some way to
sling the bike under for the rides home!
Thanks for the advice, and have a few more refills!!

You're welcome! That kinda sounds like a good plan for the forwards and
exhaust, but the stuff on the rims is thick, thankfully it's only at one small
quadrant that was exposed to our salt air here. That's going to take bit of
something heavier to get that off, but ya never know, will try everything
at least once!!
Thanks again, have another!

I've got rust under my saddlebags. I'm going to try this out as soon as
it gets too cold to ride. Sucks that I'm thinking about how it's going

When I cared, and tried to derust stuff, I used to do wads of aluminum foil
with Simichrome polish.  I think the real deal is the aluminum foil, it
prolly don't matter all that much what your rubbing on there so go ahead and
take whatever polish you have and give it a test run with the aluminum foil.
It looks messy at first as the rust smears but a few rag-wipes later it'll
look real sharp.  The important things I learned from my adventures are 1)
the rust usually looks a lot worse than it is, a little pinhole in the
chrome ends up with a huge looking spot above it, and 2)  the Simichrome I
used had a wax or something that would slow down rust regrowth.  Whatever
you end up doing, make sure there's a layer of wax when your done.

I used the Simichrome on the exhaust, it didn't do anything nasty when I
fired the machine up.  I'm sure there are others here that will be more
helpful than I, but hey, you asked.

G'luck,
Don

Nice to see ya here again Doug.

I use the same thing on light surface rust that I use to remove crud from
pipes, mufflers, etc... Brillo or SOS pads. The soap lubricates and cleans
while the 0000 steel wool does the hard work. It sometimes leaves a light
film so a light cleanign with Nevr Dull or almost any other chrome or
aluminum polish will brighten things up. You'll have to keep after any areas
that sustained lasting damage or the rust will start right back up pronto.

After you've got everything all cleaned up nice, get some of that
extend stuff (the stuff that goes over rust as a kind of rust
inhibitor/primer).   Brush on a light coat over the area where the
rust was, let it dry and then lightly rub off the excess with a rag
and a bit of rubbing compound or chrome cleaner.  Apply a good wax
over this.

The extend will seal all the little pinholes with rust inhibitor and
do a good job of keeping future rust at bay.

I (as Snarl fairly well stated) live on Vancouver Island, about a 1/4 of the
way up from Victoria. I'm about 6 miles south of the city of Duncan, and
on something like Google Earth, I'm very close to Cowichen Bay which
is a fairly cool fishing village. The horror flic &quot;The Fog&quot; was filmed there
last year, and something about mermaid's with Kim Basinger. Tourists and
the film biz the industry around here. Lot's of great riding though, miles
and miles of twisties and mountains, and if you got a rat bike, thousands
of miles of abandoned lumber roads/camps that are free and somewhat
mapped out. And for most of last week, Ophra buzzing everyone in her
Eurocoptor.. Could never get my laser out in time..
Where's about's are you!?

Thanks TL! Yeah, I stocked up on the 0000 wool last night, plus some billet
polish as that stuff is in rough shape as well. I def. will be putting
something for a protective coating once I get this cleaned up. One more thing
I'm looking for advice for (and before I forget, lot's and lots of refills for
everyone that's put up with me so far..). I'm wondering what would be the
best thing to maybe bring the engine back to life with. It's been sitting with
a tank of gas with StaBil in it, and I misted the cyl heads, but I gotta think
the oil has turned into something really bad, not sure if I should drain it
first even though cold, then do the first oil change? Or is there a better
procedure? I've looked around the sportster.org stuff, not much there.
And thanks again! Now that my kids are grown, I may actually get out
and do some slightly more serious riding, and try and hit a few &quot;events&quot;..

Regards,
D.

Pretty damn close, mid-island, Vancouver Island. You know, you folks can
always wander up here too! I'd figure out somewhere to get you fed and
entertained. And it looks like I will be doing the trip down your way a bit
more often as my daughter thinks that she is going to do her grad school
in either Seattle or in Portalnd, maybe...

Not me, not anymore.  After th' last clusterfuck StT and I went

a couple hours) I'm *not* going through that ever again.

Cool beans!  What's her major?

Oh yeah, about yer bike query, I'd just dump th' old oil (cold) n'
gas, change th' filter and do another oil/filter change at 500 miles.
Then regular change intervals after that.

Not the first, nor the last. And we get referred to as &quot;Vancouver&quot;
all the time. LIfe's not easy being an island...

Tell me about it, about the same reason that I'm not in a big hurry to
head back to the US. Doesn't help when your passport has Syrian
and Lebanese stamps in it.. Time for a new one of those, but that
don't mean they don't keep track. I knew that anything named
&quot;Homeland&quot; was gonna be a BIG problem when they came up with
that one..

Chem and Bio Engineering, although she's thinking of going into Marine
Biology. It seems to be continually changing, but after the bridge
collapse a few blocks from her apt., etc. she's thinking it might be
nice to get closer to dad and her brother out her on the good coast..

Thanks, just added that to my endless to-do list. Spent today playing
Mr. Wizard finding out what works on this rust up here. Also, strangest
stuff, alot of the billet cases have this white discoloration that looks
sadly like birdcrap at a distance. I &quot;think&quot; someone may have sprayed
some kinda clear coat on them, as some of this stuff has flaked off,
not sure what I'm going to do about that, maybe just good polish and take
it back down to bare alum..
Thanks again!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Have another!

&gt; &gt; Where do you live, DougD?

&gt; I (as Snarl fairly well stated) live on Vancouver Island, about a 1/4
&gt; of the way up from Victoria. I'm about 6 miles south of the city of
&gt; Duncan, and on something like Google Earth, I'm very close to
&gt; Cowichen Bay which is a fairly cool fishing village. The horror flic
&gt; &quot;The Fog&quot; was filmed there last year, and something about mermaid's
&gt; with Kim Basinger. Tourists and the film biz the industry around
&gt; here. Lot's of great riding though, miles and miles of twisties and
&gt; mountains, and if you got a rat bike, thousands of miles of abandoned
&gt; lumber roads/camps that are free and somewhat mapped out. And for
&gt; most of last week, Ophra buzzing everyone in her Eurocoptor.. Could
&gt; never get my laser out in time..          Where's about's are you!?

Thanks for the description. I'm in Calgary. I know a bit of Vancouver
Island just from going there over the years. I hiked the Juan de Fuca
trail about 5 years ago which took me around the west side of the
island. It's sure pretty over there. We've got a lot of mountain riding
around here too of course with the Rockies, but I'd love to live near
the ocean.

That frosty white stuff is more than likely oxidation. Salt air loves to
eat aluminum.  If you're fortunate you've caught it before it starts to
pit.  It'll polish off with a lot of elbow grease, but if you don't wax
it it'll start to oxidize again immediately.

That's one of the reasons why I gave up on chrome and polished aluminum
and started to powdercoat everything.  I live about a half mile from the
ocean and I've seen the salt air literally eat pits into polished cast
aluminum shit in a matter of days.

That's a good point. I bought my first motorcycle (Kawasaki VN750) from
a guy who had it on Salt Spring Island. It was showroom condition but
had 56K KM on it. I'm guessing he must have wiped it down and kept it
covered or something to keep it that nice.

Either that or it was mostly plastic. I think that might be the case
actually.

Well, if it was on Saltspring, the guy probably had a custom room for
just the cycle to sit in. There are some awfully &quot;extravagent&quot; homes there.
I had an aunt and uncle over there and they brought two mercedes with
them when them moved from Ont., and I think they both (the cars, not
my relatives) rusted to nothing sitting unused in the garage. They drove
an old Volvo as back then it was considered &quot;bad form&quot; to show off there.
Now there's homes there that can only be reached by chopper, and we're
getting buzzed daily by these folks.. Must be nice.. Last week we were
under attack by Ophra and her fleet of Eurocopters. This was a nice
place before it was &quot;discovered&quot;..
