Flight Attendant Arrested for Weapon

Uniformed Flight Attendant Arrested at D.C. Airport After Taking Gun on
Flight, Officials Say

By LUBNA TAKRURI

WASHINGTON Mar 31, 2007 (AP)— A uniformed flight attendant was arrested at
Dulles International Airport after she turned herself in for allegedly
carrying a concealed handgun aboard a flight from Atlanta, authorities said
Saturday.

The Transportation Security Administration, the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies were investigating if the woman had gone through
security and if the gun passed through a checkpoint unnoticed in Atlanta,
TSA spokesman Barry Phelps said.

Janet Tucker, 45, of Lithonia, Ga., turned herself in Friday for carrying
the weapon on United flight 7591, said Rob Yingling, a spokesman for the
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. She was in uniform but was not
part of the duty crew at the time, he said.

"It seems it was an inadvertent incident, from her description," he said.

Tucker was arrested and cited on charges of having a concealed weapon at
the airport. She was interviewed and released on a summons to appear in
Loudoun County Court in Virginia at a future date, Yingling said. It was
not clear whether a court date had been scheduled and he didn't know
whether Tucker had a lawyer.

United Airlines spokesman Jeff Kovick said a United employee had been
arrested but would not confirm any other information.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport spokesman Herschel
Grangent had no further comment. A telephone message seeking comment from
FBI officials in Atlanta was not immediately returned.

Oh, I see.  It's OK to commit a felony if you don't get caught!  Use
the rule that Washington Politicians use: "if you don't get caught
then there is no crime"!

Nope, I think it's pretty sensible.  Any person, United employee or
not, who tries to have the means of self-defense at hand is obviously
a criminal at best and perhaps even a terrorist.  "Bearing arms"
clearly only applies to the army and government employees not to
airline personnel even if they have a uniform.

Methinks a quick flight to Egypt or Jordan is in order where a little
taste of the rack will loosen her tongue! At least after she confesses
and is convicted she'll never have to worry about this sort of thing
again since then even TOUCHING a gun will be a new felony.

I don't think that is what is being claimed.  I suspect, but

No one has claimed she didn't have the right to bear arms.

If she is convicted of the felony (I expect she'll plead out
to a lessor offence -- most probably a misdemeanor since it was
unintentional and no one would have know if she hadn't told on
herself), then she won't be able to posses a fire arm.  Simply
touching one isn't enough.  She would have to be in active control of
the gun.

They were caught by surprise.  Guns don't help in that case, whereas if the
element of surprise is lost (or switches to the opposite side), a gun isn't
really necessary.  A bit like martial arts.

I didn't know that crew members weren't required to remove shoes at
security. I guess I wasn't paying attention. I found this out on
Saturday when a pilot's boots set off the metal detector and he had to
remove them. The pilot with him had walked through with his shoes on.
I guess I am confused by the point of having a crewmember go through the
inspection process, but not being inspected the same way.

If they are holding the razor blades to a hostage's throat, a gun won't help
much.  If they've already killed the pilots, a gun can only kill the only
other people with any flying ability.  There are many scenarios.  Guns are not
the solution to every problem.

I daresay, however, that El Al-style profiling and interrogation (particularly
the latter) would have stopped these terrorists at the gate.  While El Al
methods are labor-intensive in many cases and thus impractical for larger
airlines (El Al has only a handful of planes and flights), the quick and
"deep" interrogations could be used by any airline.

The most notorious incidents of hijacking did not require guns.

The whole strategy of "security" in the U.S. is skewed.  Looking for _objects_
is not the way to find terrorists.  You have to look at _people_, not the
things they are carrying.  Profiling and careful interrogation work a lot
better than x-ray machines and metal detectors.

&gt;  &quot;Bearing arms&quot;
&gt; clearly only applies to the army and government employees not to

">

Courts have ruled that the right to bear arms applies to the individual, not
to any particular group or "militia", etc.  As an individual, this
particular person has the right to bear arms.  She happens to be a flight
attendant, but that does not in any way affect her personal right to bear
arms.  That is, except that -deliberately- carrying firearms on airplanes is
a huge no-no.  So if she chooses to bear arms, she'd better leave those arms
at home during working hours.

&gt; I agree ... although those are fightin' words in rec.aviation.*.

&gt; &gt; No, but they'd have been a big help with this one.

&gt; We'll never know that for sure.

Perhaps not but I'm reasonably confident of it. The plane that went down
in Shanksville had a GS-1811 federal agent on board (I think he was EPA
or DOI, I can't remember) but he was unarmed because he was on a
personal trip, not official business. Had he been flying armed, he could
easily have shot the two terrorists outside cockpit when the passengers
decided to retake the plane, then blown the lock off the cockpit door.
The gun would have made the process of retaking the plane significantly
easier and quicker and would have stood a good chance of getting them
into the cockpit in time to keep the final terrorists from driving the
plane into the ground.

&gt; Not in an airliner. Small single engine AC, yes.

Nevertheless, it would be worth a try and even if the aircraft was lost
in the attempt, at least it would be the only thing lost-- not a
skyscraper also.

&gt; &gt; Actually, they do.

Yes, they do. I've seen them going through security with my own eyes.

&gt; &gt; The whole strategy of &quot;security&quot; in the U.S. is skewed.  Looking for
&gt; &gt; _objects_
&gt; &gt; is not the way to find terrorists.  You have to look at _people_, not the
&gt; &gt; things they are carrying.  Profiling and careful interrogation work a lot
&gt; &gt; better than x-ray machines and metal detectors.

&gt; You have to do both.  There's no way to do a background check on every
&gt; single person who books a flight.  Therefore, an unbiased XRay is ONE
&gt; way to possibly find people who are up to no good.

&gt; But the first step in ALL of this is to close the border to illegals
&gt; and kick out anybody who isn't legally allowed to stay in the US.
&gt; There's no way to have ANY level of security without first doing this.

Absolutely. I have no idea how Bush can justify with a straight face
spending billions and sacrificing lives fighting this war on terror
overseas and yet he won't even close the front door. Anyone can just
walk right in.

To turn around and shoot the terrorist as he forces his way through the
