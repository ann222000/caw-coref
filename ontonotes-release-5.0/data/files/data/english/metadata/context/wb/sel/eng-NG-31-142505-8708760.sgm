Does anybody, any place in the entire United States of America
have an irrevokable, unquestionable right to be on somebody
else's private property?

Or, is the inverse true?  Does the owner and deed holder have
an irrevokabale, unquestionable right to pick and choose who
he invites onto his property and who he doesn't?

This is a test question so think before you answer.

&quot;Invites&quot; is the wrong word.  You always have the write
to choose whom to invite.  &quot;Hosts&quot; would have the irony
you're looking for here.

True right is made. When you put some bullet holes
through the white-washed staircase, you gain the
right to intrude.

Common, yes.  But legal at all according to the US Constitution?

Yes.

The Constitution is intentionally sparse.

It's not meant to be a progenitor for all laws, thought it
has primacy over all laws.

It franked most of pre-existing law, while making only a few
laws &quot;unconstitutional&quot; by its sudden fiat.

What it did is create a federal government that was
previously handled in Blighty.

Many states have written laws that predate the Constitution.

And just about every state will have case law that reaches
back to English common law as the basis for some decisions.

As far as I know there are things like easement, warrant, mineral rights,
posted hunting land and armed intrusion which offer various levels of legal
right.

Are the rights of a guest in your home revoked if you say fuck off and
extending a warm invitation? Does a guest actually have any rights even if
invited onto a non-public property?

... rights that exist:

1 to remain silent *

* if you give up this right anything you say or do can be used against
you in the court of law.

2 you have the right to an attorney *

* if you can not afford an attorney one will be appointed to you by the
courts

* you have the right to shut the fuckup.

* do you understand these rights or do i have to beat them into you?

There is no &quot;right of ownership&quot;.  If you own something
you have a right to protect it in certain ways.

All land ownership is limited.  Metaphysically by your
ability to prevent trespass and the term of your life,
but legally by the fact that all land in the US originally
belonged to the government and was deeded with covenants
and falls under the principle of eminent domain.

You own the things you own, but you only own a portion of
the rights to your land.

Does that answer your question, or does it just prove
what I predicted about the depth of your knowledge?
