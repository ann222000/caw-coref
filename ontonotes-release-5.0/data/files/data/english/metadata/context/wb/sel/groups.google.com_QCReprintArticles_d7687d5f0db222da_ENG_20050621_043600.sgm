Caretaking Is a Win-Win Situation
Copyright Â© 2005 Ian White
Caretaker Jobs
http://www.caretaker-jobs.com

Many individuals are making a radical change in their lives
and becoming full time caretakers of property, estates, farms,
ranches, or even nature preserves. Caretaking has been around for
thousands of years, and is not an unknown profession. However,
the modern age has brought us the option of quick travel through
air transportation, and the ability of communication via the
Internet and newspapers. These two outlets have brought
caretaking to the foreground as an opportunity for anyone.

There are many reasons why the services of a caretaker are
needed, the first being for individuals who purchase a second
home, or even a third, due to their employment. Parents are
bringing their children with them when they travel, and are no
longer leaving them behind with a nanny, or relative. This has
prompted many to purchase a second residence. These individuals
are not interested in renting out their second home. They want
the freedom to return at any moment.

Other individuals are purchasing a second home in a favorite
vacation spot. These people are not interested in simply
investing in real estate. This vacation home is purchased as a
way to open the door up to their own family and friends who may
want to drop in at any given time.

It is a known fact that people are living longer than ever
before. The individual that may own a working farm, ranch, or
an inn may decide it is time to bring in someone younger to help
them manage their property. Their grown children may have their
own careers, or they may not want to play such a hands on role
in the operation of the family business.

All of these groups are finding that employing a caretaker comes
to the rescue of their diverse needs. It is a known fact that
insurance on second homes is higher than the premiums on a first.
This rise in cost is due to the fact that insurance companies
know that second residences are vacant most of the time. The
chances of a burglary, flood or fire are greater in these homes.
Depending on insurance carriers, employing a caretaker can lower
insurance costs slightly.

Those that employ caretakers are also finding that it saves them
money in the long run. Having someone on hand to keep up with
routine maintenance, spot potential problems and to perform any
needed repairs as they arise, is much cheaper than contracting
outside labor to perform a major job. Their homes and property
are also protected against potential burglaries, vagrants, or
board youths who may want to loiter. Caretakers can be hired
short term, or long term.

Individuals or families who offer up their services as caretakers
are looking for a change of pace. They are usually city dwellers
who are desiring a change of atmosphere and lifestyle for
themselves, and their family. Some may not have the opportunity
on their own to relocate to a remote or rural area. Some would
never have the chance to work with animals, or on a nature
preserve. The caretaking profession opens the door for them.

Caretakers tend to be retirees. Retirees gravitate toward
caretaking out of a need to feel useful, a desire for a
second career, and an opportunity to get lost in a different
environment. Their past life experiences can benefit them
greatly when entering into the caretaking industry. Anyone that
is proficient in working the land, gardening, grounds keeping,
maintenance and animal care can almost be guaranteed a position
of caretaker. Anyone that has experience in delegation,
management, and customer service may find that caretaking
at a hostel or inn is an option for them, as well.

Retirees are finding they are at a prime time in their lives to
follow their dreams and move to a location that would be
considered an impossibility in years past. For those who always
dreamed of working their own land, working with animals, or
living at an exotic beach spot, this life style change is
available to them through caretaking.

Young families are also finding the door open to them as
caretakers, as well. Many large property owners, ranch and
nature reserves are employing parents of young children to help
maintain their site. Dads and Moms choose to make this move in
an attempt to show their children different parts of the world,
different life styles, or to get them out of the city and close
to nature.

The most important thing to understand about caretaking is that
it is considered a leisure job. It is not like the hustle and
bustle of the business world, and you do not have to fear living
under the scrutiny of a domineering boss. Most owners are not
even on site, while those that are know the importance of
privacy, and a relaxed calm atmosphere. Caretakers can move at
their own pace, and enjoy all the benefits of their location.
With this relaxed atmosphere, it is important that caretakers
are very self-reliant, self starters and have an ability to work
independently.

The main benefit provided to caretakers is free rent. This will
give the retirees a chance to save their money, or spend it on
their children's tuition, or family expenses. Free rent also
benefits the young family who is saving for a place of their own.
Depending on the job, sometimes a small stipend or salary is
offered, as well as insurance. Moving expenses are usually paid
by the caretaker, however moving expenses may occasionally be
provided by the owner.

The duties of a caretaker will be as diverse as their location.
However, the number one priority of all caretakers is honesty
and a love for their environment. For those working on a horse
farm, working ranch or nature reserve, a love of animals is a
requirement. Caretakers working at a hostel or inn must have
a love for people and customer service. Depending on the
caretakers desires and areas of expertise, an owner can usually
be found to match like a hand in a glove.

It is important to also remember that those who may not consider
themselves experienced in certain areas can still obtain the
position of a caretaker. Most property owners are willing to
train someone they have a connection with, who they feel is
trustworthy, and who has potential. Owners would much rather hire
someone they feel is honest, over someone who has a page of
working references who they think may be a crook.

Becoming a caretaker is a wonderful way for retirees to spend
their golden years. The leisurely, relaxed pace, natural
landscape and free lodgings all work together to bring an
experience to their lives unlike any other they have experienced
before. Caretaking also suits the individual who may be thinking
of starting their own ranch, inn, or fishery. It gives them the
opportunity to learn as they save their money. Families benefit
from caretaking by the rural atmosphere and the ability to
promote love of the land and animals to their children. The money
that is saved on housing can go toward a future home of their
own, or their children's education.

Caretaking is a win-win situation for both the owner and the
caretaker. Reports show that there is an increased need for
caretakers around the world. A connection can be made that is
suitable for both the owner and the caretaker. Owners and
caretakers can be found using the Internet and by searching
newspapers.
