Well, I went.  And I met Sadie.  She is just as pretty in person as I
thought her picture. Though bigger (I don't think she is a size small
anymore, more a medium). Beautiful eye color. And yes, feisty.  Which
reminds me I need to dress my worse wound soon :(  Turns out she had a
litter when she got there last year.  She is a little older than her
profile, they think more like two years. I believe she is suitable for my
lifestyle in one way.  She does slap any cat that gets near her so I can't
see her exactly pining for kitty companionship and she spent a good time
sitting in the sunbeam in front of window (I got windows with wide sills).
Don't see her pining for people companionship either, I am sure she
wouldn't wither and die when I go to work. She is her own cat. Don't know
if I want to deal with the feistiness.  Though she is only feisty if you go
to her and like bother her.  She definitely isn't the kind to attack you in
your sleep or anything.  But I don't think she would at all tolerate a nail
clipping, for instance.  I wouldn't be able to handle her alone at all I
think and that is worrisome.  The lady said she can do more than she did to
me so I think I may have to pass on her :(

I did meet shy Ava and am leaning toward her, don't know why really.  She is
definitely a size &quot;small&quot; and does have the odd head/ear posture as in her
picture.  Perhaps she is a little neurological.  Very shy but will come up
to you eventually.  Take a step and she will poof but will be back after
awhile. I petted her the most, spent the most time with her and of all the
nips I got there hers were the shallowest :) I even got her purring at one
point and it is a loud purr. Such a shy one, I think she is the most likely
to spend at least a week under the bed or such.  She could probably be
restrained by one person for nail clipping, pilling, and might allow
brushing.  Quite possible she would come up in bed if cold.  While Sadie
swiped any cat that got close, Ava gets swiped by any cat that sees her.  I
don't think Ava would miss that kind of kitty companionship any and may
even get a little more secure if she doesn't have to constantly worry who
is going to have a shot at her. She is said to be faithful to her
scratching post (but the lady wasn't sure which it was and there are
several types there).

Then there was a surprise for candidate, a white lap cat.  Definitely lap
fungus (and shoulder and face).  Figure she would be also be the type that
sleeps on your head.  She is the largest of my cat candidates. Am touched
by her friendliness and she was the only one that didn't bite or scratch me
at all! Wow.  I am not sure her hearing is good.  But I think that is
common with the white cats.  I had a little squeeze of her paw to see if
she was declawed (not), she pulled back but I think when drowzy claw
clipping is possible.

Another surprise, and then the one that gave me my first and most of bites
and scratches (though not deepest, that would be Sadie's work).  Charlotte.
Can't believe she had five kittens and nursed two orphans.  She is so
small.  A kind of medium hair b/w tux.  Extremely friendly and her biting &amp;
scratching is the kittenish type but a lot of it. Paws you with claws out.
Kind of touched by her friendliness and sooo pretty IMHO too though the
biting/scratching thing might get old after awhile. She liked to bite the
scratching platform thingy, I think she is just orally fixated :)

So my candidates. This shelter anyway. Please feel free to share thoughts!
But what I need advice on - the wound.  It is a smallish blood blister and
while I am sure it was Sadie's work, not sure if from fang or claw.  I lean
toward claw.  Having had gotten bad infection (pasturella) from a cat bite
that one other time I tried to adopt a kitty, am trying to figure if it is
from fang or claw.  I don't think any kind of bite could make a blood
blister.  Experience with such?  I can't believe I had Shadow for almost
eight years and never suffered anything worse than gouges in my thighs from
her jumping off my lap.  I guess the rest of the feline world consists of
fang and claw.

Ping Tak: as I thought, the shelter is nothing of the modern posh sort of
yours.  I have never been down that little gravel road by river in the
decade or two in the area.  It was just as I figured it would be :)  But it
was clean and didn't smell.  Which is more than you can say probably for
most homes around here lol.

Sue, you don't know me but this is gramby.  Lee has always said, and after
three cats, I agree that cats adopt you, you don't adopt them.  Did you feel
that any of these choices said something like &quot;take me to myonetruehome lady
and make it quick?&quot;

Honestly, I don't think any really did.  But...

If I met the white one (I would rather call her &quot;White One&quot; than Ghoulina,
eek what a horrible name) as a stray, I think she's a type that would walk
in and adopt me.  I would keep her.

If I met Ava as a stray, I would spend a week trying to get her to come to
me and let me touch her. When/if she did I would keep her.

How do you decide?

In a perfect world, with a bigger place and more money I would take them
both since I can't make up my mind.  Although even lovebug white one had a
swipe at poor little Ava.  They say Ava gets along well with the other
cats, well, that just means Ava doesn't hit them back and hasn't gone total
hidey but they all like to take a swipe at her. I think Ava would be better
off an only kitty.  The White One seems able to hold her own (though wants
a person!) but perhaps would want a person around more than me.

I can't pick :( so maybe should keep looking?  Plenty of kitties out there,
I just don't know...

So go back next week and look again... personally I wouldn't take any
cat that bit/scratched the first time you met it - all three of ours
were real little lovebugs when we adopted them and even though they
can get rough they have NEVER drawn blood on us or on each other
(accidental clawings don't count...) When you meet the right kitty
they'll say 'I love you, I love you, I love you, please take me home
with you and get me out of this horrible place NOW!!!!!!'

Either they will say all of those nice things or &quot;Look stoopid hooman this
place sucks.  I want some real food, a nice place to sleep and you look like
an easy target.  Easy to train and easy to love.  Keep a good thought.

People often concentrate on cats that are pretty and cats that are loving --
both understandable.  However, how about considering this:  Which of these
cats seem to be cats that *most need* your care and attention?  That would
probably not be your only criterion, but it is one that is often (usually)

For years I had the attitude about kitties (or dogs or any
companion animal for that matter) with so many animals out there, being put
to death for a lack of home, why should we tolerate bad temperment?  But
judging from the attitude over the years of shelter folk and the number of
shelter kitties I have met with this &quot;habit', this biting thing is
considered, well, normal?  Also, they are stressed, they are scared,
whatever.  But when Ava, shy as she is and me wanting her to like me, bit
me, I gave her a little thump on the nose and said &quot;no bite&quot; and well, she
didn't bite again. And she didn't run either and this is a scaredycat!
Maybe it is like some people are with their children nowadays. Too
permissive? No discipline?  I have accepted that my Shadow who never bit is
the exception rather than the rule :(

I handled a lot of cats the last few times I was at the shelter, and
I've never been bitten there.  I was pretty cautious getting to know
each cat though.  But each of my current ones like to get an
occasional taste of me. :)  Dot will groom and nip your hand.  I get
Buster to bite me by holding him upside-down and vigorously massaging
his chest and tummy.  His mouth opens so wide like a shark's, and it
looks so funny having a kitty face attached to your arm. :)  It
doesn't hurt, but I give them the obligatory &quot;Ouch!&quot; of course.

That shelter was actually more like a shack back when I got Betty. :)
They had a renovation a couple of years back, but in terms of taking
care of and homing cats, it was just as good back then.

I'm so glad that you're now looking.  Whether it's Ava or Ghoulina,
I'm sure it'll be a wonderful loving companion.

I believe both my top two candidates qualify in that regard and it is making
it hard to decide.

Ghoulina is not quite pleasing to the eye.  Her pic on the web is actually
quite flattering and I think her in person appearance is why they gave her
such an ugly name.  Her lovableness I believe offsets all but I think it a
handicap that might keep her from getting adopted.  She also gives
the &quot;aura&quot; of being older and possibly hard of hearing.  That doesn't help
her chances.

Poor little Ava's scaredycatness is definitely a hindrance to adoptability.
She is very pretty colored though I think a lot of people would find it
common.  She also does have the odd head/ear thing going on making her seem
perhaps &quot;damaged&quot; and not sure if she is in some way neurologically
impaired. I am not sure everybody would hurry to take her home either.  She
is very small which people would mistake for kitten.  But she is much too
reserved and shy.

I am trying to be logical in that which kitty is best suited for the kind of
lifestyle I have.  If I were to follow my heart (well, I would need a
helluva bank account) I would take all that needed a home! Real heart I
would grab one of those kittens!  Now, they SCREAM &quot;take me home!&quot; :)

Being really logical, I think my kind of home would be most beneficial to
Ava. She could blossom in a quiet household like mine. But it is hard to
ignore how lovable the white one is. That was nice. It might be nice to
have a warm something on my lap when I watch DVDs!  I am not sure Ava would
ever be the type to do laps.  Neither was my Shadow for the most part.  We
survived without being in each other's faces :)  I don't know *sigh*

&gt; total
&gt; hidey but they all like to take a swipe at her. I think Ava would be
&gt; better
&gt; off an only kitty.  The White One seems able to hold her own (though wants
&gt; a person!) but perhaps would want a person around more than me.

&gt; I can't pick :( so maybe should keep looking?  Plenty of kitties out
&gt; there,
&gt; I just don't know...

That's just it.  There are many cats out there.  No reason to take one you
are not in love with.  Because you will find one you are in love with.  Or
one that is so in love with you that it doesn't matter.

(And take anything the shelters tell you about them with a grain of salt.)

We probably looked a over a hundred cats before we found Molly.  Perfectly
good cats, most of them.  But she was ours or we were hers.

I always have to remind myself that bringing a new dog or cat into our home
is a huge investment.  And I'm not just talking about money.  We try to take
the time to do it right.

Our next cat, if there is one will be an orange tabby girl.  If Bast gives
us any say in the matter.

&gt; Being really logical, I think my kind of home would be most beneficial to
&gt; Ava. She could blossom in a quiet household like mine. But it is hard to

&gt; have a warm something on my lap when I watch DVDs!  I am not sure Ava would
&gt; ever be the type to do laps.  Neither was my Shadow for the most part.  We
&gt; survived without being in each other's faces :)  I don't know *sigh*

But once you get a cat home with you, and they settle in and relax, their
personality is mostly likely going to change somewhat. Could turn out that
Ava would become a lap cat once she realizes there are no other cats around
to swat at her all the time. It seemed like she enjoyed your presence,
even in the less-than-optimal environment of the shelter.

I think it's great to be logical about it and choose a cat that you
think will fit in best with how you live and what your home is like. But
don't forget to listen to who *you* are drawn to, as well.

Yeah, but feeling like Mr Spock trying to make this all logical and whatnot.
I didn't feel a real &quot;tug&quot; to any cat there except for Ava.  And invested
so much time in sitting still, hand hanging down getting nipped like crazy

well, the White One surprisingly charmed me.  I try not to think I am

&gt; Well, I went.  And I met Sadie.  She is just as pretty in person as I
&gt; thought her picture. Though bigger (I don't think she is a size small
&gt; anymore, more a medium). Beautiful eye color. And yes, feisty.  Which
&gt; reminds me I need to dress my worse wound soon :(  Turns out she had a
&gt; litter when she got there last year.  She is a little older than her
&gt; profile, they think more like two years. I believe she is suitable for my
&gt; lifestyle in one way.  She does slap any cat that gets near her so I can't
&gt; see her exactly pining for kitty companionship and she spent a good time
&gt; sitting in the sunbeam in front of window (I got windows with wide sills).
&gt; Don't see her pining for people companionship either, I am sure she
&gt; wouldn't wither and die when I go to work. She is her own cat. Don't know
&gt; if I want to deal with the feistiness.  Though she is only feisty if you
&gt; go
&gt; to her and like bother her.  She definitely isn't the kind to attack you
&gt; in
&gt; your sleep or anything.  But I don't think she would at all tolerate a
&gt; nail
&gt; clipping, for instance.  I wouldn't be able to handle her alone at all I
&gt; think and that is worrisome.  The lady said she can do more than she did
&gt; to
&gt; me so I think I may have to pass on her :(

&gt; I did meet shy Ava and am leaning toward her, don't know why really.  She
&gt; is
&gt; definitely a size &quot;small&quot; and does have the odd head/ear posture as in her
&gt; picture.  Perhaps she is a little neurological.  Very shy but will come up
&gt; to you eventually.  Take a step and she will poof but will be back after
&gt; awhile. I petted her the most, spent the most time with her and of all the
&gt; nips I got there hers were the shallowest :) I even got her purring at one
&gt; point and it is a loud purr. Such a shy one, I think she is the most
&gt; likely
&gt; to spend at least a week under the bed or such.  She could probably be
&gt; restrained by one person for nail clipping, pilling, and might allow
&gt; brushing.  Quite possible she would come up in bed if cold.  While Sadie
&gt; swiped any cat that got close, Ava gets swiped by any cat that sees her.
&gt; I
&gt; don't think Ava would miss that kind of kitty companionship any and may
&gt; even get a little more secure if she doesn't have to constantly worry who
&gt; is going to have a shot at her. She is said to be faithful to her
&gt; scratching post (but the lady wasn't sure which it was and there are
&gt; several types there).

&gt; Then there was a surprise for candidate, a white lap cat.  Definitely lap
&gt; fungus (and shoulder and face).  Figure she would be also be the type that
&gt; sleeps on your head.  She is the largest of my cat candidates. Am touched
&gt; by her friendliness and she was the only one that didn't bite or scratch
&gt; me
&gt; at all! Wow.  I am not sure her hearing is good.  But I think that is
&gt; common with the white cats.  I had a little squeeze of her paw to see if
&gt; she was declawed (not), she pulled back but I think when drowzy claw
&gt; clipping is possible.

&gt; Another surprise, and then the one that gave me my first and most of bites
&gt; and scratches (though not deepest, that would be Sadie's work).
&gt; Charlotte.
&gt; Can't believe she had five kittens and nursed two orphans.  She is so
&gt; small.  A kind of medium hair b/w tux.  Extremely friendly and her biting
&gt; &amp;
&gt; scratching is the kittenish type but a lot of it. Paws you with claws out.
&gt; Kind of touched by her friendliness and sooo pretty IMHO too though the
&gt; biting/scratching thing might get old after awhile. She liked to bite the
&gt; scratching platform thingy, I think she is just orally fixated :)

&gt; So my candidates. This shelter anyway. Please feel free to share thoughts!
&gt; But what I need advice on - the wound.  It is a smallish blood blister and
&gt; while I am sure it was Sadie's work, not sure if from fang or claw.  I
&gt; lean
&gt; toward claw.  Having had gotten bad infection (pasturella) from a cat bite
&gt; that one other time I tried to adopt a kitty, am trying to figure if it is
&gt; from fang or claw.  I don't think any kind of bite could make a blood
&gt; blister.  Experience with such?  I can't believe I had Shadow for almost
&gt; eight years and never suffered anything worse than gouges in my thighs
&gt; from
&gt; her jumping off my lap.  I guess the rest of the feline world consists of
&gt; fang and claw.

&gt; Ping Tak: as I thought, the shelter is nothing of the modern posh sort of
&gt; yours.  I have never been down that little gravel road by river in the
&gt; decade or two in the area.  It was just as I figured it would be :)  But
&gt; it
&gt; was clean and didn't smell.  Which is more than you can say probably for
&gt; most homes around here lol.

&gt; People often concentrate on cats that are pretty and cats that are loving --

&gt; probably not be your only criterion, but it is one that is often (usually)

Sue, you have to do what feels best for you, but I always am grateful
for the people who adopt cats that others pass by. Some of the shy cats
have a hard time finding homes because other cats are so friendly, even

You are very lucky! Our most personable and loving cat is a biter. It

Charlie and I did it in one very long day. Three large shelters and at least
half a dozen PetCo or Petsmart adoption centers.  Probably drove 200 miles.

What I liked was the cats were pretty much separated from each other most of
the time (necessary to keep disease from spreading in the large shelters)
and while you can go through the rooms and look at them all, they bring the
ones you are interest in to you in a small family visiting room so you can
interact with them individually.

I've never had a cat bite unless I started it or the cat was ill.  Not one
of mine anyway.  I'd be cautious of a grown cat that bit or put its claws
out around strangers.  But being in a room with a lot of other cats puts
them at a real disadvantage.

I had my mind made up pretty much what I wanted, and a lot of the cats we
saw didn't fit the list.  I needed a young adult girl cat with big ears and
a long tail.  Hopefully one that needed me back.  So it took a while to fine
who we were looking for.

We went to the Petsmart where we got her three times that day.  The rescue
group that was bringing cats in was delayed.  In fact we waited over a hour
on the third visit pretty late in the day for them to get there.  Someone
was watching over her and over us.

The only time I ever was bitten was many years ago.  My cat launched
herself at the storm door toward my friend's Boston Terrier.  I tried
to scruff her so I could close the wooden door and she turned around
and bit me on the hand.  All the fight went out of her immediately and
she acted very apologetic afterwards.  The bite didn't amount to
anything.

Caliban was a biter when I got him, but I've mostly taught him not to
bite. He snatches at my hand sometimes, but he doesn't bite down like he
did when he was younger.

I just taught him by going limp and squealing every time he bit down,
and then when he let go, I would turn my back and ignore him for a
while. Then we'd continue playing.

Licky does this cute thing sometimes when I'm petting him, where he'll
do this sort of play-bite. He doesn't hurt me at all, it's more like
he's going through the motions of biting me. Actually, it's not that
clear to me whether he's playing or expressing annoyance/anxiety, because
soon after he does it, he backs off from me looking very nervous. If
he is doing it out of some sudden anxiety, he is certainly the most
gentle little cat about it! And the only reason it doesn't occur to
me that he's having a real problem and isn't just playing, is because
prior to that, he'd been meowing for my attention and then purring his
butt off when I started petting him. He's so mercurial!

When I adopted Sir William (RB) I had gone to his foster home to play
with a pretty 8 week old tabby girl kitten that I had alread booked.
IIRC, he had already been returned back to the rescue group twice for
biting different adopters. I literally saw him for about 2 minutes,
and that was it, he had to come home with me. I can't even describe it
as we looked at each other - It was like a meeting of minds. He was a
big, battered, scruffy ginger and white middle aged street cat, rather
than a delicate, gentile, happy-go-lucky tabby kitten....

He bit me once, and then turned into the most wonderful, amazing,
loving lap fungus. I only had him for 6 months before he went to RB on
1 October 2000, but I still miss him every day.

You'll know when Bast has picked your new owner. All of mine, I've
kept for different reasons, I've fostered the best part of 70-80 cats
now, but the ones that live here were picked by Bast to stay.

Sounds flaky, but it's fact. :)

I do watch for signs that a cat has &quot;had enough,&quot; and I don't push it.  Even
petting can overstimulate a cat, and then it's time to stop.  I also never
dangle my hands in such a way that a cat is encouraged to attack the hand --
instead, I hold a toy *in* my hand for that kind of play.  But, mostly, I
opt for gentle petting, tossing toys, laser pointer, toys on the end of a
pole, etc. (no &quot;roughhousing&quot; when in personal contact, which may lead to
scratching and biting).

&gt; Licky does this cute thing sometimes when I'm petting him, where he'll
&gt; do this sort of play-bite. He doesn't hurt me at all, it's more like
&gt; he's going through the motions of biting me.

Yes, all of my cats have done that -- &quot;mouthing&quot; or play-bite.  I always
relax and gently remove my hand, but I also look for signs of
overstimulation (which is a sign to &quot;stop playing&quot;) when that happens.

After reading some of the responses here about searching for a cat, I
realize once again how fortunate I have been because I have *never* gone
through that process in my entire life.  I have also been fortunate that my
cats have had long lives, so I only have four  &quot;selection&quot; experiences to
relate over a span of 45 years.  My first cat was feral.  I wanted a cat and
simply accepted the first cat that my neighbor and I were able to trap.  I
was young and foolish (meaning, I knew absolutely nothing about feral cats).
If I had known then what I know now, I would have known that it is *not* a
good idea to take on a feral cat as your very first indoor cat.  I was also
lucky because Raucher became an absolutely wonderful companion.  It took at
least two years before I would say that we were &quot;bonded,&quot; but he eventually
was completely trusting and would let me do anything that was needed
(including medication and nail trimming) -- something that I later learned
was pretty unusual for former ferals.  However, I would have missed out on
one of the best experiences of my life if I had been &quot;wiser&quot; and had known
not to adopt a feral under those circumstances.  During the first couple of
years, there were occasions when he would &quot;attack&quot; my ankles.  Just the
quick movement of walking by would be enough to cause that.  He never broke
any skin -- thus, my earlier response -- but it was enough that I knew he
was becoming agitated.  I would put him in the bedroom for about 15 minutes,
and that was all that was needed.  He was approximately 8 months old when we
trapped him, and he lived to be almost 20 years old.  I still don't have a
picture of him in my albums, but this reminds me that I should scan some of
his pictures and post them online.  He was regal and magnificent -- full of
mats and debris when I first trapped him, but gorgeous when I eventually saw
what he &quot;really&quot; looked like after good food and care.

Amber, my second cat (her picture is in the Rainbow Bridge album), had been
declawed before I adopted her.  She was &quot;owned&quot; by people who claimed to
love her -- and probably did, in their view of love -- but they permitted
their toddler to pull her around by the tail and did nothing to intervene.
They were lucky that Amber never bit him!  Instead, she would go into hiding
as far under furniture as she could get, and they didn't understand why she
stayed away from the family so much.  They were expecting a second child,
lived in a mobile home, and didn't have &quot;room&quot; for Amber any more.  So, they
were looking for someone to adopt Amber and were going to put her outdoors
if they could not find someone -- outdoors, despite the fact that she was
declawed!  I had been without a cat for two or three months after Raucher's
death, and this happened at just the time when I had decided that I &quot;needed&quot;
to get another cat.  I was warned when I went to visit that Amber was very
shy and it would take some time for her to come out and see me.  Instead,
she jumped into my lap as soon as I sat down!  I thought at that time that
they were just trying to entice me to adopt by claiming that this was such
an unusual event, but I couldn't bear the thought of her being put outdoors.
So, I took her home with me that very day and soon learned that they had
actually been telling the truth!  She was my little angel, dear and sweet
and loving, but it was quite some time before she wanted to be around other
people.  Blood work at age 13 showed early signs of liver/renal failure,.
CRF showed its ugly head, and I went on a campaign of trying to give her the
best care possible.  She lived for another 3 years (while the original
estimate that been for &quot;no more than 3 months&quot;), and it was devastating when
I lost her.  I eventually had to make the heart-rending decision of
euthanasia for both Raucher and Amber, but I know it was the right decision
for them.

Then came Holly and Duffy, and I have already told their stories many times
on this group.  Holly was about 6 months old when I adopted her 12 years
ago.  Duffy was estimated to be 3-5 years when I adopted him in 2003.  Each
of them had personalities that are distinctly different from my previous two
cats, and each is irreplaceable.  In fact, one thing I did avoid was any
attempt to find a cat that &quot;looked like&quot; my previous cats.  Cats cannot be
replaced; we can only go forward and adopt a new cat with his or her own
personality.  I think people sometimes make the mistake of trying to find a
cat that looks like a beloved cat they have lost, and then they are
disappointed when it isn't at all the same type of animal.

My &quot;point&quot; with this very long message is that I simply &quot;accepted&quot; each of
my cats rather than looking for specific characteristics.  Actually, that
wasn't quite true of Holly because my two previous cats had had medium-long
fur and were so wonderful that I planned to get another cat with long or
medium-long fur.  Well, Holly was available on the day I went looking, she
did not have long fur, and the rest of the story is that the length of fur
doesn't matter at all!  You certainly would not want to adopt a cat if you
are afraid of the cat or nervous around it, but I am not at all sure that we
should &quot;shop&quot; for a cat in the same way that we shop for an article of
clothing.  Their personalities will change as they adapt to live with you,
in much the same way that children's personalities develop over time.

Yes, I hear about the &quot;overstimulation&quot; biting kind of thing from pros like
shelter people.  But it is really amazing the number of cats I run into
with a thing for that.  Friends, they tell me don't go near that one, that
one bites, etc.  And when I was a kid, other friends seemed to all have
beautiful cats that petting was a hazardous affair. It seems to be accepted
you pet a cat, then they bite you to tell you they have had enough.  We all
know &quot;belly trap&quot; and Shadow was guilty of that, but hung on with all four
clawed paws and then RAN like Hell. No bite.  Claws were her weapon of
choice and if ever there was a candidate for declawing it was her since she
could do damage without trying.  Just jumping down from your lap (or a
chair) she had those rears out and inflicted a lot of damage (my legs and
chair) but I could never declaw a cat.  Just.  Can't.

And there is play biting of kittens or in the case of gentle moosh Shadow,
her Daddy taught her the ridiculous game of &quot;attack kitty&quot;.  I guess it is
a guy-thing.  He would put his hand in front of her face and say &quot;play
attack kitty&quot; and she did.  She only mouthed him but he knew it was time to
clip her claws when blood loss was greater than usual :)  I never played
that with her, except once when we were living alone and I wondered if
she &quot;missed&quot; that game.  I tried.  She laid her ears back, gave a launch at
the end but then jumped away.  So she knew Mommy wasn't for that game :)

I have never been so scared about bites of any animal until that one
declawed cat. Dogs have nipped and so have horses, well one horse more than
a nip, good chomp. Gotta admit, kittens are starting to look better all the
time.  But am trying to face and rationalize my fear.  I don't know what
was worse, the bite itself (wicked deep practically to bone) or the
infection and it's treatment afterward.  It was an awful experience.

&gt; scratching and biting).

It's good to be careful when dealing with an unfamiliar cat, but I do
roughhouse Mir, because she loves it so much. She does get stimulated -
that's how I know she loves it - and she does grab my hand, but she
keeps her claws in. She even makes as if to bite my hand, but she never
touches fang to skin. She is so incredibly gentle. But sometimes she
just begs for me to manhandle her - she jumps up on my chair and hunks
down with her ears back as if preparing herself for the impact. If I
don't attack her when she does that, she looks very disappointed.

From your description, I would say that you are following Mir's lead and
doing what she enjoys.  When I refer to overstimulating, I am thinking of
people who get bitten or scratched -- and then they blame the cat for being
aggressive and/or &quot;mean,&quot; when the fault really lies with the person who
fails to watch for signs that the cat does *not* like it.

Well, the ones I call mean are the sudden ones with no cat language warning.
These cats give no warning.  No tail twitching.  Or ears laying back.  Or
what I think a well-mannered cat would do, simply move away.  I would not
pursue a cat who has moved away from me.

In the case of the declawed cat years ago, no warning whatsoever.  He was in
his basket and I went to stroke him to say goodbye while I filled out the
papers.  15 minutes earlier he had been a total love bug.  On my lap,
purring, butting, the whole nine yards.  He wasn't dozing, he wasn't
cornered, I hadn't startled him.  He just bit.  Hard and did not want to
let go.  He was quite vicious with other cats which is why he was isolated
and was a good fit for my home.  He had been marked as good with children.
I don't think so.  I had been visiting other cats in between and they
thought perhaps it was the smell of his enemies he was reacting to.  I
don't think so.  The lady's reaction was odd, she kissed him on the head
and asked him if he was alright after he bit me.  He was fine.  I wasn't.

Sadie was pretty sudden too.  She had let me get a pet in here and there in
her wanderings inside and outside the shelter.  She was laying on a garbage
bag and I went to give her a good bye stroke. I think I did make contact.
Then she did :(  she didn't get anything in real deep but it was sudden.  I
don't think she is vicious at all.  She is a dominant, that's obvious by
her behavior with other cats.  Her highness is to be admired by the
peasants from a distance :)

The only time Persia ever scratched me (and boy did she ever!) was when I
was half asleep and idly rubbing her tummy.  It was dark so I couldn't see
the signs that she'd had enough.  She wrapped her front paws around my arm
and bunny-kicked the hell out of me.  But it was my fault.  I couldn't see
her &quot;warning signs&quot; in my drowsy state in the dark.  I don't do that anymore

What you described as a reaction from a declawed cat is one of the
unfortunate consequences of having cats declawed.  One of their primary
lines of defenses has been removed, and some of them will then revert to
inappropriate behavior such as urinating outside the litter box or biting.
This is not true of all declawed cats, of course -- my little Amber
(declawed before I adopted her) was a little angel, and she compensated
pretty well for her lack of claws, although she never had the same grace or
agility as all of my clawed cats have had.  However, there is a
significantly higher proportion of declawed cats that do become biters or
develop medical problems such as early onset of arthritis.

He had horrendous ear infections when I got him that we couldn't
completely cure although we stayed on top of with antibiotics and the
vets cleaning out his ears once a week. Then in Sept 2000 he managed
to break his ankle, we don't know how and he had major orthopedic
surgery on the leg - he had an external fixator fitted. Two weeks into
recovery, he started having fits and had what seemed like a stroke
because he went blind and became paralysed down his left side. The vet
thought that either the ear infections had flared up again causing
menigitis, or that he'd had a stroke. There was absolutely nothing the
vet could do so I had to make the very heartbreaking decision to send
him to the bridge, but it broke my heart, quite literally. His
original foster mum who hoodwinked me into taking him (Debbie Wilson
who also posts on RPCA) was there when he went to the bridge too and
I'm glad that she also had the chance to say goodbye as he was a very
special cat.

I desperately didn't want Sir William to go to RB, but Bast had other
plans. 5 days later Pandora arrived as a &quot;short term foster&quot;. She
never left and in the last 7 years has travelled all over the world
with me and her best friend HRFL Tiger. :)

Yes, Ava might warm up when she has a quiet little home of her own.  She was
probably feral, her mother and her got picked up as &quot;strays&quot; and her mother
was quite shy too they say.  Mama did get adopted and they tell me she
eventually warmed up.  Ava is sweet, but has a kind of sad bored look about
the face.  I think shy plain kitties get overlooked.  That she was
comfortable enough to nibble and butt my hand in such a short time is a
good sign.

The White One was apparently dumped off a pickup truck in a box either
outside the shelter or Petsmart or something like that.  She was definitely
a housecat at some point and is not shy.  Very friendly. But they think
(think? err, think?) she is spayed. Either she had litter box issues, tore
up the place or maybe they just wanted to throw her away when she lost her
kittenish ways.  Sadly, too many people like that.

Wish I could take them both :)  Am going to go seem them in a little while
and will bring a donation of something.

That is the primary reason I like to get a cat as a kitten.  You get the
chance to teach them things like that.  Usually it is momma cats job and
their siblings job, but not every kitten gets properly raised.

&gt; I do watch for signs that a cat has &quot;had enough,&quot; and I don't push it.  Even
&gt; petting can overstimulate a cat, and then it's time to stop.

Mary, yes, I know the signs and the &quot;don't push it&quot; stuff. That does
work for most cats, but Bear is just a play-biter. He will sometimes
even walk up to my bare feet and take a nip to announce his presence! He
nailed the vets in the shelter several times before we took him home,
that's why he had a note in his chart to be careful around him. I think
it's just how he communicates. He also licks the other cats on the head
then suddenly bites their ears.

I just read that you've had 4 cats over your life. Time to double or
triple up - ha! We seem to get them in clumps of about 4 at a time, and
then another stray shows up... I probably shouldn't publish how many
cats we've had in the last 20 years, even with all of them living to a
good age, except our diabetic, pancreatitus cat who just lived to about
age 12.

I've loved having this many though, even though there's no room for me
on the electric blanket.

&gt; People often concentrate on cats that are pretty and cats that are loving

&gt; both understandable.  However, how about considering this:  Which of these
&gt; cats seem to be cats that *most need* your care and attention?  That would
&gt; probably not be your only criterion, but it is one that is often (usually)
&gt; neglected and yet could provide you with the most loving of companions.
">

When I got my first two I chose ones that were not that friendly.

Kitty was a stray that was the unfriendliest cat I ever seen and
pregnant with kittens.  One day she went in garage and stayed.  She
had her kittens couple days later and I have kept her since.  She has
never tryed to get out since then which has been 11 years ago.  She is
a loving cat AS LONG AS I DO NOT TRY TO HOLD HER MORE THEN A COUPLE
MINUTES.  One time I tryed to do her nails and she peed on me and bite
me.  I ended up in hospital for two days with infection.  But she
loves to set by me and be petted and she is the only one that sleeps
with me.  When the younger 4 and 5 year olds bug her (She is like 15
years) she runs to me and set between my feet until I walk her back to
the bedroom which she claimed as hers.  Right now she is setting at my
feet as I am at the 'puter and the other 3 younger ones are encircling
her trying to get at her to bug her I guess because she likes to be
left alone and keep to herself being older.

My second one Margie I got when she was about 3 months at Humane
Society as company for Kitty.  I liked her because she was a calico
and shy.  When I picked her up she clawed me something crazy trying to
get away.  I told the lady right then that I wanted her (The cat!!).
Now she meows at me whenever I go bye and ignore her or if she can
reach me she will swat at me to get my attention.  At night she will
set on night stand and hit me with her paw until I wake up and she get
on the pillow and we &quot;Snuzzle&quot; a bit.  She does this 2 / 3 times a
night.  First time she ever did this I almost had a heart attack
because I thought someone was in the house!!

The second two (Sam and Rascal) were strays that needed help and once
I got them fixed and their problems fixed I was to attached to get rid
of them.  Sam had a bad hernia on his stomach and Rascal was really
sick.

None of them are really lap cats but none of them will let me out of
their sight either except at night when I go to bed then they set in
the bedroom until I am in bed and the light goes out then they all go
find their favorite places to sleep.  Next morning as soon as they
here me they are all in the bedroom again waiting for me to get up and
feed them.

Sorry this is so long.  Did not intend it to be.  Got carried away
here.

IIRC, that's only BLUE-EYED white cats - and mostly the

&gt; It's good to be careful when dealing with an unfamiliar cat, but I do
&gt; roughhouse Mir, because she loves it so much. She does get stimulated -
&gt; that's how I know she loves it - and she does grab my hand, but she
&gt; keeps her claws in. She even makes as if to bite my hand, but she never
&gt; touches fang to skin. She is so incredibly gentle. But sometimes she
&gt; just begs for me to manhandle her - she jumps up on my chair and hunks
&gt; down with her ears back as if preparing herself for the impact. If I
&gt; don't attack her when she does that, she looks very disappointed.

LOL! That's really cute. Roxy and even Licky enjoy that, too. And if
they get enough of it, they just get up and trot off. No biting necessary.

However, I have certainly been clawed in the process of playing, enough
to draw blood. I'm sure in those cases that it's not a warning to stop
playing. They just get excited and start swiping. Roxy is far more guilty
of this than Licky. (Actually, if anyone's guilty, it's me, for not
clipping her claws often enough!)

&gt; He had horrendous ear infections when I got him that we couldn't

&gt; recovery, he started having fits and had what seemed like a stroke

Maybe he had a blood clot from the surgery? That could have caused a
stroke.

That's what's so amazing about Mir. No matter how excited she gets and
completely into the game, she just doesn't scratch. And I don't even
clip her claws. The only time she scratches me is when she uses me as
her stepladder. :P

That's what we think probably happened, because the symptoms were
exactly the same. It was traumatic &amp; devestating at the time, but I'm
glad that I made the decision to let him go to RB without loosing too
much of his dignity. The vet suggested an MRI scan to see what was
going on, and the money wasn't an object, but I wondered who I would
have been keeping him alive for - certainly not for him as his
prognosis for recovery and good quality of life was very poor. :
( Besides, Bast had other plans.... 5 days after Sir William went to
RB, I was asked to look after a very traumatised 5 month old feral
kitten who'd had a very rough deal....... She's still here 7 years
later, and still a snotty madam, and I thank Bast every day for
her...... sometimes. ;o)

I think some cats get over stimulated when they see a potential human to
take them, Chester was wonderful when I played with him, but when I left the
first time he reached through the bars and grabbed my skirt with claws out
and hung on for all his 11 pounds were worth, Lee

&gt; &gt; So go back next week and look again... personally I wouldn't take any

&gt; &gt; can get rough they have NEVER drawn blood on us or on each other
&gt; &gt; (accidental clawings don't count...) When you meet the right kitty
&gt; &gt; they'll say 'I love you, I love you, I love you, please take me home
&gt; &gt; with you and get me out of this horrible place NOW!!!!!!'

&gt; For years I had the attitude about kitties (or dogs or any
&gt; companion animal for that matter) with so many animals out there, being
put
&gt; to death for a lack of home, why should we tolerate bad temperment?  But
&gt; judging from the attitude over the years of shelter folk and the number of
&gt; shelter kitties I have met with this &quot;habit', this biting thing is
&gt; considered, well, normal?  Also, they are stressed, they are scared,
&gt; whatever.  But when Ava, shy as she is and me wanting her to like me, bit
&gt; me, I gave her a little thump on the nose and said &quot;no bite&quot; and well, she
&gt; didn't bite again. And she didn't run either and this is a scaredycat!
&gt; Maybe it is like some people are with their children nowadays. Too
&gt; permissive? No discipline?  I have accepted that my Shadow who never bit
is

you might wait a week and go revisit the candidates, then you might know, if

&gt; Honestly, I don't think any really did.  But...

&gt; If I met the white one (I would rather call her &quot;White One&quot; than Ghoulina,
&gt; eek what a horrible name) as a stray, I think she's a type that would walk

&gt; If I met Ava as a stray, I would spend a week trying to get her to come to
&gt; me and let me touch her. When/if she did I would keep her.

&gt; How do you decide?

&gt; In a perfect world, with a bigger place and more money I would take them
&gt; both since I can't make up my mind.  Although even lovebug white one had a
&gt; swipe at poor little Ava.  They say Ava gets along well with the other
&gt; cats, well, that just means Ava doesn't hit them back and hasn't gone
total
&gt; hidey but they all like to take a swipe at her. I think Ava would be
better
&gt; off an only kitty.  The White One seems able to hold her own (though wants
&gt; a person!) but perhaps would want a person around more than me.

&gt; I can't pick :( so maybe should keep looking?  Plenty of kitties out
