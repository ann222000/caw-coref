Examine this aerial view

You can see that the so called pyramid is covered in dirt. Could it be
it is not a pyramid? Could it be a burial mound?
Or is it covered in silt because it was at one time UNDER Titicaca?

Instead of just digging into the top to find the buried treasure and
ruining the thing, do you not think that it might have been better to
remove the dirt and expose it? Is it a building?
You see you are just a wrecking crew. And Harvard University, has been
digging in that mound for 10 years.

Let this be a lesson to all countries.
You do not want foreign archaeologists entering your ruins.
You want them kept out completely. No photographs.
Allow the general public in under supervision, and allow your own
archaeologists to examine and excavate.
But keep out the foreign archaeologists because they will turn the
world against your heritage even with their photographs, and their
lies, and if they can get in, they will do damage wherever possible.
Their track record is right there for all to see.

Let tourists in, of course, and let them see your work in progress.
Make it an open public affair, and they will always think the best of
your heritage. They will tell their friends and they will put their
photographs on their websites and they will not accept false lies
about their antiquity. They will take things at face value.

When they see a city, covered in silt, by a lake, and they see
monoliths, encrusted in limestone, from being in that lake, they know
it is very old.
And they will say that, because that is the truth.
And they will post their pictures for others to see.
But when you let archaeologists from other countries in, they always
say your people were stupid. Too stupid to be able to do anything like
this. It is all a mistake. Those are natural formations, your people
were uneducated natives who only built temples and only built temples
to sacrifice people their idols and their primitive gods.
That is what they say about Tiahuanacu.
A city older than Stone Henge, that had running water.
A port city bustling with commerce. Built with stones weighing in
excess of 600 tons that they themselves could not move.
Huge stones fitted with such precision, that you could not fit a razor
blade between them.

Architecture that equals any of the modern age.

The name given to the site by Harvard University?
After 400 years of desecration of this site by Harvard University,
blowing apart the megalithic stones with gun powder even as recounted
by one Conquistador scribe, and then in 1833, again trying to walk
away with statues tucked into their trouser pockets?
There, are limestone, encrustations, on the remaining megalithic
blocks, it was under, the lake, at one time.
It is clear evidence, of a flood of Biblical proportions.

And the cover-up, of the miniature steps, by Harvard University, will
go down in history, as one of the most diabolical treatments of any of
our cherished world heritage sites.
Its all right here, see for yourself. The oldest city in the world.
And BTW thats not a pyramid, so stop trying to make it look like a
pyramid, but doing more of your fancy rock work. It is simply a burial
mound, made in the dirt, which someone piled up there after they tried
to excavate the city, back in the time of the Incas. They piled the
dirt there, and people started burying their kin in it. That city was
under the water, for thousands of years. But you will see that when
more ruins are found under Lake Titicaca. There are probably ruins
under the ground all the way to the current lake shore.
But this site is destroyed. Oh well, I have found an even better
example of this great civilization and I will show you in a following
thread entitled, The Great Deluge, and the pre flood giants of Peru.
History is written by the winners.
And by the looks of it, the good guys won.

&gt; &gt; &gt; this. It is all a mistake. Those are natural formations, your people
&gt; &gt; &gt; were uneducated natives who only built temples and only built temples
&gt; &gt; &gt; to sacrifice people their idols and their primitive gods.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is what they say about Tiahuanacu.

&gt; &gt; Tiwanaku.

&gt; &gt; You post as though you were a champion of the local folks; but
&gt; &gt; you can't seem to give them the simple respect of using their
&gt; &gt; names for things. As archaeologists have been doing for quite
&gt; &gt; some time.

&gt; The name given to the site by Harvard University?
&gt; After 400 years of desecration of this site by Harvard University,
&gt; blowing apart the megalithic stones with gun powder even as recounted
&gt; by one Conquistador scribe, and then in 1833, again trying to walk
&gt; away with statues tucked into their trouser pockets?
&gt; There, are limestone, encrustations, on the remaining megalithic
&gt; blocks, it was under, the lake, at one time.
&gt; It is clear evidence, of a flood of Biblical proportions.

&gt; And the cover-up, of the miniature steps, by Harvard University, will
&gt; go down in history, as one of the most diabolical treatments of any of
&gt; our cherished world heritage sites.
&gt; Its all right here, see for yourself. The oldest city in the world.
&gt; And BTW thats not a pyramid, so stop trying to make it look like a
&gt; pyramid, but doing more of your fancy rock work. It is simply a burial
&gt; mound, made in the dirt, which someone piled up there after they tried
&gt; to excavate the city, back in the time of the Incas. They piled the
&gt; dirt there, and people started burying their kin in it. That city was
&gt; under the water, for thousands of years. But you will see that when
&gt; more ruins are found under Lake Titicaca. There are probably ruins
&gt; under the ground all the way to the current lake shore.
&gt; But this site is destroyed. Oh well, I have found an even better
&gt; example of this great civilization and I will show you in a following
&gt; thread entitled, The Great Deluge, and the pre flood giants of Peru.

So Harvard began this desecration 30 years before it was founded
(1636)? Wow. An unparalleled record of infamy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://s2.supload.com/free/Tiahaunaco-9-30-2007.jpg/view/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Examine the protrusion in that wall in this photo... http://s2.supload.com/free/Tiahaunaco-9-30-2007.jpg/view/

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know what this? Well how can you people claim to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; archaeologists when you don't know what a very common thing is, that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is found all over Peru?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a water channel. http://www.panoramio.com/photo/3706357http://www.panoramio.com/photo/ ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And you have it sticking out of a wall like an ornament. You have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed these ruins completely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Examine this aerial view http://s2.supload.com/free/TiticacaPyramid-9-30-2007.jpg/view/

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can see that the so called pyramid is covered in dirt. Could it be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not a pyramid? Could it be a burial mound?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is it covered in silt because it was at one time UNDER Titicaca?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of just digging into the top to find the buried treasure and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ruining the thing, do you not think that it might have been better to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remove the dirt and expose it? Is it a building?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You see you are just a wrecking crew. And Harvard University, has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digging in that mound for 10 years.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here, have a look at this tourist page from a trip someone made in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2001.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Look halfway down the page. Even he knows what a water pipe is.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Harvard has them sticking out the walls. http://www.timshome.com/travel/bolivia/

&gt; &gt; &gt; Let this be a lesson to all countries.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You do not want foreign archaeologists entering your ruins.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You want them kept out completely. No photographs.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Allow the general public in under supervision, and allow your own
&gt; &gt; &gt; archaeologists to examine and excavate.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But keep out the foreign archaeologists because they will turn the
&gt; &gt; &gt; world against your heritage even with their photographs, and their
&gt; &gt; &gt; lies, and if they can get in, they will do damage wherever possible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Their track record is right there for all to see.

&gt; &gt; And when UNESCO comes knocking, DO NOT LET THEM INTO YOUR COUNTRY.
&gt; &gt; They are just their henchmen. And they will say, you must protect this
&gt; &gt; site! And they will insist that archaeologists from places like
&gt; &gt; Harvard come onto the site and investigate its importance.
&gt; &gt; And then they will diminish its antiquity and make it worthless by
&gt; &gt; trying to get your artifacts into foreign museums, and then they will
&gt; &gt; bad mouth your ruins in the press as being of no consequence. http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id;_site=567

&gt; Let tourists in, of course, and let them see your work in progress.
&gt; Make it an open public affair, and they will always think the best of
&gt; your heritage. They will tell their friends and they will put their
&gt; photographs on their websites and they will not accept false lies
&gt; about their antiquity. They will take things at face value.

&gt; When they see a city, covered in silt, by a lake, and they see
&gt; monoliths, encrusted in limestone, from being in that lake, they know
&gt; it is very old.
&gt; And they will say that, because that is the truth.
&gt; And they will post their pictures for others to see.
&gt; But when you let archaeologists from other countries in, they always
&gt; say your people were stupid. Too stupid to be able to do anything like
&gt; this. It is all a mistake. Those are natural formations, your people
&gt; were uneducated natives who only built temples and only built temples
&gt; to sacrifice people their idols and their primitive gods.
&gt; That is what they say about Tiahuanacu.
&gt; A city older than Stone Henge, that had running water.
&gt; A port city bustling with commerce. Built with stones weighing in
&gt; excess of 600 tons that they themselves could not move.
&gt; Huge stones fitted with such precision, that you could not fit a razor

Yes Rick,  you are correct, and this photo from Cusco illustrate
perfection of the same nature than the monolithic foundations of the
Occidental wall in Jerusalem which has nothing to do with the Jews
indeed ... Such monolithic foundations there and here are beyond the
reach of present technology with complete 3D imbrications of each
stone ... in clear without cement ! ... a exceptional feat only found
again in the European Cathedrals built all the them by the Knight
Templars, but in this case this with square dressed stones !
Still the real story is more amazing since Tiahuanacu.was a sea port
with mooring still visible allowing securing of high sea vessels etc

By the way silt as you mention is not generated by present conditions
but is a secondary deposition or secondary erosion if you prefer

You are correct with your comments relative to the Harvard 's Dudes,
those idiots are always ( as the other official Archaeologist) playing
down the correct time scale to make it fit to their ludicrous Time
Column derived from erroneous interpretation of Graptolites and
Trilobites fossil population. One thing you have to know is that NO
Archaeologist has a mind of his own; there are all riding on the band
wagon of that most lunatic perversion presenting itself as Geology at
the present time ... on that Band Wagon the Archaeologists are
whistling and dancing on the same tune that degenerate humanity of
Rock Surveyors masquerading the world over as Geologist indeed

Well just as the archaeological community attributes everything in
South America to the Incas, I blame all the destruction of the
archaeological treasures on Harvard. I think thats fair.

Harvard is laboring under the impression, that a people's
technological advance, devolves, from incredibly intricate precision
stonework, to piling up rock and inserting smaller bits between them
to chink the walls.

Rather than admit the obvious, which is that some other civilization
did that work, and the Incas merely moved into their territory and
built on their foundations.

Most people can tell the difference between ruins such as these...
http://www.culturalexpeditions.com/pikillacta.html

and ruins such as these

http://www.flickr.com/photos/carsten_tb/1016723842/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/cragg-ohlsson/63772577/
Clearly Harvard has no concept of building styles, architecture and
technical ability, because they attribute both styles to one group,
the group which has not shown itself capable of constructing using
these methods or even being able to move, most of the rocks.
They merely say they used pounding stones, hand held stones to do this
amazing rockwork, and they say it just took them a long time, but you
cannot get a a single rock, out of a cliff face, with a pounding
stone, let alone fit it with precision as is the norm for that style.

Thanks for the photos, they are beautiful.
Of course you are correct and those Harvard jokers  ( or any other
official archaeologist by the way ) are  completely clueless about
engineering, quarrying, mining etc from the practical point of view
indeed.
THEY ARE ALL TRADELESS WITHOUT EXCEPTION !
... and unable hence to realise the impossibility  to cut those stones
out of their original rock formations with the tools the Incas were
allegedly using, to dress them squares in all faces and as well fit
them with the precision observed.
Any tradesman in the world be it carpenter, fitter, surveyor, engineer
etc realises the master  work involved in those realisations ...
Archaeologists as well as Geologists are unable to even dress a stone
wall correctly and will never do so ...unable they are to realise too
that only the union of manual &amp; intellectual potential allows to find
&amp; achieve coherent results

Of course the Incas had nothing to do with such constructions which
they squatted, but respected and of which they had in their legends
the key to their origin ( Popol Vuh )

I can tell you that as a True Geologist I am in a position to
calculate the Energy required to lift the Andes and lower the
Tacamaca, and explain as well the cause &amp; chaining of all those events
conducting to the huge unconsolidated sedimentation deposit, the
instability of the region, the huge quakes &amp; chain of volcanoes
there ...

Harvard so called scientists are part of a cover up regarding the real
History of Man &amp; of that planet, and as you may not know it, they are
all affiliated to the those &quot; little aprons bearing cunts&quot; aka
Freemacs whose only work is symbolic ! Magical power of the Freemacs'
wand &amp; their initiation in accepted time column based on the
Biball
We are in fact right in the Dark Ages and those Clerics are part of
the Inquisition

&gt; &gt; &gt; So Harvard began this desecration 30 years before it was founded
&gt; &gt; &gt; (1636)? Wow. An unparalleled record of infamy.

&gt; &gt; Well just as the archaeological community attributes everything in
&gt; &gt; South America to the Incas, I blame all the destruction of the
&gt; &gt; archaeological treasures on Harvard. I think thats fair.

&gt; &gt; Harvard is laboring under the impression, that a people's
&gt; &gt; technological advance, devolves, from incredibly intricate precision
&gt; &gt; stonework, to piling up rock and inserting smaller bits between them
&gt; &gt; to chink the walls.

&gt; &gt; Rather than admit the obvious, which is that some other civilization
&gt; &gt; did that work, and the Incas merely moved into their territory and
&gt; &gt; built on their foundations.

&gt; &gt; Most people can tell the difference between ruins such as these... http://www.culturalexpeditions.com/pikillacta.html

&gt; &gt; and ruins such as these http://www.flickr.com/photos/62112731@N00/127236192/http://www.flickr ...
&gt; &gt; Clearly Harvard has no concept of building styles, architecture and
&gt; &gt; technical ability, because they attribute both styles to one group,
&gt; &gt; the group which has not shown itself capable of constructing using
&gt; &gt; these methods or even being able to move, most of the rocks.
&gt; &gt; They merely say they used pounding stones, hand held stones to do this
&gt; &gt; amazing rockwork, and they say it just took them a long time, but you
&gt; &gt; cannot get a a single rock, out of a cliff face, with a pounding
&gt; &gt; stone, let alone fit it with precision as is the norm for that style.- Masquer le texte des messages précédents -

&gt; out of their original rock formations with the tools the Incas were

&gt; them with the precision observed.
&gt; Any tradesman in the world be it carpenter, fitter, surveyor, engineer
&gt; etc realises the master  work involved in those realisations ...
&gt; Archaeologists as well as Geologists are unable to even dress a stone
&gt; wall correctly and will never do so ...unable they are to realise too
&gt; that only the union of manual &amp; intellectual potential allows to find

&gt; Of course the Incas had nothing to do with such constructions which
&gt; they squatted, but respected and of which they had in their legends
&gt; the key to their origin ( Popol Vuh )

&gt; I can tell you that as a True Geologist I am in a position to
&gt; calculate the Energy required to lift the Andes and lower the

It just seems odd to me, that anyone would attempt to alter history,
or misrepresent some historical facts or even suppress history, when
every single event in history, is recorded through th eeyes of some
person, and that data is stored in the conscious computer.
And moreso. The entire scenes are observed and if you could interface
with it, you could look at any point in history and see everything as
it happened in great detail.

The whole thing, the whole universe is a conscious computer, and this

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Examine the protrusion in that wall in this photo... http://s2.supload.com/free/Tiahaunaco-9-30-2007.jpg/view/

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know what this? Well how can you people claim to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; archaeologists when you don't know what a very common thing is, that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is found all over Peru?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a water channel. http://www.panoramio.com/photo/3706357http://www.panoramio.com/photo/ ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And you have it sticking out of a wall like an ornament. You have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed these ruins completely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Examine this aerial view http://s2.supload.com/free/TiticacaPyramid-9-30-2007.jpg/view/

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can see that the so called pyramid is covered in dirt. Could it be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not a pyramid? Could it be a burial mound?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is it covered in silt because it was at one time UNDER Titicaca?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of just digging into the top to find the buried treasure and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ruining the thing, do you not think that it might have been better to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remove the dirt and expose it? Is it a building?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You see you are just a wrecking crew. And Harvard University, has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digging in that mound for 10 years.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here, have a look at this tourist page from a trip someone made in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2001.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Look halfway down the page. Even he knows what a water pipe is.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Harvard has them sticking out the walls. http://www.timshome.com/travel/bolivia/

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let this be a lesson to all countries.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You do not want foreign archaeologists entering your ruins.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You want them kept out completely. No photographs.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Allow the general public in under supervision, and allow your own
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; archaeologists to examine and excavate.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But keep out the foreign archaeologists because they will turn the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world against your heritage even with their photographs, and their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lies, and if they can get in, they will do damage wherever possible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Their track record is right there for all to see.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And when UNESCO comes knocking, DO NOT LET THEM INTO YOUR COUNTRY.
&gt; &gt; &gt; They are just their henchmen. And they will say, you must protect this
&gt; &gt; &gt; site! And they will insist that archaeologists from places like
&gt; &gt; &gt; Harvard come onto the site and investigate its importance.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And then they will diminish its antiquity and make it worthless by
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to get your artifacts into foreign museums, and then they will
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad mouth your ruins in the press as being of no consequence. http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id;_site=567

&gt; &gt; Let tourists in, of course, and let them see your work in progress.
&gt; &gt; Make it an open public affair, and they will always think the best of
&gt; &gt; your heritage. They will tell their friends and they will put their
&gt; &gt; photographs on their websites and they will not accept false lies
&gt; &gt; about their antiquity. They will take things at face value.

&gt; &gt; When they see a city, covered in silt, by a lake, and they see
&gt; &gt; monoliths, encrusted in limestone, from being in that lake, they know
&gt; &gt; it is very old.
&gt; &gt; And they will say that, because that is the truth.
&gt; &gt; And they will post their pictures for others to see.
&gt; &gt; But when you let archaeologists from other countries in, they always
&gt; &gt; say your people were stupid. Too stupid to be able to do anything like
&gt; &gt; this. It is all a mistake. Those are natural formations, your people
&gt; &gt; were uneducated natives who only built temples and only built temples
&gt; &gt; to sacrifice people their idols and their primitive gods.
&gt; &gt; That is what they say about Tiahuanacu.
&gt; &gt; A city older than Stone Henge, that had running water.
&gt; &gt; A port city bustling with commerce. Built with stones weighing in
&gt; &gt; excess of 600 tons that they themselves could not move.
&gt; &gt; Huge stones fitted with such precision, that you could not fit a razor
&gt; &gt; blade between them. http://s2.supload.com/free/cusco-koricancha-inca-walls-cc-drp.jpg/view/

&gt; Yes Rick,  you are correct, and this photo from Cusco illustrate
&gt; perfection of the same nature than the monolithic foundations of the
&gt; Occidental wall in Jerusalem which has nothing to do with the Jews
&gt; indeed ... Such monolithic foundations there and here are beyond the
&gt; reach of present technology with complete 3D imbrications of each
&gt; stone ... in clear without cement ! ... a exceptional feat only found
&gt; again in the European Cathedrals built all the them by the Knight
&gt; Templars, but in this case this with square dressed stones !
&gt; Still the real story is more amazing since Tiahuanacu.was a sea port
&gt; with mooring still visible allowing securing of high sea vessels etc

&gt; By the way silt as you mention is not generated by present conditions
&gt; but is a secondary deposition or secondary erosion if you prefer

&gt; You are correct with your comments relative to the Harvard 's Dudes,
&gt; those idiots are always ( as the other official Archaeologist) playing
&gt; down the correct time scale to make it fit to their ludicrous Time
&gt; Column derived from erroneous interpretation of Graptolites and
&gt; Trilobites fossil population. One thing you have to know is that NO
&gt; Archaeologist has a mind of his own; there are all riding on the band
&gt; wagon of that most lunatic perversion presenting itself as Geology at
&gt; the present time ... on that Band Wagon the Archaeologists are
&gt; whistling and dancing on the same tune that degenerate humanity of
&gt; Rock Surveyors masquerading the world over as Geologist indeed

Well its good to have a geologist around.
I was looking at Bolivia and was wondering to myself if one of my
girlfriends Gwendolyn, was sitting at the electro-gravitic controls in
the moon pushing buttons to see what does what when I saw this. Little
wonder there is so much dinosaur and giant copra therebouts.
Any thoughts on this?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blowing apart the megalithic stones with gun powder even as recounted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by one Conquistador scribe, and then in 1833, again trying to walk
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away with statues tucked into their trouser pockets?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There, are limestone, encrustations, on the remaining megalithic

Perhaps I should confess that this is just rock mail from home. It
reads like a family album almost doesn't it?
My dad, my grandmother, my brother Stephen, Mary, and someone who I am
not sure who that is, unless it is an oriental stylized impression of
Zeus. (By Ipas Chico) he looks familiar, but I can't place him. Its
probably my uncle on my dad's side. It is just that he is being
portrayed with some oriental or Spanish characteristics there.

I felt I should confess because those who know me have seen this type
of thing from me before, yes you mentioned Santa and Zeus of course is
Santa and I have in the past posted some cloud mail from him in the
form of a short video where he dons a Santa hat. A message from home
sent via cloud mail.

Rockmail though that is quite a nice treat. It is so nice to have such
a wonderful thoughtful family. Part of why I am so anxious to get home
I suppose. It would be nice to just load up the moon with all our
friends and set off like on a Star Trek like voyage home. I would of
course want to bring Adriana and Devon and a few other people. Lots of
people would want to go home if they could I am sure.

Gwendolyn and Hanuman and Robert are also depicted there in Peru.
Although the artwork isn't as nice.
http://s2.supload.com/free/HanumanGwendolynRObert-10-4-2007.jpg/view/
Hanuman on the left facing left, Gwendolyn showing her boobies to the
right inside the polygon and Robert depicted as an old blow hard below
and to the right, but as I said not a very flattering picture of
Gwendolyn who is actually a very beautiful blond babe.
The reason that you can only see the top half of Stephen is because he
can't draw feet.

I think the reason whoever did this art depicted Gwendolyn as an angel
with Chinese heritage is because they don't know where she is from.
But I actually did get beamed to her parents house for dinner about 5
years ago and met her parents and it was just like a house in suburban
America.
But whoever depicted them, probably wasn't sure where Robert,
Gwendolyn and Hanuman actually come from, whereas the rest they know
they are Anunaki. Gwendloyn does have some sort of very ancient
heritage but it is not Chinese and she isn't an angel, she pretends to
be an angel but she is a Goddess. She plays down that aspect of
herself. She is probably one of the original seeders of good old terra
firma. Gaia is another name of hers I guess. And Sailor Moon. So she
is probably an Anunaki, her parents look like Anunaki its just she
hasn't been home for a very long time, other than getting to beam home
and that.
Hanuman is depicted as having a human face on the right as well, and
that is because Hanuman is our conscious computer, so he looks after
the animals as well, and that is why he is depicted as a monkey boy.
And Robert well thats not very fair to Robert, but the guys he hangs
around with are a little bit American in that tropical tourist shorts
kindof  way, and so if he was depicted as his debonair self people
would take shots at him, whereas this is just a way for people to
ignore him.
And Michael is there closer to the beach, with his back turned, all
white wings, as an angel. I won't bother to post it there's nothing to
see. He's the baby of the family. If you want to see his butt you can
go looking for it.

Your approach is correct indeed although failing to understand the
cause of both the Andes mountain building and the consequences of on
the Olmers ' civiilisation ... which are under your very eyes indeed

Of course all of this completely goes above the dull heads of the
Geoclowns and other type of Archaeojesters !

Tne intellectual impaired Universities brainwashed fools still believe
for most in the Father Xmas' tales upgraded versions such as Lyell,
Dar Ween &amp; Aggasiz infantile legends.

Well it suits all those parasites clogging the gears of understanding
and maintaining Mankind back in time since 150 years.
As it is well known the tenants of false theories have to die for new
superior knowledge to see the day ...
Academic vermines will stand their ground indeed since their very
survival depends on it.
