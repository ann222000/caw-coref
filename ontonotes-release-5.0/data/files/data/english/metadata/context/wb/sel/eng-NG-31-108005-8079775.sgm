What kinds of machines do we own? and how old are these machines? and what
do we prefer age/brand wise? (sorry if this is a repeat but I don't have the
time to go back into the archives right now and I am a terribly curious
person)

I have:
1964 Kenmore in original cabinet with all the original cams and accessories.
My favourite machine to use at this time.

1992 Kenmore. Just a simple machine with 10 stitches. Wonderful machine for
hemming and mending of our uniforms and such. Light and easy to drag out for
emergency surgery!

and my newest acquired machine
1960's Bernina 731 with ALL the bells and whistles. I cant wait to try this
baby out and possibly make it my new favourite machine!

Oh and I also own a brand new Kenmore serger that I have used once. I must
learn how to use it and get comfortable with that kind of machine since it
is a bit out of my comfort zone.

I find that I prefer the old, heavy, simpler machines to the new fancy
computerized ones. I learned on a simple Elna knee control and I guess  that
is where my loyalty lies when it comes to using machines. I know how to rip
them apart and put them back together and they still work when I am done
with that! LOL (yes, that is important to me for some odd reason?)

~KK in BC~ who is patiently waiting to inherit my mom's machines, a FW
singer of unknown age, a treadle that belonged to my grandmother in MINT
condition, another FW of unknown origin but sews like a dream, her new
serger from Singer, and her newest SM also a Singer (but computerized so I
am not really excited about that one LOL) Sadly she has disposed of her
industrial upholstery machine before I could claim it.

I have my mother's old Singer Redeye treadle that I learned to sew on, 2
featherweights, a Singer 301, a Singer 401, a Singer 503, and a realitively
new Bernina. Can you tell I like old Singers. It's a challenge for me to
tear them apart and get them working. And they sew beautifully. My Bernina
is the one I use most, however.

Current machines:
Main machine is a Viking #1,(not the #1+). Love this machine. It sits in
a table, has a front load bobbin case and is great for most anything I
can think of.
Also have a Viking Rose, with embroidery module. This is my &quot;travel&quot;
machine. Don't use the embroidery module much at all. And really should,
but don't have a place to really set it up and make it easily accessible.
Singer 66, in a table. (I think it from the 1950's sometime) DH picked
this one up for me at Goodwill, for $20.  Had to put about $200 into
repairs and replacement parts (rewiring, pressure foot and screw, bobbin
cover, new lamp, needle screw, etc).  Should be a good little machine,
and DH wants me to teach him how to use it too. &lt;BG&gt;

Also have a Singer Stylist (?) in the trunk of the car. It has a &quot;frozen
gear&quot; according to the person I got it from. Cost me all of $5, so it
may turn out to be a good little machine too when I can afford to get it
looked at. &lt;G&gt; (Even have the manual for this one.)

Still mourning my Viking 6460. Wonderful machine, that I loaned to a
&quot;friend&quot;. Friends and the machine disappeared.  sigh. Love that machine
and would love to find one.  Even though they are so old that it is
difficult to find parts for them now.

Is there enough bandwidth for some of our lists? ;-)

My list is:

Three modern Janomes, one of which I'll get around to selling eventually.
Two sergers, both inherited and rarely used.
One longarm
Two complete treadles (1890's Minnesota VS, 1900 Singer VS). I adore the
Minnesota, but the Singer is my main piecing machine because I can use a
modern 1/4&quot; foot on it.
Three treadle heads and one e-machine in various conditions. One of the
treadle heads is a parts machine; one is slated to get converted to a hand
crank. The other head and the e-machine are eventually destined to find
loving homes somewhere.

ooops........
Forgot the sergers.  Have a Huskylock 560EDT (?) and a White Speedylock.
The Husky sits in the same table, other leg of the &quot;U&quot; as my #1, the
White is my travel serger. &lt;G&gt;

One of these days I hope to own my grandmother's treadle. sigh. My aunt
has it, sitting as a TV stand, because she &quot;learned to sew on it&quot;, even
though Grandma had told me I could have it. sigh. Hope I do get it
eventually. My aunt's daughter doesn't sew that I know of.

I also will get my dad's sister's machine. Not sure what it is-- but
everyone agrees that I should have it since I am the one cousin that
really does the most sewing.  &lt;G&gt; It is currently in Texas, (Cañon
county??) if anyone is heading through there to this part of the world
and wants to do a &quot;pony express&quot; deal. &lt;VBG&gt;
I may try to figure out a way to stop by and pick it up on the way home
from Houston in November.  It is out of the way, but can't be any more
out of the way than Midland was. &lt;VBG&gt; (And visiting family I haven't
seen in over 30 years would be a heck of a lot better than sitting while
waiting to have an engine replaced.&lt;VBG&gt;)

Well, there are sewing machines and then there are sewing machine.
Outside around the yard are 3 or 4 old SInger carcass only machines.
They are tucked in bushes here and there.

In the garage are several 201's a couple Spartan's I think a 127 and a
couple 401's and a 500  and probably if James isn't looking there are a
few more tucked here  and there. I know for sure of a couple of small
oddball VS oldies.

There is an old Sewhandy, the precursor to the FW in the new 'barn'.
I am having a devil of a time finding my parts but there are a few boxes
of those too. (I mentioned I could help someone here with a tension
assembly and I still can't find those parts.  Whoever that was I am
sorry.  Sherry maybe? )

Inside I have my first ever machine a Singer treadle.  Still works but
my computer sits on it these days.  I have 2 FW's.  Grandma's original
and a beauty of a Centennial that dh gave me.  I have a couple of black
301's, and a brother PQ1500 that I need to sell.  My beloved Bernina 930
and new Janome 6600 are here in residence also.  James has a Singer 306
somewhere around here too.

There are probably more.  If you asked what do you sew on the answer
would be real different.  My Brother 1500 and the B. 930 were my
main machines with a 301 going to quilt classes.  I am trying to work
over to the Janome 6600.  I am going for that class Tuesday so I hope
that is going to help getting me sewing on that pretty much for most
stuff.  I adapted my favorite old sewing cabinet so that it fits flush
and it is in front of the sunny window and good to go.

Taria

BTW,  I got my grandma's FW when mom passed.  Inheriting a machine is
good but it seems to happen way too soon.  Love the machine, but sure
miss my mama.

I bought a new Janome 6600 a few months back, but got off track in
quilting/sewing with my hip surgery.  I LOVE that machine!!!  Bought a
gently used Janome Jem a few weeks ago and haven't even tried it out.  I
have a 1950 (the year I was born!) Singer 15-91 in an adapted cabinet from
some off-brand sewing machine- bought the machine and cabinet at a flea
market for $25 and all I wanted was the cabinet. ;-)  And a 1932 Singer 66
Redeye treadle that's a *blast* to sew on- I usually keep it behind the sofa
as a gorgeous sofa table.  I love them all for their unique talents!

PS:  My son is driving me to see my surgeon Monday- I hope to be able to
start some weight bearing- it's been almost TEN WEEKS!  I'm ready to start
walking!

Pfaff Girl here...

a 2030 that I purchased when I started quilting in 1999.  I do all of my
sewing on it.   A real workhorse!!!

and a 7570 that I purchased off eBay last October...  this is an embroidery
machine... which I have not yet fiured out how to use!  Anybody live near me

option sadly).

I have a Janome 1600DB set in a large flat table.
A Bernina 1008 mechanical which I use most of all.
A Bernina 220 Activa computerized which I don't use much.
A Janome New Home 234 computerized Serger which I use for sewing
clothes.
A Janome ME4023 which I am giving to a friend when she comes to visit
so that she can stop swearing at her old singer and get back to
sewing.
That is it for now. All of the machines are newer models and have
replaced others
that I have moved on from and either given away to charity or
friends.
I hate Holding garage sales and would rather give something away, to
charities or needy friends
than sit in the sun and be beaten down on the already cheap price that
I am selling something for.

I have a Singer99K that my DH bought for my 20th birthday in Malta.
I have a Pfaff 7550 about 9 years old.
I have a Janome My Lock over locker (serger)
I have a Anglosew blind hemming machine
I have  a Newholme 323  bought as a stand in when my Viking bit the
dust.
At my son's house there is a very old singer treadle that he got with
his house and I use that if I have to do any sewing for him.

The lovely machines that I happen to be owned by the first one used to/still
does belong to my mom, a 1966 greenish Singer 331 with the knee control,
which I learned to first sew with. Then I ended up with a cheap plastic
brother from a dept store does an ok sort of job but not like my singers
though. Then I was lucky to get a 1965 Singer Featherweight in the original
carrier, with all the attachments including the zigzag attachment from a
lady who was going to take it to the dump, she really didn't know what she
had but when she told me what it looked like, I knew what it was and I
jumped at it. Nearly died from shock when I realized what she was thinking
of tossing away. I am now holding out for a serger and a singer treadle.
Good things come to those who wait I hope

Our local Pfaff store has monthly club meetings for those who own Pfaff and
anyone can go to the club meetings.  I haven't been in a few years, but I'm
thinking that you pay a few dollars monthly dues to help with refreshments
and you learn lots of good information on how to use the newer machines.  My
Pfaff is an older 1471 and I love it!!  Barbara in SC

I have a Huskystar (205? I think) that I got as a birthday present from my
mom a few years back and a Dressmaker older machine. No Idea how old it is,
but old enough to be all metal and heavy as hell! Once I figure out how to
thread her properly I'll use her for piecing for a bit and take the
Huskystar in to be serviced. The other machines I've had (a couple of small
Singers) have been fixed up and given to friends' daughters as their first
machines. One I don't think much will happen with but the other may just
turn into a good seamstress since her mom is going to help her along with
the first steps. I try to nab every freecycle machine I see listed with an
eye toward getting a few good working machines and I can always find homes
for the ones I don't need/want.

Interesting question! I've got a Bernina 1000 which is 11 years old and a
Bernina 1008 which is 3--same age as the puppy who pulled the 1000 onto the
floor during my one-week sewing vacation three years ago ;-( They're almost
identical but I do slightly prefer the 1000--it's easier to get into its
guts.

I've only got two machines DM's hand-me-down Janome from 1980 that I
pretty much learnt to sew on and my first bought new machine a
Huskylock 905 (overlocker/serger) that I love to use - I make a lot
of DS's clothes and some for me too.

My main machine these days is an Elna Quilter's Dream 6003. I bought it
in 2002 because my daughter wanted the very basic computerized Elna that
I had purchased in 1995. She was having trouble with the Elna Supermatic
that my parents bought me in 1966 (I think it just needed cleaning and
oiling). The Supermatic went to my sister who had burned out the motor
on her Supermatic that was just like mine. I also have an Elna serger
that must be about 20 years old. I am definitely an Elna woman; they've
all been great machines. I also have a Singer 401 that I bought on a
garage sale; it's a great backup machine.

I have a Janome 6600 because my old Singer died on me.

Although at a yard sale yesterday for $20.00 they had the bottom to a
treadle machine....all I need is a marble top for it.  If it isn't sold I
want to go back for it..
I can see that tin my sewing room with a mason jar lamp filled with buttons
....or a fish tank on it.
Any ideas of what to do with this bottom part??

My main machine is a
Janome JA1512, a basic machine
I also have the following
Featherweight
Singer treadle
Singer 201
and a handcrank dating from about 1908 which, (as I have since found
out was common at the time)  was imported from Germany and rebadged.

My main machine is a Singer 15-91 knockoff called a Spartan, teal
colored, bought from eBay for $16. Also have a Singer 834, Singer 401
in cabinet with stool waiting to be cleaned and put in use, a white FW
220V bought at second hand shop [not complete, needs some things]
Singer 15, Singer 16-91. And a few others. Will be cleaning them up
and selling them.

My sister still has the treadle machine that my mother promised to me,
being used as a conversation piece.....

My youngest machine is about my age ;)

Pami-

I also have a treadle bottom framework.  It came with three pieces of 2X6
lumber that were stained and glued/screwed to the top of it to use as a
table.  (Estate auction- $8.00!)  I want to get a nicer top for the base.  I
use it to hold a lamp next to my recliner which usually lives in my studio.
But in this house the sewing area is too cramped for the recliner and the
table.  Phooey.  I miss that lovely, peaceful, quiet corner for reading-
mostly reading quilt books and magazines.  VBG  A marble top sounds lovely-
good idea!

Well, I think I'm a lightweight in the sewing machine collection category.
I have my original sewing machine that my 1st husband bought me when we were
first married.   It's a Singer Genie.  Never had any trouble with it.  I
never knew you were supposed to clean your machine or get them serviced.
It's still never been serviced, but I now know how to clean it.  I just got
it back from a friend who had it for about 2 years &amp; she made slipcovers,
drapes &amp; various other things with it.  It's a keeper.  (Made in France -
who knew!!)  It is probably 30+ years old.

I have a Viking #1+ - that is my primary machine &amp; it's a great, great
machine.  I thought I'd use the embroidery feature.  You'd have to put a gun
to my head to get me to embroider.  I have absolutely no, zero, zilch
interest in embroidering.

My &quot;new to me&quot; machines are a Singer Featherweight, vintage 1939 &amp; a white
Featherweight - I forget how old she is.  I just need a tan/brown FW to
complete the line-up.  I love, love, love my FW.  I had my Viking in for
servicing recently &amp; used my FW a lot &amp; when the Viking came home, I left it
in it's case, until just recently.  Did I mention that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my
FW!  I'm going on retreat next week &amp; that's what I'm bringing with me.

I don't know what I have.  They come here from ebay.  DH gets them going and
go is exactly what they do.  Right this minute there are twins in my sewing
room - two Bernina Virtuosa 155s and two sergers.  There is a worn Bernina
1230 waiting for a home and some old and beautiful Singers when a backup or
beginner SM is needed.  I would love to add the old Pfaff, the 130 I think
it is, that can sew through canvas and beer cans; never know when I'll want
to do that.  I'd also like to have a hemstitching machine.  I'm watching.
One will appear one day. Polly

I have 3 machines:

1- My grandmother's early 1970's New Home.  She made all her own clothing,
repaired clothing for my grandpa and some repairs for her grown kids (6 of
them) and made things for us grandkids (18 of us) on it.  She worked that
thing to death until she died and I inherited it..  Although it runs and I
did use it a couple of times to repair a few things, it is no longer one I
will use.  I had it serviced and was told it is not doing well inside.  So,
it sits next to my others now for sentimental reasons.

2- A new Bernina I received from my mother for Christmas shortly after I
began quilting about 4 years ago.  This is the one I use for everything, but
that is going to change soon.  It will be mainly for my quilting and
lightweight stuff now.  I love her, but she can be temperamental at times.

3- My 1952(IIRC) Singer 15-91 Freecycle machine that I posted about.  I
received it in May (?)  from a woman that is down sizing and moving to a
much smaller place.  She never sewed with it and the aunt she  inherited it
from only used it a few times.  It came with the cabinet and stool.
Although it runs great it is not in use right now because it needs to be in
a cabinet to use, and we are working the cabinet.  There was some water
damage to the top of the cabinet and some minor damage to some of the sides
and edges so we are working on refinishing it.  I'm also going to
reupholster the seat for the stool.  When we're done, it will be used for
all the heavier duty things (repairing jeans, patches on baseball caps,
repairing bags etc. )  and some of my quilting and other lighter sewing on
occasion too.

As to preferences -
Haven't had enough experience to have a brand preference - I've only just
started.
I do have an age preference - Most of the time I must say I really like my
newer (computerized) machine.  Having the needle stop up or down is really
nice, and when I had to use my mothers old back up machine (non-computerized
1970's Bernina) while mine was in for repairs, I really missed that feature.
There are times though that I really like the old back up because it is much
less picky and cooperates much better with certain projects.

My main machine is a Janome 6600 that I have had for 1 year.  I also
have a Janome 9500 I use for embroidery.  A Janome 644 serger which is 6
months old.

These replaced my New Home Limited edition which I bought around 1992 I
think.  I also have an old Singer fashionmate that my wife used (before
she found out I could sew, then no more LOL)

Well needless to say I have accumulated 9 sewing machines over the last few
years.
My first was a junior miss in a carrying case that I got
when I was about 10 years old.
My second was a singer 503A   I got in l963.
Next was a Brother 907 1992
Next was a Viking Rose with embroidery Unit 2000
Next was a Euro Pro 9106 40 stitches 2004
Next was a Designer 2 with embroidery Unit 2004
next was a singer 66 treadle l925 2004
next was a singer 15-91 1952  2006
and finally my last one was a viking 905 serger 2007.
I use at least one or two every day.  I do a lot of
Machine embroidery on the rose and the designer 2.
Usually make most of my christmas presents.  I have
7 kids and 12 grandchildren to make for.
As of now all of my machines are working.  But I
always have a backup if one doesn't work.
I have been sewing off and on for the last 50 + years.
The last 5 years I have a been mainly quilting and
crafts. Check out my stuff at:

Oh dear Polly.... the sewing through canvas and beer cans just brought to
mind the most incredible red neck version of a wedding gown that one could
ever hope for.... if one could actually hope for such a beast? LOL

I actually wish now we had done a redneck or Halloween wedding now that I
know us so much better than I did when we got married. It would have been a
HOOT! Maybe for my 10th we will get re-wed and I will get you to design me
the canvas and beercan gown ok? Oh but you would have to be sure to make the
hubby a cumberbund and ball cap out of the same stuff since we would have to
have something to match us up with!

I have an Imperial, which is an absolute bear to get any information
on.  I think it was probably made sometime in the 60's.  It is all
metal with plastic knobs and is that odd tan-beige that was the enamel
color for home machinery in the early to mid 60's.

A Pfaff 130, early 1950's.  I'm not sure if it was inspired by the
model god used to sew sails for the ark, or if it was typical german
engineering to enable one to sew tanks.  It is a most awsesome
machine.

A Bel-Air Bantam, copy of a Singer featherweight. I think it is
probably a WWII  vintage because it is cast zinc (mostly) rather than
cast iron.  A nice little straight stitching machine.

A Free-Westinghouse, probably one of the last to go out with that
name, it came with a manual which is copyrighted 1934.  A very easy
sewing beast.

A 1928 Singer 99, still in the original bentwood case.  I am still
trying to figure out a good ergonomically correct table and chair
combination to use it with.  As is I have to sit on a couple of phone
books.

I have a treadle by courtesy.  When one of the old aunties died she
left it to me because I am the only one amongst the sibs, wives, and
cousins that really sews _and_ doesn't have to yell for help whenever
the machine burps.
I believe it is a Singer 27 or perhaps an extremely close cousin.
Very ornate with a vibrateing shuttle bobbin.  I still haven't really
gone over it. It isn't _truly_ mine, you see.  DH's cousin
who is &quot;slow&quot; uses it frequently and I haven't the heart to take it
away from her.  She is better than 25 years older than me, and I am
not sure she could learn to use a new machine (she is afraid of
electricity).  I've ended up teaching her how to make right triangle
squares without having to sew bias edges, and she is going to town
making new kinds of quilt blocks.  There was a method to Aunty's
madness.

Hey Polly, in the course of my searchings I discovered that the Pfaff
130 is much beloved by upholsterers and sailmakers.  So if you ever
see one of those shops going out or such, you might want to have a
look.  I bet places that make canvas awnings might have some too.
I am still wondering how I lived without mine for leather, PVC, and
corsets.  Or corsets whose top layer is leather or PVC.

Well, I have a National hand crank - looks good but I don't have a shuttle
for it, a red-eye Singer treadle (works well), two 15-91's one works great
the other was my GGM's, a 401 and a FW, a Babylock Serger and my new Bernina

I have:
Viking Lily - love of my quilting-life!
401-A Singer - was my Mom's, and I learned to sew clothes on it. Still
works!
a Singer made ?1896 - my DH brought home from the dump one day cuz he
thought I'd like it!!  (He's a keeper, he is!!)  It is an electrified
version of a treadle. I checked the number on it with Singer and their list
indicated it was made in PA.  I still need to clean it and get it running
smoothly. (It does run, though!)

I do have an old treadle cabinet, but the above machine doesn't quite fit.
It reminds me of the old treadle my DGma tried to teach me to sew on.

...and 2 sergers.

My main one is the Cotton Patch's Anniversary edition, from 2002.  I
don't know who actually made it.  It has straight stitch, zigzag,
buttonhole and maybe 15 or 20 decorative stitches.  It's enough to
keep me occupied and happy.  I have a clear plastic table for it, to
keep the weight of the quilt from snapping needles.
I have a treadle, which needs a new leather belt.
I also have 2 99K handcranks - one from 1931 which has seen better
days and one from 1937 which is near mint condition.  I sewed on both
before I had the electric one in 2002.  I made my first quilt on a 99K
handcrank.  Boy that took forever, and the quilting was tricky, since
I had to use one hand to turn the crank.  It's amazing what a
determined quilter can do though.  :)

&gt; singer of unknown age, a treadle that belonged to my grandmother in MINT
&gt; condition, another FW of unknown origin but sews like a dream, her new
&gt; serger from Singer, and her newest SM also a Singer (but computerized so I
&gt; am not really excited about that one LOL) Sadly she has disposed of her
&gt; industrial upholstery machine before I could claim it.

I guess I've got all new fancy ones.  :-)  My main machine is my Viking Lily
555.  I've also got a Viking serger, a fancy Janome Jem Plantinum that was my
Christmas present from 2 years ago, and a brand new Brother embroidery
machine that I've played with a little.
