Thanks Edward I thought I remembered you did those tests on Ochre. Unfortunately I don't have any wood ash. Did you process the material yourself? If so may I ask what method you used? I am currently drying the material out with the idea of slaking it in water so I can sieve the rocks and other material out. I also think I may sinter it to cone 05 to remove any organics. I am slightly concerned that doing that may actually fuse the material because it seems to have some clay content.

Does anyone else have any experience with using raw copper? I usually just buy the green powder in a baggie and I am not sure how they process that. Mechanical? Chemical? We also went swimming in an abandoned copper quarry that hit a spring and filled up with water. I picked up some interesting samples there as well. Vancouver Island is very geologically rich. It's also something of a pottery Paradise. I will probably move out there at some point.

I have added some more pics of the deposit on my blog so check them out at http://fireandmud.blogspot.com/

greg: I got quite a bit of wood ash because I could not get to the
store to buy my usual natural lump charcoal for the BBQ. Instead I had
to use briquettes. Not as good for cooking the chicken &amp; pork but
yields a very nice wood ash glaze material. I wonder if the ochre you
got in Vancouver looks much like the samples of (?) that I got in
Oregon.

Greg,

replace woodash by whiting and it will work.
I have tested about 40 glazes containing &quot;local
red ochre&quot; but they are all over my hard-drive.

I got my ochre from the lady next door whose
uncle owned the mine until his death many years ago.

It is very simple to process
1- Let the stuff dry completely
2-Break the larger bits with something
solid,
3-Sieve it to the granulometry you want,
if you own many.
I am lucky, I was given sieves ranging from 20
to 325 meshes by companies closing down

The samples I got from the lady next door were
relatively fine-grained, so I dry them and sieved
30 and 60 meshes. What went thru 60 also went thru
170.
Therefore I have larger and finer grained ochre.

I believe the method you described is suitable,
it is like washing and sieveing ashes, it should
work.
I would bring your ochre to the red as we say in French,
&quot;amener au rouge&quot;, that is close to quartz inversion,
I mean when the kiln is starting to become red inside;
to get rid of most of the volatiles,
I did not do that with my samples and never had a
volatile-related problem, even if I added large amounts
of the material to my glazes.

Hello everyone!

This forum is just great! But i will be away for quite a while and won't have internet. i will be going to the south of france (i'm french, but i'm currently living in new zealand) to study ceramic for one or two years ( www.agir-ceramique.com if you feel like going to check the website of the school i willl be going to. ) That's in a little secluded medieval village lost in the middle of the garigue :-)

Thanks for all the advices i got from this forum and to all the participants!
i will come back once i've got internet at home again =)
take care!

have a nice day~~!

Caroline

I've used small diameter copper wire wrapped around a bottle; the part that didn't melt and fall onto the kiln shelf left a dark green to black line. Since then Ive used it occasionally in the bottom of platters, making shapes of the wire, placing them over the glaze. It's fun to experiment with.
I guess that's not exactly &quot;raw copper&quot;,  but it's not just the green powder either.

Thanks Edward, Hank, and Ann.
Your advise has been a great help to me. I am going to do some tests
this week and I will keep you all posted on the results. I took quite
a few samples both wet and dry from several locations, inside and
outside of the cave, so i have quite a range of material to test. I
think I may also include some Ochre and Copper carb from my regular
supply as control samples. I wish I had seen the copper more clearly I
may have only taken one sample of that so until I get a chance to
return I may have to concentrate on the Ochre. Someone else suggested
that the deposit might in fact be yellow iron oxide. We shall see how
it turns out. I also need to investigate any current mining claims
that might be on the property.

Thanks again:

Does anyone else have any experience with using raw copper?

As someone else has pointed out, you can take copper wire and lay it on a
bisqued piece and, if the wire is thin, say around 24 gauge, you can get it
to leave a black to green line that resembles the wire line that you made.
You can also do that by wrapping the wire around pots and such.  I don't
know what the temperature is that you'll get the best results, but I do know
that the work I've been doing with copper in a sawdust barrel fire has been
quite satifactory.

Best of luck,
Philip

Phillip,
Copper wire works great in a Saggar.  I fire to about 1825 F with copper
wire around my pots, I use 42 gauge wire because the mark gets wider
during the firing.  I have also used this same wire under a clear glaze
and I get red and green from it when fired in reduction at cone 10.  you
simply hold the wire in place on the bisque with dots of glaze about
every two inches, then dip the whole pot in the glaze bucket.  Spraying
the glaze will tend to blow the wire around.

If you go to my page at school at :

http://www.tacomacc.edu/home/rmahaffe/contents.htm
then click on my work you can see some of my saggar fired work.

You do have to be careful because when the metalic copper falls onto a
shelf in a cone 10 reduction firing it can kind of eat into a shelf.  I
know this because someone threw a penny into a kiln and we had a black
hole in the shelf that went about 3/8 of an inch deep (mullite shelves)
so I used a chisel to remove the black area hopeing that by doing that
it would not erode the shelf any deeper.

I did not try patching the hole (more of a divot) the shelf was not in that great condition before the penny incident so we just put some kilin putty into the hole to get it a bit more level.
