Brad Jacobs calls himself &quot;one of the most famous plastic surgeons in
history.&quot; At his clinic on the Upper East Side, he's performed
thousands of breast-augmentation and liposuction procedures, and his
patients reportedly include Playboy Playmate Courtney Culkin and
Playboy cover girl Monica Leigh. Last year, he expanded his practice
to include a new specialty in reshaping buttocks at his &quot;Star Butts&quot;
clinic. For $11,000, patients reshaped their asses to resemble the
behinds of Eva Longoria, Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, or Paris
Hilton. Jacobs received his medical degree from McGill University,
which his lawyer calls &quot;the Harvard of Canada.&quot; He's a family man with
a wife and a son and a house on Long Island.
He's also at the center of one of New York's most sensational
medical-malpractice scandals in recent history. Over the course of the
last eight years, Jacobs has settled or lost at least 26 malpractice
lawsuits filed against him, and more are working their way through the
courts. In late June, the state Department of Health suspended his
license to practice medicine, and Jacobs is now fighting to save his
career. State medical investigators have charged him with a wide range
of misconduct, including giving his patients boob jobs that were much
bigger than they requested, failing to treat a patient's abscess after
surgery, humiliating a patient by undressing her post-operative wounds
in front of Jacobs's then girlfriend, and removing too much cartilage
from a patient's nose during rhinoplasty. In the most shocking case,
state investigators claim that Jacobs smoked crystal meth with one of
his patients, had sex with her while she was recuperating from a nose
job, and ultimately deformed her face.

Jacobs has strenuously denied these allegations and spent the last few
months appealing the decision. On June 20, he and his lawyer, Michael
Kelton, convened a press conference at Kelton's office, where an
emotional Jacobs read a prepared statement before leaving the room.
Two of his patients stayed behind to sing his praises; one had flown
in from Chicago to stand by her doctor. According to Kelton, over 100
patients have submitted letters attesting to Jacobs's professionalism;
indeed, they claim they can't do without him. &quot;Dozens of his patients
are calling to say, 'What do I do now?' &quot; Kelton says. &quot;You know, his
patients love him. And they can't even imagine going somewhere else.&quot;

Amid the furor, the identity of the patient who allegedly smoked meth
and had sex with Jacobs was not revealed. Now, the Voice has learned
her name and her story. She tells a lurid tale of Vegas strip clubs,
of sex in Jacobs's Upper East Side apartment, and of the doctor
performing surgery while under the influence of crystal meth. If her
story is true, Jacobs is a menace who should never be allowed near a
scalpel again.

But is her story true? Jacobs says his former patient is a delusional
schizophrenic who invented the affair, a woman so haunted by
self-loathing that she became fixated on the one man she thought could
make her beautiful. Furthermore, Jacobs claims that he's been hounded
in the press by greedy lawyers who saw a cash cow and milked it for
all it was worth, while he was left with a life in ruins.

Since late June, a panel of two doctors and one layman has been
reviewing Jacobs's case on behalf of the state Department of Health.
They are considering whether to permanently revoke his license to
practice medicine and are scheduled to render a decision at the end of
September. (In the meantime, Jacobs cannot practice.) The panel's
members must ask themselves: Is the man who describes himself as &quot;one
of the most famous plastic surgeons in history&quot; just a speed-addled
quack? Or is he a good man being shaken down by a school of legal
sharks and drug-addicted strippers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Few doctors can boast a résumé quite as impressive as Jacobs's. After
growing up in Queens and Long Island, Jacobs attended SUNY Albany and
got his medical degree from McGill University. He did his residency at
St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he says he'd already
amassed a large patient following before setting up a private practice
in 1995. With aggressive use of Internet marketing, his patient list
grew worldwide by the late '90s, and he became particularly renowned
among Austrian women. He's done work on four Playboy Playmates and
countless Playboy models, who have autographed copies of their covers
for him to display at his Upper East Side office. Before he sold it to
cover his legal expenses, his old Porsche boasted the license plate
&quot;BUNNYMAKR.&quot;

It wasn't just his celebrity clientele that boosted Jacobs's
reputation. He was named president of the advisory council for the
breast-implant manufacturing company Mentor, and has presented
techniques at the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
Until his recent troubles started, Jacobs was writing a book, Good
Boobs Gone Bad, on how to correct botched boob jobs. &quot;Everything was
about to be catapulted to the next level instead of being knocked down
like this,&quot; he says. &quot;It's just an absurdity—the whole thing.&quot;

Jacobs may have wanted to take things to another level, but there was
the little matter of 26 malpractice cases that ended in judgments
against him or in settlements over the years. According to Jacobs,
plastic surgeons deal with such settlements constantly, and his track
record is better than some. &quot;No names mentioned, but you look at other
plastic surgeons—some of these surgeons have that in a year,&quot; he says.
But according to the health-care ratings company HealthGrades, more
patients have filed malpractice actions against Jacobs than any other
plastic surgeon in the state; in fact, Jacobs's malpractice rate is 10
times the state average. According to Ken Halperin, a malpractice
attorney with the firm Wingate, Russotti, and Shapiro, that's an
extraordinary figure. &quot;It's extremely unusual,&quot; he says. &quot;I'd be
shocked if there were more than 10 doctors in the state of New York
that had 25 malpractice cases, let alone had settlements against them.
. . . The amazing thing is that he still has his license.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

In addition, Jacobs has numerous lawsuits that have yet to be
resolved. Andrew Rosenbaum has been handling one such case, in which a
patient, who requested not to be named, came to Jacobs for a boob job
in August 2004. According to Rosenbaum, the patient began to notice a
disturbing mass in one of her breasts after the procedure, and worried
that she might have breast cancer. The patient underwent uncomfortable
and expensive scans to investigate the mass, but no one could figure
out whether it was a tumor or not. She spent years with the fear of
death gnawing at her. &quot;After approximately two and a half years of
suffering the discomfort and pain, the psychological fear and the
worry, she had to have a risky procedure known as a needle biopsy,&quot;
Rosenbaum says. When the doctors pulled the needle out of her breast,
he adds, they pulled out a long string of gauze.

&quot;[Jacobs] left a surgical sponge inside her left breast at the time he
closed her up during the procedure,&quot; says Rosenbaum. His client sued
Jacobs last November, and Rosenbaum claims that Jacobs has conceded
liability. (John Rubin, Jacobs's attorney in that case, didn't return
phone calls seeking comment.) But as it turns out, Jacobs has no
malpractice insurance, so Rosenbaum's client may well get nothing for
her terror and pain. &quot;Not only did he perform incorrectly the
procedure—scarred her—to add insult to injury, at this point he's
refused to amicably resolve fairly and justly compensate my client,&quot;
Rosenbaum concludes.

Jacobs's lawyer Kelton confirms that Jacobs practiced medicine without
malpractice insurance, although this is not illegal. Jacobs
acknowledged the incident, but said it was no big deal. &quot;There was
nothing crazy, just some gauze I left,&quot; he says. &quot;We've made an offer.
We made a reasonable offer regarding removal of that. It's just that
her attorney is not negotiating in her best interest.&quot;

At least in that case, the breast cancer was just a scare. Attorney
Mitchell Shapiro is suing Jacobs on behalf of a client who wasn't so
lucky. Shapiro's client, who also requested not to be named, was about
to visit Jacobs in July 2005 for a liposuction treatment when she had
a routine mammogram with another doctor. The test revealed a lump that
looked like breast cancer, and her doctor performed a core biopsy and
sent it to a lab to make sure. The woman then called Jacobs to cancel
the liposuction procedure.

But according to Shapiro, Jacobs didn't want her to do that. &quot;So he
says to her, 'No, let's keep the appointment. I don't think you have
cancer. Come in, let me take a look. I've already got the time booked
for you.' &quot;

Shapiro claims that his client took her mammogram results in, and
Jacobs told her the lump looked benign. But just to be safe, he
removed tissue from her breast, telling her that he had removed the
lump and sent the tissue to a pathology lab for testing. A few days
later, the woman's core biopsy indicated that she had cancer. But
Jacobs's lab reported that she was healthy, with no cancer at all. How
was that possible?

&quot;[Jacobs] missed the lump and sent healthy tissue to the lab,&quot; Shapiro
says. &quot;He did a lumpectomy of healthy tissue, so naturally his lab
comes back negative. . . . So now she realizes that she has to go to a
breast surgeon who specializes in cancer. He looks at her breast and
said, 'What happened?' She tells him, and he says, 'Jacobs should
never have touched you. He's not qualified to do that.' &quot;

Shapiro claims that Jacobs cut such a huge divot out of his client's
breast that by the time the surgeons removed the cancer, there was
practically no breast left; she had to have a full mastectomy. But
that's not what infuriates Shapiro. &quot;If she didn't have that core
biopsy and had just believed Jacobs, she would have done nothing, and
it would have spread all over the place and killed her,&quot; he says.
&quot;What he did was just make her whole experience so tortured. To be
told that she didn't have cancer, and then be told that he's
wrong—it's just disgusting.&quot;

John Rubin was also Jacobs's attorney in this case, and he didn't
return phone calls seeking comment. Again, Jacobs says, the case was
inconsequential. &quot;I've done hundreds of breast biopsies throughout the
years,&quot; he said. &quot;I went in the same spot [where the mammogram showed
a lump], took tissue that felt suspicious. They don't put a label on
it. . . . I didn't claim I got the mass. It's OK to miss, as long as
you say you missed.&quot; As for Shapiro's claim that the lumpectomy
precipitated his client's mastectomy, Jacobs scoffs: &quot;The amount of
tissue I took was less than a dime, all right? So they're blowing
things a little out of proportion here.&quot;

Beginning in 2003, Jacobs's malpractice caseload suddenly spiked, and
his lawyers were handling between three and seven lawsuits a year. In
2006, three women sued the doctor for allegedly jamming oversized
implants into their breasts without their knowledge—implants so large,
the New York Post reported, that they would &quot;eat away&quot; at the areola,
indent the nipples, or deform the sides of the breasts. Jacobs has
denied these allegations and continues to fight them in court. That
same year, a stripper from Las Vegas would file the most sensational
lawsuit of all—and her allegations would become the centerpiece of the
hearing that may cost Jacobs his career.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Brittany Hendricks is what you might call a troubled woman. Her first
abortion was at age 14, and she had a second abortion and a
miscarriage after that. She's seen multiple doctors for depression and
addiction to crystal meth. For several years before meeting Jacobs,
she worked as a dancer at the Spearmint Rhino club in Las Vegas.
&quot;Brittany Hendricks is someone who brings no credibility to the
table,&quot; says Michael Kelton, Jacobs's lawyer. &quot;She's an admitted
crystal-meth user—she uses it virtually every day. . . . She testified
that she tried to shake Dr. Jacobs down for a couple hundred thousand
dollars. She commits a felony virtually every day when she smokes. She
has admitted that she has sent crystal meth through FedEx. This is a
person with a history and a background that offers no credibility to
any of her testimony or her allegations.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Nonetheless, Hendricks was determined to tell her story. She recently
flew to New York and testified at Jacobs's Department of Health
hearing, where she recounted her experiences at the hands of her
former doctor. &quot;Everything I said was true,&quot; Hendricks tells the
Voice. &quot;I wasn't hiding anything to make myself look better. I told
the whole naked truth, as raw as it was—as ugly and stupid and
ridiculous as it made me look, I shared it. Because Brad is really
toying with people's lives. . . . That's why I didn't have any shame
sharing my story.&quot;

Jacobs retorts that Hendricks was high when she spoke before the
health department recently. &quot;She was on crystal last week!&quot; he says.
&quot;She's a blithering drug addict.&quot;

Hendricks refused to go into the details of the case with the Voice,
but last year she testified in a deposition as part of a malpractice
lawsuit that she filed against Jacobs; it was settled in May, with
Hendricks receiving $322,000. (Jacobs claims that his former
malpractice-insurance company chose to settle the case, and that he
had nothing to do with the decision to pay Hendricks.) The portrait
that emerges from her testimony is that of a woman with a drug problem
and low self- esteem who put herself in the hands of a trusted
surgeon. By the time she left his care, she'd allegedly been pressured
to have sex with the doctor and his then girlfriend—reeling from speed
he allegedly provided—and was sporting a deformed, &quot;repulsive&quot; nostril
that ruined her life.

By the summer of 2004, Hendricks testified, she had spent months
talking with Jacobs over the phone preparing for a nose and boob job.
She was worried that her heavy meth use would complicate the surgery
and had quit a month earlier; the withdrawal left her feeling like
shit. But Jacobs seemed friendly, comforting, even spiritual. He
invited her to stay at an Upper East Side apartment that he maintained
(though he lived on Long Island) while she prepared for the surgery .
On June 16, Hendricks arrived at the apartment. When Jacobs opened the
door, Hendricks testified, he was jumpy and amped. As a long-time meth
user, Hendricks knew what was up.

&quot;He was talking kind of fast and he was applying to something, and I
figured out that he was applying, you know, to drugs,&quot; Hendricks says
in her idiosyncratic way of speaking. After a quick hug, she says,
Jacobs asked her: &quot;Is it going to be an issue with you if I party and
you party? Do you party?&quot;

Hendricks says she played it cool. &quot;He was referring to, you know, pot
and crystal meth. . . . In the back of my head, I was thinking,
'Whoa!' But then, in the front of my head, I said, 'Cool!' You know,
because I had gotten sober a whole month before I got there, so it
would have been a hard trip to make, because I wasn't feeling so
great.&quot;

This kind of talk mystifies and infuriates Jacobs. He never suggested
smoking crystal meth, he says, and he doesn't even have an apartment
in the city. &quot;It never existed,&quot; he says, although Hendricks's lawyer,
Lawrence Karam, insists that his private investigator has confirmed
that Jacobs did indeed keep the apartment. As for the speed, Jacobs
claimed that when Hendricks showed up for the nose job, he could see
that the drugs were taking their toll and counseled her to get off the
stuff immediately. &quot;She didn't seem that healthy to me,&quot; Jacobs said.
&quot;I read her the riot act, said she had to stay off the crystal.&quot;

Hendricks testified that Jacobs bounced up to his loft bedroom and
returned with a &quot;quag&quot;—a bong customized to smoke meth. The two took a
few hits of speed, and then Jacobs left to pick up his son. Hendricks
met up with a few friends and spent the night working the quag and
hitting bars till six in the morning. The next day, a bleary Hendricks
showed up for a consultation at Jacobs's office, where she signed a
consent form for the nose and boob job. At some point, she talked to
Jacobs, either in person or on the phone, and told him she'd hit the
quag a little more. &quot;Cool—that's cool,&quot; Jacobs allegedly replied.
&quot;Just save me a little.&quot;

Hendricks was scheduled to go under the knife for her rhinoplasty the
next day, but that night, June 17, Jacobs planned a big party for
himself, Hendricks, and his girlfriend Sharon (now his wife).
According to Hendricks's testimony, the three smoked crystal meth in
Jacobs's living room until 1:30 in the morning, when the doctor
declared it was time to examine her nose and talk about the surgery.
Jacobs examined her breasts and asked what sort of nose she wanted.
Hendricks said she wanted something more refined and feminine. &quot;OK, I
got you,&quot; Jacobs said. &quot;I see what you're saying—I do it all day
long.&quot;

Then it was time for more speed. After hitting another ball or two,
Jacobs and Sharon started having sex, while an increasingly
uncomfortable Hendricks sat on the couch and looked on. As Jacobs and
Sharon got busy, Sharon made a move on Hendricks. &quot;I made a motion to
Jacobs like 'I am not into this,' and he had her stop coming near me,&quot;
Hendricks claims. &quot;I think Dr. Jacobs could tell I was uncomfortable,
though, and he said to Sharon, 'You know, I don't think she is into
girls,' or something like that.&quot; During the deposition, Jacobs's
lawyer asked Hendricks to describe the doctor naked.

&quot;He has a gigantic penis,&quot; Hendricks said.

&quot;Go on, please,&quot; said Jacobs's lawyer.

&quot;He has a really good body. He has a lot of muscle. He is in really
good shape.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

According to Hendricks, Jacobs and Sharon suggested that if she didn't
want to join in, perhaps she could film them. Hendricks agreed and
pulled out her laptop. Using the computer's built-in webcam, she
filmed the doctor and his girlfriend having sex for an hour. But
Hendricks couldn't produce the video for the lawsuit, and claimed that
her hard drive had crashed, wiping out the evidence.

According to Jacobs, the missing hard drive tells you all you need to
know about Hendricks. &quot;Of course it doesn't exist,&quot; he says. &quot;I mean,
hello? Give me something here!&quot; But that's just what you'd expect, he
adds, from a woman who tried to extort $200,000 from him.

Hendricks arrived at the office at 10 the next morning, just in time
for her nose and boob job. But Jacobs was running late, and she had to
wait a few hours.

About a week or so after the procedure, Hendricks returned to Jacobs's
office, and as he removed the bandages, she saw her new nose for the
first time. &quot;It looked a little bit like an Asian nose—and no offense
against Asian noses, but I wanted it to be refined and pretty,&quot;
Hendricks testified. &quot;To me, it was more—it was elongated and chubby,
and it just—it was unattractive on me, and it was nothing like I
pictured, and I was absolutely horrified.&quot;

That night, Jacobs came by the place, gave her a shot of something to
calm her down, and eventually ended up in bed with her. &quot;He just said,
'You can sleep in the bed, you know— I don't bite,' whatever, and I
said OK. So I slept in the bed next to him, and, you know—I don't
know, I guess we started having sex.&quot;

&quot;Was this consensual sex?&quot; asked Jacobs's lawyer.

&quot;I was—I don't know. I mean, it wasn't— he didn't rape me by any
means, but I just didn't really know how to—I really wasn't feeling
like having sex, but I didn't really say anything about that.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Hendricks's nose never really healed properly, she claimed. One
nostril was permanently detached from her face, and when she
eventually tried to go back to work at the Spearmint Rhino, her boss
&quot;made comments about my face and my nose being repulsive.&quot; She
returned to New York for a breast augmentation and touch-up on her
nose the following month, but claimed that when she woke up, her nose
was so cut up and stitched together that she was &quot;appalled and just
disgusted.&quot;

As bizarre and extravagant as Hendricks's story might seem, the New
York State Department of Health is taking her claims very seriously.
In fact, state investigators specifically cited her case when they
ruled in June that Jacobs's practice &quot;constitutes an imminent danger
to the health of the people of this state.&quot;

Jacobs claims that Hendricks's raging meth habit caused her
post-operative complications. &quot;It's the worst possible drug for
healing—period,&quot; he says. In fact, he sent her to a second doctor in
Florida for post-operative treatment. And if she was so unhappy with
his performance, he adds, why did she come back to him for the boob
job a few months later? &quot;This was an unfortunate girl who felt that,
you know, surgical intervention could not only help her self-esteem
but actually achieve something that was unachievable by surgery
alone,&quot; Jacobs says. &quot;She was making undue, I guess, requests or
obligations of me to make her beautiful, when all it was was to revise
her nose. . . . She seemed happy for a time, but her healing was a
little slow, and she wasn't this beautiful princess that she wanted to
become. I did everything I could to help her.&quot;

Jacobs may have paid Hendricks money to go away, but that's not
necessarily an indication of guilt, he says. His attorney Michael
Kelton adds that he's procured dozens of statements from patients who
celebrate Jacobs's work. &quot;People say things like, 'He save my life,'
'He saved my body,' &quot; Kelton says. &quot;People came to him who were
horribly scarred, deformed by bad plastic surgeries. . . . He
transformed them.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

So just who is Brad Jacobs? Is he what so many former patients and
their lawyers claim—a reckless, arrogant man who disfigures women and
takes drugs before dashing off to the office? Or a family man maligned
by ungrateful patients and opportunistic lawyers? Who is the man
behind the lawsuits?

Jacobs insists that his predicament is the result of a few greedy
lawyers who had the names of a few reporters in their Rolodexes. After
one or two lawyers floated a few horror stories in the tabloids, more
and more attorneys and journalists jumped on an easy, lurid story,
until now he's the poster child for bad doctors. He just can't catch a
break. &quot;I'm one of the best plastic surgeons on the planet, and that's
what people don't like about me,&quot; Jacobs says. &quot;My competitors—but a
lot of them are coming to my aid now. . . . This morning, I had a
member of the American Board of Plastic Surgeons on the phone, saying,
'Jesus, we've gotta help you on this.' He called me in support, said I
needed to know what's happening to me is wrong, and offered to help
any way he could.&quot; (An assistant to Alan Matarasso, the doctor Jacobs
cited, denied that Matarasso was a member of the American Board of
Plastic Surgeons, but didn't elaborate further .)

We'll find out what the State of New York thinks of Jacobs shortly,
when the Department of Health rules whether he can ever practice
medicine again. Jacobs claims that the case is going well; his lawyer
has impeached the testimony of witnesses over and over, and he fully
expects to be back at work soon. However, he adds, his reputation and
his family may never recover from the toll that's been taken. Asked
how he was feeling, Jacobs replies: &quot;Distraught. Despondent.
Depressed. Anything else? I have a 10-year-old son who doesn't know
how to look at his daddy anymore.&quot;

On the other hand, over two dozen women claim to have been disfigured
and mutilated by a reckless, arrogant butcher who ruined their bodies
and then cashed their checks. Over the course of at least eight years,
they and their lawyers say, Jacobs hacked his way to the top of his
profession and left a trail of scar tissue in his wake. Brittany
Hendricks is one of these women. She says she's sad to see it come to
this, but she thinks it's time for one of the most famous plastic
surgeons in history to find another line of work. &quot;I think he's a
human being,&quot; she says. &quot;I think he made some bad mistakes. I don't
wish him any ill will. But I don't think he should perform surgery
again.&quot;
