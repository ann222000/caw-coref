Hello,
We've got a few shows this week that we wanted to let you know
about. If you haven't gotten your copy of &quot;Glass Half Full&quot; you'd
better get to one of these clubs and pick one up before they're all
gone.

Wed. Sept. 12th @ Muldoons (Gaithersburg, MD)
If you dig Acoustic Stylee... bring it, copies will be in attendance

Fri. Sept 14th @ Chapala (Burtonsville, MD)
Our first time at this club, we plan on throwing down as usual...
Let's show them what they've been missing. GHF copies will also be in
attendance.

Sat. Sept 15th @ Blue Fins (Gaithersburg, MD)
Jon Blank will be joining Willie for this one, there is a high
possibility of some crowes tunes happening here... Guess what? you can
pick up GHF here too

Short and sweet,
the band
