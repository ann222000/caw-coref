Good morning all:

I am an Irene my son Jacob is in the 4th grade gifted class.

The purpose of this email is to encourage all parents to come to this
evenings LSC meeting tonight at 5:30 room 101.

Although we have been given some assurance that Ms. Williams is going to
be the permanent teacher for the 4th grade gifted, do to personal
experience, I would recommend that we still show our position in the LSC
meeting tonight.

Last week Monday the 10th I was told By Dr. Reece that our class would
have a permanent teacher on the 17th.  My understanding other parents
was also told the same thing.    On Monday the 17th we were greeted by a
substitute.

After approaching Dr. Reece again, she explained that the decision was
made after the PTO meeting on Wednesday the 12th and I was asked why I
was not there. I expressed my dissatisfaction and explained that I chose
not to attend the budget meeting thinking all was resolved, my error I
know.

So parent, I am strongly encouraging you to attend even though we have
been given some side bar promise that it is all clear and we have a
permanent teacher.

My purpose is to show that there is unity in the 4th grade gifted class
as well as in the parent involvement at Pritzker.  United we have power.
After all who will represent our children if we don't?

I was also told by Dr. Reece that she was going to ask the board to have
someone there.  If CPS does have someone there what message will be sent
if only a handful of parents are there?

If you cannot attend tonight please send someone to represent your child
in this endeavor.

Thank you,

Irene

Summary of items regarding teacher assignments for
this year:

1) There will be three full time Kindergarden classes,
with three full teachers.

2) Mrs. Kidd will return to her assistant principal
job, there will be a full time teacher for that class.

3) The teacher who was volunteering her time for,
sorry, I forget which class, will now be hired for
that class.

4) Mrs. Williams will be the permanent teacher for the
4th grade options class.

5) There will not be any split classes in the school.

I hope that this conveys the information that we were
given, with the sense that there will be little
disruption from the instruction and relationships
already formed these first few weeks.  I expect that
formal notices and information will be coming out too,
but I know that if I hadn't been able to attend the
meeting I would have wanted to here something quickly.
I think I got it right, but any mistakes in this
message are solely my responsibility!

Ann
