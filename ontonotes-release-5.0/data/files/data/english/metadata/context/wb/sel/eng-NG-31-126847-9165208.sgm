Five Things Mike Huckabee Doesn't Want You to Know About Him

By John Gorenfeld, AlterNet. Posted November 22, 2007.
Here are five things you probably didn't know about him.
http://www.alternet.org/stories/68397/?page=1
1. Clinton conspiracy theories inspired his biggest mistake.

&quot;Clinton's biggest crime,&quot; claimed New York Post scribe Steve
Dunleavy in 2000, was allowing a Vietnam veteran named Wayne DuMond to
go to prison for 50 years after being convicted -- -- for the 1985
knifepoint rape of the 17-year-old cheerleader Ashley Stevens, a
distant cousin of the Clintons. &quot;That rape never happened,&quot; Dunleavy
said.

By the time Huckabee became governor, it was believed by many on the
Right that DuMond had not only been maimed but also framed by the Bill
&amp; Hillary Octopus. Responding to the pressure, Huckabee said DuMond
had gotten a &quot;raw deal&quot; and wrote to the imprisoned DuMond: &quot;Dear
Wayne, [m]y desire is that you be released from prison. I feel that
parole is the best way for your reintroduction into society to take
place.&quot;

In June 2001, Ashley Stevens heard on her car radio that DuMond -- let
loose by the state of Arkansas -- had beein seized for strangling 39-
year-old Carol Shields in Kansas City, leaving her naked and bound on
a bed. Authorities had also suspected DuMond in the similar rape-
murder of a 23-year-old pregnant victim, Sarah Andrasek.

Huckabee has since sought to pin the blame on a parole board for
freeing the ingrateful DuMond. The next year, however, the Arkansas
Times took home an alt-newsweekly award for a piece, &quot;Huckabee Frees
Career Rapist,&quot; in which numerous inside sources said it was the
governor who made the decision.
2. Win over the Christian Right? He is the Christian Right.

At 15, in a small church in Hope, Ark., young Mike Huckabee came to
the pulpit with a pitcher of grape juice. As he poured water into it,
he cautioned the flock against &quot;watering down the blood of Christ.&quot;
Likewise, after college, Huckabee picked the most fire-and-brimstone
employer imaginable.

Despite Huckabee's undiluted credentials -- as someone who helped to
build the Moral Majority, as a governor who fought to stop gays from
adopting -- he has been slighted by other like-minded Christian
leaders. He's suffered the indignity of watching evangelist Pat
Robertson endorse, in his place, the licentious, pro-choice mayor of
New York, Rudy Giuliani. The buzz is that other Christian Right
leaders just aren't sold on Huck as a safe bet. One reason is that
he's already pissed off other parts of the party's base. For example:

3. If you're a Minuteman, you'll hate Huckabee.

In the world of Free Republic, the conservative internet community,
real Republicans are holding out for a hero to save them from the
Mexican immigrants they believe are trying to establish an evil Aztec
caliphate in the Southwest. Posts one patriot: &quot;Huckabee. He's that
pro-amnesty governor who lost a lot of weight, right?&quot;

One evening in 2005 during the Minuteman craze, Dr. Wesley Kluck, a
pediatrician in the Bible Belt town of Arkadelphia, sat down to e-mail
a plea for help to his old classmate, Huckabee. Years ago, Kluck's
third-grader daughter had proudly announced she was learning Spanish
to talk to a new best friend. The friend's mother, Juanita Hernandez,
got up before dawn to debone chickens for the food giant Tyson Foods,
in a plant along Interstate 65 at an industrial park in nearby Gum
Springs.

But just after sunrise, U.S. agents in khaki uniforms had stormed the
place. They arrested over a hundred workers, stranding 30 children to
fend for themselves.

Around midnight, Kluck tells AlterNet, an email arrived from a
concerned Mike Huckabee, who moved to help the families. He personally
paid $1,000 to help and demanded an explanation from the federal
government. &quot;How is our government benefiting from an abandoned 1-year-
old?&quot; Huckabee asked. His constituents were furious. They called up
the governor's office, swearing at him for helping the Mexicans. The
calls, Huckabee said, were running &quot;1,000 to 1&quot; against him.

Even his worst enemy in Arkansas -- the maverick Arkansas Times editor
Max Brantley, who busted Gov. Huckabee for several ethical violations
involving gifts and cash -- credits Huck with a rare streak of
kindness towards poor immigrants. And that's not all: Huckabee, eating
sandwiches with reporters one day, frankly called some fellow
Republicans &quot;driven by sheer racism.&quot;

So jokes about sending Chuck Norris to secure the border will not be
enough to endear Huckabee to the GOP's nativist wing.

4. He supports a crazy tax plan.

On the one hand, Huckabee has managed to alienate the tax-cuts-for-the-
rich crowd. Big corporations haven't invested in him. The Club for
Growth has run ads calling him too liberal. He &quot;destroyed the
conservative movement in Arkansas,&quot; complains old-school, right-wing
activist Phyllis Schlafly. And one former state GOP legislator, in an
interview with AlterNet, suggests that a lot of people's feelings were
hurt when Huckabee compared them to &quot;Shi'ite Republicans&quot;: extremists
who didn't understand the practical considerations of governing a
state like Arkansas, with its progressive tendencies.

To boost his tax cred, candidate Huckabee has eagerly signed onto
FairTax, a proposal to abolish the IRS touted by Atlanta radio host
Neal Boortz and at rallies nationwide. Boortz would end the income
tax. Instead you'd pay a federal sales tax, and to offset resulting
problems, the government would write you checks every month. How much
you get depends on the number of people are in your household. And
nothing else.

The cash awards, or &quot;prebates,&quot; are supposed to offset how hard it
will be on poor people to pay more for groceries. For the middle
class, it has the allure of the government paying you, instead of vice-
versa, while you get to fire your accountant and throw out your
paperwork, unless of course you're a store owner, in which case you
become neighborhood taxman. Says Huck: &quot;I would like April 15 to be
another beautiful spring day in America.&quot;

Bruce Bartlett, an economics adviser in the Reagan administration, has
accused FairTax of originating in the Church of Scientology, which has
historically seen the IRS as a mortal enemy. For some time the IRS
refused to honor L. Ron Hubbard's pyramid scheme as a tax-exempt
religion, so his acolytes dreamed up an awfully similar plan to
obliterate the agency. FairTax activists, however, maintain that the
resemblance between the two plans is coincidental.

But what's important is whether FairTax itself is workable. Analysts
across the political spectrum have said it isn't. Costs could far
exceed the promised 23 percent sales tax, and possible side effects
include instantly creating a tax-free black market for everything,
screwing up important deductions and punishing older people who've
paid the old way.

5. If you enjoyed the Terri Schiavo case, you'll love the Huckabee
administration.

After Huckabee became governor of Arkansas in 1996 -- he grabbed
national headlines with a governor's intervention that year to block
the state from paying $419 for a retarded 15-year-old girl's abortion,
her pregnancy stemming from being raped by her stepfather on a camping
trip.

Huckabee held up Medicaid payment for the operation. He claimed his
hands were tied by the state constitution, Amendment 68, which
prevented underwriting of abortions unless the mother's life was
endangered. The Supreme Court had thrown arguments from Christian
Right governors like these out before. But Huck held to his guns,
which threatened to end the $900 million annual agreement with
Washington that gave his state medical money, so long as it played by
federal rules.

A compromise was finally reached in which private money footed the
bill. Afterward Arkansas Democrat-Gazette columnist Michael Leahy
accused Huckabee of having played a moralistic version of poker with
the meek, remarking:

We do not need any affable benevolent men playing Supreme Ruler. Maybe
it's the kind of role that a lot of us would slip into if similarly
thrusted into high office. Maybe it's what a lot of people fantasize
about in the shower, the selfish, autocratic things we would do if our
word were law, our prejudices were given full berth, our resentments
were settled -- and to hell with mortals' rules.
