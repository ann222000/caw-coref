The format war between the HD-DVD and Blu-Ray formats doesn't appear
to be over anytime soon... and the fans love it.

The battle for supremacy of the hi-def DVD market has its own brand of
fans on each side, and they're using several different venues on the
Internet to show which flag they're flying. Here's a small sampling of
some recent blurbs from these sites:...

Here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to buy one of those cheaper DVD
players that upgrade the image, and continue buying regular DVDs, and
when the market is settled, I'll buy the more expensive machine and the
HD DVDs to go with it.  A couple of the posts on that site said it's all
a matter of disc space.  Blu Ray holds more space, while another says
that HD stores less information but stores it more efficiently.  Myself,
all I care about is how it's going to LOOK, and from what I can gather,
there won't be a visible difference between the two.  Therefore either
format is okay with me.

Keep in mind, it won't make any difference unless you've got your first
Big Flat, and the cable/satellite/air-broadcast wherewithal to use it--
And even then, upscaled DVD's may look good, but...the HD-network Hi-Def
shows will still look *better*, and darnit, movies on disk are SUPPOSED
to look better than what you get on the free networks!  That's not
riiiiight!  &gt;_&lt;

ATM, the best-rated working players for either format are the game
machines (nobody likes to say it, but it's true), which just happen to
be getting that big holiday push anyway--
And as for X-Box and HDDVD...enjoy that pretty Red Ring of Death.

....DONNNNN'T....YOUUUUU....BELIEVE IT!!!!  &gt;_&lt;

Except for gullible news sources, who were dopey enough to believe that
no Microsoft money changed hands over Paramount's &quot;decision&quot; to adopt
HD, most were ready to hold up Blu's glove and proclaim the war
officially All Over But the Shouting...
And the Shouting, as we heard from tech companies and studios, wasn't
going to be shouted until after the Black Friday holiday sales and the
January CES '08.
(So that we'd have &quot;official&quot; industry figures over low HD-DVD sales vs.
Blu, instead of just &quot;rumors&quot; of them...And FTR, Blu *did* reportedly
paste HD at the first BF07 sales figures, so that's one down, one to go,
until we can get some more of those damn Warner disks we've been waiting
two years for.)

Throw in the HD camp adopting the &quot;weasel&quot; business strategy one would
associate with a Microsoft-backed product, and the &quot;War&quot; has now turned
from just impatience over a Guest That Won't Leave, into a Good Vs. Evil
battle, with nostalgic memories of how DIVx got a minimum of what it
deserved.

...Columnists, do not confuse Patience and Irritated Virtue with
&quot;enjoying&quot; the War.  We're just waiting it out with everyone else until
we can roll the tanks into Berlin.

That's all true.  BUT . . . I don't have to have all that today.  I'll
wait until the dust settles.  It won't matter much that I'll have to
suffer through a couple of months of artificially upgraded DVD images.
And from what you're saying, the wait was going to be even shorter than
I expected.  A conservative guess would be that by next summer, I should
be set up.  Unlike the VHS-vs-BETA wars in the 80s, in which BETA was a
better image, what I'm reading about the two HD formats is, they're
visually the same.  Your current preference would be based on how
important extravagant features are to you.  Me, I listen to commentaries
sometimes, and I watch making-of featurettes if the movie was
particularly good and I want to know more about the FX, but I don't pay
much attention to the bonus game or some such (like the memory game the
MOMENTO DVD had on it; or was that THE LAST MIMZY).  I guess having an
entire season on one DVD would be cool, but multi-disc packs are sort of
cool in their own right.  It really won't matter to me which one wins.
I have no dog in the race, as they say.  Either format is an exciting
improvement, and for now -- once I buy the HDTV -- I can use a cheap
upgrader.  Like MoviePig said below, I'll jump in around $200, too,
which, like him, is about what I did with standard DVDs.  I think my
first machine was a Pioneer $240 unit.  So I can wait.

It's hard to believe you can get standard DVD players -- fairly good

On that last question, I can offer a personal perspective.  Way back
when I longingly coveted and eventually purchased my first VHS deck, I
wasn't having to overbook my evenings trying to keep up with not only
my (few) must-see tv shows, but also the endless, demanding stream of
ordered-to-order dvds typically parked in my in-basket nowadays...

Fine, fine--
Just sayin':  90% of the &quot;What's all the big deal, huh, huh?&quot; whining
we've been seeing tends from those who haven't got the sets yet.
Okay, it's an honest question, but, like most questions, it's usually
asked by somebody who doesn't know.

If you don't have the Big Flat yet....the Format War discussion is not
meant for you.  It never was meant for you.
It's like a discussion on how to tune up a BMW, if all you've got is a
Honda.  It's a discussion aimed, tailored, technically referencing, and
strictly applying to, People Who've Got It, and if you haven't got it,
just talk among yourselves for a moment.  Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

All the rest of us weird people ask the columnists, trend reporters and
general Usenet whine-boiz is, don't even *PRESUME* to know what you're
talking about, if you aren't already getting the hi-def &quot;secret club&quot;
signals already coming over the networks for the last couple years.
(Ever wonder why Jay Leno is in widescreen?...Yyyeah.)
Back in the day, you couldn't explain DVD's coolness to your friends
without just inviting them over, and we can't explain HDTV:  When you
see it...You Will Know.  And you will know how your home theater is to
be tweaked accordingly, just for the simple task of keeping up with it.
And all of a sudden, those &quot;I got an upscaler!&quot; brags will seem so
pitifully, nostalgically innocent.  -_-

That's not a good argument.  Whichever format wins will end up getting
ALL the movies.  The studios will want to sell titles so they'll go with
whatever format wins.  That means that the already exclusive titles, if
they're produced exclusively in whatever the losing format will be, will
have to be manufactured again, under the final format.  That studios are
currently picking sides doesn't reflect on who the winner will be or --
more importantly -- which format is better.  It reflects only that a
studio has been bribed or whathaveyou to produce exclusively films under
a selected format.  That's all it indicates, and isn't pertinent to the
question of image quality.

But I do know what HDTV is, and I've seen it, and if the picture quality

Yes, it was.  I'm a consumer, and as a consumer, that I don't have a
&quot;Big Flat&quot; doesn't exclude me.  When I say it doesn't matter to me which
one wins, it's just as significant as YOU when you say you've clearly
picked a side, and that you've picked that side for no other reason than
your game platform supports it.  That isn't the most convincing

Derek, that argument's so ridiculous -- and trying REALLY hard to sound
snooty -- I'm surprised I have to tell you this.  Those TVs are
everywhere now.  They now dominate the market.  Your argument doesn't
stand, and reflects more a defect in your character than any commitment
to sound thinking.  I've seen the TVs, I've watched the TVs, and your
extremely subjective preference has no technological rationale to it.

&gt; (Ever wonder why Jay Leno is in widescreen?...Yyyeah.)
">

No, I never wonder.  I never watch Leno.  Ever.  As for the rest of
whatever it is you call that mess up there, we DO know what we're
talking about.  YOU bunch of pretentious wannabees need to get your head
out of whatever smelly place you're keeping it, because you're clearly
not watching what the trends are.  HD is HERE -- everywhere -- and
regardless of what your vanity is telling you, you owning an HDTV isn't
at all an indication that you're part of some BMW-driving elite.  From
where the sensible people are sitting -- and MoviePig, with his BIG
FLAT, has weighed it -- it doesn't matter.  You pretentious types seem
to to be sniping at each over which technology is better, and the
particular geeks YOU represent seem to prefer Blu Ray because your PS3
supports it.  Since it's a game deck, and I'm not particularly
interested in game decks, what IT plays is irrelevant to the issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Back in the day, you couldn't explain DVD's coolness to your friends
&gt; without just inviting them over, and we can't explain HDTV:  When you
&gt; see it...You Will Know.  And you will know how your home theater is to
&gt; be tweaked accordingly, just for the simple task of keeping up with it.
&gt; And all of a sudden, those &quot;I got an upscaler!&quot; brags will seem so
&gt; pitifully, nostalgically innocent.  -_-
">

I knew you often go all-out to swallow the camel, but this effort is
even more ludicrous than usual.  I'm going to score this piece among
your stinkers.  The upscaler for us non-gamers is only a temporary
measure until the format war is over.  Those progressive-scan machines
are cheap.  You yourself didn't SELECT one format over the other.  YOU
just selected a game platform that just happens to support Blu Ray, and
now you're posturing that you're part of some technological elite, IN
THE KNOW, based on WISDOM FROM EXPERIENCE.  A more veridical description
would be that you're a juvenile foisting more opinion than (to put it
politely) expertise  -- as callow males tend to do -- while peevishly
snapping the levers on your controller because the discussion is
distracting you, and -- damnit -- where's mom with your peanut butter
sandwich with the crust torn off?  You've added nothing to this debate,
and you've certainly not presented a single argument as to why you
prefer Blu-Ray over HD DVD.  Like I said, based on what I've read from
people seemingly more rationale than you -- and presented without the
panoply -- TO THE EYE, the format doesn't matter.  In the meantime, I'll
sit back and watch you self-titled geeks girl-punch each other until one
or the other group is left standing.  Whichever one wins, ALL the
studios will produce ALL titles under the victorious format.  It seems
like a no-brainer to me.

&gt; Most have been judging on &quot;How many darn studio movies you'll be able to
&gt; get&quot;, and HD has been steadily industry-isolating itself for the past
&gt; year like North Korea.
&gt; The way we pitch it is, Blu is the perfect format for fans who still
&gt; want to be able to watch movies *next* year.  :-P

&gt; &gt; have no dog in the race, as they say.  Either format is an exciting
&gt; &gt; improvement, and for now -- once I buy the HDTV -- I can use a cheap
&gt; &gt; upgrader.  Like MoviePig said below, I'll jump in around $200, too,
&gt; &gt; which, like him, is about what I did with standard DVDs.  I think my
&gt; &gt; first machine was a Pioneer $240 unit.  So I can wait.

&gt; Fine, fine--
&gt; Just sayin':  90% of the &quot;What's all the big deal, huh, huh?&quot; whining
&gt; we've been seeing tends from those who haven't got the sets yet.
&gt; Okay, it's an honest question, but, like most questions, it's usually

&gt; If you don't have the Big Flat yet....the Format War discussion is not

&gt; It's like a discussion on how to tune up a BMW, if all you've got is a

&gt; strictly applying to, People Who've Got It, and if you haven't got it,
&gt; just talk among yourselves for a moment.  Not that there's anything
&gt; wrong with that.

&gt; All the rest of us weird people ask the columnists, trend reporters and

I have a big flatscreen HD set bought this past summer and I much
prefer cathode ray tube sets (I still have four of those, and I'm not
gettin' rid of them).
When push comes to shove I most enjoy watching regular DVDs and VHS
tapes on my 13-inch TV/VCR combo, with the Toshiba code-free DVD
player hooked up to it.
Most of what I watch looks better on it. (Admittedly, many of the new
anime DVDs look great on the big set, which is kind of why I got it in
the first place.)
But I can't say that the cable channels, including the HD ones, look
all that impressive to me on the big set. So many of them look worse
than they did on the CRT set.

I still say that HD is a huge fraud being perpetrated on the public by
the electronics industry and their evil techie collaborators.
( Techies should NEVER be allowed to dictate the directions of
consumer electronics and personal computers; it's like letting the
weapons designers command the military.)
Do we really NEED to see Wolf Blitzer's nose hairs or Katie Couric's
wrinkles? Do I need to see every blade of grass on a piece of astro
turf with such clarity?
No, I don't.

&gt; &gt; want to be able to watch movies *next* year.  :-P

&gt; That's not a good argument.  Whichever format wins will end up getting
&gt; ALL the movies.  The studios will want to sell titles so they'll go with
&gt; whatever format wins.  That means that the already exclusive titles, if
&gt; they're produced exclusively in whatever the losing format will be, will
&gt; have to be manufactured again, under the final format.  That studios are
&gt; currently picking sides doesn't reflect on who the winner will be or --
&gt; more importantly -- which format is better.  It reflects only that a
&gt; studio has been bribed or whathaveyou to produce exclusively films under
&gt; a selected format.  That's all it indicates, and isn't pertinent to the
&gt; question of image quality.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Me, I listen to commentaries sometimes, and I watch making-of
&gt; &gt;&gt; featurettes if the movie was particularly good and I want to know more
&gt; &gt;&gt; about the FX, but I don't pay much attention to the bonus game or some
&gt; &gt;&gt; such (like the memory game the MOMENTO DVD had on it; or was that THE
&gt; &gt;&gt; LAST MIMZY).  I guess having an entire season on one DVD would be

&gt; &gt; Okay, it's an honest question, but, like most questions, it's usually
&gt; &gt; asked by somebody who doesn't know.

&gt; But I do know what HDTV is, and I've seen it, and if the picture quality
&gt; is the SAME in both formats, it really doesn't matter.  That's the
&gt; issue, IMAGE QUALITY.  Is one actually clearer than the other?

&gt; &gt; If you don't have the Big Flat yet....the Format War discussion is not
&gt; &gt; meant for you.  It never was meant for you.

&gt; Yes, it was.  I'm a consumer, and as a consumer, that I don't have a
&gt; &quot;Big Flat&quot; doesn't exclude me.  When I say it doesn't matter to me which
&gt; one wins, it's just as significant as YOU when you say you've clearly
&gt; picked a side, and that you've picked that side for no other reason than
&gt; your game platform supports it.  That isn't the most convincing
&gt; argument.  It sounds to me as if it has nothing to do with your &quot;Big
&gt; Flat.&quot;

&gt; &gt; It's like a discussion on how to tune up a BMW, if all you've got is a
&gt; &gt; Honda.  It's a discussion aimed, tailored, technically referencing, and
&gt; &gt; strictly applying to, People Who've Got It, and if you haven't got it,
&gt; &gt; just talk among yourselves for a moment.  Not that there's anything
&gt; &gt; wrong with that.

&gt; Derek, that argument's so ridiculous -- and trying REALLY hard to sound
&gt; snooty -- I'm surprised I have to tell you this.  Those TVs are
&gt; everywhere now.  They now dominate the market.  Your argument doesn't
&gt; stand, and reflects more a defect in your character than any commitment
&gt; to sound thinking.  I've seen the TVs, I've watched the TVs, and your
&gt; extremely subjective preference has no technological rationale to it.

&gt; &gt; All the rest of us weird people ask the columnists, trend reporters and
&gt; &gt; general Usenet whine-boiz is, don't even *PRESUME* to know what you're
&gt; &gt; talking about, if you aren't already getting the hi-def &quot;secret club&quot;

&gt; &gt; (Ever wonder why Jay Leno is in widescreen?...Yyyeah.)

&gt; No, I never wonder.  I never watch Leno.  Ever.  As for the rest of
&gt; whatever it is you call that mess up there, we DO know what we're

&gt; out of whatever smelly place you're keeping it, because you're clearly
&gt; not watching what the trends are.  HD is HERE -- everywhere -- and
&gt; regardless of what your vanity is telling you, you owning an HDTV isn't

&gt; to to be sniping at each over which technology is better, and the
&gt; particular geeks YOU represent seem to prefer Blu Ray because your PS3

&gt; interested in game decks, what IT plays is irrelevant to the issue.

&gt; &gt; Back in the day, you couldn't explain DVD's coolness to your friends
&gt; &gt; without just inviting them over, and we can't explain HDTV:  When you
&gt; &gt; see it...You Will Know.  And you will know how your home theater is to
&gt; &gt; be tweaked accordingly, just for the simple task of keeping up with it.
&gt; &gt; And all of a sudden, those &quot;I got an upscaler!&quot; brags will seem so
&gt; &gt; pitifully, nostalgically innocent.  -_-

&gt; I knew you often go all-out to swallow the camel, but this effort is
&gt; even more ludicrous than usual.  I'm going to score this piece among
&gt; your stinkers.  The upscaler for us non-gamers is only a temporary
&gt; measure until the format war is over.  Those progressive-scan machines
&gt; are cheap.  You yourself didn't SELECT one format over the other.  YOU
&gt; just selected a game platform that just happens to support Blu Ray, and
&gt; now you're posturing that you're part of some technological elite, IN
&gt; THE KNOW, based on WISDOM FROM EXPERIENCE.  A more veridical description
&gt; would be that you're a juvenile foisting more opinion than (to put it
&gt; politely) expertise  -- as callow males tend to do -- while peevishly
&gt; snapping the levers on your controller because the discussion is
&gt; distracting you, and -- damnit -- where's mom with your peanut butter
&gt; sandwich with the crust torn off?  You've added nothing to this debate,
&gt; and you've certainly not presented a single argument as to why you
&gt; prefer Blu-Ray over HD DVD.  Like I said, based on what I've read from
&gt; people seemingly more rationale than you -- and presented without the
&gt; panoply -- TO THE EYE, the format doesn't matter.  In the meantime, I'll
&gt; sit back and watch you self-titled geeks girl-punch each other until one
&gt; or the other group is left standing.  Whichever one wins, ALL the
&gt; studios will produce ALL titles under the victorious format.  It seems
&gt; like a no-brainer to me.
">

Just to be clear, I do *love* the Big Flat (...or, more precisely, the
1080p flat).  But, yeah, when I'm forced to watch movies on my old
(small!) crt-set, I not only re-acclimatize quickly, but can still
tell visual shit from Shinola there.  All I've said (which I think you
heard) is that the upgrader delivers a picture that removes most of
whatever sense of deprivation I'd feel from not watching a State of
the Art picture.........

.......which, btw, comes *not* from LCDs (like mine and Derek's) at
the moment, but rather from the dreaded plasmas, according to Consumer
Reports.  But, hell, that crown is *always* gonna be a moving target.
E.g., I don't know when further resolution improvement would become
undetectable... but I do know that 2160p would surely look
spectacular, and therefore will happen.  Meanwhile, both plasmas and
LCDs are about to give way to the *vastly* greater contrast-ratio and
color fidelity of FEDs... (although not, it seems, as soon as we'd
like...)

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's all true.  BUT . . . I don't have to have all that today.  I'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; wait until the dust settles.  It won't matter much that I'll have to

&gt; &gt; &gt; And from what you're saying, the wait was going to be even shorter than

&gt; &gt; &gt; important extravagant features are to you.

&gt; &gt; Most have been judging on &quot;How many darn studio movies you'll be able to
&gt; &gt; get&quot;, and HD has been steadily industry-isolating itself for the past
&gt; &gt; year like North Korea.
&gt; &gt; The way we pitch it is, Blu is the perfect format for fans who still
&gt; &gt; want to be able to watch movies *next* year.  :-P

&gt; &gt; &gt; Me, I listen to commentaries
&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes, and I watch making-of featurettes if the movie was
&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly good and I want to know more about the FX, but I don't pay
&gt; &gt; &gt; much attention to the bonus game or some such (like the memory game the
&gt; &gt; &gt; MOMENTO DVD had on it; or was that THE LAST MIMZY).  I guess having an
&gt; &gt; &gt; entire season on one DVD would be cool, but multi-disc packs are sort of
&gt; &gt; &gt; cool in their own right.  It really won't matter to me which one wins. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have no dog in the race, as they say.  Either format is an exciting
&gt; &gt; &gt; improvement, and for now -- once I buy the HDTV -- I can use a cheap
&gt; &gt; &gt; upgrader.  Like MoviePig said below, I'll jump in around $200, too,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which, like him, is about what I did with standard DVDs.  I think my
&gt; &gt; &gt; first machine was a Pioneer $240 unit.  So I can wait.

&gt; &gt; Fine, fine--
&gt; &gt; Just sayin':  90% of the &quot;What's all the big deal, huh, huh?&quot; whining
&gt; &gt; we've been seeing tends from those who haven't got the sets yet.
&gt; &gt; Okay, it's an honest question, but, like most questions, it's usually

&gt; &gt; If you don't have the Big Flat yet....the Format War discussion is not

&gt; &gt; It's like a discussion on how to tune up a BMW, if all you've got is a

&gt; &gt; strictly applying to, People Who've Got It, and if you haven't got it,
&gt; &gt; just talk among yourselves for a moment.  Not that there's anything
&gt; &gt; wrong with that.

&gt; &gt; All the rest of us weird people ask the columnists, trend reporters and

&gt; &gt; ejan ... @verizon.net

&gt; I have a big flatscreen HD set bought this past summer and I much
&gt; prefer cathode ray tube sets (I still have four of those, and I'm not
&gt; gettin' rid of them).
&gt; When push comes to shove I most enjoy watching regular DVDs and VHS
&gt; tapes on my 13-inch TV/VCR combo, with the Toshiba code-free DVD
&gt; player hooked up to it.
&gt; Most of what I watch looks better on it. (Admittedly, many of the new
&gt; anime DVDs look great on the big set, which is kind of why I got it in
&gt; the first place.)
&gt; But I can't say that the cable channels, including the HD ones, look
&gt; all that impressive to me on the big set. So many of them look worse
&gt; than they did on the CRT set.

&gt; I still say that HD is a huge fraud being perpetrated on the public by
&gt; the electronics industry and their evil techie collaborators.
&gt; ( Techies should NEVER be allowed to dictate the directions of
&gt; consumer electronics and personal computers; it's like letting the
&gt; weapons designers command the military.)
&gt; Do we really NEED to see Wolf Blitzer's nose hairs or Katie Couric's
&gt; wrinkles? Do I need to see every blade of grass on a piece of astro
&gt; turf with such clarity?
&gt; No, I don't.

&gt; That's not a good argument.  Whichever format wins will end up getting

&gt; whatever format wins.  That means that the already exclusive titles, if

&gt; studio has been bribed or whathaveyou to produce exclusively films under
&gt; a selected format.  That's all it indicates, and isn't pertinent to the
&gt; question of image quality.
">

That's the historical lesson we're going with:
Yes, Beta was &quot;better&quot;...But it couldn't handle the technical needs for
movies, it didn't stock the movies, it couldn't *get* a competitive
share of studio movies, movies drove the industry, and Beta was lost in
the shuffle.  Here endeth the lesson.

Like Beta, HD spent all its time trying to sell itself as the next
future recordable media, instead of refining its capacity and
corporate-allegiance exposure while the competition went out and got the
commercial studios on its side.
(And as for the capacity issue being a player in the movie wars, we've
already had our first test, when the hyped Transformers HD literally
&quot;didn't have room&quot; for a hiqh-quality audio coding....Ouch.  Didn't help.)

&gt; Anyway, this is the last format war before it's all downloads, so you

Actually, most tech columnists are now proclaiming downloads a sucker
industry--
Unbox was a titanic flop, AppleTV never sold the iTunes store as a DVD
competitor and was brushed aside in the wake of iPod mania (and the box
is now largely treated as a &quot;next Newton&quot; punchline), the industry still
hasn't found a united standard for non-Windows systems, and there's no
example out front to champion.

One of the reasons Microsoft appears so willing to lie-cheat-and-steal
for the cause of HD is that they own their own patent on the coding,
that will also corner the market on downloadable movies, while the Blu
patents are scattered over a number of companies, Toshiba included.
Which explains why MS is the first to distract poor-sales discussions
with &quot;Well, who cares about disks, it'll probably be all downloads
anyway&quot;...Just as long as they can still keep one thumb in the pie.

When I got my first pair of eyeglasses, I could read a billboard ten
blocks away, but everything in front of me was distorted. I walked
down the street and felt like I was walking in a ditch. I went to the
movies to see JACKIE BROWN and I could see every pore in Pam Grier's
face. That's not what I needed eyeglasses for. I told the eye place
and they said I'd get used to it. I told them I didn't want to get
used to it. I made them cut the prescription so everything was a
little more practical. Eventually I went to another eye doctor and got
the right prescription.

There IS a middle ground between HD and smearing vaseline...

&gt;&gt;Yes, it was.  I'm a consumer, and as a consumer, that I don't have a
&gt;&gt;&quot;Big Flat&quot; doesn't exclude me.  When I say it doesn't matter to me which
&gt;&gt;one wins, it's just as significant as YOU when you say you've clearly
&gt;&gt;picked a side, and that you've picked that side for no other reason than
&gt;&gt;your game platform supports it.  That isn't the most convincing
&gt;&gt;argument.  It sounds to me as if it has nothing to do with your &quot;Big
&gt;&gt;Flat.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's like a discussion on how to tune up a BMW, if all you've got is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;Honda.  It's a discussion aimed, tailored, technically referencing, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;strictly applying to, People Who've Got It, and if you haven't got it,
&gt;&gt;&gt;just talk among yourselves for a moment.  Not that there's anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong with that.

&gt;&gt;Derek, that argument's so ridiculous -- and trying REALLY hard to sound
&gt;&gt;snooty -- I'm surprised I have to tell you this.  Those TVs are
&gt;&gt;everywhere now.  They now dominate the market.  Your argument doesn't
&gt;&gt;stand, and reflects more a defect in your character than any commitment
&gt;&gt;to sound thinking.  I've seen the TVs, I've watched the TVs, and your
&gt;&gt;extremely subjective preference has no technological rationale to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;All the rest of us weird people ask the columnists, trend reporters and
&gt;&gt;&gt;general Usenet whine-boiz is, don't even *PRESUME* to know what you're
&gt;&gt;&gt;talking about, if you aren't already getting the hi-def &quot;secret club&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;signals already coming over the networks for the last couple years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;(Ever wonder why Jay Leno is in widescreen?...Yyyeah.)

&gt;&gt;No, I never wonder.  I never watch Leno.  Ever.  As for the rest of
&gt;&gt;whatever it is you call that mess up there, we DO know what we're
&gt;&gt;talking about.  YOU bunch of pretentious wannabees need to get your head
&gt;&gt;out of whatever smelly place you're keeping it, because you're clearly
&gt;&gt;not watching what the trends are.  HD is HERE -- everywhere -- and
&gt;&gt;regardless of what your vanity is telling you, you owning an HDTV isn't
&gt;&gt;at all an indication that you're part of some BMW-driving elite.  From
&gt;&gt;where the sensible people are sitting -- and MoviePig, with his BIG
&gt;&gt;FLAT, has weighed it -- it doesn't matter.  You pretentious types seem
&gt;&gt;to to be sniping at each over which technology is better, and the
&gt;&gt;particular geeks YOU represent seem to prefer Blu Ray because your PS3
&gt;&gt;supports it.  Since it's a game deck, and I'm not particularly
&gt;&gt;interested in game decks, what IT plays is irrelevant to the issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Back in the day, you couldn't explain DVD's coolness to your friends
&gt;&gt;&gt;without just inviting them over, and we can't explain HDTV:  When you
&gt;&gt;&gt;see it...You Will Know.  And you will know how your home theater is to
&gt;&gt;&gt;be tweaked accordingly, just for the simple task of keeping up with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;And all of a sudden, those &quot;I got an upscaler!&quot; brags will seem so
&gt;&gt;&gt;pitifully, nostalgically innocent.  -_-

&gt;&gt;I knew you often go all-out to swallow the camel, but this effort is
&gt;&gt;even more ludicrous than usual.  I'm going to score this piece among
&gt;&gt;your stinkers.  The upscaler for us non-gamers is only a temporary
&gt;&gt;measure until the format war is over.  Those progressive-scan machines
&gt;&gt;are cheap.  You yourself didn't SELECT one format over the other.  YOU
&gt;&gt;just selected a game platform that just happens to support Blu Ray, and
&gt;&gt;now you're posturing that you're part of some technological elite, IN
&gt;&gt;THE KNOW, based on WISDOM FROM EXPERIENCE.  A more veridical description
&gt;&gt;would be that you're a juvenile foisting more opinion than (to put it
&gt;&gt;politely) expertise  -- as callow males tend to do -- while peevishly
&gt;&gt;snapping the levers on your controller because the discussion is
&gt;&gt;distracting you, and -- damnit -- where's mom with your peanut butter
&gt;&gt;sandwich with the crust torn off?  You've added nothing to this debate,
&gt;&gt;and you've certainly not presented a single argument as to why you
&gt;&gt;prefer Blu-Ray over HD DVD.  Like I said, based on what I've read from
&gt;&gt;people seemingly more rationale than you -- and presented without the
&gt;&gt;panoply -- TO THE EYE, the format doesn't matter.  In the meantime, I'll
&gt;&gt;sit back and watch you self-titled geeks girl-punch each other until one
&gt;&gt;or the other group is left standing.  Whichever one wins, ALL the
&gt;&gt;studios will produce ALL titles under the victorious format.  It seems
&gt;&gt;like a no-brainer to me.

&gt; Just to be clear, I do *love* the Big Flat (...or, more precisely, the
&gt; 1080p flat).  But, yeah, when I'm forced to watch movies on my old
&gt; (small!) crt-set, I not only re-acclimatize quickly, but can still
&gt; tell visual shit from Shinola there.  All I've said (which I think you
&gt; heard) is that the upgrader delivers a picture that removes most of
&gt; whatever sense of deprivation I'd feel from not watching a State of
&gt; the Art picture.........
">

I understood that exactly as you meant, that you love your big flat.  I
was only addressing what you said about the images generated from
upgrade players.  Yes, I know that there is a NOTICEABLE difference
between real HD DVDs and a progressive scan DVD player, but it'll
suffice until the war is over.  And that's exactly what I intend to do.
I might not wait until the smoke actually clears, but it'll be close
enough to the end that the who is holding the flag will be obvious, even
from the distance.  It's not like I plan on buying that many more big
titles between now and then.  I'm at my transition phase.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; visually the same.  Your current preference would be based on how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; important extravagant features are to you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most have been judging on &quot;How many darn studio movies you'll be able
&gt;&gt;&gt; to get&quot;, and HD has been steadily industry-isolating itself for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; past year like North Korea.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The way we pitch it is, Blu is the perfect format for fans who still
&gt;&gt;&gt; want to be able to watch movies *next* year.  :-P

&gt;&gt; That's not a good argument.  Whichever format wins will end up getting
&gt;&gt; ALL the movies.  The studios will want to sell titles so they'll go
&gt;&gt; with whatever format wins.  That means that the already exclusive
&gt;&gt; titles, if they're produced exclusively in whatever the losing format
&gt;&gt; will be, will have to be manufactured again, under the final format.
&gt;&gt; That studios are currently picking sides doesn't reflect on who the
&gt;&gt; winner will be or -- more importantly -- which format is better.  It
&gt;&gt; reflects only that a studio has been bribed or whathaveyou to produce
&gt;&gt; exclusively films under a selected format.  That's all it indicates,
&gt;&gt; and isn't pertinent to the question of image quality.

&gt; That's the historical lesson we're going with:
&gt; Yes, Beta was &quot;better&quot;...But it couldn't handle the technical needs for
&gt; movies, it didn't stock the movies, it couldn't *get* a competitive
&gt; share of studio movies, movies drove the industry, and Beta was lost in
&gt; the shuffle.  Here endeth the lesson.
">

But Beta DID have the license to issue movies, and there were in fact at
first just as many titles in Beta as in VHS.  The problem wasn't that
they didn't get the license to issue movies.  It was the that Sony
wouldn't license production of the machines to other manufacturers, as
the inventors of VHS did.  Sony was proprietary, and because of it, they
couldn't' get enough machines on the market and they remained too
expensive.  VHS machines were everywhere, and the prices came down.
They also had variable recording speeds, so you could get six to eight
hours on a tape.  The ability to record WAS important.  Very important,
it seems, because Beta had far superior image quality, and it took VHS
several years to catch up with that, with SVHS.  But by that time, DVDs
were trickling into the market, and SVHS never really caught on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Like Beta, HD spent all its time trying to sell itself as the next
&gt; future recordable media, instead of refining its capacity and
&gt; corporate-allegiance exposure while the competition went out and got the
&gt; commercial studios on its side.
&gt; (And as for the capacity issue being a player in the movie wars, we've
&gt; already had our first test, when the hyped Transformers HD literally
&gt; &quot;didn't have room&quot; for a hiqh-quality audio coding....Ouch.  Didn't help.)
">

I find that hard to believe.  Where did you read that?  If that's true,
that should settle the issue of which is the superior format.

&gt;&gt;&gt;much attention to the bonus game or some such (like the memory game the

&gt;&gt;&gt;entire season on one DVD would be cool, but multi-disc packs are sort of
&gt;&gt;&gt;cool in their own right.  It really won't matter to me which one wins. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;have no dog in the race, as they say.  Either format is an exciting
&gt;&gt;&gt;improvement, and for now -- once I buy the HDTV -- I can use a cheap
&gt;&gt;&gt;upgrader.  Like MoviePig said below, I'll jump in around $200, too,
&gt;&gt;&gt;which, like him, is about what I did with standard DVDs.  I think my
&gt;&gt;&gt;first machine was a Pioneer $240 unit.  So I can wait.

&gt;&gt;Fine, fine--
&gt;&gt;Just sayin':  90% of the &quot;What's all the big deal, huh, huh?&quot; whining
&gt;&gt;we've been seeing tends from those who haven't got the sets yet.

&gt;&gt;phase out plasma sets, and started looking at a nice reliable LCD for
&gt;&gt;half the price)
&gt;&gt;ejan ... @verizon.net

&gt; I have a big flatscreen HD set bought this past summer and I much
&gt; prefer cathode ray tube sets (I still have four of those, and I'm not
&gt; gettin' rid of them).
&gt; When push comes to shove I most enjoy watching regular DVDs and VHS
&gt; tapes on my 13-inch TV/VCR combo, with the Toshiba code-free DVD
&gt; player hooked up to it.
&gt; Most of what I watch looks better on it. (Admittedly, many of the new
&gt; anime DVDs look great on the big set, which is kind of why I got it in
&gt; the first place.)
&gt; But I can't say that the cable channels, including the HD ones, look
&gt; all that impressive to me on the big set. So many of them look worse
&gt; than they did on the CRT set.

&gt; I still say that HD is a huge fraud being perpetrated on the public by
&gt; the electronics industry and their evil techie collaborators.
&gt; ( Techies should NEVER be allowed to dictate the directions of
&gt; consumer electronics and personal computers; it's like letting the
&gt; weapons designers command the military.)
&gt; Do we really NEED to see Wolf Blitzer's nose hairs or Katie Couric's
&gt; wrinkles? Do I need to see every blade of grass on a piece of astro
&gt; turf with such clarity?
&gt; No, I don't.
">

If that's all you watch on TV is Blitzer and Couric, and with such a
nasty attitude about them, I'd say your problem isn't the TV at all.
You're a right-wing nut.  For the rest of us, a beautiful cinema would
make it worth our while.  You sound like you've got a conspiracy theory
too many rattling around upstairs to see what we're really talking about.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The battle for supremacy of the hi-def DVD market has its own brand of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fans on each side, and they're using several different venues on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Internet to show which flag they're flying. Here's a small sampling of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;some recent blurbs from these sites:...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to buy one of those cheaper
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;DVD players that upgrade the image, and continue buying regular DVDs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and when the market is settled, I'll buy the more expensive machine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the HD DVDs to go with it.  A couple of the posts on that site
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;said it's all a matter of disc space.  Blu Ray holds more space, while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;another says that HD stores less information but stores it more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;efficiently.  Myself, all I care about is how it's going to LOOK, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;from what I can gather, there won't be a visible difference between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the two.  Therefore either format is okay with me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Keep in mind, it won't make any difference unless you've got your first

Audio:
&quot;Indeed, I had the opportunity to attend a special 'Transformers' media
event with Paramount late last week, and the question was asked almost
immediately -- why no Dolby TrueHD or uncompressed PCM? The studio's
answer was that due to space limitations on the disc, the decision was
made to limit the audio to Dolby Digital-Plus 5.1 Surround only (here at
1.5mbps). Unfortunately, this confirms the long-held theory that the
30Gb capacity of an HD-30 dual-layer HD DVD disc has forced studios to
choose between offering a robust supplements package (as they've done
here) and the very best in audio quality.&quot;

have to solve first.
Unfortunately, it was the only audience they could target.)  ;)

You also forgot reason #3 that's usually brought up by the disk fans,
ie., that if your DVD player gets hit with a power surge, your living
room disk shelf won't disappear.  ;)

(Right about this time, we usually hear from the download-defenders who
say &quot;Yeah, but I read somewhere, there was gonna be this box with 5000
movies on it?&quot;
At which point those who actually *read* the article pointed out that
the box actually had 5000 TRAILERS on it, all pointing to pay-per-view
downloads.
And as long as studios refuse to learn from the past, anything which
brings up the Ghosts of DIVx is doomed from the start...Why do they even
keep trying??)

I still don't care.  You're not going to download the album for FREE,

downloaded an OLD song (&quot;Suzy Snowflake&quot;; it's that time of year) on
iTunes and it cost over a dollar.  I take it if you download an entire
album of, say, twenty songs at 99 cents each (as you can do at Amazon
now), it'll be about the same amount if you just bought the entire CD.
It might even be cheaper to buy the whole CD.  But you'd be missing the
cool liner notes and the spiffy packaging, all which looks very
attractive and collectable on a shelf.

Never mind, Snarky Harky wanted to make the easy showoff comment, but
went TOO easy, aimed too low, and pretty much encapsulated everything
the public (and most of the PPV-hungry studios) *doesn't* know about the
download industry that's &quot;supposed to replace&quot; DVD's.

First of all, it's not going to be iTunes...Well, maybe if you still
have an AppleTV it is, but one of the main problems the company
encountered was, you were buying a desktop-sized encoding of a standard
signal for the comparative price of the DVD.  Most of the people who
were downloading were downloading for their iPod, but with no hi-def
downloads as of yet, most of the sparse AppleTV product was &quot;To spare
you the trouble of squinting at your iPod.&quot;

If we're talking hi-def downloads that're supposed to make the &quot;stupid
Format War obsolete&quot;, again, those are the hi-def signals that are being
designed for more dedicated living-room machines with high transfer and
huge amounts of hard-disk drive, such as the Tivo (which tried to save
Amazon Unbox), or more specifically, X-Box and PS3's download community.
Large amounts of 40-80G space can be used for longterm storage (see
earlier &quot;Oops, you just lost your movie library!&quot; complaint), and for
the more tech-advanced, USB hard-drives can be attached to backup stored
material.
Unfortunately, if you're storing a 25G hi-def movie, you'd need a
recordable HD or Blu disk to keep it on...Wow, just look at how much
work we're saving to avoid paying $24.95 at Best Buy!  :-D

Of course, this is keeping in mind that this will all be coming directly
from the studios and corporations, with all various mutations of rights
management (such as Hark's own example of iTunes, which would allow him
to be &quot;sneaky&quot; enough to record exactly three CD's before the files
locked)...
But then, to those champions of tech liberty, it's all about the Backup
Copy!  ^_^

(Remember:  It's only studio execs who have no idea how these things
work, and still fantasize about the El Dorado of &quot;People who don't want
to go to Blockbuster&quot;.
It helps an argument considerably if you try not to sound like a studio
executive.)

Well, no. If you buy a whole album, you get a package price -- a full
album is usually 8-9 bucks. +35 cents for a blank CD to burn it to,
should you feel the need.
There's vinyl fetishists out there, and they didn't save the LP.
(Heck, in the late 50s, a guy named Jerry Boussard decided to form a
record label to record &quot;old time&quot; music -- bluegrass and proto-country
and the like -- called Fonotone, and well into the 60s, he was
releasin his records on 78s, because that's how they did in the old
days. There are always peopel willing to support dead and dying
formats.

As to the other, I've got tons of CDs and DVDs -- and gradually, you
realize that no one is paying you to be a library. (As I prepare to
move, I realize just how much stuff I have as I put it into boxes.)

The logical evolution is to some sort of download, whether it's a TV
box/TIVO/VOD set up or over the web. Derek can fulminate os
obsessively as he likes over the idiocy of studio executives and the
failure of DivX, but eventually -- I'd say within fifteen years, it'll
be downloads.

They'll still be making DVDs, just as they're still making CDs, (they
were still making LPs as a viable commercial format into the 90s) but
the movement is towards the disappearance of music and movies as
things you buy as physical objects.

It used to look attractive and collectable on a shelf, now it only
looks like clutter.  Once you get older, you can't read those CD liner
notes anyway.  Everything I get now goes straight onto MP3 players and
an external hard drive.  If the hard drive breaks I'm screwed but I'll
bemoan that catastrophe when it happens.   iTunes is for suckers
anyway.  I go with eMusic.

&gt;&gt;I still don't care.  You're not going to download the album for FREE,
&gt;&gt;and from what I've seen, downloading isn't saving that much money.  I
&gt;&gt;downloaded an OLD song (&quot;Suzy Snowflake&quot;; it's that time of year) on
&gt;&gt;iTunes and it cost over a dollar.  I take it if you download an entire
&gt;&gt;album of, say, twenty songs at 99 cents each (as you can do at Amazon
&gt;&gt;now), it'll be about the same amount if you just bought the entire CD.
&gt;&gt;It might even be cheaper to buy the whole CD.  But you'd be missing the
&gt;&gt;cool liner notes and the spiffy packaging, all which looks very
&gt;&gt;attractive and collectable on a shelf.

&gt; Well, no. If you buy a whole album, you get a package price -- a full
&gt; album is usually 8-9 bucks. +35 cents for a blank CD to burn it to,
&gt; should you feel the need.
&gt; There's vinyl fetishists out there, and they didn't save the LP.
&gt; (Heck, in the late 50s, a guy named Jerry Boussard decided to form a
&gt; record label to record &quot;old time&quot; music -- bluegrass and proto-country
&gt; and the like -- called Fonotone, and well into the 60s, he was
&gt; releasin his records on 78s, because that's how they did in the old
&gt; days. There are always peopel willing to support dead and dying
&gt; formats.

&gt; As to the other, I've got tons of CDs and DVDs -- and gradually, you
&gt; realize that no one is paying you to be a library. (As I prepare to
&gt; move, I realize just how much stuff I have as I put it into boxes.)

&gt; The logical evolution is to some sort of download, whether it's a TV
&gt; box/TIVO/VOD set up or over the web. Derek can fulminate os
&gt; obsessively as he likes over the idiocy of studio executives and the
&gt; failure of DivX, but eventually -- I'd say within fifteen years, it'll
&gt; be downloads.

&gt; They'll still be making DVDs, just as they're still making CDs, (they
&gt; were still making LPs as a viable commercial format into the 90s) but
&gt; the movement is towards the disappearance of music and movies as
&gt; things you buy as physical objects.
">

I don't mind owning the library, whether I'm paid or not.  I don't want
too many layers of technology between my experience and the source
material.  A download is beneficial to the studios only, for which
you'll pay nearly the full price of a hard copy, but the studio won't
have to put out any money for packaging design, manufacture, and
shipping, and the bottom-line being beaucoup profit for a product in
digital space, over which I can never claim a sense of real
proprietorship.  It's like a capitalist's version of communism: the
state doesn't own everything; the corporation does, though you have
access to it from whatever your digital storage device is.  Your
immediate reaction to that statement is that I'm exaggerating, but
there's more of an actuality to it than you at first realize.  If my
favorite DVD becomes damaged in some way, I'll spend about $20 (probably
less) to replace it.  If that digital storage device to which I've
downloaded my media is lost or damaged or malfunctions, my entire
library is destroyed in one fell swoop.  If whatever is stored is
important to me, I'd have to replace it ALL.  I doubt that studios are
going to give me a guarantee of replacement if my device is damaged.

And here's another element I find attractive about hard copies.  There
is a point of being TOO wired, and I like the sense of withdrawing into
my very own space, watching something that I bought OUT THERE but am now
enjoying PRIVATELY, in here.  all of this downloading involves way too
much technology, that is too interdependent with all of that
cross-wiring.  The best analogy is the aforementioned digital books.  I
don't like the idea of having to keep a battery charged for a handheld
screen to read that book.  I want to escape, and be independent of all
technology, deriving a sense of timelessness from my experience, and not
worry about whether the device has enough charge to last a particular
length of time.  That analogy seems remote, but beneath the actual
experience, the feeling is exactly the same.

&gt; It used to look attractive and collectable on a shelf, now it only

&gt; an external hard drive.  If the hard drive breaks I'm screwed but I'll
&gt; bemoan that catastrophe when it happens.   iTunes is for suckers

I'm already older.  I'm 55 (or will be on the 12th).  I find it no more
clutter than I find my books to be.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, and once I've downloaded the album, I can burn the CD for about
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 35 cents.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; John Harkness
&gt; &gt;&gt; I still don't care.  You're not going to download the album for FREE,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and from what I've seen, downloading isn't saving that much money.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; downloaded an OLD song (&quot;Suzy Snowflake&quot;; it's that time of year) on
&gt; &gt;&gt; iTunes and it cost over a dollar.  I take it if you download an entire
&gt; &gt;&gt; album of, say, twenty songs at 99 cents each (as you can do at Amazon
&gt; &gt;&gt; now), it'll be about the same amount if you just bought the entire CD.
&gt; &gt;&gt; It might even be cheaper to buy the whole CD.  But you'd be missing the
&gt; &gt;&gt; cool liner notes and the spiffy packaging, all which looks very
&gt; &gt;&gt; attractive and collectable on a shelf.

&gt; &gt; Well, no. If you buy a whole album, you get a package price -- a full
&gt; &gt; album is usually 8-9 bucks. +35 cents for a blank CD to burn it to,
&gt; &gt; should you feel the need.
&gt; &gt; There's vinyl fetishists out there, and they didn't save the LP.
&gt; &gt; (Heck, in the late 50s, a guy named Jerry Boussard decided to form a

&gt; &gt; should you feel the need.
&gt; &gt; There's vinyl fetishists out there, and they didn't save the LP.

&gt; &gt; record label to record &quot;old time&quot; music -- bluegrass and proto-country
&gt; &gt; and the like -- called Fonotone, and well into the 60s, he was
&gt; &gt; releasin his records on 78s, because that's how they did in the old
&gt; &gt; days. There are always peopel willing to support dead and dying
&gt; &gt; formats.

&gt; &gt; As to the other, I've got tons of CDs and DVDs -- and gradually, you
&gt; &gt; realize that no one is paying you to be a library. (As I prepare to
&gt; &gt; move, I realize just how much stuff I have as I put it into boxes.)

&gt; &gt; The logical evolution is to some sort of download, whether it's a TV
&gt; &gt; box/TIVO/VOD set up or over the web. Derek can fulminate os
&gt; &gt; obsessively as he likes over the idiocy of studio executives and the
&gt; &gt; failure of DivX, but eventually -- I'd say within fifteen years, it'll
&gt; &gt; be downloads.

&gt; &gt; They'll still be making DVDs, just as they're still making CDs, (they
&gt; &gt; were still making LPs as a viable commercial format into the 90s) but
&gt; &gt; the movement is towards the disappearance of music and movies as
&gt; &gt; things you buy as physical objects.

&gt; I don't mind owning the library, whether I'm paid or not.  I don't want
&gt; too many layers of technology between my experience and the source
&gt; material.  A download is beneficial to the studios only, for which
&gt; you'll pay nearly the full price of a hard copy, but the studio won't
&gt; have to put out any money for packaging design, manufacture, and
&gt; shipping, and the bottom-line being beaucoup profit for a product in
&gt; digital space, over which I can never claim a sense of real
&gt; proprietorship.  It's like a capitalist's version of communism: the
&gt; state doesn't own everything; the corporation does, though you have
&gt; access to it from whatever your digital storage device is.  Your
&gt; immediate reaction to that statement is that I'm exaggerating, but
&gt; there's more of an actuality to it than you at first realize.  If my
&gt; favorite DVD becomes damaged in some way, I'll spend about $20 (probably
&gt; less) to replace it.  If that digital storage device to which I've
&gt; downloaded my media is lost or damaged or malfunctions, my entire
&gt; library is destroyed in one fell swoop.  If whatever is stored is
&gt; important to me, I'd have to replace it ALL.  I doubt that studios are
&gt; going to give me a guarantee of replacement if my device is damaged.

&gt; And here's another element I find attractive about hard copies.  There
&gt; is a point of being TOO wired, and I like the sense of withdrawing into
&gt; my very own space, watching something that I bought OUT THERE but am now
&gt; enjoying PRIVATELY, in here.  all of this downloading involves way too
&gt; much technology, that is too interdependent with all of that
&gt; cross-wiring.  The best analogy is the aforementioned digital books.  I
&gt; don't like the idea of having to keep a battery charged for a handheld
&gt; screen to read that book.  I want to escape, and be independent of all
&gt; technology, deriving a sense of timelessness from my experience, and not
&gt; worry about whether the device has enough charge to last a particular
&gt; length of time.  That analogy seems remote, but beneath the actual
&gt; experience, the feeling is exactly the same.

&gt; --
">

Commodity fetishism.

Someday I'll figure out why it is that I can't actually throw a book
in the garbage...

(I'm an abandoner, though -- I've left books on airplanes, in hotel
rooms, on buses, trains and in restaruants. But I can't throw them
out.)

And I still have a couple of thousand of the things, that I keep
because... I have no idea why I feel the need to own all of William
Gibson's novels, or the poetry of William Blake. It's not like I ever
go back to reread them. I don't even feel that I should be going back
and rereading them.

When I finished a five year stint as a classical music reviewer, I had
something like 4000 classical CDs -- literally 70 shelf feet of the
things. That's JUST classical. No pop, no blues, no indigenous
Americana music. (I've winnowed and culled that down to under a
thousand, simply be stripping out the inevitable duplications. I used
to have fifteen or sixteen recordings of the Beethoven Violin
Concerto. I think I've got five or six at this point,mostly because I
have boxed sets by favorite violinists, and they all record the same
repertoire.

I've been culling my DVDs for about a year now,and I still can't part
with things that I can almost guarantee that I'll never watch again.
Early Fassbinder, anyone? (that almost is what holds it there, the
thought that the day after I dump my copy of Love is Colder Than
Death, someone will come along with a big cheque to write that
definitive Fassbinder study....yeah, right.)

But Nick, I'm keeping my Alpha Blues...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, and once I've downloaded the album, I can burn the CD for about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 35 cents.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John Harkness

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still don't care.  You're not going to download the album for FREE,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from what I've seen, downloading isn't saving that much money.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; downloaded an OLD song (&quot;Suzy Snowflake&quot;; it's that time of year) on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; iTunes and it cost over a dollar.  I take it if you download an entire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; album of, say, twenty songs at 99 cents each (as you can do at Amazon
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now), it'll be about the same amount if you just bought the entire CD.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It might even be cheaper to buy the whole CD.  But you'd be missing the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cool liner notes and the spiffy packaging, all which looks very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attractive and collectable on a shelf.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, no. If you buy a whole album, you get a package price -- a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; album is usually 8-9 bucks. +35 cents for a blank CD to burn it to,
&gt; &gt; &gt; should you feel the need.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There's vinyl fetishists out there, and they didn't save the LP.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Heck, in the late 50s, a guy named Jerry Boussard decided to form a
&gt; &gt; &gt; record label to record &quot;old time&quot; music -- bluegrass and proto-country
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the like -- called Fonotone, and well into the 60s, he was
&gt; &gt; &gt; releasin his records on 78s, because that's how they did in the old
&gt; &gt; &gt; days. There are always peopel willing to support dead and dying
&gt; &gt; &gt; formats.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As to the other, I've got tons of CDs and DVDs -- and gradually, you
&gt; &gt; &gt; realize that no one is paying you to be a library. (As I prepare to
&gt; &gt; &gt; move, I realize just how much stuff I have as I put it into boxes.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; The logical evolution is to some sort of download, whether it's a TV
&gt; &gt; &gt; box/TIVO/VOD set up or over the web. Derek can fulminate os
&gt; &gt; &gt; obsessively as he likes over the idiocy of studio executives and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; failure of DivX, but eventually -- I'd say within fifteen years, it'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; be downloads.

&gt; &gt; &gt; They'll still be making DVDs, just as they're still making CDs, (they
&gt; &gt; &gt; were still making LPs as a viable commercial format into the 90s) but
&gt; &gt; &gt; the movement is towards the disappearance of music and movies as
&gt; &gt; &gt; things you buy as physical objects.

&gt; &gt; Hasn't happened with books.  (Nor does it seem likely to ...despite
&gt; &gt; perennial headlines, such as Amazon unloading all fifteen of its
&gt; &gt; Kindles.)

&gt; &gt; Indeed, &quot;collectible&quot; won't sustain a medium, but &quot;convenient&quot; will.

&gt; But then, no one's come up with a more convenient way to read books
&gt; than, well, books.
">

If, by 'read', you mean 'own, store, and transport', then afaics the
same applies to a tiny disc with a movie on it... enough so, anyway.

(Meanwhile, actually *reading* the book has never been all that
convenient... at least according to, say, millions of grade-schoolers
who'd rather fake their book-report by watching the movie.)

How to decimate Potter book sales: release the movie on the same day.

And I'll raise the Dilbert Principle banner, and claim that people will
never, EVER pay for something that's &quot;supposed&quot; to be free.
Start a pay-subscription website if you don't believe me.

Downloads will be popular if there is ABSOLUTELY no other alternative.
(Just as cable-PPV didn't particularly catch fire when VHS rentals were
plentiful.)
But any business system that recognizes the ability to own a movie for
unlimited free repeat viewings will appeal to the &quot;A man's DVD shelf is
his castle&quot; mentality, by virtue of the &quot;Unlimited free&quot; part:

Though years, decades and technologies will roll by, by the very aspect

The difference with CD's being, we don't buy a movie to watch one single
scene, and throw the other 89 minutes of the movie away.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hasn't happened with books.  (Nor does it seem likely to ...despite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;perennial headlines, such as Amazon unloading all fifteen of its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kindles.)

&gt;&gt;(Meanwhile, actually *reading* the book has never been all that
&gt;&gt;convenient... at least according to, say, millions of grade-schoolers
&gt;&gt;who'd rather fake their book-report by watching the movie.)

&gt; would those be the same millions of grade schoolers who had their
&gt; parents camped out for the midnight release of Harry Potter books?

&gt; The problem wasn't the form, but the content.

...So, the Format War is doomed because kids are buying Harry Potter
instead of downloading CD's?  0_o??

You and Dilbert appear to be at odds with, say, the NFL's best minds,
who this past week narrowcast one of the season's marquee games
(Dallas vs. GB), attempting to animate a would-be pay-channel for the
most popular sport in the Land of the (formerly) Free.

&gt; Downloads will be popular if there is ABSOLUTELY no other alternative.
&gt; (Just as cable-PPV didn't particularly catch fire when VHS rentals were

Maybe I'm seeing where I stand as the middle of the road, but...
outside of the likes of this n.g., I'd be surprised if lots of people
actually own triple-digit dvd libraries.  I myself watch very few
movies twice... and those few that I buy to watch (mostly due to
otherwise limited availability) I usually give away.  The nuances of
ownership (by consumers) seems to me peripheral.  I expect the battle
to center more around buyable rentables.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, no. If you buy a whole album, you get a package price -- a full
&gt;&gt;&gt; album is usually 8-9 bucks. +35 cents for a blank CD to burn it to,

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's vinyl fetishists out there, and they didn't save the LP.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Heck, in the late 50s, a guy named Jerry Boussard decided to form a

Ouch. a) I haven't been a &quot;stereo salesman&quot; in five years.  b) Film is
on its way to being an archaic medium, but people still seem to use
it--why?  c) I design and build my own speakers.  This would be
analogous to you becoming a filmmaker.  How long will the world have to
wait?
