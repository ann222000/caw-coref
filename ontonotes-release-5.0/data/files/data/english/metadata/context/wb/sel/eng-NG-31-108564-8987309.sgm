Any interesting claim in Science http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/317/5840/905
that fast earthquakes, which slide faster than 2km per second,
are more destructive than slower quakes.

I was under the impression it was duration, which scales up with
magnitude,
was the most important destructive factor.  A five minute M9 shake
versus a 30 second M7 shake.

The reason that duration scales with magnitude is that it results from
the length of the rupture. The rupture begins at one place along a
stressed fault and propagates the length of the fault. It may take a
long time for the rupture to propagate the length of a long stressed
fault.

For instance, a rupture in the fault at the Cascadia subduction zone
( http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/cascadia.php ) may
take minutes to propagate the whole length. During that time, seismic
waves will emanate from the rupturing point as it travels along the
fault. Imagine the noise a piece of paper makes as you tear it: the
noise is made at the tear point, but lasts the duration of the tear.

For any particular quake or location, the &quot;most important destructive

Mike,

Do you have a link to an article which supports your point of view?

In regard to all things being equal which of the following statements
is true?
A. All natural geysers change their behavior prior to earthquakes.
B. According to Dr. Boohdy the Muslins are slow to embrace science due
to their religious beliefs.
C. The Parkfield Earthquake on 9/28/04 was not a M:6.0.

Rick, upon re-reading your post, I realize that you actually brought up a
more interesting seeming contradiction than I first realized.

First, the Sciencemag URL you provided requires a subscription, but the gist
of the Science article can be found at
http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&amp;articleID;=85763F1C-E7F2...

As you state, duration scales up with magnitude, at least typically. So, for
any given rupture length (and all other factors being equal), a
&quot;super-shear&quot; quake (as the article termed them), with a rupture speed
approximately twice that of a normal quake, would have half the duration of
the normal quake. You infer that the magnitude, then, would be lower in the
super-shear quake due to its shorter duration. I think this might be where
the seeming contradiction to which you refer arises. Though magnitude does
typically increase with duration, it is not BECAUSE of duration. Duration is
not one of the parameters. I know you know this, Rick - I'm just trying to
lay out the problem logically.

Ultimately, all earthquake magnitude scales attempt to measure the energy
released in a quake. There is no reason to believe that a 100-km long fault
segment rupturing at high speed would release less energy than the same
segment rupturing at half that speed. Moment magnitudes, for instance are
derived from 3 factors only, none of them concerned with speed of rupture.
Those factors are the shear modulus of the rocks involved, area of rupture
(length X width), and the average displacement.

For our hypothetical 100-km super-shear rupture those factors would all
remain equal. But, how could a super-shear, then be MORE destructive? As you
point out, duration is an important factor in destructiveness. This is
because the force, or acceleration and amplitude, of the shaking tends to
max out at a fairly low magnitude, leaving only duration to vary. The
article seems to suggest that in super-shear quakes the maximum acceleration
exceeds that value found in normal quakes, and does so sufficiently to more
than offset the reduced duration.

So, all other factors being equal (rock modulus, rupture area, total
displacement, site conditions), the super-shear rupture will last about half
as long, and be more destructive in spite of its short duration due to the
higher &quot;intensity&quot; of the resulting motions.

The Scientific American version of Rick's article mentions a few other
interesting aspects of super-shear ruptures. As of now, the phenomenon only
is observed on strike-slip faults. It is thought that super-shear rupture
can only occur along fairly straight sections of a fault, stopping at major
bends. The article suggests that the 1906 San Francisco quake was more
damaging than its magnitude would fully account for, and that super-shear
may be responsible for the difference.

I am an amateur, and would welcome either corrections or approval from
professionals regarding the above!

&gt; &gt; Do you recall how C attacked you the first time I invited you to you
&gt; &gt; know where?

&gt; But if you'll recall, I broke the rules of her board.

&gt; Which of us is still there, and which isn't? I wonder why that is?

&gt; &gt;  Well, the same thing happened here seven years ago,

&gt; There are no rules on usenet, at least not in the way you imagine
&gt; there should be.

Brian,

While the world awaits intelligence, he's out at the airport.  Today
there are so many important issues on the table and people like him
fail to recognize them.  I mean in Peru today they've changed the
constitution to afford a takeover after the earthquake.  Now if you
can't imagine that happening in California, you best think again.

Remember, after Katrina and Rita FEMA dropped the ball on thousands
who were stretched out across America and it was up to the States to
absorb the costs of their recovery.

We should learn from other victims that what we think is firm and
solid doesn't depend on the speed of an earthquake, just that one
arrives and it changes their lives and the lives of their countries
sometimes forever.

Several thoughts come to mind:

First and foremost, nice dance/change of subject. So to make
the point, I was kicked off because I crossed a line, and I
knew it. But I was trying to make a point. I was allowed back
on after apologizing.

Second, it wasn't just FEMA that dropped the ball AFTER Katrina.
What about the myriad of dropped balls BEFORE the hurricane?
Those were dropped by the locals AND the residents. It's not
like they didn't know what would happen if such a storm struck.
Numerous studies showed that what could happen was EXACTLY
what DID happen. Instead of preparing for the worst, they stuck
their heads in the sand.

Third, you can't fix what doesn't WANT to be fixed. See point
2 above. Given that, the solution is not socialist style forced
action. If people are too stupid to vote for funding on the
necessary preparations when they are proposed, or to vote for
representatives to act in the best interest of the voters, then
they get what they deserve. One of the prices of freedom is that
people are free to make bad choices.

Fourth, I'll bet that California is far more prepared for a
major earthquake disaster than Lousiana was for Katrina, anyway.

&gt; For our hypothetical 100-km super-shear rupture those factors would all
&gt; remain equal. But, how could a super-shear, then be MORE destructive? As you
&gt; point out, duration is an important factor in destructiveness. This is
&gt; because the force, or acceleration and amplitude, of the shaking tends to
&gt; max out at a fairly low magnitude, leaving only duration to vary. The
&gt; article seems to suggest that in super-shear quakes the maximum acceleration
&gt; exceeds that value found in normal quakes, and does so sufficiently to more
&gt; than offset the reduced duration.

&gt; So, all other factors being equal (rock modulus, rupture area, total
&gt; displacement, site conditions), the super-shear rupture will last about half
&gt; as long, and be more destructive in spite of its short duration due to the
&gt; higher &quot;intensity&quot; of the resulting motions.

This is exactly right - it is the magnitude (technically, the moment
magnitude) that captures the size of the overall motion in an
earthquake.  So halving the duration of a given magnitude event does
not effect the amount of energy released much.  Actually, a hidden
property, the absolute stress against which the fault is moving,
matters, but I'll ignore that.

Changing the rupture velocity doesn't change the amount of energy
much, but it does change how it is radiated.  My impression is that
rupture velocity near the shear wave speed is actually the worst case
- a very strong S or Love wave pulse is radiated directly in the
direction that the rupture is propagating.  Super-shear rupture
velocities send more energy out to the sides, but do not generate the
forward-directed &quot;directivity pulse&quot;.  Rupture velocity much slower
than the shear wave velocity generates less shaking, and perhaps more
(harmless to people) heating on the fault surface.

So which is more damaging partly depends where the cities lie relative
to the fault, rupture direction, and style of faulting (my comments
apply only to strike-slip faults).
