DD and I are going to make an appointment with the wedding reception planner
at the local country club.  I have the package plans but I have no clue what
to look out for in the pricing and selections.  Does anyone have any hints,
suggestions or pitfalls to avoid?  The reception will include alcohol.  DD
has basically looked at it all and thought...hey that looks good and wanted
to do it all by email.  I'm a bit more skeptical and want to meet her in
person and talk things over face to face.  DH thinks all this is foolish, so
the $$ is going to be a bone of contention to some extent.  Maybe I should
say, he'll gripe about it and do whatever we come up with.  She and I aren't
over the top extravagant types, so he doesn't have to worry about going into
the poorhouse.
So?  What have you done that you wish you hadn't.....or had??  I'm
listening.
Thanks.

I have NEVER done anything like this, but I would probably get an itemized
list of all the costs and then shop around and see if you can do better on
the prices- liquor comes to mind as a biggie with a huge mark-up.  I am
fascinated with anything calla lily and have stumbled across some really
pretty wedding thingies of all sorts on eBay.  You may not like calla
lilies, but just an idea that there's a LOT of stuff out there.  Anything
you can do yourself without getting your stress level out of sight will save
some money and possibly personalize the wedding more than their 'stock'
wedding packages.  Just a thought.

Have fun- I do not envy you having to pull all the details together.  We've
all heard about the wedding that was planned down to the final tiniest
detail and then they realized, at the last minute, that no one ordered the
flowers or the cake or something that was really, really necessary!  I do
know bridal gowns have to be ordered plenty in advance- and then you pray
for months until The Wedding Day that the bride doesn't gain or lose weight!
No, I do NOT envy you one little bit.  VBG

I arranged my own wedding and I was terrified of overspending.  I tried
to save on almost everything.  I wish now that I hadn't in some areas.
Nuff said (from my point of view - it's all a bit sad-making).

Thanks a lot Leslie!  It sounds like we are cut from the same cloth.  There
won't be much flexibility with the venue...but maybe some.  We don't have a
lot of choices in our smallish town, and DD has picked a place she had loved
since it opened.  We probably have to work within a package....but the
package CAN be customized...(though probably customized UP!)
This will be a Christmas time wedding, so we'll probably have a built in
&quot;theme&quot; to some extent.  Either Christmas (though I don't really like
poinsettias) or &quot;winter&quot; with some Irish touches thrown in.  The groom is
proud of his Irish ancestry.   It should be fun....with the exception of the
grumpy father of the bride (DH).  The less we give him the details, the
happier he'll be.  Maybe it's a good thing I do the accounting around here.

When our kids got married (one son, one daughter) we decided what we
wanted and could afford to give them for the wedding. I also bought DD's
dress. Then it was up to them to either plan a wedding within that
amount or come up with the rest of the money themselves. In both cases,
both members of the couple had good jobs and money was not a real
problem for the other parents. DD made a budget and they came in under
budget overall. They did go over budget on photos, but made up in other
areas. DD made her invitations and centerpieces. I'm not sure she saved
anything on invitations, but had nice, unique invitations. Her
centerpieces were paper lanterns that with a votive candle in the
center, set on a round mirror. We took the flowers from the church to
the reception site, so they got double use. Unfortunately the holidays
are probably not a good time to try to get a good price, because
facilities are usually pretty busy with holiday parties :(. Don't get
too stressed; after all it's only a wedding. The marriage is the
important part.

This is YOUR WEDDING....NOT the Bride, not the Groom......YOUR Wedding. do
NOT let him say' Whatever YOU like (some things are ok for you to
decide--but the majority should be a TOGETHER ok.)

Go over the Guest List very carefully, have food that you both LIKE
(caterer? TASTE TEST it first,  same with the cake): make sure the Florist
writes the person's name on each corsage, boutonniere, etc (PLEASE be sure
that neither of you are allergic to what you carry/wear), : IF you get your
shoes 'dyed' make sure they can be RE-DYED; check to see if there are any
Hotels that will give a discount to your traveling wedding guests, rental
Hall fees......include insurance?: music that you BOTH like---both for
church and reception. (Guarantee money back if the band gets sick and you
have to bring your 'record player' at the last second?); Honeymoon plans
where you BOTH want to go: Reservations ahead of time, etc.
These are just off the top of my head........did a LOT of Wedding Bouquets,
worked with a  LOT of brides, brides and grooms, Brides' Mom cause DD was
'in college, works outta town, etc.

Seen and heard of a lot of &quot;OOOOPSSSS, we forgot to&quot;..........

SET A BUDGET and know that you WILL spend more. It's been about 20 years
since I last helped plan a wedding so I can't help with any pricing.

After the Wedding, a NICE touch would be writing a TY note to the ppl that
made your day EXTRA Special.

Sis got married the Day after Christmas. Church was already decked out so
that saved a bundle. We wore red velvet dresses and the flower girl wore
green and carried a single red poinsettia on a white 'muff'. Bride carried
red roses. Aunt lent her a fur stole---it was winter in the middle of
Northern MI....cold.....snow......

Flowers that come to mind: Carnations always look lovely with pine greens
(roses will be very expensive because of the Rose Parade and Christmas),
Spider Mums  and button mums for a delicate look, and either white static or
baby's breath. Type in Christmas Flowers for a few more ideas..and give you
a price range.

Now those are the kinds of tips I want to hear.  &quot;Name on the
flowers.&quot;...who knew?  Not me.
A hotel runs the country club venue we are booking.  So the food will be
from them and they even include the cake from a nice bakery in the package,
as well as discounted rooms to reserve.  It's the &quot;ooops, we forgot&quot;  that I
want to know about.  I have enough oops in my usual days!

We managed to pull off a nice wedding for our daughter despite the
fact she
came from a long line of elopers who didn't know squat about planning
a wedding, ha.
One suggestion, keep your sense of humor, and find time to
watch &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;.
I suppose the one thing I learned was one of the most important
contracts is the photographer. I sure wouldn't scrimp on this one
if I had it to do over.
Congratulations!

What would I have done differently?  Gotten a professional
photographer.

We used a family member who had won awards for her spot photography
(flowers, hot air balloons, kids playing, etc.).  She was
uncomfortable with the job, and we really should have taken that as a
delicate refusal.  The photos we have are okay, but I know I would
have been happier with a professional wedding photographer, even if we
had to pay off the expense for months.

My opinion:  do what the couple want to do and don't skimp on the
things they think are important. Your guests are going to take their
cues from how happy the bride and groom are. If they're smiling and
enjoying themselves, then so will your guests. If they're fretting
over whether or not they're going to run out of cake/the flowers
aren't what we really wanted/they're overcharging on mixed drinks,
etc., etc., etc., then the guests will be uncomfortable, too.

And plan to schedule several hours just before the big day for you to
utterly pamper yourself; spa trip, massage, a romantic dinner,
whatever. You'll need the chance to de-stress.

&gt;&gt; &gt; This is YOUR WEDDING....NOT the Bride, not the Groom......YOUR Wedding.
&gt;&gt; &gt; do
&gt;&gt; &gt; NOT let him say' Whatever YOU like (some things are ok for you to
&gt;&gt; &gt; decide--but the majority should be a TOGETHER ok.)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Go over the Guest List very carefully, have food that you both LIKE
&gt;&gt; &gt; (caterer? TASTE TEST it first,  same with the cake): make sure the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Florist
&gt;&gt; &gt; writes the person's name on each corsage, boutonniere, etc (PLEASE be
&gt;&gt; &gt; sure
&gt;&gt; &gt; that neither of you are allergic to what you carry/wear), : IF you get
&gt;&gt; &gt; your shoes 'dyed' make sure they can be RE-DYED; check to see if there
&gt;&gt; &gt; are
&gt;&gt; &gt; any Hotels that will give a discount to your traveling wedding guests,
&gt;&gt; &gt; rental Hall fees......include insurance?: music that you BOTH
&gt;&gt; &gt; like---both
&gt;&gt; &gt; for church and reception. (Guarantee money back if the band gets sick
&gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; you have to bring your 'record player' at the last second?); Honeymoon
&gt;&gt; &gt; plans where you BOTH want to go: Reservations ahead of time, etc.
&gt;&gt; &gt; These are just off the top of my head........did a LOT of Wedding
&gt;&gt; &gt; Bouquets, worked with a  LOT of brides, brides and grooms, Brides' Mom
&gt;&gt; &gt; cause DD was 'in college, works outta town, etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Seen and heard of a lot of &quot;OOOOPSSSS, we forgot to&quot;..........

&gt;&gt; &gt; SET A BUDGET and know that you WILL spend more. It's been about 20
&gt;&gt; &gt; years
&gt;&gt; &gt; since I last helped plan a wedding so I can't help with any pricing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; After the Wedding, a NICE touch would be writing a TY note to the ppl
&gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt; made your day EXTRA Special.

Great advice!  Thanks!  I don't anticipate this being horribly stressful.
Both DD and I are rather laid back, which can hinder good planning actually.

Our own reception - many decades ago - surely didn't go as planned.  We had
a professional photographer at the church who had a long list of pictures he
wanted to make and we had lots of family that demanded that he take pictures
of great-aunt Bessie (who had just celebrated her 95th birthday) and little
Priscilla who had just turned two and did look precious . . . you've got the
picture.  Anyhow, the bridal party arrived at the reception more than an
hour late because of the massive photo-op taking place at the church.  By
the time we got to the reception, the other guests were weary and ready to
go their ways.  I don't know yet what would have been the solution.  Polly

At my nephews wedding, the photographer set up in the church basement quite
a bit before the start of the wedding.  Family had been invited to the
church early for some snacks and, as it turned out, to have pictures taken
with the photographer.  Only problem was....for some reason my family didn't
get the message.  We haven't had a formal sitting done since the kids were
little.  It would have been a great opportunity to get one.  Sigh.  I'm sure
it is a nice way for the photographer to sell some extra pictures...just
need to get the word out that he's taking EVERYONE'S picture!   A neat
idea... maybe it would have been the solution fot the Great Aunt Bessie
issue.

Ditto on the Photographer but get one that is WELL KNOWN. Bro had one that
NEVER EVER gave them their photos. He skipped town (divorce) and Months
later someone found boxes and boxes of photos out in the dump totally ruined
by the weather by the time they were found.
We had my Uncle---he was good and greatly ENJOYED what he was doing. The
photos show it as   'a lot in the moment' that most Pro's wouldn't have
gotten . (One of My Grandmother dancing with my Sis-we are the ONLY Wedding
she danced at in years and years-Pro wouldn't have known that)
Niece had a friend that did a video-4 hours long! What a gift.
Photos that are rarely seen are of both the Bride and the Groom getting
ready beforehand. Florist delivering the flowers, cake being set up......all
those things that 'make' a Wedding.

What happens if the wedding gets canceled? it DOES happen.....what all will
you have to pay for? Will you get ANY deposits back?

MAKE SURE the 'hall, church. etc' has NOT been booked---or the church with
back to back weddings.......Photog won't have time to take those church pics
if it is.

MAKE LISTS AND MORE LISTS.........tape them INSIDE a cupboard door so
someone doesn't pitch them cause *I* didn't know what they were.

Make sure your SHOES FIT........Sis bought ours downstate and we didn't get
to try them on until the DAY of the wedding......OUCH OUCH OUCH all day. (I
had 2 pair for mine---Church ones and reception ones as it rained and rained
that day so I was GLAD to get out of wet shoes)

IF she has a 'train' on her gown have the dressmaker fix it so she doesn't
have to 'carry it' at the reception. it'll wear her out and be in the 'way'
when she's dancing (ask how I know-didn't then)

All I can think of right now.

yes, check the Photographers referrences. Ask for other Brides' names
and phone numbers to check to see if they were satisfied. Also, he/she
should have an established studio. You'll be able to see his/her work
on the walls.
Another thing i wouldv'e done better is to make sure the bride has no
stress on the morning of the wedding. If you've ever seen &quot;My big fat
greek wedding&quot; that was mine...only Italian, and louder!  =) i can &lt;G&gt;
now but back then, i was so tense, it was aweful. what i wouldv'e
really liked was a bubble bath, the hairdresser to be on time and a
super cup of cocoa.
also--make sure the best man doesnt get the groom drunk the night
before. that's a whole other story....&lt;G&gt;

We had our pictures taken before the ceremony, before the guests
arrived. We still had to deal with snapshots later, but that wasn't too
bad. It does help a bit, though it means the groom sees the bride before
the ceremony. Both our kids did it the same way.

When DD and I were interviewing photographers, she recognized brides in
almost every sample book. I knew the mother of one and called her. She
said they had used that photographer for their oldest daughter's
wedding. When the second one got married, they didn't even consider
anyone else. DD went with that photographer and we weren't sorry.

Okay, so I'll echo the photographer thing. Get a good one. My Dad wanted
to save a little money (in all fairness, he didn't have that much), so
he hired a friend of a friend. Umm ... this guy should have practiced
how to load his camera so that the film (pre-digital days) would
actually wind. :S We have *no* wedding photos, except those taken when
we restaged part of it for that express purpose.

Keep in mind that the wedding, while your expense, is actually for the
bride and groom. They should be able to make the decisions, as long as
those decisions fit in with the budget -- which they should be informed
about ahead of time. Both of my DDs had lovely weddings, but neither was
what I'd have chosen -- that's fine, since they were not my weddings.
&lt;G&gt; We gave them each a budget, and they stuck to it and had what *they*
wanted (the DDs and their honeys).

Howdy!

Husband used to take wedding photos, professionally.
What a circus!   If this is at a church, ask if they have a wedding
coordinator; she/he usually knows everything, and is worth a nice
little gratuity $$.  Might also recommend a good photographer.
In our case,  he took the portraits &amp; all the must-have photos,
I skipped around in the background w/ the 35m camera taking &quot;snaps.&quot;

Here's a couple of tips:

Tell the photographer what you want (have a contract!), how long you expect
him/her to stay at the reception, agree on the length of his/her service
time, have him/her check out the wedding site ahead of time, if it's
just showing up a couple of hours before the ceremony to look over
the room(s), because (s)he will be there early anyway to get those
group photos done*

Have a list.  You can not possibly remember all the photos you will
want later.  One bride didn't put &quot;bride w/ groom&quot; on her
list, wouldn't stand still long enough for the photographer
to take that all-important photo (she was too busy bossing
everyone); we re-staged that photo 2 weeks later, she still had
the dress &lt;g&gt; &amp; he rented a (better) tux.

Have the photographer speak to the preacher -- to find out what is NOT
allowed in the service, or in the church (no flash? no walking
around in the sanctuary during the service? no interruptions?);
the preacher/judge/pronouncer usually knows where the best spots
are for the best photo ops

*Take LOTS of those group photos BEFORE the service.
Before the crowds arrive (don't want to spoil the Surprise!).
While the bride is prepping (primping) in the bridal room/parlor
or wherever, the groom &amp; his men(usually) can gather in the sanctuary
or judges chambers (whatever) w/ the family(ies) for those
once-in-a-lifetime pics; groom w/ parents, grandparents, attendants,
in-laws, great-aunt Bessie, who ever; do these BEFORE the service.
Then have the groom's party shuffle off into the catacombs while
the Bridal Party comes into the sanctuary/chambers for the same
treatment.   Including flower children/petal throwers &amp; ring bearer.
This will save time &amp; get everyone to the reception before the guests
have drunk all the champagne.

Give the photographer GOOD, really GOOD directions to the reception area.
Give the photographer a head start to get to the reception BEFORE the
bride &amp; groom.

Don't over-do the party.  Some brides (or their mothers) want to add every
cute idea they ever heard of, include every detail &amp; new tradition
--and it's just too much.  If you're a laid-back type of bride, try to
keep the service, ceremony, shindig as laid-back as you can.  No one
will remember how many candles you lit (&amp; the photographer probably
isn't allowed up on the podium steps or behind the communion table to
get a picture of this extra performance) or realize that the groomsmen's
cummerbunds matched the bridesmaid's varying shades of pink-to-pale rose
bouquets (I was a church's wedding coordinator for a couple of years,
god help me) -- &amp; no one can tell the difference, anyway.  Details like
this will drive you crazy.

Agree ahead of time to NOT smash the cake into each other's faces.
This isn't funny anymore.  Nor is it pretty, as the photographs will
show.  Often the newly weds get pissed off over this stupid little
trick, and having their first married-couple fight during the reception
is not very attractive, either.  &lt;g&gt;    *click*snap*whir*: pictures!

And, finally, IF you want that same professional photographer to take the
Bride &amp; Groom Depart the Party pics, either pay him/her extra to stay
for the whole shindig, or get the couple moving out the door before
the photographer wilts from the long wait.  &lt;g&gt;
Otherwise, have a back-up plan, another photographer or 3 to hang around
&amp; take the Going Away pics.

Relax.  Have fun.  It's just a wedding: people have them all the time. &lt;g&gt;

R/Sandy -- after the 50th wedding they all start to look alike  &lt;VBG&gt;
p.s. dipping large, fresh strawberries in chocolate was a courtesy
I extended once--and never tasted a single one! -- but we got them to
the reception upstairs in time for the party -- details!

This is great!  I'm so glad I asked this OT question!  I suppose we could
buy some Bride's magazines and planners, but I thought it would be best to
go to the experienced sources first!!   I have a folder in which I'm saving
all these notes.

My son and his Lady Love were married at the end of this August and the
three things that *I* thought worked out extremely well and contributed to
an occasion that turned out exceptionally nice were........

LIMITED ALCOHOL:
As guests entered the reception there were servers with trays with glasses
of champagne and sparkling cider......Guests were offered ONE glass of one
or the other as they came in the door. During and after dinner guests were
kept served at the tables with coffee, tea (iced or hot), choice of soft
drinks or sparkling cider. After dinner, just before the cake cutting
(which, BTW, did NOT include the &quot;face smash&quot;) waiters again circulated with
trays of champagne and sparkling cider announcing the cake cutting and the
couple's first dance and that toasts to the couple were about to begin,
offering the glass of choice of either beverage to each guest. There was a
bar with a bartender set up but people paid for their own alcoholic
beverages other than the two glasses of champagne offered. Soft drinks at
the bar were free. Not one complaint was heard from anyone that I know of
(Especially the staff at the restaurant and the manager, all they could talk
about was what a wonderful, fun, polite crowd and what a pleasure it was to
work.) I asked quite a few people later on what they thought about the lack
of free flowing alcohol and there still weren't any negative comments,
mostly what I heard was that it was *SO* nice there weren't any of the
usually &quot;drunken incidents&quot;.  There was a lot of dancing, laughter, mingling
and milling about talking and the lack of alcohol induced hi-jinx didn't
seem to put a damper on any of the festivities.......it also cut down
immensely on cost.

PHOTOGRAPHS:
They chose their PROFESSIONAL photographer carefully, asking a lot of
people -not those names given to them by the photographer- for their
recommendations and she (the photographer they chose) was wonderful. She
took all the &quot;stock pictures&quot; before and during the wedding ceremony, then
went to the reception and left after the first dance and cake cutting were
over. The reception continued 4 hours after that. There were two disposable
cameras on each table. These were from the company  &quot;I Thee Snap&quot;
www.itheesnap.com NAYY  After the reception the cameras were gathered up
and mailed off to this company who then put all the pictures up on their
website. You can download what you want for free or order a full CD to be
mailed to you. The wedding couple gets all for free as part of the cost.
There was an &quot;I Thee Snap&quot; business card tied to each favor on the place
cards at the tables with the web address and code to enter the 'wedding
album'. If you went to the website before the pictures were up they asked
for your email and sent a notice when the pictures were posted. Now those
were some really great candid pictures........especially one that was taken
under a table with all the gals having their shoes off!  LOL I honestly
think this company has come up with one of the best ideas since sliced
bread......again, NAYY.

MUSIC:
A collectively universal *very positive* comment was made about the music.
They had chosen a quartet (electric violin, bass fiddle, electric guitar and
piano) and my son made it VERY CLEAR to them that the speakers (amps) were
to be kept turned DOWN and it was added in to their contract that if the
volume was not to his specifications they would not get paid...and he
insisted that addendum was signed by all members of the quartet. They played
a wonderful assortment of music (from 40s big band to current rock) and
there was a lot of dancing BUT, those at the tables or standing in groups
*talking* didn't have to scream and shout at each other to be
heard.......that alone got as many positive compliments as anything. It also
got the band a pile of tip money and future bookings. Obviously people of
all ages enjoyed them for the wonderful music and the lack of ear drum
shattering volume. I will also tell you that he &quot;interviewed in person&quot;
and/or listened to over 2 dozen tapes of the music groups before they chose
this one......excellent choice IMO.

I still hear from people about what a very lovely wedding it was.

Since this wedding was held in the local park's rose garden the wedding
party got dressed at a home near by. One of the all ready dressed groom's
men was standing in the dining room where all the gals were getting the
finishing touches on their make-up and announced that it was his birthday
and needed to get his driver's license renewed and flew out the door (DMV
was 4 blocks away).  He returned in about 20 minutes with a big grin and
showing off his DL picture taken all slicked up and in his tux........&quot;Man,
this is an 8 year license! I'm going to get more mileage out of this $100
dollar monkey suit than in the history of all wedding rentals!!&quot;  Now *THAT*
was funny!  LMAO

&gt; Tell the photographer what you want (have a contract!), how long you expect
&gt;     him/her to stay at the reception, agree on the length of his/her service
&gt;       time, have him/her check out the wedding site ahead of time, if it's
&gt;       just showing up a couple of hours before the ceremony to look over
&gt;        the room(s), because (s)he will be there early anyway to get those
&gt;          group photos done*

&gt; Have a list.  You can not possibly remember all the photos you will
&gt;               want later.  One bride didn't put &quot;bride w/ groom&quot; on her
&gt;               list, wouldn't stand still long enough for the photographer

&gt;             the dress &lt;g&gt; &amp; he rented a (better) tux.

&gt; Have the photographer speak to the preacher -- to find out what is NOT
&gt;            allowed in the service, or in the church (no flash? no walking
&gt;           around in the sanctuary during the service? no interruptions?);
&gt;           the preacher/judge/pronouncer usually knows where the best spots
&gt;           are for the best photo ops

&gt; *Take LOTS of those group photos BEFORE the service.
&gt;        Before the crowds arrive (don't want to spoil the Surprise!).
&gt;        While the bride is prepping (primping) in the bridal room/parlor
&gt;        or wherever, the groom &amp; his men(usually) can gather in the sanctuary
&gt;        or judges chambers (whatever) w/ the family(ies) for those
&gt;       once-in-a-lifetime pics; groom w/ parents, grandparents, attendants,
&gt;      in-laws, great-aunt Bessie, who ever; do these BEFORE the service.
&gt;     Then have the groom's party shuffle off into the catacombs while
&gt;     the Bridal Party comes into the sanctuary/chambers for the same
&gt;     treatment.   Including flower children/petal throwers &amp; ring bearer.
&gt;      This will save time &amp; get everyone to the reception before the guests
&gt;      have drunk all the champagne.

&gt; Give the photographer GOOD, really GOOD directions to the reception area.
&gt; Give the photographer a head start to get to the reception BEFORE the
&gt;        bride &amp; groom.

&gt; Don't over-do the party.  Some brides (or their mothers) want to add every
&gt;       cute idea they ever heard of, include every detail &amp; new tradition
&gt;      --and it's just too much.  If you're a laid-back type of bride, try to
&gt;     keep the service, ceremony, shindig as laid-back as you can.  No one
&gt;     will remember how many candles you lit (&amp; the photographer probably
&gt;     isn't allowed up on the podium steps or behind the communion table to
&gt;     get a picture of this extra performance) or realize that the groomsmen's
&gt;     cummerbunds matched the bridesmaid's varying shades of pink-to-pale rose
&gt;     bouquets (I was a church's wedding coordinator for a couple of years,
&gt;     god help me) -- &amp; no one can tell the difference, anyway.  Details like
&gt;     this will drive you crazy.

&gt; Agree ahead of time to NOT smash the cake into each other's faces.
&gt;      This isn't funny anymore.  Nor is it pretty, as the photographs will
&gt;      show.  Often the newly weds get pissed off over this stupid little
&gt;      trick, and having their first married-couple fight during the reception
&gt;      is not very attractive, either.  &lt;g&gt;    *click*snap*whir*: pictures!

&gt; And, finally, IF you want that same professional photographer to take the
&gt;      Bride &amp; Groom Depart the Party pics, either pay him/her extra to stay
&gt;     for the whole shindig, or get the couple moving out the door before
&gt;     the photographer wilts from the long wait.  &lt;g&gt;
&gt;     Otherwise, have a back-up plan, another photographer or 3 to hang around
&gt;     &amp; take the Going Away pics.

&gt; Relax.  Have fun.  It's just a wedding: people have them all the time. &lt;g&gt;

&gt; R/Sandy -- after the 50th wedding they all start to look alike  &lt;VBG&gt;
&gt;     p.s. dipping large, fresh strawberries in chocolate was a courtesy
&gt;      I extended once--and never tasted a single one! -- but we got them to
&gt;      the reception upstairs in time for the party -- details!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Both DD and I are rather laid back, which can hinder good planning

Wow, that's *excellent* info. We had a &quot;brotherinlaw&quot; photographer. In
all fairness,
money was tight and he offered, and he *was* a pretty fair amateur
photographer.
It was an outdoor wedding, the light and shadows
were all wrong. Shoulda hired a pro.

A few things come to mind that I haven't seen mentioned yet.  One thing I
did not do when DH &amp; I got married was to have a videographer.  We thought
about it, but decided since it was my 2nd marriage &amp; neither of us had/have
kids, what did we need a video for?  I regret that.  When you're getting
married, you're so involved in making sure everything is going well, that
you miss the details.  I feel like I missed so much of what was going on &amp; a
video would have been fun to watch.

We elected to take pictures before the event of all parties in the wedding.
I've been to too many weddings where there is a huge time gap between the
ceremony &amp; the reception.  It seems unfair to make your guests wait even an
hour before you present yourselves.

When you contract with the photographer, write in the contract that you will
receive the negatives.  Sometimes much after the ceremony, you may want more
prints of somebody or something that you didn't order in the first place.
If you can't locate the photographer, you're out of luck.  (I put together a
mini album for my mom &amp; my in-laws - it was much less expensive to have my
own prints made.)  If you do have any friends that offer to take pics at the
wedding - by all means, let them take the candid photos.  Some of my
favorite pics are the candid photos taken by friends.

Don't forget the thank-you's!  I am a little Type - A - my thank you's went
out within 48 hours of receiving the gifts prior to the wedding &amp; within one
week after receiving gifts at the ceremony.  (My boss's wife even called me
to thank me for the advance thank you:)  I had received a notice from Macy's
that what they had purchased was on backorder, so I sent a thank you note.
Maybe that's a little over the top, but I was stressing about them not
getting a timely thank you &amp; maybe they wouldn't know the gift had been
backordered.)

Add to this sad story: a friend here in Munich told me she was sitting next
to a newlywed couple on the train who looked so miserable she just had to
ask what was wrong. They brought their digital camera along on their
European honeymoon, still with all the wedding photos on the memory stick,
took lots of honeymoon photos as well, and on their last day lost the
camera! So they were on their way to the airport, headed home and full of
gloom. Moral: download as you go!

&gt; Okay, so I'll echo the photographer thing. Get a good one. My Dad wanted
&gt; to save a little money (in all fairness, he didn't have that much), so
&gt; he hired a friend of a friend. Umm ... this guy should have practiced
&gt; how to load his camera so that the film (pre-digital days) would
&gt; actually wind. :S We have *no* wedding photos, except those taken when
&gt; we restaged part of it for that express purpose.

&gt; Keep in mind that the wedding, while your expense, is actually for the
&gt; bride and groom. They should be able to make the decisions, as long as
&gt; those decisions fit in with the budget -- which they should be informed
&gt; about ahead of time. Both of my DDs had lovely weddings, but neither was
&gt; what I'd have chosen -- that's fine, since they were not my weddings.
&gt; &lt;G&gt; We gave them each a budget, and they stuck to it and had what *they*
&gt; wanted (the DDs and their honeys).

Kathy-
i went to a wedding not long ago, they put 2 or 3 disposable cameras
on each table at the reception and asked the crowd to take pictures
thru-out the night. then leave them for the wedding party to gather
after the B/G left so they could be developed while the B/G were on
their honeymoon.
Back in the day....we used to give out matchbooks as the souveneir,
now i've seen chocolate bars with the B/G name and date, little
bottles of wine with a label made for the B/G and even little
christmas ornaments with a tag label on them.
just a thought!

I attended a wedding in NH where they gave out little bottles of maple syrup
that were personalized with the bride and groom's names.  That was
different!  Another had baskets of goodies in all the guest's motel rooms
(they paid for our rooms!).  It had chocolates, a bottle of wine
(non-alcoholic for some of us), tickets to a local event, a map of the town,
and a bunch of other thoughtful items for us out-of-towners/guests.  That
was a rather- Ha! VERY!!!-  extravagant event, tho.  All of it was amazing
with no expense spared..... they even paid for everybody's airline tickets
with their miles and paid for the rest of the tickets when their miles ran
out.  Sheesh!!!  But I sure did enjoy flying first class- for the first and
last time.

Howdy!

A few days ago I heard some little comment on t.v. where the
bride was announcing her wedding cost: $300,000.
Her best friend's response: &quot;Is that all?&quot;

Just think what a quilt studio I could have w/ that kind of investment.
Actually, the minister who married us pointed out that the
thousands spent on weddings (this was 1975) would make a great
down payment on a house.  ;-P

Btw, back to those weddings we used to photograph: the amount spent on
the whole shindig was no indication of the length of the marriage.
When I'd contact the couples a year or so later to send them the
photo negatives... kinda' sad, many of the couples had already split.
But they had their big party first!

Speaking of guests . . . . that can be a very touchy subject!  However, DH &amp;
I, since we were paying for our own wedding (&amp; admittedly, we were more
mature), decided that the guest list would be pared down to:  Immediate
family, relatives that we have an ongoing relationship with (i.e., we
actually spend time with them), then work associates we could not avoid
inviting for political reasons, work associates we considered friends &amp; then
it was open to friends that we BOTH enjoyed spending time with.  It was so
nice to party with people we both actually knew &amp; enjoyed, rather than all
the distant relatives, old school chum, co-workers we barely knew, etc.  We
knew it was risky, but we didn't want a free for all.

Yep, often it is about the big party.  Lots of folks
don't get it.
I'm not sure the cost of our wedding but dad built a
gazebo in the back yard and it was just a family/close
friend kind of a deal.  I made the girls dresses and
there were no rented clothes.  My brother did a beautiful
cake.  I was at dad's house last month and saw that
the gazebo was gone.  I guess it gave all it could.
2 weddings and a lot of bbq's.  Kind of odd to see it gone.
I'm glad mine was the one wedding that outlasted the gazebo.
I didn't have all the dreams of a fancy, fussy wedding.
When it came down to it we were just tired of commuting
to date. Mine was a low budget event but I think you beat
on the low end with the $100!

Yeah, I've watched a few episodes of &quot;Platinum Weddings&quot;....and I realize
that even if I DID have that kind of money, I don't have the imagination or
taste to spend it!  Yes, I do realize there are consultants who would be
glad to spend it for me......
I think my wedding was under $1000 and it has lasted 31 years.

We went to Winnemucca, Nevada (lots of couples in this part of Idaho go to
Winnemucca to get married) about a 4 hour drive.  All it cost was the drive
down and back, one night motel, couple or three meals, and the license.
We're still married 29 years later!

It really seems like a lot of girls are thinking ONLY of the wedding and
forget there is a marriage afterwards.

DD had this kind of wedding - just the people they really wanted (no
work associates though, except those who were close friends). The
wedding was in a registry office as the groom had been married before,
but it was a lovely old Elizabethan house with beautiful gardens for the
photos. The reception was at a very nice hotel overlooking the sea on
the south coast. There were only 25 of us altogether, and we had the
drinks reception on the balcony of the bridal suite followed by a lunch
at one big oval table in a private room. Even though we didn't know all
their friends, and had never met the grooms family before, it was all so
friendly as though everyone had known everyone else for years.

DD wore quite a simple long straight silk dress - not the standard white
big dress. She had lovely flowers, and had iced the cake herself. At the
end of the reception we all had a break, and met up in the evening for a
meal in a restaurant with the bride and groom who were staying at the
reception hotel. (we were actually far too full to eat very much!)

It was very successful, and everyone commented what an enjoyable time
they had. The hotel staff too said how much they had enjoyed being part
of it.

They were so, so lucky too - the sun shone all day and it was lovely and
hot - not like this year or last year, when it rained and was miserable.

They said they were going back to the hotel every year for their
anniversary, but haven't got there yet.

My first wedding was fairly low key.  We had to move it up because my
soon to be husband's grandfather, who he lived with, died very suddenly.
We couldn't afford to lose the house they were living in (Very small 2
bedroom house, for $60 a month, including water.) and the furniture. He
couldn't have kept the house for the 4-6 months until the tentative
later date. So we moved it up.
Waited until after our finals were over, and got married just a couple
of weeks after the funeral. So it was a small, quickly planned wedding.
&lt;G&gt; But the marriage did last for 10 years.
My sister had gotten married just 5 weeks before I did. (Hers was Dec.
19. then we went through Christmas and all. G'pa Milne died the first
week of Jan. and we got married on Jan. 23.) Crazy few weeks there. My
folks gave both of us $1000 for our wedding or whatever. My wedding was
a lot less than that, and we used the left over money for rent and such
for a couple of months too. &lt;G&gt;

My second wedding was bigger, but still not extravagant......... will
have to scan some of those pics and post them sometime. Full Tudor, as
in Henry VIII period. &lt;G&gt; I made both of our outfits and all. This
marriage is going on year 27......&lt;VBG&gt;

&gt;My son and his Lady Love were married at the end of this August and the
&gt;three things that *I* thought worked out extremely well and contributed to
&gt;an occasion that turned out exceptionally nice were........

&gt;LIMITED ALCOHOL:
&gt;As guests entered the reception there were servers with trays with glasses
&gt;of champagne and sparkling cider......Guests were offered ONE glass of one
&gt;or the other as they came in the door. During and after dinner guests were
&gt;kept served at the tables with coffee, tea (iced or hot), choice of soft
&gt;drinks or sparkling cider. After dinner, just before the cake cutting
&gt;(which, BTW, did NOT include the &quot;face smash&quot;) waiters again circulated with
&gt;trays of champagne and sparkling cider announcing the cake cutting and the
&gt;couple's first dance and that toasts to the couple were about to begin,
&gt;offering the glass of choice of either beverage to each guest. There was a
&gt;bar with a bartender set up but people paid for their own alcoholic
&gt;beverages other than the two glasses of champagne offered. Soft drinks at
&gt;the bar were free. Not one complaint was heard from anyone that I know of
&gt;(Especially the staff at the restaurant and the manager, all they could talk
&gt;about was what a wonderful, fun, polite crowd and what a pleasure it was to
&gt;work.) I asked quite a few people later on what they thought about the lack
&gt;of free flowing alcohol and there still weren't any negative comments,
&gt;mostly what I heard was that it was *SO* nice there weren't any of the
&gt;usually &quot;drunken incidents&quot;.  There was a lot of dancing, laughter, mingling
&gt;and milling about talking and the lack of alcohol induced hi-jinx didn't
&gt;seem to put a damper on any of the festivities.......it also cut down
&gt;immensely on cost.

&gt;PHOTOGRAPHS:
&gt;They chose their PROFESSIONAL photographer carefully, asking a lot of
&gt;people -not those names given to them by the photographer- for their
&gt;recommendations and she (the photographer they chose) was wonderful. She
&gt;took all the &quot;stock pictures&quot; before and during the wedding ceremony, then
&gt;went to the reception and left after the first dance and cake cutting were
&gt;over. The reception continued 4 hours after that. There were two disposable
&gt;cameras on each table. These were from the company  &quot;I Thee Snap&quot;
&gt; www.itheesnap.com NAYY  After the reception the cameras were gathered up
&gt;and mailed off to this company who then put all the pictures up on their
&gt;website. You can download what you want for free or order a full CD to be
&gt;mailed to you. The wedding couple gets all for free as part of the cost.
&gt;There was an &quot;I Thee Snap&quot; business card tied to each favor on the place
&gt;cards at the tables with the web address and code to enter the 'wedding
&gt;album'. If you went to the website before the pictures were up they asked
&gt;for your email and sent a notice when the pictures were posted. Now those
&gt;were some really great candid pictures........especially one that was taken
&gt;under a table with all the gals having their shoes off!  LOL I honestly
&gt;think this company has come up with one of the best ideas since sliced
&gt;bread......again, NAYY.

&gt;MUSIC:
&gt;A collectively universal *very positive* comment was made about the music.
&gt;They had chosen a quartet (electric violin, bass fiddle, electric guitar and
&gt;piano) and my son made it VERY CLEAR to them that the speakers (amps) were
&gt;to be kept turned DOWN and it was added in to their contract that if the
&gt;volume was not to his specifications they would not get paid...and he
&gt;insisted that addendum was signed by all members of the quartet. They played
&gt;a wonderful assortment of music (from 40s big band to current rock) and
&gt;there was a lot of dancing BUT, those at the tables or standing in groups
&gt;*talking* didn't have to scream and shout at each other to be
&gt;heard.......that alone got as many positive compliments as anything. It also
&gt;got the band a pile of tip money and future bookings. Obviously people of
&gt;all ages enjoyed them for the wonderful music and the lack of ear drum
&gt;shattering volume. I will also tell you that he &quot;interviewed in person&quot;
&gt;and/or listened to over 2 dozen tapes of the music groups before they chose
&gt;this one......excellent choice IMO.

&gt;I still hear from people about what a very lovely wedding it was.

&gt;&gt;think this company has come up with one of the best ideas since sliced
&gt;&gt;bread......again, NAYY.

&gt;&gt;MUSIC:
&gt;&gt;A collectively universal *very positive* comment was made about the music.
&gt;&gt;They had chosen a quartet (electric violin, bass fiddle, electric guitar and
&gt;&gt;piano) and my son made it VERY CLEAR to them that the speakers (amps) were
&gt;&gt;to be kept turned DOWN and it was added in to their contract that if the
&gt;&gt;volume was not to his specifications they would not get paid...and he
&gt;&gt;insisted that addendum was signed by all members of the quartet. They played
&gt;&gt;a wonderful assortment of music (from 40s big band to current rock) and
&gt;&gt;there was a lot of dancing BUT, those at the tables or standing in groups
&gt;&gt;*talking* didn't have to scream and shout at each other to be
&gt;&gt;heard.......that alone got as many positive compliments as anything. It also
&gt;&gt;got the band a pile of tip money and future bookings. Obviously people of
&gt;&gt;all ages enjoyed them for the wonderful music and the lack of ear drum
&gt;&gt;shattering volume. I will also tell you that he &quot;interviewed in person&quot;
&gt;&gt;and/or listened to over 2 dozen tapes of the music groups before they chose
&gt;&gt;this one......excellent choice IMO.

&gt;&gt;I still hear from people about what a very lovely wedding it was.

Not exactly reception planning, but a suggestion. If not tooo
extravagant have an &quot;extra&quot; corsage and 1-2 extra boutonnières (?)
ready. Invariably there will be a problem with one, or you will wish you
had one for someone special that shows up.  The corsage can always be
given to someone special at the reception if not needed earlier, and the
boutonnières can always go to little girls if not needed. &lt;G&gt;

&gt; DD and I are going to make an appointment with the wedding reception planner
&gt; at the local country club.  I have the package plans but I have no clue what
&gt; to look out for in the pricing and selections.  Does anyone have any hints,
&gt; suggestions or pitfalls to avoid?  The reception will include alcohol.  DD
&gt; has basically looked at it all and thought...hey that looks good and wanted
&gt; to do it all by email.  I'm a bit more skeptical and want to meet her in
&gt; person and talk things over face to face.  DH thinks all this is foolish, so
&gt; the $$ is going to be a bone of contention to some extent.  Maybe I should
&gt; say, he'll gripe about it and do whatever we come up with.  She and I aren't
&gt; over the top extravagant types, so he doesn't have to worry about going into
&gt; the poorhouse.
&gt; So?  What have you done that you wish you hadn't.....or had??  I'm
&gt; listening.
&gt; Thanks.

My husband and I paid for almost all our own wedding expenses. Only
fair as we were 28 and 29 respectively and had been living together
for five years. We shopped around packages, caterers and such and came
to a meeting of the minds and pocket books. Our wedding was small and
had no frills. And the only alcohol provided was one bottle of
champagne at each table for toasting. We were not sorry, ever. We
didn't go into debt. The wedding and reception were a grand success.
Everybody happily ate deli sandwiches and drank soda pop. Nobody was
there for the food.

Remember: nobody is coming to the reception for the food. If they are,
then you don't want them there anyway and can easily and happily cut
them from your invite list.

This is a day for your daughter and her new husband to make memories.
If you are going to splurge, do it on things that will be in photos:
flowers and cake. The rest will be forgotten quickly. If anybody is
still talking about the food at the reception this time next year I'll
eat my hats. And I have lots of hats.

Go light. Don't provide your guests with the opportunity to get drunk.
Concentrate on making your daughter feel beautiful.

I remember one thing about my wedding dinner. I couldn't eat a bite. I
was so anxious, so tied up in knots and thrilled and exhausted from no
sleep the night before that my stomach rebelled. I hear that's common
for brides. And bridegrooms too.

Hugs and lots of love,
Sunny

If you supply disposable cameras, be SURE to put an
explanation with it! Just make a note that party goers
should take some fun pictures of each other for the
bride and groom to enjoy later, and deposit the used
cameras in a designated/labeled basket. It is good to
tell people why the cameras are on table so they will
be USED up and STAY at the party for the newlyweds.
