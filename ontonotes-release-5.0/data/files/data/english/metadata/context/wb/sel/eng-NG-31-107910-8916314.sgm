I have noticed for some time that the rear left wheel on my 96 doesn't
always look right.  It is sometimes toed in when parked when other cars are
toed out or straight.  Looking under the car I found that a bolt was missing
from the car end (as opposed to wheel end) the lower wishbone.  This is the
forward one of the two bolts.  How dangerous is it to drive the car like
this?  How can it just fall off?  When feeling around I notice a nut is
still in place on the top of this connection.  is that a permanent nut and I
just need a bolt or did this thing sheer off somehow?
Thank you.

That is hard to say, without knowing how much time it takes for the wheel
to break off from metal fatigue.  Can you leave a note for your loved ones
to post a message here if you die in a car accident, so that I have a better
answer next time?

It can obviously not just fall off.   It could vibrate out without leaving
a trace.  But why?

How long have you had this car?  Is it possible a previous owner or shop
may have had any business fooling with this bolt?  Of course, material
defects are always possible, but they seem to be very rare to me.

Is the tread drastically different on this tire than the others? That
would help indicate how long this has been going on.
The Miata suspension is so sensitive that you should feel something
wrong as the control arm shifts. It has to be affecting the handling.

If it has been like this the entire time you have owned the car, it will
feel like a different vehicle when it is fixed, especially with a good
alignment.

Are you certain that the bolt is missing and that the head has not
sheared off?
These are two-piece nut and bolt assemblies. If the nut is there, then
there should be at least part of the bolt left for it to attach to.

Any chance of getting a picture?

Extremely dangerous.
I would have the entire control arm assembly inspected and replace the
bolt before driving it anywhere but onto a tow truck.

Don't know, but I have seen stranger things happen on cars.

See above.

Good luck!

A cliff side hairpin turn as the control arm snaps free?  ;-)

Let us know how it goes, 96miata, assuming that you are still alive.

I also hope that the question was not bait, because if it was, I
swallowed it hook, line and sinker.......

Thank you for the helpful responses.

The bolt in question was one a vertically oriented bolt that ties the lower
wishbone to the performance rods or brace bar assembly.
The nut is an integral part of the wishbone.  The tip of the bolt was left
behind in the nut and was drilled out by the mechanic.
A new bolt was inserted through the performance rods and through the old nut
and a new nut put on top of the original.
The mechanic left a stainless steel hose clamp in the mix that he said was
used to align the holes.  It can not be easily removed because it is
sandwiched between the rods and sits under the head of the bolt.  It will
have it redone at some point by someone that cares more about the quality
and appearance of their work.  I would have thought the old bolt would have
been tapped to directly accommodate the threads of a new bolt.  Perhaps that
is expecting too much.

The creaking noise that occurred when breaking, and caused me to look under
the car in the first place, is now gone.  The car feels tighter on bumps.
It is possible that there was a  problem with the bolt for some time, that
it had cracked off from the nut but still held in place by tension or rust
and only provided value with horizontal stresses but not vertical ones.
Once it fell out the creaking noise began then the horizontal support, like
breaking, was gone.

With almost one hundred thousand miles, should the tie rods be replaced
(front and back)?  And how about the bushings on the stabilizer bar in the
back?

Thank you.

I can't help you on the tie rods but, I don't think you'd experience any
change if you replaced the sway bar bushings. I've messed with some with
pretty high mileage and don't remember them being brittle however, if yours
are, that would warrant replacement. Upgrading the sway bars is the thing
you want to do!
