Can anyone point me at any password recovery tools for Linux that can
recover &quot;ARC, ZIP, RAR &amp; ZOO&quot; archive passwords.

I can find plenty for Windows, both free and paid for!  But it seems
that ones for Linux elude me.

Thanks:

Not the way it works in Linux: Linux systems use shadow passwords. There's a
file /etc/passwd, but it saves everything except password hashes. The system
doesn't save user passwords. What is saved, or stored, is the value of a one way
hash algorithm from processing the password. That password will always have to
the same hash value - the system compares hashes instead of actual &quot;passwords&quot;.
You should boot the computer in single-user mode and change the password.

No surprise.

The OP isn't looking for a system password cracker, but wants to be able
to open archives that have been encrypted with a password.  (Possibly with
nefarious intent?)

If Windows utilities to do this are easy to come by, it seems like Wine
should be useful here.

Oh, well I sure didn't get that from his post - maybe that's his

of Linux security as opposed to Windows, huh?

Thanks Mark. Later.

Disseminating knowledge about good security is always a big plus for one's
karma, indeed.

I guess that the fact there are crackers for those kinds of password
protected archives show it's not a really secure way to store sensitive
data.

I &quot;think&quot; that was not what he asked for.He is asking for utilities to
recover ARC ZIP RAR Zoo passwords, not system passwords.

Note that a good password system should NOT have recoverable passwords
since that would mean the bad guy can recover them.

Nefarious intent !!!!
That had already taken place before I got involved!

I've no problems running Wincrap, but this is serious stuff.  I have
already DD'd the disk.  The original is no longer available to me.  I
don't want to run Windows tools for fear of compromising the original
data, so I have several copies to play with.

The Wincrap tools are either crippleware or just don't work!  I ain't
paying for tools that make promises that they can't keep.  Hence my
question.  I am sure that there are people out there that are far
more knowledgeable than I am!
