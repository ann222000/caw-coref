*I don't care *that Larry Craig is gay, or that Mark Foley is. I do care
that they pushed for laws that attacked other gays and assailed our
Constitutional rights and liberties, while living a lie. Craig isn't
even the latest GOPocrite snared in a sex scandal. Another is unfolding
involving &quot;The chairman of the Clark County Republican Party--who last
month was elected president of the Young Republican National
Federation.&quot; What did this Young Republican leader and County Republican
Chair do?

&quot;On Tuesday afternoon, Glenn Murphy Jr. e-mailed media outlets a letter
announcing his resignation from both positions, citing an unexpected
business opportunity that would prohibit him from holding a partisan
political office. However, the Clark County Sheriff's Department on
Friday began investigating Murphy for alleged criminal deviate
conduct--potentially a class B felony--after speaking with a 22-year-old
man who claimed that on July 31, Murphy performed an unwanted sex act on
him while the man slept in a relative's Jeffersonville home.&quot; In 1998
Murphy attempted to do the same thing on a guy who was also asleep, but
charges were never filed in that case.

You want to talk about hypocrisy? &quot;Florida state Rep. Bob Allen a
Republican of course, &quot;was a co-sponsor earlier in 2007 of legislation
to increase the penalty for 'public lewdness and indecent exposure,'
such as trolling for sex partners in public restrooms (upping the crime
from a misdemeanor to a felony). The bill did not pass, which was lucky
for Rep. Allen, who was arrested in July in a men's room in Titusville
when undercover officers said he entered and exited three times in the
space of a few minutes, peered over a restroom stall and offered oral
sex for $20.&quot; This according to a WKMG-TV (Orlando) report, carried in
the &quot;News of the Weird&quot; column.

Also from the &quot;News of the Weird&quot; reporting on Republicans behaving
badly: &quot;In Louisville, Ky., local Republican Party activists John Lowler
and Peter Hayes feuded recently over their status at the upcoming state
convention, with Lowler alleging that Hayes punched him. Lowler had
first accused Hayes of smearing him by suggesting that he had recently
had gay sex. (Lowler acknowledges that he used to be gay but says he is
now straight).&quot; Reported by The Courier-Journal, 4-16-04.

Again, who cares if anyone is a gay American? Well, it seems some
high-level Republicans do. The &quot;News of the Weird&quot; article shows typical
bigotry by GOPocrites: &quot;Former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson, after
the first Republican presidential debate in May, explained one awkward
answer he gave (about firing a worker who was gay) by claiming, in part,
that he was distracted by his need for a restroom break.&quot; It comes back
to the restroom again.

Apparently their refusal to face up to their sexual identity--gay,
straight or otherwise--compels these hypocrites to commit crimes, lie,
and attack the dignity, rights and freedoms of other Americans. Just
like right wing Republican Sen. Larry Craig who admitted his criminal
conduct and even plead guilty, but keeps repeating over and over &quot;I am
not gay!&quot; Well Larry, we know you're gay. Mature, sensible people don't
care about that. We only care that you kept voting for an illegal and
failed war and attacks on our Constitution, and you helped lead the
right wing Republican assault on the rights of other Americans.

Craig isn't even the first right wing Republican in the U.S. Senate to
lecture Americans on morality while failing to practice what he
preaches. Louisiana Senator David Vitter took a week or so, but he
finally acknowledged and admitted his &quot;past sin,&quot; asked God for
forgiveness &quot;and was forgiven.&quot; How does he presume that? Rather than
look after his constituents still suffering in the aftermath of Katrina,
he was paying for sex from prostitutes and prostituting his office to
the highest bidder--if not Halliburton-style no bid contracts! Vitter
took over in Congress for Rep. Livingston who helped lead the witch hunt
impeachment of Clinton, but Livingston was soon exposed as paying for
kinky sex with prostitutes.

Again, it's not the sex, it's the rank hypocrisy and McCarthyism these
goons use to distort and debase our politics. Vittner's wife was vocal
about her disdain for Hillary Clinton during the Clinton Impeachment
circus her husband supported: she even warned what she would do if she
caught her husband committing adultery, &quot;I'm a lot more like Lorena
Bobbitt than Hillary. If he [Vittner] does something like that, I'm
walking away with one thing, and it's not alimony, trust me.&quot; But now
she is &quot;standing by her man&quot; now because &quot;God forgave him.&quot; How does she
know? Because her husband told the world God forgave him. How convenient!

Show the world that you're on to these GOPocrites and closet cases who
inflict their psychodrama and self-loathing on an innocent America. The
list goes on and on and on with astonishing accounts of sexual and other
indiscretions byRepublican &quot;morality&quot; and &quot;family values&quot;  stalwarts
like Mark Foley, David Vitter, Larry Craig,  Barry Edwards, Ted Haggard,
Ted Klaudt, Bob Allen, Coy Privette, Liam Michael Golden, Michael Flory,
Glenn Murphy, Jr., Bob Dole, Jeff Gannon, Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay, Dan
Burton....

Right wing neo-con Republicans like George Bush, Dick Cheney, Larry
Craig, David Vittner, Tom DeLay, Duke Cunningham, and Mark Foley show
their values with illegal wars and raids on our national treasury, drunk
driving, lying, taking bribes, and selling out the American people
especially our troops and kids. What Republican &quot;values?&quot; They lie,
cheat, steal and now we find they molest kids and conspire to cover up
these crimes! Then, they try to lecture the rest of us about how to live
our lives. Voice your outrage over the criminality and hypocrisy of
Republicans! Please buy these shirts, buttons and stickers.

The Democrats aren't any better. They thrive on the Craig &quot;news.&quot;  When will
you come to the realization that although some call themselves  Democrats,
what we have is a one party system!! Hillary is a right wing Democrat  and so are
some of the other &quot;Democrats.&quot;

Talk, talk, talk, but nobody except Kucenich wants to impeach the leaders  of
this administration or put them in front of an International War Crimes
Tribunal, although using lies and deceit thee murdered thousands of Americans  and
hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich (note, no &quot;e&quot; in his last name) is a Democrat,
and for good reason. Democrats are in fact much better than the
Republicans. On this Labor Day, keep in mind that Republicans favor
&quot;right to work&quot; and union busting, while Democrats stand with the
working people of our nation.

Democrats also uphold basic Constitutional Rights against popular or
highly motivated extreme and undemocratic policies. For example, the
Republicans try to tell gay people they've made an &quot;evil choice&quot; and
work to block or strip away rights from gays. Republicans remain
hostile to equal rights for women, especially pay equality.

Republicans undermine civil rights for minorities and they stoke the
fires of intolerance against gays, immigrants and minorities. Also, in
violation of our founders' clear intent, Republicans try to ram harsh
and narrow sectarian fundamentalist religious &quot;values&quot; down our
throats. Democrats work so Republicans cannot do that.

Republicans uniformly favor the wealthy and powerful credit companies,
prescription drug companies, weapons-makers and others and abuse power
to raid our treasury to further enrich the rich. They blocked health
coverage for all, and even oppose expansion of health care for
children. These are worthy Democratic initiatives which would have
passed into law long ago, but for the obstructionism of Republicans.

In short, the Democratic Party is the most effective agent for change
and social justice in US history. Please come to our meetings in
Wheaton and get involved with making the Democratic Party even more
effective, even more responsive and even more progressive.
