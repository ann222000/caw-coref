&gt;Last Nights Dream
&gt;By: Luke Nichols

&gt;Some parts of this dream I will leave out, because they are personal, and
&gt;memories of a girl, long, long gone.
&gt;I dreamt I was at my home, and I drove down to a Town. I don't know the
&gt;Town. I just know on one side of the road, it had a rocky cliff, and on the
&gt;other side, a river.

Forgive the verbose reply, but as a Christian, the subject of dreams
interests me. Perhaps other Christians are interested in dreams, too?

To begin with, archetypally, the river symbolizes the eternal stream
of the heavenly &amp; hellish subconscious, as manifests physically in the
weak nuclear force.  In judicial astrology, tarot, and other religions,
this is called the trinity, or triplicity, of Water. Our closest is the
Astral plane, the ineffable God of the Moon, who rules over the Creator
of Water Cancer: Imagination, Dreams, Somnus, Morpheus, Delta, Emotions,
appropriately named "The Chariot" of tarot. To sleep perchance to dream...

The rocky cliff is the triplicity of Gravity, centered on Plovton-Hades
at the geocenter--the focus--of the Earth, befittingly named "The World"
in tarot, the Creator of Gravity, ruled by the mighty Titan King Saturn
chained (and occasionally forebodingly unchained) far beneath your feet.

The "rockiness" of the cliff symbolizes the crystalline firmament, the
tenth heaven, as called the *Empyrean*, and akasic memory of the Earth.
Hence the common phrases, "the rock remembers" but "the water forgets".
Like in Genesis, the arid land is called Earth, and the congregation of
the waters are called Seas [Gen 1:10, ibid].

The river on one side and the rocky cliff on the other symbolizes night
and day, the evening and morning, superior and inferior, feminine and
masculine, yin and yang, liturgical and ecclesiastical, etc. One might
think of this as manifesting in right-brain and left-brain hemispheres
of the mortal physical human brain, i.e. respectively, but the emphasis
is always on the eternal, heavenly, major arcana aspects of experience.

The road is the endless road of soul's eternal, ever-aggregating, ever-
developing experience: both in the discarnate state, and the incarnate
state, all being eternal, the latter being eternally-temporal, to wit.

The "Town", the Tau, which is the sidereal letter of Venus, the sixth
evening-morning of Creation, of immortal humankind before the Fall of
Autumn &amp; Evening; i.e. the never-ending journey towards a destination
unknown--unknown to the extent of sovereign freewill, otherwise known.
And "memories of a girl, long, long gone" etc. is similarly universal,
i.e. universally archetypal, as is the rest of your "personal" dream.
It is both uniquely personal (subjective), and archetypal (objective)...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So this guy and me are talking, and I looked back over my left shoulder, and
&gt;one of the mountains exploded. Volcanic rock and ash flew up into the air,
&gt;and magma began to flow down the sides of the mountain, as the top glowed
&gt;red. I knew, instantly, I was a dead man. I prayed, after a while, &quot;God, it
&gt;is enough.&quot; and the volcano kind of died down.
">

In this context "me" is more subjective, whereas "I" is more objective.
I.e. me the mortally-incarnate ego-self, in contrast to I the God-self.
Spiritually, right and left, Latin "dexteram et sinistram" [Jonah 4:11],
is directly associated with good and evil, heaven and hell, respectively.
Hence "down to the left", "up to the right". These are _very_ archetypal.

The past tense is revealing "I (God-self) looked back over my (ego-self)
left (evil) shoulder, pristinely reminiscent of Lot's wife, who had looked
back upon the fire and brimstone as it rained down upon Sodom and Gomorrah
[Gen 19:24-26]. Again, this is prototypical, archetypal, dream symbology.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So, next I'm on this high steel tower, looking down into the river. A hole
&gt;opened in the bottom of the river, and water began to gush up. I rebuked the
&gt;river in the name of Jesus, and the water went back down into the Earth.
">

"The Tower" is definitively symbolic of victorious Mars, Ares, who rules
the God-self, in tarot "The Devil", Creator of Fire whose inferior aspect
physically manifests in the strong nuclear force; and also rules "Death",
the sting of the Scorpion, the Sustainer of Water (as previously noted).

Heavenly Victory survives death, "lives through death", like the Samurai.
Hence, to look back objectively, in retrospect, is the exclusive purview
of our immortal soul, as to remember past mortal incarnations, lifetimes
upon the earth.  Only the immortal soul has access to the akasic records.
And not only to our own, but also to others. Psychic mediums and prophets
practice this reading ability moreso than your average gentile, obviously.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Then, I was looking up in the sky, and I saw a big mound of dirt, flying in
&gt;the air, with a Temple on it. People all around me was happy, thinking it
&gt;was Jesus coming back. So the mound of dirt landed on top of a mountain, and
&gt;people from everywhere was climbing up the mountain, to go see the sight.
">

Please try to be a little more apocalyptically-archetypal (just kidding)!
The new city descending out of heaven, in view, etc. etc. [Rev 21:1-3ff].
This direct, and unmistakably obvious, association with the Second Advent,
the prophesied return of Jesus Christ, requires no further interpretation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Once I got up there, there was a man, with coal black hair. He had the
&gt;garments of a priest on. He spoke soothing words to the masses, and they had
&gt;worship in their eyes for this man.
&gt;But, I realized, this man is not Jesus. I realized he was antichrist.
&gt;Then I woke up.

Yours is a perfectly archetypal dream, and is a very good dream to have.
We each experience this dream a little differently, of course, but the
gist of it is to own and embrace our shadow-self; i.e. to acknowledge
the primordial Tree in the midst of the Paradiso, with its "forbidden
fruit", partaking of which did open our eyes to the knowledge of good
and evil. Some experience this as "I shook hands with the devil", and
"a devil-dog approached me and commenced to panting in my ear as I lay
helplessly-motionless", etc. (as happens on occasion when we're astral-
projecting, attempting in vain to return to our physical body, causing
a bit of a "panic" for a time, until we regain physical consciousness).

In conclusion, I believe this dream instructs her dreamer to recognize
that freedom and responsibility do eternally and universally walk hand-
in-hand. That, as sinners, we always have freedom of choice but not of
consequences. Some like to believe that souls "choose" to get banished
from Paradise--to get kicked out of heaven--and cast down to the earth,
etc., but that's not how it works in reality.  Every time our immortal
souls incarnate into yet another newborn infant human body born in sin,
essentially born to die, born with a *plethora* of good and bad karma,
more than enough for one lifetime, it's a traumatic experience for the
soul! Good and evil have always been a choice, eternally a choice with
inexorable and _exacting_ consequences.  Call it "sin", call it "karma"
or what have you.  I prefer to call it "what goes around comes around".

Thus it is good to embrace the shadow-self, to befriend Satan, and the
Devil. To approach the dark cloud of the Abyss, of the bottomless pit,
to see that we are part of all, and all is part of us: good -and- evil.

Hope that helps,

And another load of pure useless agabage from dim the min.

There are those who believe that life here, began out there, far across the
universe, with tribes of humans, who may have been the forefathers of the
Egyptians, or the Toltecs, or the Mayans. Some believe that they may yet be
brothers of man, who even now fight to survive, somewhere beyond the
heavens.
