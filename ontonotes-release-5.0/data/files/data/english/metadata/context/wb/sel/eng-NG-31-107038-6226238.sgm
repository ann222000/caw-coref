DISCOURSES ON KRS'N'A AND THE GIITA' - 02

THREE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WORD "KRS'N'A"

Shrii Shrii Anandamurti

Whatever exists in this world has some meaning behind it. Even every
word that we use has a history of its own. It may be that not many are
aware of that meaning. But that does not mean that there is no meaning
in it.

Every word has a history. Fifteen thousand years ago, the word ratha
was in use. The usual meaning of the word ratha is "chariot". But why
was the chariot called ratha? There would be a charioteer, and he, in
those ancient times, in order to goad the horses to pull the chariot,
would make a sound like ra . . . ra . . . ra. Upon hearing which the
horses would immediately start running. When he would make a sound like
tha . . . tha, the horses would stop. Since the chariot was controlled
by the sounds ra and tha, it came to be known as ratha.

There are so many things in the world the meaning of which is not known
to many. Take for instance the name of this town, "Ludhiana". Not many
are aware of what the word means. But it does have a meaning. In the
Vedic language there was a word lodhra, which is the name of a flower.
The women of those ancient times would use the pollen of this flower as
their face-powder. There was also in the Vedic language a word dha'nya,
meaning any green vegetation. This land had lodhra-dha'nya in
abundance, and the local dialect of the land, about 3500 years ago, was
Paesha'cii Pra'krta. The original Vedic Sanskrit "Lodhra-Dha'nya"
became corrupted by Paesha'cii Pra'krta to "Lodhdha Ha'nna". Then 2500
years ago, that word became changed in Demi-Paesha'cii into
"Lodhdhaa'nna", which then in Old Punjabi took the form of
"Lodhiya'na". Now in modern Punjabi it is "Ludhiya'na". [Anglicized in
turn as "Ludhiana".] In the same way, there is not a single word that
does not have some meaning behind it, though people may or may not be
aware of that meaning.

One such word is "Krs'n'a", the meaning of which is not known to many.
In Sanskrit the verb krs' means "to do research", "to find out". So the
Entity that one attains by making one's mind subtler and subtler,
through sa'dhana' and bhajanas, is called "Krs'n'a". In other words,
what someone attains through profound culture and sa'dhana', is
Krs'n'a.

The second meaning of the verb krs' is "to attract", "to draw
everything to one's own self". The nucleus of our solar system is the
sun, and a number of planets, satellites, etc., are orbiting round the
sun. The sun is attracting all the orbiting objects towards itself. It
is because of this attraction that the planets, satellites, etc., are
able to move round their nucleus along their own orbits. Similarly, He
who is attracting the whole universe towards His own self, is Krs'n'a.
Thus Krs'n'a is the greatest force of attraction in the universe. No
one can go beyond the ambit of His attractive force. People may or may
not come close to Him, but under no circumstances can anybody transcend
the limits of His being. And where would anyone go, after all? Outside
His being there is nothing and nobody. Hence to Him who has the
greatest attractive power, we give the name "Krs'n'a".

You also know that of all the colours from white to black, black has
the greatest force of attraction. That is why in Sanskrit black is
called krs'n'a.

Now let us talk a little about history. About 3500 years ago, this
Bha'ratavars'a [India] of ours was divided into many fragments. There
was no unity among the different kingdoms, and in the absence of unity,
the development of the common people was not possible. Yet Bha'rata is
one and indivisible.

What is the meaning of "Bha'rata"? In Sanskrit the root verb bhr means
"to provide with subsistence"; and the root verb tan means "to
increase", "to enhance". So bha'rata comes to stand for a land where
all the necessary means of subsistence are available, with ample scope
for all-round development.

Bha'ratavars'a [vars'a = "land"] was divided into a number of diverse
smaller states which had no unity among them. And in the absence of
unity, no development of the country as a whole was ever possible. But
culturally Bha'ratavars'a is a land of a single social group. Here was
born in days long past a great maha'purus'a whose ambition it was to
bring the fragmented parts of the land together and to establish a bond
of unity among them. And that He did accomplish. Krs'n'a was the great
personality of that age who could attract everyone with His
extraordinary personality.

You may ask, then why did Lord Shrii Krs'n'a have to plan out the
battle or the Maha'bha'rata?* You should bear in mind that whenever
someone wants to accomplish a task, he or she has to devise certain
means for the purpose. You can get your work done with sweet words. But
it is a fact that not everybody can be induced to work by sweet words!
If the driver of an ox cart tells his oxen, "Oh my dears, please turn
left or turn right," the oxen may or may not pay heed to the request.
That is why the driver is found to have a sharp prod in his hand.
People who are sincere and good will readily do the job on the basis of
sweet words. But some people are as obstinate as oxen. For them the
application of force is needed. And when that fails, then even sterner
measures are required. That explains why the battle of the
Maha'bha'rata had to be orchestrated.

* Maha'bha'rata literally means "Great Â India". Hence Maha'bha'rata
became the name both for the campaign led by Krs'n'a to unify India,
and for the epic composition about that campaign. Here it means the
former. --Trans.

It would not be correct to say that He had to fight the battle, because
Lord Shrii Krs'n'a himself did not take part in that battle. But He
devised the plan of the battle. He had to do this under pressure of
circumstances. Where sweet words do not work, or simple reason fails,
the application of force is the only weapon to accomplish the job.
Words that the mind will not easily obey, flesh and bone obey when
struck a blow. This Krs'n'a was an historical figure. Descending to the
earth of that time in the form of a human being, He accomplished a
great task in human society.

Those of you who are students of science, particularly of medical
science, must know that the human body has a number of glands. They
secrete different types of hormones, and these secretions determine the
mental vrttis [propensities] of human beings. On these secretions also
depend the nature, conduct, and the behaviour patterns of human beings.

To control the propensities there are certain cakras [psycho-spiritual
centres or plexi] located in different parts of the body. These cakras
in turn are controlled by the sahasra'ra cakra.* In fact all the
functions of the organism are controlled by the sahasra'ra. So when
someone wants to ascend, to become spiritually elevated, they have to
raise their jiivabha'va [microcosmic bearing] to a higher level. This
jiivabha'va is known in the language of the scriptures as the
kulakun'd'alinii [latent divine force]. The kulakun'd'alinii should be
aroused and made to ascend gradually step by step from the mu'la'dha'ra
cakra** to the central controlling point in the sahasra'ra. This
jiivabha'va, or kulakun'd'alinii shakti, is called "Ra'dha'" in Tantric
scriptures, while the central controlling power in the sahasra'ra, from
where all the manifold activities of humans are controlled, is called
"Krs'n'a". When the kulakun'd'alinii reaches the sahasra'ra, the person
attains moks'a [non-qualified liberation]. This is the significance of
"Krs'n'a" in yoga.

* The uppermost psycho-spiritual centre, or plexus, in the body,
located at the crown of the head. --Trans.

** The lowermost psycho-spiritual centre, or plexus, in the body,
located at the base of the spine, above the perineum. --Trans.

These are some of the interpretations of the word "Krs'n'a". But
whatever interpretation we give, one thing should always be remembered
-- that all the "Krs'n'as" are ultimately one and the same.

The essence of dharma, its mystery, lies hidden in Parama Purus'a.
Krs'n'a is the controller of the whole universe. Even then He is not
far away from you. Who in this world is nearest of all to you?
Certainly it is Krs'n'a. And whom do you love most in the world? Again
it is Krs'n'a. Maybe you love Him unconsciously, while He loves you
consciously. Very well does He know who in this world is a sinner and
who is virtuous. Knowing full well what is what, He loves all without
discrimination. He does not keep aloof from anybody out of contempt. He
never says that He will not allow So-and-so a place in His heart
because that person is a sinner. To Him a sinner and a virtuous person
are equal. You should always remember that whatever be the past history
of a person, that person's link with Krs'n'a, from beginningless time
to endless time, will always remain the same. So never under any
circumstances should you allow any sort of doubt or anxiety to enter
your mind.
