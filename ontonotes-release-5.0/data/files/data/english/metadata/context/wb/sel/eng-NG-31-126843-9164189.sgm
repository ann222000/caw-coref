Institute)

Current polling suggests that Americans remain unscathed from fears of
imminent and future terror attacks on U.S. soil. Since November 2001,
the Gallup Poll has questioned Americans about their thoughts
regarding terrorism occurring within the United States. At any given
time, only about 5 - 14 % of Americans polled have said that they are
Very worried that they or someone in their family would become a
victim of terrorism. Around 55% answered that they were either not to
worried, or not worried at all.

When asked if they felt that there would be further acts of terrorism
in the United States the majority responded that it wasn't too likely
or not likely at all. When polled regarding what the priorities for
Congress and the President were, National Security was rated seventh
falling behind the environment and pollution.

In a news briefing on July 17th 2007, Homeland Security Advisor
Frances Townsend expresses that Americans should feel safer due to
&quot;Our greatly increased worldwide counterterrorism efforts since
September the 11th.&quot; She further states that it is because of this
effort that &quot;we have constrained the ability of Al Qaida to attack the
U.S. again and have led terrorist groups to view the homeland as a
harder target to strike than it was on 9/11.&quot; However, Townsend also
explained that &quot;Al Qaida will continue to attempt visually dramatic
mass casualty attacks in the homeland. And they will continue to
acquire and employ chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
materials and will not hesitate to use them if they develop sufficient
capability.&quot;

These statements were based upon the newly released national
intelligence estimate of the terrorist threat to the United States
homeland. The first ever of its kind, this estimate is &quot;intended to
provide a strategic understanding of the terrorist threat to the
homeland over the next three years and to give the intelligence
communities baseline judgments in order to help policy-makers develop
and prioritize government actions.&quot; But do Americans trust the
intelligence gathered by the various agencies of the federal
government to be credible?

For many years some have felt that the Bush administration have used
terror threats as a way to manipulate the media by creating a
distraction from negative press. Other claims have included that Bush
has used the threat of Domestic terrorist attacks as a means to
demonstrate our need to continue the war in Iraq and engage the enemy
abroad. However, Senator Barack Obama expressed today that the
national intelligence estimate demonstrates &quot;a chilling reminder of
what we have feared all along. After almost six years, awesome
sacrifices by our brave men and women in uniform, and hundreds of
billions of dollars spent, we are no safer than we were on 9/11.&quot;
Supporting that notion Senator Russ Feingold said that &quot;``The NIE
confirms that al-Qaida is the most serious threat to the United
States, and that key elements of that threat have been regenerated or
even enhanced. ... The administration's policies in Iraq have also
allowed the emergence of an al-Qaida affiliate that didn't exist
before the war.'' Both parties recognize the report's serious threats
of plans by al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks - which including
homegrown terrorists, to inflict mass casualties through new attacks
on the United States. Frances Townsend reiterated this feeling in her
press briefing saying &quot;We are facing a persistent terrorist enemy led
by Al Qaida that remains driven and intent on attacking the homeland
and that continues to adapt and improve its capabilities... There
should be no question in anybody's mind: Despite our successes, this
is an enemy that remains determined. And it remains determined to try
and understand if there are vulnerabilities that they may exploit. It
requires us to be equally adaptive at capturing or killing them.&quot;
Although Townsend adds that there has been no &quot;credible information
pointing to a specific imminent attack&quot;, what serious security threats
do we face as a Nation?

According Paul Williams, seasoned investigative reporter and former
FBI consultant, al-Qaida is not content with detonating just one
nuclear devise inside the United States but multiple detonations
simultaneously in seven cities. He reveals in his recently released
book &quot;The Day of Islam: The Annihilation of America and the Western
World&quot;, that New York, Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, Miami, Boston,
Houston, and Los Angeles are all targets for what he calls is an
inevitable &quot;American Hiroshima&quot;. According to Williams, former CIA
Director George Tenet informed President Bush one month after the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that at least two suitcase nukes had reached
al-Qaida operatives in the U.S. &quot;Each suitcase weighed between 50 and
80 kilograms (approximately 110 to 176 pounds) and contained enough
fissionable plutonium and uranium to produce an explosive yield in
excess of two kilotons,&quot; wrote Williams. &quot;One suitcase bore the serial
number 9999 and the Russian manufacturing date of 1988. The design of
the weapons, Tenet told the president, is simple. The plutonium and
uranium are kept in separate compartments that are linked to a
triggering mechanism that can be activated by a clock or a call from
the cell phone.&quot; He asserts that the nuclear weapons have already been
smuggled into the United States over the Mexican border with help of
the MS-13 street gang. Can this be true? Williams's explosive
revelations cannot be construed as just mere speculation; in fact,
there are many top level government officials which have been
mentioned as his sources. This list includes current FBI Director
Robert Mueller who verifies Williams' that al-Qaida is poised &quot;to
detonate a nuclear device that would kill hundreds of thousands of
Americans&quot; - and that, they seek to simultaneously detonate these
devices in multiple cities. A Senior CIA official named Michael
Scheuer, confessed to Williams that the CIA &quot;&quot;found that [bin Laden]
and al-Qaida were involved in an extraordinarily sophisticated and
professional efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction - in this
case, nuclear weapons.&quot; Other Revelations include:

In 1996, al-Qaida's &quot;paymaster&quot; and a top lieutenant for bin Laden
walked into a U.S. embassy in Africa and spilled the beans on the
terror group's activities - including that al-Qaida had purchased
nuclear material in the Sudan.
The story of a Brooklyn, N.Y., mosque that was receiving &quot;stipends&quot;
from the federal government for more than $2 million a year up until
1993 - when it was discovered that the mosque was the nerve center for
the first attack on the World Trade Center.
The case of a Chicago charity that raised millions for bin Laden and
even paid for one of his operatives whose sole job was to acquire
nuclear weapons.
Evidence the Saudi intelligence service claims bin Laden has an
arsenal of between 40 and 70 tactical nuclear weapons.
Russian sources that claim bin Laden bought 12 to 15 fully assembled
nuclear weapons.
Ties between al-Qaida and the Chechen rebels who allegedly acquired
nuclear suitcase devices.
Bin Laden's claim to a Pakistani journalist two months before 9/11
that acquiring nuclear was &quot;not difficult&quot; - claiming they were
available from Russia for between $10 million and $20 million.
Evidence bin Laden spent between $60 and $100 million to build nuclear
devices with the help of scientists from Pakistan, Russia, and China.
The damage even a low yield &quot;junk&quot; nuclear device would do to New York
- with an estimated 250,000 dead in several days.
The remarkable story of two British secret agents who penetrated al-
Qaida's camps in Afghanistan - and reported to Britain that the terror
group was finishing work on radiological weapons.
The stunning admission of the head of Britain's MI5 who confirmed that
&quot;renegade&quot; scientists had provided al-Qaida with the knowledge they
needed to build a nuclear device.
New Jersey: the strange case of a Pakistani who died of radiological
poisoning soon after 9/11, a man who had apparently served as a &quot;mule&quot;
to transport the deadly material into the U.S.
Axis of Evil: the secret alliance between al-Qaida and Iran that
brings together two religious groups with one common goal: destroying
the U.S.
Interestingly, Williams claims that despite Homeland Security Advisor,
Frances Townsends July 17th assertion that we have captured or killed
two-thirds of Al-Qaida's leadership from 9/11, &quot;only one member of bin
Laden's shura - or high command - has been killed.&quot; So again I ask,
can Americans trust the intelligence gathered by the various agencies
of the federal government? Is there credible evidence that al-Qaida
currently possess nuclear weapons within the United States?

Recently, a Virginia company was able to acquire a nuclear license
granting them the permission to purchase machines containing Americium
241 and Cesium 137. Both are radioactive elements that could too
easily create a non-fissible bomb that spreads radiation over an
extensive area. Although this company was set up by the U.S.
government to test the ability of individuals to purchase enough
nuclear material to build a bomb, it demonstrates that there still
remains serious safety concerns post 9/11. &quot;Although we (Investigators
from the Government Accountability Office) had no legitimate use for
the machines, our investigators received, within days of obtaining a
license from NRC, price quotes and terms of payment that would have
allowed us to purchase numerous machines containing sealed radioactive
source materials.&quot;

This disturbing news comes after a June 2007 report in which the FBI
revealed the name of Adnan Gulshair el-Shukrijumah being al-Qaida's
operational leader on a nuclear plot targeting the United States.
Authorities believe that El-Shrukrijumah is &quot;reportedly the man Usama
bin Laden tapped to lead a previous plot to detonate nuclear bombs
simultaneously in several U.S. cities.&quot; However Intelligence officials
claim that &quot;although al-Qaida created a team to develop nuclear terror
plots targeting American cities, the organization has to date been
unable to acquire the key materials necessary to carry out such
attacks.&quot; Adnan Gulshair el-Shukrijumah is a Saudi Born al-Qaida
operative who currently remains at large and quite possibly residing
within the United States. The State Department is offering up to $5
million dollars for information about current location through the
Rewards for Justice Program however, they have yet to receive any
pertinent information. El-Shrukijumah has reportedly spent fifteen
years in the United States and has a mother who currently resides in
Florida. Although the FBI is not sure whether el-Shrukrijumah is
working alone or if he is acting in concert with others as part of a
terrorist cell, they believe that &quot;he may play a large and leading
role in the next set of terrorist attacks inside the United States.&quot;

With all of these revelations, as well as the recently foiled
terrorist attacks here and abroad; how is it that the majority of
Americans remain confident that our National Security is sufficient
enough to prevent another atrocity from occurring on U.S. soil? Can we
currently afford to allow politicians on both sides of the isle to use
the Intelligence agencies as a tool to cast blame and create fear? Has
the Iraq War Issue completely taken our focus off of protecting the
United States from an even larger, more horrific terrorist attack then
that of 9/11? How can we continue to support our elected officials
when they hold our very lives with contempt?

As a Nation we must not fail to recognize the serious and explicit
threats to our homeland. We must not allow the media and politicians
to hijack and streamline their rhetoric on the back of what is
believed as credible intelligence. These strategic assessments should
be used as they were purposely designed, which is to help policy
makers develop and prioritize government actions. Furthermore, we as a
Nation must quickly come to grips with regard to the overall safety of
our daily lives. We must not forget that there are still many issues
such as Immigration Reform and Border Patrol that are vitally
important to the direct safety of our cities and villages. We must do
this with constant regard to maintaining the delicate balance between
civil liberties and the ability of the government to protect American
Lives.
