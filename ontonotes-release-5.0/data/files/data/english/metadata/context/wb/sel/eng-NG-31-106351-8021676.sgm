Psychic Phenomena Proves Life after Death

Science has continued ceaselessly in search of evidence to confirm
life after death. But the problem is that, with all its highly
advanced technology, science still has not been able to devise the
instruments which are sensitive enough to receive the ultra-high
frequencies emanating from these higher vibrationary planes of being.

Can the existence of this life beyond the grave be proven, then? Why,
of course, yes! But it will depend largely upon each individual's own
estimation of what to him constitutes sufficient proof.

To some, the vague teachings and veiled references in Scripture are
enough evidence, so they say. Well and good. However, as it relates to
the many, the lives they lead belie their positive assertions of their
faith, for they continue to cling to this life and lust for the things
of this world in direct contravention to their professed expectation
of a far better life in heaven. If only these people could be more
firm in their convictions, perhaps the world would be better.

Clearly, there is a very real need to reinforce man's wavering faith
in the true life. Psychic phenomena in their different forms and
varied aspects could fill this need. It would be to our best advantage
to try and learn all that we can about these erstwhile-unexplored
areas of human experience. And with our increased knowledge, we shall
be able to overcome even the fears and the superstitions that have
kept us in utter confusion in the past.

Since the early days, God and His angels have been communicating with
men through the prophets and seers. Today, we know these same
instruments of the Divine as plain mediums and psychics. These mediums
and psychics are simply humans like us who have developed their
psychic faculties to a very high degree. And as far as the heaven life
is concerned, who best can tell us except those angels who are the
permanent residents, there.

Today, there are so many various methods of communication that may be
availed of. The more elementary of these relate to the use of the
ouija board, the employment of tables to rap out Morse Code-like
messages, as in the case of the early Spiritualists, and the speaking
in tongues of the Christians and Charismatics. However, owing to their
very limited nature and because the messages are often unclear and
incomprehensible, the resulting communications have not been
exceptionally useful.

But the communications become clearer and more effective depending on
the character and spiritual readiness of the person seeking to
communicate. &quot;The pure in heart will always be able to see God.&quot;
Provided one is morally upright and properly trained, one might try
and do automatic writing. This form of communication is effected by
allowing higher intelligences, usually Spirit guides, to have free use
of one's writing hand. Others may prefer to communicate through trance
mediums. Some, as illustrated in the Bible, are induced to dream while
others are imparted visions. Today, many are clairvoyant and they can
see far more than what the physical eye can see, and clairaudient,
able to hear sounds which are beyond the ear's capacity to hear. And
then there are those who have developed their telepathic abilities.

Some have obtained to their insights seemingly by accident. There are
those who have been mysteriously transported to the Other World even
while their physical bodies lay lifeless and they were being declared
clinically dead by their doctors. However, they were able to tell
their unforgettable stories after they were subsequently revived and
brought back to life.

The more spiritually awakened however, as part of their development,
are allowed to visit the higher worlds on a more voluntary basis. They
are able to disengage themselves from their physical vehicles and,
thus freed, are able to travel to planes and dimensions beyond the
physical and return unharmed while in full retention of the memory of
their journey. The Hindu and Buddhist adepts, a few yogis and
Christian mystics and many Spiritualists and Spiritists are able to
perform such astral travelling or undertake out-of-body-experiences.
And through them, men in the world are better informed. In these
modern times, these occurrences are not as rare as many would believe.
It is only that, due to man's tendency to condemn those who express
new ideas and concepts, the truth is guarded if not totally silenced.
But the truth will out.

Today, we need not cower in fear of the unknown like little children
afraid of the dark. Really, there is nothing to fear provided our
motives are sincere. Likewise, we need not remain perpetually in
ignorance. Instead, let us be open to the Light. Let us be rid of all
the misinformation and the superstitions. Psychic abilities and
perceptions can be utilized to obtain more accurate information that
will enable us to understand God's Kingdom better.

There truly is life after death. Heaven is real although existing in
an altogether different dimension. And there, where life and happiness
are without end, we will be reaping all the fruits of our labor. All
that we have deserved will be ours to enjoy. The conditions of life
beyond need no longer remain vague and unverified to the earnest
seeker, because the proofs are now more readily available. Provided we
are genuinely motivated, and persistent and patient enough in our
search, we will always be able to find all the proofs we need.

This is just a veiled admission that gods are nothing more than the figments
of peoples imaginations.

Mike, please don't be drawn into following suit
when people moronically spout nonsense.  The bit
you included, above, is self-evidently stupid.
If instruments are not capable of receiving the
&quot;ultra-high frequencies emanating...&quot; then how
is one supposed to know that there are ultra-high
frequencies emanating?  Dooh.  _____________Marty
