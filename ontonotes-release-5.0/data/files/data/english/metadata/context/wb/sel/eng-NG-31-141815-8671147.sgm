I just managed to send a message to AB2006 without a single word from myself
in it (Harry, I wish you could¹ve caught it).  Here is what I meant to send.
---------------------

Just so everyone knows, Shirely Kressel (see her message below) is one of
the smartest people in Boston, and I will always have respect for her
opinions, which I share in 99.99% of cases.

But sometimes people can just view one and the same issue from different
angles, reach different conclusions, and still be right.  (Actually, there
in no such thing, in my opinion, as being 100% right on anything.
Intellectual rigidity is very much an enemy of progress.  We need to defend
certain principles, but also be open minded about fine-tuning them.  For
example, stealing is bad, but if I had to steal something to save someone¹s
life I would.)

Shirely¹s point, quite valid, is that we should not be putting up with bad
development (private, public, or institutional) in exchange for community
benefits, because from the moral standpoint it¹s like accepting a bribe for
something that should not be happening in the first place.  On the face of
it, it¹s hard to disagree with it.

In my observation, the prospect of community benefits also tends to divide
the neighborhood as benefits-seekers are willing to close their eyes to
somebody else in the neighborhood getting ³screwed², in exchange for
benefits that matter to them (e.g., support for a Little League here, help
for a Historical Society there, a contribution to a school, a Board of
Trade, etc., etc.).

I have been analyzing these moral dilemmas in my mind for years now, and
this is what I think (now ­ until someone can persuade me otherwise):

1. There is no new institutional development that has no negative impact on
somebody or something.
2. New institutional development will happen in and around Boston because
this is a city of big institutions with neighborhoods squeezed in between
(and they will, unfortunately, keep getting squeezed);
3. New institutional development is impossible to structure in in ways that
are all positive because institutions are exempt from zoning.

CONCLUSION: if an institution is exempt from zoning and by definition has a
right to negatively impact the neighborhood (according to the laws we have),
and the law says that the neighborhood can¹t sue the institution or the City
for the negative impacts ‹ then I don¹t see accepting well thought-through
community benefits, at a right time in the process, as a bribe.

We can, and should still fight for ³good² development ‹ but getting
mitigation for something that in many cases is inevitable (because Harvard
and BC own certain lands and WILL develop them) is not in itself repulsive,
unethical, or undesirable as far as I am concerned.  (What I am opposed to
is the institution using potential benefits to drum up support for bad
development from people who are not going to be affected by it.)

If one were to be rigid about these things (as in ³we must never accept any
benefits from Harvard or BC²), Allston would not have gotten a beautiful
library where kids and adults can productively spend time and widen their
horizons (which makes the community and individual lives better).  I would
not have given up on that library just for the sake of a general, albeit
well-intentioned, principle.

With respect to large private developments, things can get very tricky with
community benefits ‹ because it sometimes means that the development gets
bigger in order to pay for those benefits.  But I think that in many cases
those developments get to be a certain size ‹ benefits or no benefits.  So
if the neighborhood can¹t stop a big development, I don¹t see a problem with
structuring mitigation that benefits those who are most impacted.

This is what happened with the Chestnut Hill Waterworks.  The state had to
sell the parcel adjacent to the Reservoir to finance the preservation of
exquisite, historic buildings (otherwise we would¹ve lost them; the state
didn¹t have millions of dollars to restore and manage them).  The land got
rezoned and the new zoning envelope (which we fought to keep reasonable, and
lowered the height from proposed 120 feet to half of that) permitted a
sizeable building.

But we also fought to have the building well-designed, and removed from the
Reservoir as far as possible.  We got everything that was important to the
community ‹ and on top of that fantastic community benefits  that will soon
come to fruition and be a tremendous asset in the neighborhood.  Those
benefits include funds for improving the Reservoir, and inside of one of the
historic buildings, a Public Space Unit with a Museum and community space ­
in a neighborhood where there is currently no culture whatoseover and no
community space.

Without those benefits, the new building would¹ve been built just as big
because that¹s what the zoning allowed.  It ended up being a great
development with great benefits.

With all due respect, if Shirley and others who think similarly on this
issue, were in charge of that Waterworks development community process, we
would have most certainly ended up with the new development as it is, but no
benefits.  As a long-term resident of this area, I want all the best for
this neighborhood.  So I am glad that we didn¹t sacrifice our neighborhood
needs on the altar of a principle.

Each development and each IMP are different, and have lots of nuances to
ponder.  Nuances require nuanced thinking.  Just my modest opinion.

I do not know Ms. Kressel, but agree with her or not she does make
sense. I do not know Ms. Webster. After reading her reply, she could,
in my opinion use a course in logic. I can be 100% right on something
intellectual (1 + 1= 2). I asked Ms. Webster to explain something she
said about me. I never got a reply.
I will ask her another question. Why did you buy a house in an area
that is heavily populated with students?

Mr. Thompson:

I do not know you either -- and I don't have any obligation to be answering
a personal question that a complete stranger is hurling at me on a public
internet forum.  It¹s none of your business why I settled down in Brighton.
Decisions like that are made for a range of reasons, none of them for public
consumption.  It¹s boorish to demand that people confess them to you.

The neighborhood where I live ‹ in fact all of Allston-Brighton -- is for
everyone, not just for students.  The vast majority of people living in my
neighborhood are NOT students.  Are you suggesting that they should have
never moved here?  Thank goodness for people who want to be homeowners here.
(According to your logic, you should be also asking students why they live
in a neighborhood full of non-students.)

I ask you to stop your emails in which you focus on me personally instead of
issues.  You appear to be fixated on the least important things that I
wrote, or didn¹t write, and make your indignation everyone else¹s business.

I did not answer you previous query because I thought it was pointless.  You
asked me to explain to you again what I had already conveyed clearly in the
previous posting (that if everyone thought that things that have never been
done are undoable, there would be no progress).  I did not know how to
explain it any more clearly.  Either a person gets it or not.

Your comment yesterday that ³1+1=2 is 100% right², and therefore I need a
course in logic, further suggests that our minds are are too different to
understand each other.  I wasn¹t talking about math.  I was talking about
complex, multi-faceted issues that straddle institutional needs, zoning,
development, politics, ethics, the law, and the sphere of human needs in the
neighborhood.  Issues like that do not lend themselves to rigid, black &amp;
white answers.

Human brain craves easy answers, but our reality is just too complicated for
that.  Right and wrong are in fact relative terms.

Please don¹t ask me what I meant by the previous sentence.  I don¹t think
that you and I should be discussing this on this forum. and even less so
directly.  I might welcome that if I thought you¹re truly open-minded.

I think this exchange between Eva and Shirley is bringing forth some
great arguments and discussion on the issue of community benefits.
Perhaps we should have a community forum in the coming months where this
issue is discussed in person.

Subject: [AB2006] Community benefits issue

I just managed to send a message to AB2006 without a single word from
myself in it (Harry, I wish you could've caught it).  Here is what I
meant to send.
---------------------

Just so everyone knows, Shirely Kressel (see her message below) is one
of the smartest people in Boston, and I will always have respect for her
opinions, which I share in 99.99% of cases.

But sometimes people can just view one and the same issue from different
angles, reach different conclusions, and still be right.  (Actually,
there in no such thing, in my opinion, as being 100% right on anything.
Intellectual rigidity is very much an enemy of progress.  We need to
defend certain principles, but also be open minded about fine-tuning
them.  For example, stealing is bad, but if I had to steal something to
save someone's life I would.)

Shirely's point, quite valid, is that we should not be putting up with
bad development (private, public, or institutional) in exchange for
community benefits, because from the moral standpoint it's like
accepting a bribe for something that should not be happening in the
first place.  On the face of it, it's hard to disagree with it.

In my observation, the prospect of community benefits also tends to
divide the neighborhood as benefits-seekers are willing to close their
eyes to somebody else in the neighborhood getting &quot;screwed&quot;, in exchange
for benefits that matter to them (e.g., support for a Little League
here, help for a Historical Society there, a contribution to a school, a
Board of Trade, etc., etc.).

I have been analyzing these moral dilemmas in my mind for years now, and
this is what I think (now - until someone can persuade me otherwise):

1.      There is no new institutional development that has no negative
impact on somebody or something.
2.      New institutional development will happen in and around Boston
because this is a city of big institutions with neighborhoods squeezed
in between (and they will, unfortunately, keep getting squeezed);
3.      New institutional development is impossible to structure in in
ways that are all positive because institutions are exempt from zoning.

CONCLUSION: if an institution is exempt from zoning and by definition
has a right to negatively impact the neighborhood (according to the laws
we have), and the law says that the neighborhood can't sue the
institution or the City for the negative impacts - then I don't see
accepting well thought-through community benefits, at a right time in
the process, as a bribe.

We can, and should still fight for &quot;good&quot; development - but getting
mitigation for something that in many cases is inevitable (because
Harvard and BC own certain lands and WILL develop them) is not in itself
repulsive, unethical, or undesirable as far as I am concerned.  (What I
am opposed to is the institution using potential benefits to drum up
support for bad development from people who are not going to be affected
by it.)

If one were to be rigid about these things (as in &quot;we must never accept
any benefits from Harvard or BC&quot;), Allston would not have gotten a
beautiful library where kids and adults can productively spend time and
widen their horizons (which makes the community and individual lives
better).  I would not have given up on that library just for the sake of
a general, albeit well-intentioned, principle.

With respect to large private developments, things can get very tricky
with community benefits - because it sometimes means that the
development gets bigger in order to pay for those benefits.  But I think
that in many cases those developments get to be a certain size -
benefits or no benefits.  So if the neighborhood can't stop a big
development, I don't see a problem with structuring mitigation that
benefits those who are most impacted.

This is what happened with the Chestnut Hill Waterworks.  The state had
to sell the parcel adjacent to the Reservoir to finance the preservation
of exquisite, historic buildings (otherwise we would've lost them; the
state didn't have millions of dollars to restore and manage them).  The
land got rezoned and the new zoning envelope (which we fought to keep
reasonable, and lowered the height from proposed 120 feet to half of
that) permitted a sizeable building.

But we also fought to have the building well-designed, and removed from
the Reservoir as far as possible.  We got everything that was important
to the community - and on top of that fantastic community benefits  that
will soon come to fruition and be a tremendous asset in the
neighborhood.  Those benefits include funds for improving the Reservoir,
and inside of one of the historic buildings, a Public Space Unit with a
Museum and community space - in a neighborhood where there is currently
no culture whatoseover and no community space.

Without those benefits, the new building would've been built just as big
because that's what the zoning allowed.  It ended up being a great
development with great benefits.

With all due respect, if Shirley and others who think similarly on this
issue, were in charge of that Waterworks development community process,
we would have most certainly ended up with the new development as it is,
but no benefits.  As a long-term resident of this area, I want all the
best for this neighborhood.  So I am glad that we didn't sacrifice our
neighborhood needs on the altar of a principle.

Each development and each IMP are different, and have lots of nuances to
ponder.  Nuances require nuanced thinking.  Just my modest opinion.

Community benefits issueWell thought out analysis. Eva illustrates the age old conumdrum confronting many social activists-pragmitism or principle.   The issue of Harvard development appeared to be a fait accompli.  Most of us reluctantly realized this from the day we were first cognizant of Harvard's ambitions to colonize Allston.

The logical conclusion is that if the development is insuperable, then perhaps the community should focus on aquiring as many community benefits as possible to minimize the intrusion.  On the other hand, those who maintain that &quot;bad &quot;development must be fought on principle view community benefits as merely crumbs to mitigate the negative impact of that development.  Thus far, Harvard has not even shown the grace to offer those pittances.  Oh wait, I did receive a flyer yesterday informing us about a free lunch and ticket to a football game.  If the game is scheduled at night, we can even participate in disrupting our own neighborhood.  Ha.

Certainly, both stratagies can exist as non-antagonistic contradictions. If I can be permitted to generalize, history has shown us that relying on pragmitism alone can often result in co-optation of principle and less than just results at the end of the day.  Conversely, rigidly adhering solely to principle can result in missed opportunities to collect benefits from an institutional, political or social adversary.

This community posseses some keen thinking individuals who possess the skills to map a strategy that includes both positions.  Though I am not familiar with all the legal options available to communities facing institutional intrusion into a neighborhood, I suspect that a strategy could include such options  It matters not how many high priced lawyers are at the university's disposal; a prolonged court struggle could mean unwanted publicity.  If the bull dozers and trucks begin their dusty march through the neighborhood choking off community standards, will folks be willing to stand against them in some manner.  Will folks be willing to defend their communities with such tactics if their pleas are ignored?  Civil disobediance is an American tradition, but it is asking a lot.

The university has momentum and time on its side; we have our lives and commmunity on ours.  A strategy's objective could be to protract &quot;'bad&quot; development through the courts and on-the-ground community resistance  and yet still press for community benefits when the development is  inevitable and &quot;less bad.&quot;  There is room for both.  Just musing.

Subject: [AB2006] Community benefits issue

I just managed to send a message to AB2006 without a single word from myself in it (Harry, I wish you could've caught it).  Here is what I meant to send.
---------------------

Just so everyone knows, Shirely Kressel (see her message below) is one of the smartest people in Boston, and I will always have respect for her opinions, which I share in 99.99% of cases.

But sometimes people can just view one and the same issue from different angles, reach different conclusions, and still be right.  (Actually, there in no such thing, in my opinion, as being 100% right on anything.  Intellectual rigidity is very much an enemy of progress.  We need to defend certain principles, but also be open minded about fine-tuning them.  For example, stealing is bad, but if I had to steal something to save someone's life I would.)

Shirely's point, quite valid, is that we should not be putting up with bad development (private, public, or institutional) in exchange for community benefits, because from the moral standpoint it's like accepting a bribe for something that should not be happening in the first place.  On the face of it, it's hard to disagree with it.

In my observation, the prospect of community benefits also tends to divide the neighborhood as benefits-seekers are willing to close their eyes to somebody else in the neighborhood getting &quot;screwed&quot;, in exchange for benefits that matter to them (e.g., support for a Little League here, help for a Historical Society there, a contribution to a school, a Board of Trade, etc., etc.).

I have been analyzing these moral dilemmas in my mind for years now, and this is what I think (now - until someone can persuade me otherwise):

1.. There is no new institutional development that has no negative impact on somebody or something.
2.. New institutional development will happen in and around Boston because this is a city of big institutions with neighborhoods squeezed in between (and they will, unfortunately, keep getting squeezed);
3.. New institutional development is impossible to structure in in ways that are all positive because institutions are exempt from zoning.

CONCLUSION: if an institution is exempt from zoning and by definition has a right to negatively impact the neighborhood (according to the laws we have), and the law says that the neighborhood can't sue the institution or the City for the negative impacts - then I don't see accepting well thought-through community benefits, at a right time in the process, as a bribe.

We can, and should still fight for &quot;good&quot; development - but getting mitigation for something that in many cases is inevitable (because Harvard and BC own certain lands and WILL develop them) is not in itself repulsive, unethical, or undesirable as far as I am concerned.  (What I am opposed to is the institution using potential benefits to drum up support for bad development from people who are not going to be affected by it.)

If one were to be rigid about these things (as in &quot;we must never accept any benefits from Harvard or BC&quot;), Allston would not have gotten a beautiful library where kids and adults can productively spend time and widen their horizons (which makes the community and individual lives better).  I would not have given up on that library just for the sake of a general, albeit well-intentioned, principle.

With respect to large private developments, things can get very tricky with community benefits - because it sometimes means that the development gets bigger in order to pay for those benefits.  But I think that in many cases those developments get to be a certain size - benefits or no benefits.  So if the neighborhood can't stop a big development, I don't see a problem with structuring mitigation that benefits those who are most impacted.

This is what happened with the Chestnut Hill Waterworks.  The state had to sell the parcel adjacent to the Reservoir to finance the preservation of exquisite, historic buildings (otherwise we would've lost them; the state didn't have millions of dollars to restore and manage them).  The land got rezoned and the new zoning envelope (which we fought to keep reasonable, and lowered the height from proposed 120 feet to half of that) permitted a sizeable building.

But we also fought to have the building well-designed, and removed from the Reservoir as far as possible.  We got everything that was important to the community - and on top of that fantastic community benefits  that will soon come to fruition and be a tremendous asset in the neighborhood.  Those benefits include funds for improving the Reservoir, and inside of one of the historic buildings, a Public Space Unit with a Museum and community space - in a neighborhood where there is currently no culture whatoseover and no community space.

Without those benefits, the new building would've been built just as big because that's what the zoning allowed.  It ended up being a great development with great benefits.

Eva is dependably a disinterested (not uninterested!) guardian of the public
realm, and her points should be considered carefully.   A community forum on
the benefits issue would be a great opportunity for all perspectives to be
explored, with everyone bringing their own experiences to the discussion.
It can only improve the commmunity's preparation for negotiations.

Let me just comment on one point in Eva's message below:

CONCLUSION: if an institution is exempt from zoning and by definition has a
right to negatively impact the neighborhood (according to the laws we have),
and the law says that the neighborhood can¹t sue the institution or the City
for the negative impacts ‹ then I don¹t see accepting well thought-through
community benefits, at a right time in the process, as a bribe.

Insititutions are not exempt from zoning a priori.  The BRA created a
mechanism for institutions to replace zoning by its approval of their Master
Plans, which then become the &quot;zoning.&quot; *   So, in the negotiations over the
Master Plan, the community can try to influence this &quot;rezoning.&quot;  It is
indeed very hard to sue here for &quot;spot zoning,&quot; because the BRA is the
so-called &quot;planning&quot; body and as such gets to decide what is &quot;consistent&quot;
with the General Plan for the City and therefore not a violation (yet
another reason to re-establish the Planning Board and take planning out of
the redevelopment authority).  But we shouldn't resign ourselves to leaping
straight to the benefits bazaar as our only hope of getting something out of
a &quot;done deal&quot;; we  should decide what, in principle and in specifics, we
will insist on protecting, and organize to do that now.

I suggest we direct our eyes at Mayor Menino, who is managing all this from
behind the curtain (as Paul McCann once explained to the City Council, the
BRA was created to throw people off their land and do all the dirty things
and keep the mayor's hands clean);  at our City Councilors, who should be
forced to take back their planning role, stolen from them by the BRA in
1960, and work for their salary; and at our State legislators, who could be
devising state measures about PILOT, institutional and corporate subsidies
(e.g., through MassDevelopment, see attached), and other diversions of our
tax money from our needs.

If we broaden our conception of the problem, maybe we can find more kinds of
solutions.

*The BRA does the same for developers, using the Plannned Development Area
mechanism (sites of at least an acre, except where developers decide to
count the streets as part of the site), the U-District (where the BRA adds
to the site any bit of its land), and the Chapter 121A &quot;blight&quot; declaration
(where the BRA simply &quot;finds&quot; blight without findings, e.g., the four-star
Irish Jurys Hotel in Back Bay; 121A also exempts the project from property
taxes).

I googled you and found an article in the TAB where you said that you
bought a house and found out that it was in a student area. You said
that you were going to devote your time to fix the area.

&gt; I do not know you either -- and I don't have any obligation to be answering

&gt; internet forum.  It¹s none of your business why I settled down in Brighton.
&gt; Decisions like that are made for a range of reasons, none of them for public
&gt; consumption.  It¹s boorish to demand that people confess them to you.

&gt; The neighborhood where I live ‹ in fact all of Allston-Brighton -- is for
&gt; everyone, not just for students.  The vast majority of people living in my
&gt; neighborhood are NOT students.  Are you suggesting that they should have
&gt; never moved here?  Thank goodness for people who want to be homeowners here.
&gt; (According to your logic, you should be also asking students why they live
&gt; in a neighborhood full of non-students.)

&gt; I ask you to stop your emails in which you focus on me personally instead of
&gt; issues.  You appear to be fixated on the least important things that I
&gt; wrote, or didn¹t write, and make your indignation everyone else¹s business.

&gt; I did not answer you previous query because I thought it was pointless.  You
&gt; asked me to explain to you again what I had already conveyed clearly in the
&gt; previous posting (that if everyone thought that things that have never been
&gt; done are undoable, there would be no progress).  I did not know how to
&gt; explain it any more clearly.  Either a person gets it or not.

&gt; Your comment yesterday that ³1+1=2 is 100% right², and therefore I need a
&gt; course in logic, further suggests that our minds are are too different to
&gt; understand each other.  I wasn¹t talking about math.  I was talking about
&gt; complex, multi-faceted issues that straddle institutional needs, zoning,
&gt; development, politics, ethics, the law, and the sphere of human needs in the
&gt; neighborhood.  Issues like that do not lend themselves to rigid, black &amp;
&gt; white answers.

&gt; Human brain craves easy answers, but our reality is just too complicated for
&gt; that.  Right and wrong are in fact relative terms.

&gt; Please don¹t ask me what I meant by the previous sentence.  I don¹t think
&gt; that you and I should be discussing this on this forum. and even less so
&gt; directly.  I might welcome that if I thought you¹re truly open-minded.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Each development and each IMP are different, and have lots of nuances to
&gt; &gt;&gt; ponder.  Nuances require nuanced thinking.  Just my modest opinion.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true of development in general.  Good development should be

Hi folks,

Just a note on the recent flavor of the recent emails concerning Eva.

It appears to me that the personal motivations, politics and choices of Eva,
Shirley or anyone else in the Group is not really germane to this discussion
unless an egregious activity could identified and construed as a conflict of
interest.  Since this is obviously not the case, it would behoove us to move
on.  Such discussions might be appropriate in an informal setting over beers
or something like that, but it distracts us from the task a hand.  Both of
these women bring a lot to the table.

I am only peripherally involved in this issue thus far for a number of
reasons, but I have see this play before.  Unless folks develop a cohesive,
fluid strategy with concrete objectives to engage the University as it is
now and  then as it dances around like some whirling dervish winking and
nodding at the BRA, this project will be a colassal waste of time for
residents.  At some point and God forbid, we are outmanuevered from apathy
of intimidiation,  residents might as well go inside their homes and turn up
the volume on the television or radio to drown out what is occuring outside
on the street.

That would be a tragedy.

Regards,

I googled you and found an article in the TAB where you said that you
bought a house and found out that it was in a student area. You said
that you were going to devote your time to fix the area.

&gt; &gt; I will ask her another question. Why did you buy a house in an area
&gt; &gt; that is heavily populated with students?
&gt; &gt; John Thompson

&gt; Mr. Thompson:

&gt; I do not know you either -- and I don't have any obligation to be
&gt; answering
&gt; a personal question that a complete stranger is hurling at me on a public
&gt; internet forum.  It¹s none of your business why I settled down in
&gt; Brighton.
&gt; Decisions like that are made for a range of reasons, none of them for
&gt; public
&gt; consumption.  It¹s boorish to demand that people confess them to you.

&gt; The neighborhood where I live &lt; in fact all of Allston-Brighton -- is for
&gt; everyone, not just for students.  The vast majority of people living in my
&gt; neighborhood are NOT students.  Are you suggesting that they should have
&gt; never moved here?  Thank goodness for people who want to be homeowners
&gt; here.
&gt; (According to your logic, you should be also asking students why they live
&gt; in a neighborhood full of non-students.)

&gt; I ask you to stop your emails in which you focus on me personally instead
&gt; of
&gt; issues.  You appear to be fixated on the least important things that I
&gt; wrote, or didn¹t write, and make your indignation everyone else¹s
&gt; business.

&gt; I did not answer you previous query because I thought it was pointless.
&gt; You
&gt; asked me to explain to you again what I had already conveyed clearly in
&gt; the
&gt; previous posting (that if everyone thought that things that have never
&gt; been
&gt; done are undoable, there would be no progress).  I did not know how to
&gt; explain it any more clearly.  Either a person gets it or not.

&gt; Your comment yesterday that ³1+1=2 is 100% right², and therefore I need a
&gt; course in logic, further suggests that our minds are are too different to
&gt; understand each other.  I wasn¹t talking about math.  I was talking about
&gt; complex, multi-faceted issues that straddle institutional needs, zoning,
&gt; development, politics, ethics, the law, and the sphere of human needs in
&gt; the
&gt; neighborhood.  Issues like that do not lend themselves to rigid, black &amp;
&gt; white answers.

&gt; Human brain craves easy answers, but our reality is just too complicated
&gt; for
&gt; that.  Right and wrong are in fact relative terms.

&gt; Please don¹t ask me what I meant by the previous sentence.  I don¹t think
&gt; that you and I should be discussing this on this forum. and even less so
&gt; directly.  I might welcome that if I thought you¹re truly open-minded.

&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------

&gt; &gt;&gt; Just so everyone knows, Shirely Kressel (see her message below) is one
&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the smartest people in Boston, and I will always have respect for her
&gt; &gt;&gt; opinions, which I share in 99.99% of cases.

&gt; &gt;&gt; But sometimes people can just view one and the same issue from
&gt; &gt;&gt; different
&gt; &gt;&gt; angles, reach different conclusions, and still be right.  (Actually,
&gt; &gt;&gt; there
&gt; &gt;&gt; in no such thing, in my opinion, as being 100% right on anything.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Intellectual rigidity is very much an enemy of progress.  We need to
&gt; &gt;&gt; defend
&gt; &gt;&gt; certain principles, but also be open minded about fine-tuning them.
&gt; &gt;&gt; For
&gt; &gt;&gt; example, stealing is bad, but if I had to steal something to save
&gt; &gt;&gt; someone¹s
&gt; &gt;&gt; life I would.)

&gt; &gt;&gt; Shirely¹s point, quite valid, is that we should not be putting up with
&gt; &gt;&gt; bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; development (private, public, or institutional) in exchange for
&gt; &gt;&gt; community
&gt; &gt;&gt; benefits, because from the moral standpoint it¹s like accepting a bribe
&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; something that should not be happening in the first place.  On the face
&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; it, it¹s hard to disagree with it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; In my observation, the prospect of community benefits also tends to
&gt; &gt;&gt; divide
&gt; &gt;&gt; the neighborhood as benefits-seekers are willing to close their eyes to
&gt; &gt;&gt; somebody else in the neighborhood getting ³screwed², in exchange for
&gt; &gt;&gt; benefits that matter to them (e.g., support for a Little League here,
&gt; &gt;&gt; help
&gt; &gt;&gt; for a Historical Society there, a contribution to a school, a Board of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Trade, etc., etc.).

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been analyzing these moral dilemmas in my mind for years now,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; this is what I think (now - until someone can persuade me otherwise):

&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. There is no new institutional development that has no negative
&gt; &gt;&gt; impact on
&gt; &gt;&gt; somebody or something.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. New institutional development will happen in and around Boston
&gt; &gt;&gt; because
&gt; &gt;&gt; this is a city of big institutions with neighborhoods squeezed in
&gt; &gt;&gt; between
&gt; &gt;&gt; (and they will, unfortunately, keep getting squeezed);
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. New institutional development is impossible to structure in in ways
&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; are all positive because institutions are exempt from zoning.

&gt; &gt;&gt; CONCLUSION: if an institution is exempt from zoning and by definition
&gt; &gt;&gt; has a
&gt; &gt;&gt; right to negatively impact the neighborhood (according to the laws we
&gt; &gt;&gt; have),
&gt; &gt;&gt; and the law says that the neighborhood can¹t sue the institution or the
&gt; &gt;&gt; City
&gt; &gt;&gt; for the negative impacts &lt; then I don¹t see accepting well
&gt; &gt;&gt; thought-through
&gt; &gt;&gt; community benefits, at a right time in the process, as a bribe.

&gt; &gt;&gt; We can, and should still fight for ³good² development &lt; but getting
&gt; &gt;&gt; mitigation for something that in many cases is inevitable (because
&gt; &gt;&gt; Harvard
&gt; &gt;&gt; and BC own certain lands and WILL develop them) is not in itself
&gt; &gt;&gt; repulsive,
&gt; &gt;&gt; unethical, or undesirable as far as I am concerned.  (What I am opposed
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; is the institution using potential benefits to drum up support for bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; development from people who are not going to be affected by it.)

&gt; &gt;&gt; If one were to be rigid about these things (as in ³we must never accept
&gt; &gt;&gt; any
&gt; &gt;&gt; benefits from Harvard or BC²), Allston would not have gotten a
&gt; &gt;&gt; beautiful
&gt; &gt;&gt; library where kids and adults can productively spend time and widen
&gt; &gt;&gt; their
&gt; &gt;&gt; horizons (which makes the community and individual lives better).  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; would
&gt; &gt;&gt; not have given up on that library just for the sake of a general,
&gt; &gt;&gt; albeit
&gt; &gt;&gt; well-intentioned, principle.

&gt; &gt;&gt; With respect to large private developments, things can get very tricky
&gt; &gt;&gt; with
&gt; &gt;&gt; community benefits &lt; because it sometimes means that the development
&gt; &gt;&gt; gets
&gt; &gt;&gt; bigger in order to pay for those benefits.  But I think that in many
&gt; &gt;&gt; cases
&gt; &gt;&gt; those developments get to be a certain size &lt; benefits or no benefits.
&gt; &gt;&gt; So
&gt; &gt;&gt; if the neighborhood can¹t stop a big development, I don¹t see a problem
&gt; &gt;&gt; with
&gt; &gt;&gt; structuring mitigation that benefits those who are most impacted.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is what happened with the Chestnut Hill Waterworks.  The state had
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; sell the parcel adjacent to the Reservoir to finance the preservation
&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; exquisite, historic buildings (otherwise we would¹ve lost them; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; state
&gt; &gt;&gt; didn¹t have millions of dollars to restore and manage them).  The land
&gt; &gt;&gt; got
&gt; &gt;&gt; rezoned and the new zoning envelope (which we fought to keep
&gt; &gt;&gt; reasonable, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; lowered the height from proposed 120 feet to half of that) permitted a
&gt; &gt;&gt; sizeable building.

&gt; &gt;&gt; But we also fought to have the building well-designed, and removed from
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Reservoir as far as possible.  We got everything that was important to
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; community &lt; and on top of that fantastic community benefits  that will
&gt; &gt;&gt; soon
&gt; &gt;&gt; come to fruition and be a tremendous asset in the neighborhood.  Those
&gt; &gt;&gt; benefits include funds for improving the Reservoir, and inside of one
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; historic buildings, a Public Space Unit with a Museum and community
&gt; &gt;&gt; space -
&gt; &gt;&gt; in a neighborhood where there is currently no culture whatoseover

I forgot: Jurys Hotel was found blighted for a TIF tax waiver, not for a
121A.

But there about two dozen major commercial and luxury housing projects in
Boston to which the 121A  &quot;blight&quot;-justified zoning and tax exemption was
applied, including the FleetCenter, One Beacon, the Prudential Center, the
Landmark Center, Genzyme, Harvard's MATEP (Medical Area Total Energy Plant).
etc.  Although they make some negotiated payment, it's a fraction of the
real tax.   See Boston Herald report attached.

*The BRA does the same for developers, using the Plannned Development Area
mechanism (sites of at least an acre, except where developers decide to
count the streets as part of the site), the U-District (where the BRA adds
to the site any bit of its land), and the Chapter 121A &quot;blight&quot; declaration
(where the BRA simply &quot;finds&quot; blight without findings, e.g., the four-star
Irish Jurys Hotel in Back Bay; 121A also exempts the project from property
taxes).
