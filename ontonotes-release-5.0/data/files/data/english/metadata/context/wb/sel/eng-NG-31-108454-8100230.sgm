The religious police and the Syariah Courts have nowgiven their views on the matter of her personal faith. To them she is andalways will be Muslim.She turns up in court clearly wearing the
symbols of being a Hindu and hassworn that she is not a Muslim; and never was. But who is the definer of thetruth and who is the enforcer? Now, to really enforce the decision, is itnow the responsibility of the Syariah Department to set up a criminaldivision to enforce their law? How else can they do it? I thought this wasthe very reason that the police advised the state government in Terengganunot to enforce the so-called Syariah Islamic Administration in the statebecause the police have no authority to enforce it, under our Constitution?Where are we heading?What has really changed? Or, are we now saying that the Islamic religiousdepartment can enforce their ruling that she live with her grandparents?Have they become the new moral and religious police in the public spaces ofMalaysia? But really, under which
jurisdiction and is it still consistentwith the Federal Constitution? Come on Malaysia, where are we reallyheading?The word and concept of 'secular,' was always used by the Constitutionaldrafters to define our document of destiny. It does not mean being&quot;anti-religious&quot; or &quot;anti-theistic&quot; but rather denies that any one specificand particular religious worldview of right and wrong was the guiding andsole parameter for the rules and regulations of Malaysia. Another way tounderstand it is that the Federal Constitution is religion-neutral whenenforcing its principle and articles.Therefore, in the specific case of Syariah law, the ninth schedule clearlydefined its status within the state enactments. It was designed to
belimited to private and personal family matters, wherein such laws alreadyexist for procedures to fulfill some Islamic teaching.Therefore, while the Constitution is secular, in its reading andinterpretation of rights, the framers' worldviews were not atheistic. We cantherefore view the secular as always a subset of a sacred worldview. Thelate Tun Suffian quote I used in the last column clearly defines that thereis a clear and specific domain in which reason and logic of universal truthforms provide the underlying basis of laws and regulations, rather than thedictates of any one specific worldview.Often, these guiding values are &quot;the mores of the culture,&quot; or the&quot;morality&quot; of that particular culture at any point in time is what reignsin public space. Such public space morality is always defined premised uponreligious values, and especially originating from many religious valuesystems which are commonly

Usuallythey are a local, global and of universal value.Secular systemAs such, as crafted in our secular Constitution, even the words, &quot;Islam asthe religion of the Federation&quot; cannot be used to create an over-ridingvalue system for our civic rules and regulations.

conscience. This was never intended bythe framers of the Constitution.How can we possibly have a case where a person who says she is a Hindu butis put in rehabilitation for six months under the Islamic ReligiousDepartment. The case is fundamentally really no different than the Lina Joycase, with a slight twist. Now that Revathi is released with certainconditions, my question is who is responsible to &quot;enforce the decision?&quot;What if her elderly parents cannot enforce the conditions; or do not want toenforce these conditions, do we put them in prison as well underrehabilitation?After all, as she has stated, after her time in rehabilitation; she is notever going to become a Muslim, try as much as they all want. What then isthe real resolution? For her to migrate as well to another country? Whatabout her personal rights and civil liberties as a citizen?Or, is the government-based religious department willing to
confine her tolife imprisonment? Would that be within the law of the land? Is that whatIslam is really all about; faith practiced through force and compulsion?Surely not, because there is no compulsion in Islam! How then does onerationalise all this that is happening in the 21st century? Maybe it is timefor all civil-minded and moderate Malaysian citizens to hold a peace marchfor Revathi.

They have nofederal power of the law on such matters which are not criminal but seem totreat people as if they are criminals. Things are really getting out ofhand, and I believe that the nation must not be careless with what ishappening, as we are fanning emotions among the

The current crop of the Rulers'Council are all well trained and studied in matters of the law.Raja Nazrin, the Regent of Perak, has already made his very cleararticulation to defend the dignity of the Constitution. Maybe the BarCouncil must consider a civil action suit to test the Constitutionality ofthe
Revathi case and many other cases wherein the Federal Constitutionalrights and privileges of basic civil liberties which are guaranteed andprotected, are being abused in the name of religion.------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -KJ John served in public service for 30 years and took optional retirementto work in his own consulting group.

i am a hindu.and i want to be fair.i want to comment on siti fatimah aka revathi's case. btw, siti fatimah is the legal name. she was born when her christian parents converted to Islam. so she is a muslim by birth. her parents gave her to her grand parents to be brought up. it is her parents who are being irresponsible here. they shud have decided on her religious status before giving her to her hindu grandparents to be brought up when she was a child.. siti fatimah aka revathi is caught in a trap for no mistake of her. and we cant go on blaming the family of siti fatimah.  this is where we expect the HINDU SANGAM AND MIC  to come in and sort out the matter. and after the lina joy case, it is difficult to get a verdict favourable to siti fatimah aka revathi from the syariah court. the syariah courts are just interpreting the law. cases like siti fatimah aka revathi can only be settled via negotiations by our indian reps in govt. i wonder why we have MIC and HINDU SANGAM
for? warming the seats and enjoying the big fat pay and perks, perhaps

Whither Malaysia
KJ John Jul 10, 07 12:17pm

Some thing is going fundamentally very wrong in Malaysia today. We have a
written 50- year-old Federal and Secular Constitution which clearly defines
the limits of jurisdiction of Islamic or Syariah law as, it applies only to
personal and family matters.

But, it appears that there are more and more cases of jurisdictional abuse
by the religious or morality police, called the Majlis Agama Islam. The most
recent cases were the &quot;abuse&quot; of a Malay singer in Ipoh for being improperly
attired and the raid on Indian restaurants for displaying different
religious symbols. These are not personal and family matters. They are civil
and public square issues.

Last week, we had the release of M Revathi from an Islamic rehabilitation
centre. She was born to Muslim parents, grew up as a Hindu with her
grandparents, claims to be one and was married to another Hindu and the
couple have a child. Recently she was taken into custody for rehabilitation
for almost six months.

Her case in the Civil Court was up for hearing but she was released before
that. The attempt to cleverly release her made the matter only an academic
one, according to the judge. The matter is more than academic, and I am
sorry that the judge found the easy way out.

The case involves fundamental liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and
abused by the Islamic religious department. It also shows their insincerity
and lack of willingness to test the jurisdictional issue before the federal
civil courts of law. The religious police and the Syariah Courts have now
given their views on the matter of her personal faith. To them she is and
always will be Muslim.

She turns up in court clearly wearing the symbols of being a Hindu and has
sworn that she is not a Muslim; and never was. But who is the definer of the

now the responsibility of the Syariah Department to set up a criminal
division to enforce their law? How else can they do it? I thought this was
the very reason that the police advised the state government in Terengganu
not to enforce the so-called Syariah Islamic Administration in the state
because the police have no authority to enforce it, under our Constitution?

Where are we heading?

What has really changed? Or, are we now saying that the Islamic religious
department can enforce their ruling that she live with her grandparents?
Have they become the new moral and religious police in the public spaces of
Malaysia? But really, under which jurisdiction and is it still consistent
with the Federal Constitution? Come on Malaysia, where are we really
heading?

The word and concept of 'secular,' was always used by the Constitutional
drafters to define our document of destiny. It does not mean being
&quot;anti-religious&quot; or &quot;anti-theistic&quot; but rather denies that any one specific
and particular religious worldview of right and wrong was the guiding and

Therefore, while the Constitution is secular, in its reading and
interpretation of rights, the framers' worldviews were not atheistic. We can
therefore view the secular as always a subset of a sacred worldview. The
late Tun Suffian quote I used in the last column clearly defines that there
is a clear and specific domain in which reason and logic of universal truth
forms provide the underlying basis of laws and regulations, rather than the
dictates of any one specific worldview.

Often, these guiding values are &quot;the mores of the culture,&quot; or the
&quot;morality&quot; of that particular culture at any point in time is what reigns
in public space. Such public space morality is always defined premised upon
religious values, and especially originating from many religious value
systems which are commonly accepted as agreeable by the culture. Usually
they are a local, global and of universal value.

Secular system

As such, as crafted in our secular Constitution, even the words, &quot;Islam as

value system for our civic rules and regulations. That would be arbitrary

related Articles. For, even within the same Article, the roles of every
other religion of the federation and their concomitant freedoms of worship
are equally protected and preserved. Moreover the freedom of worship is
recognised as a personal and private matter in Article 11.

Therefore, whether we like it or not, our current Federal Constitution
guarantees our multi-religious framework of existence and we can therefore
only remain a secular system, in the purest meaning of what is secular.

Real politick would dictate that unless we can amend major segments of the
Federal Constitution with a two-thirds majority; and the Rulers Council
agrees, there can be no major changes in this specific construction of the
Constitution. Thereby, even an idealist party like PAS may have to
realistically refine their mission to realise that their vision of an
Islamic state in Malaysia can only operate within the constraints of the
current Federal Constitution. This is purely a rational and legal position

The case of Revathi has now hit the world press and has demonstrated the
current confusion in Malaysia's judicial system; and the full and apparent
existence of two standards of justice in the public spaces of life - one for

personal and family matters.

But, it appears that there are more and more cases of jurisdictional abuse
by the religious or morality police, called the Majlis Agama Islam. The most
recent cases were the &quot;abuse&quot; of a Malay singer in Ipoh for being improperly
attired and the raid on Indian restaurants for displaying different
religious symbols. These are not personal and family matters. They are civil
and public square issues.

Last week, we had the release of M Revathi from an Islamic rehabilitation
centre. She was born to Muslim parents, grew up as a Hindu with her
grandparents, claims to be one and was married to another Hindu and the
couple have a child. Recently she was taken into custody for rehabilitation
for almost six months.

Her case in the Civil Court was up for hearing but she was released before
that. The attempt to cleverly release her made the matter only an academic
one, according to the judge. The matter is more than academic, and I am
sorry that the judge found the easy way out.

The case involves fundamental liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and
abused by the Islamic religious department. It also shows their insincerity
and lack of willingness to test the jurisdictional issue before the federal
civil courts of law. The religious police and the Syariah Courts have now
given their views on the matter of her personal faith. To them she is and
always will be Muslim.

She turns up in court clearly wearing the symbols of being a Hindu and has
sworn that she is not a Muslim; and never was. But who is the definer of the
truth and who is the enforcer? Now, to really enforce the decision, is it
now the responsibility of the Syariah Department to set up a criminal
division to enforce their law? How else can they do it? I thought this was
the very reason that the police advised the state government in Terengganu
not to enforce the so-called Syariah Islamic Administration in the state
because the police have no authority to enforce it, under our Constitution?

Where are we heading?

What has really changed? Or, are we now saying that the Islamic religious
department can enforce their ruling that she live with her grandparents?
Have they become the new moral and religious police in the public spaces of
Malaysia? But really, under which jurisdiction and is it still consistent
with the Federal Constitution? Come on Malaysia, where are we really
heading?

The word and concept of 'secular,' was always used by the Constitutional
drafters to define our document of destiny. It does not mean being
&quot;anti-religious&quot; or &quot;anti-theistic&quot; but rather denies that any one specific
and particular religious worldview of right and wrong was the guiding and
sole parameter for the rules and regulations of Malaysia. Another way to
understand it is that the Federal Constitution is religion-neutral when
enforcing its principle and articles.

Therefore, in the specific case of Syariah law, the ninth schedule clearly
defined its status within the state enactments. It was designed to be
limited to private and personal family matters, wherein such laws already
exist for procedures to fulfill some Islamic teaching.

Therefore, while the Constitution is secular, in its reading and
interpretation of rights, the framers' worldviews were not atheistic. We can
therefore view the secular as always a subset of a sacred worldview. The
late Tun Suffian quote I used in the last column clearly defines that there
is a clear and specific domain in which reason and logic of universal truth
forms provide the underlying basis of laws and regulations, rather than the
dictates of any one specific worldview.

Often, these guiding values are &quot;the mores of the culture,&quot; or the
&quot;morality&quot; of that particular culture at any point in time is what reigns
in public space. Such public space morality is always defined premised upon
religious values, and especially originating from many religious value
systems which are commonly accepted as agreeable by the culture. Usually
they are a local, global and of universal value.

Secular system

As such, as crafted in our secular Constitution, even the words, &quot;Islam as
the religion of the Federation&quot; cannot be used to create an over-riding
value system for our civic rules and regulations. That would be arbitrary
and careless to the spirit of the original Federal Constitution and all her
related Articles. For, even within the same Article, the roles of every
other religion of the federation and their concomitant freedoms of worship
are equally protected and preserved. Moreover the freedom of worship is
recognised as a personal and private matter in Article 11.

Therefore, whether we like it or not, our current Federal Constitution
guarantees our multi-religious framework of existence and we can therefore
only remain a secular system, in the purest meaning of what is secular.

Real politick would dictate that unless we can amend major segments of the
Federal Constitution with a two-thirds majority; and the Rulers Council
agrees, there can be no major changes in this specific construction of the
Constitution. Thereby, even an idealist party like PAS may have to
realistically refine their mission to realise that their vision of an
Islamic state in Malaysia can only operate within the constraints of the
current Federal Constitution. This is purely a rational and legal position
on the subject.

The case of Revathi has now hit the world press and has demonstrated the
current confusion in Malaysia's judicial system; and the full and apparent
existence of two standards of justice in the public spaces of life - one for
Muslims, as dictated by the State Enactments, and another by profession for
the non-Muslims by their choice of conscience. This was never intended by
the framers of the Constitution.

How can we possibly have a case where a person who says she is a Hindu but
is put in rehabilitation for six months under the Islamic Religious
Department. The case is fundamentally really no different than the Lina Joy
case, with a slight twist. Now that Revathi is released with certain
conditions, my question is who is responsible to &quot;enforce the decision?&quot;
What if her elderly parents cannot enforce the conditions; or do not want to
enforce these conditions, do we put them in prison as well under
rehabilitation?

After all, as she has stated, after her time in rehabilitation; she is not
ever going to become a Muslim, try as much as they all want. What then is
the real resolution? For her to migrate as well to another country? What
about her personal rights and civil liberties as a citizen?

Or, is the government-based religious department willing to confine her to
life imprisonment? Would that be within the law of the land? Is that what
Islam is really all about; faith practiced through force and compulsion?
Surely not, because there is no compulsion in Islam! How then does one
rationalise all this that is happening in the 21st century? Maybe it is time
for all civil-minded and moderate Malaysian citizens to hold a peace march
for Revathi. Maybe it is time to stop our 50th year celebrations to think
through the ugly nation we are slowly but surely turning ourselves into.

Seriously, this thing cannot go on; when the religious department officers
become thugs and enforce their own non-public space rules. They have no
federal power of the law on such matters which are not criminal but seem to
treat people as if they are criminals. Things are really getting out of
hand, and I believe that the nation must not be careless with

i am a hindu.and i want to be fair.i want to comment on siti fatimah aka
revathi's case. btw, siti fatimah is the legal name. she was born when her
christian parents converted to Islam. so she is a muslim by birth. her
parents gave her to her grand parents to be brought up. it is her parents
who are being irresponsible here. they shud have decided on her religious
status before giving her to her hindu grandparents to be brought up when she
was a child.. siti fatimah aka revathi is caught in a trap for no mistake of
her. and we cant go on blaming the family of siti fatimah.  this is where we
expect the HINDU SANGAM AND MIC  to come in and sort out the matter. and
after the lina joy case, it is difficult to get a verdict favourable to siti
fatimah aka revathi from the syariah court. the syariah courts are just
interpreting the law. cases like siti fatimah aka revathi can only be
settled via negotiations by our indian reps in govt. i wonder why we have
MIC and HINDU SANGAM for? warming the seats and enjoying the big fat pay and
perks, perhaps
