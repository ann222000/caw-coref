Sober Time

Summer Song
Forgotten never more
Rainbow Summer Rain

Valerie's guided Cloud
God’s calligraphy borne to water ground,
Serenely, like a distant train.

Morning Chief loves Thunder-Woman whisper,
Sharing both they a disappearing fear.
Sober Time, UN-staggering, CONQUERING karmic refrain.

Dry leaves of autumn blew once at her feet
Amazing Grace now free from sharp edged regretful retreat.
No more burdens of cold, drifting mountain chains.

From a love heart of unity, service &amp; recovery
Started in promise and ending here
Wrapped warm within easy terrain.

Waiting for shine
Now, heart aching gratitude,
Quite fearless of change.

And to prayers lived, a loving God, said,
“Serenity Granted”
For you, there’s no more shame.

Come
Friends…
In these simple halls, freely…remain.

Just For Today
July 22                                          Spiritual death

&quot;For us, to use is to die, often in more ways than one.&quot;
Basic Text, p.78

As newcomers, many of us came to our first meeting with
only a small spark of life remaining. That spark, our spirit,
wants to survive. Narcotics Anonymous nurtures that spirit.
The love of the fellowship quickly fans that spark into a flame.
With the Twelve Steps and the love of other recovering addicts,
we begin to blossom into that whole, vital human being our
Higher Power intended us to be. We begin to enjoy life, finding
purpose in our existence. Each day we choose to stay clean,
our spirit is revitalized and our relationship with our God grows.
Our spirit becomes stronger each day we choose life by staying
clean.

Despite the fact that our new life in recovery is rewarding,
the urge to use can sometimes be overwhelming. When
everything in our lives seems to go wrong, a return to using
can seem like the only way out. But we know what the
consequence will be if we use-the loss of our carefully nurtured
spirituality. We have traveled too far along the spiritual path
to dishonor our spirit by using. Snuffing the spiritual flame we
have worked so hard to restore in our recovery is too dear a
price to pay for getting high.

Just for today: I am grateful that my spirit is strong and vital.
Today, I will honor that spirit by staying clean. pg. 212

Toward Peace and Serenity

. . .when we have taken a square look at some of these defects,
have discussed them with another, and have become willing to
have them removed, our thinking about humility commences to
have a wider meaning.
TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 74

When situations arise which destroy my serenity, pain often
motivates me to ask God for clarity in seeing my part in the
situation. Admitting my powerlessness, I humbly pray for
acceptance. I try to see how my character defects contributed
to the situation. Could I have been more patient?  WasI intolerant?
Did I insist on having my own way?  Was I afraid?  As my defects
are revealed, I put self-reliance aside and humbly ask God to
remove my shortcomings. The situation may not change, but as
I practice exercising humility, I enjoy the peace and serenity which
are the natural benefits of placing my reliance in a power greater
than myself.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day by Hazelden/ July 22nd

A.A. Thought for the Day

One of the finest things about A.A. is the diversity of its
membership. We come from all walls and stations of life.
All types and classes of people are represented in an A.A.
group. Being different from each other in certain ways, we
can each make a different contribution to the whole. Some
of us are weak in one respect, but strong in another. A.A.
can use the strong points of all its members and can
disregard their weaknesses. A.A. is strong, not only because
we all have the same problem, but also because of the
diversified talents of its members. Each person can contribute
part. Do I recognize the good points of all my group's members?

Meditation for the Day

&quot;And greater works than these shall ye do.&quot; Each individual
has the ability to do good works through the power of God's
spirit. This is the wonder of the world, the miracle of the
earth, that God's power goes out to bless the human race
through the agency of so many people who are actuated by
His grace. We need not be held back by doubt, despondency,
and fear. A wonderful future can lie before any person who
depends on God's power, a future of unlimited power to do
good works.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that I may not limit myself by doubting. I pray that
I may have confidence that I can be effective for good.

Today's Thought
JULY 22

You are reading from the book The Language of Letting Go.
Melody Beattie ©

Learning to Trust Again

Many of us have trust issues.

Some of us tried long and hard to trust untrustworthy people.
Over and again, we believed lies and promises never to be
kept. Some of us tried to trust people for the impossible; for
instance, trusting a practicing alcoholic not to drink again.

Some of us trusted our Higher Power inappropriately. We
trusted God to make other people do what we wanted, then
felt betrayed when that didn't work out.

Some of us were taught that life couldn't be trusted, that we
had to control and manipulate our way through.

Most of us were taught, inappropriately, that we couldn't trust
ourselves.

In recovery, we're healing from our trust issues. We're
learning to trust again. The first lesson in trust is this: We can
learn to trust ourselves. We can be trusted. If others have taught
us we cannot trust ourselves, they were lying. Addictions and
dysfunctional systems make people lie.

We can learn to appropriately trust our Higher Power - not to
make people do what we wanted them to, but to help us take
care of ourselves, and to bring about the best possible
circumstances, at the best possible times, in our life.

We can trust the process - of life and recovery. We do not have
to control, obsess, or become hypervigilant. We may not always
understand where we are going, or what's being worked out in
us, but we can trust that something good is happening.

When we learn to do this, we are ready to learn to trust other
people. When we trust our Higher Power and when we trust
ourselves, we will know who to trust and what to trust that person
for.

Perhaps we always did. We just didn't listen closely enough to
ourselves or trust what we heard.

Today, I will affirm that I can learn to trust appropriately. I can
trust my Higher Power, my recovery, and myself. I can learn to
appropriately trust others too.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Keep It Simple*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Bigger Than Hope
by Alan Cohen

Last summer, I set out with a group of friends on a sailboat excursion
to camp on the mystical island of Molokai. En route we met a tropical
storm during which we treaded water for an hour amidst imposing
swells. Quite a few of our retinue made pilgrimages to the rail, and
by the time the squall abated and we reached shore, numerous
would-be sailors had waxed green-faced and swore to take a plane
next time.

Fortunately, the weather improved and we went on to enjoy a
magnificent sojourn on the exotic isle. As we prepared to leave
the next day, several people were anxious about the prospect of
hitting bad weather again. Someone suggested we gather for a
group prayer for easy passage, and I spoke a strong affirmation
that peace was indeed with us. Together we visualized a
smooth, easy, and delightful trip, and we came into the vibration of
positive expectation until the anxiety had lifted.

As soon as we opened our eyes, a young man in our midst, new to
the spiritual path, blurted out, &quot;Yeah, and let's hope we don't hit any
more storms!&quot; His statement crashed awkwardly against the vision
we had just co-created. Afterward I took the fellow aside and
explained to him an important principle:

Once we have prayed for something, we must step fully into the
new vibration and not go backward into thoughts, words, or actions
that affirm the condition we were praying to heal. We are always
affirming what we want or what we don't want, and everything we
think, say, or do is directing our energy in one direction or another.

When I was studying with master healer Hilda Charlton, during a
class we prayed for a woman named Loni who was seeking to be
healed of a particular disease. After the prayer session a man
approached Loni and suggested she try a certain herbal treatment.
At the following week's class Hilda passionately admonished the
fellow and the group: &quot;How dare you undo the healing work we did!
We spent a long time and a lot of energy bringing this woman into
the consciousness of wholeness, and you speak to her as if she
needs help! If she is not sick, as we declared her to be, why would
you tell her what to do to erase her illness? Don't you ever do this
again!&quot;

Hilda was not against medicine (on many occasions she
recommended that students take it), and she was extremely
compassionate with people who were suffering. That night Hilda
was using the incident to underscore an important point, one
which has stayed with me and helped me immensely over
many years: To be an effective healer, speak to the place in your
client that is whole, and treat each person as if they are already
who they would like to be. As Dale Carnegie advised, &quot;Give them
a reputation to live up to.&quot;

In the famous biblical story, God advised Lot and his family to
leave Sodom because the city was about to be destroyed; God
told the family to leave quickly and not look back. On their road to
freedom, Lot's wife turned to see what was happening back there,
and she turned into a pillar of salt. Certainly this did not happen
physically - the story is a metaphor, a grand piece of advice for
all times: Don't get involved with what you are leaving behind.
Your past may be loaded with pain, suffering, and difficulty, but
you are trying to build a new life. Leave the past where it was,
and turn your attention fully toward where you are going. Jesus
advised simply, &quot;Turn the other cheek.&quot;

This is the time of rebirth, signified in the legends of our major
religions. In Judaism we commemorate Passover, representing
the ascension from slavery to freedom. In Christianity we
celebrate the resurrection of Christ. We have paid far too much
attention to scenes of slavery and crucifixion; we have played
them out time and again. Now it is time for us to focus on what
happens next. The more we delve into how we got where we
are, the more we stay where we were. The more we analyze
what is not working, the more things do not work. And the more
we consider how we would like it to be, the more things become
as we would have them. The choice is ours.

Real spirituality is beyond hope. Hope means there is a chance
things may turn out as we wish, and if we are lucky we may get
what we want. Inner knowing, on the other hand, proceeds from
the awareness that love is present now, well-being is our natural
state, and all is really well.

Yes, we may have hit a storm on way over, but that does not
mean we have to hit one on the way back. Our history is not
our destiny, and our destiny begins now.

When you are weak and tired and feel you can no longer go on....
lift up your hands to God/Spirit/all that is and say...

&quot;Dear God, I am with you.
I place my hands, my heart and my situation in your hands.

&quot;I have journeyed too long alone and
in my haste forgotten to look over and see you beside me.

&quot;Thank-you for your unseen presence and blessings in my life.
How may I serve you as you serve me?

Blessings......&quot;

New Life, New Love

I used to be a user
Kept God out of my heart.
I used to live only in fear
And kept myself apart.

Then I found a program
And began to live in today.
With Twelve Steps and these rooms
I'm living a new way.

I had to learn to trust again
I had to learn to bend.
I had to learn to let go and live
I learned to love again.

Newfound love and God's grace
Has kept me here somehow.
No longer living in pain and fear
I have a blessed life now.

Love inspired is love desired
And I have love today.
I have an awesome life to live
I am here to stay.

Live in peace, light, and love,
and KNOW that you are blessed,

Everyday In Recovery

Everyday In recovery
Is a new day of discovery
We learn new things
About each other you see
Learning a new way
We strive to live free
Staying sober we don't drink
All of a sudden we begin to think
Digging deep as we go
In recovery we grow
If we stand still we lose
It's your program
So you choose
Damned if you do
Damned if you don't
Got to change it's your choice
We can only hear your voice
We try hard to reach the person inside
The one in the center
Where do you hide
Eyes are the window to the soul
Everyone has the right to be whole
Everyday in recovery
Is a new day of discovery
We all have this chance to be free
Come along you can see

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Keep The Focus On You*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

We have stopped for a moment
to encounter each other.
To meet, to love, to share.
It is a precious moment, but it is transient.
It is a little parentheses in eternity.
If we share with caring, lightheartedness, and love
We will create abundance and joy for each other,
and this moment will have been worthwhile
