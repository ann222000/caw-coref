My wife and I have no points on our DMV records (no tickets or
accidents for the past 3 years), and we have never ever made any
claims on our homeowner HO-3 policies. We also have excellent credit
score (&gt;700), so that is not issue.

California AAA (our current insurer) increased rates about 10% last
year, and I just received the renewal bill for HO-3 which is going up
by nearly 30%! AAA gave me a generic, mumbo-jumbo explanation for the
increase which basically boils down to &quot;the rate increase is NOT
related to your personal factors; we are raising everyone's rates,
because of blah blah.&quot; Basically, &quot;because we can&quot; attitude. So I
decided to shop around, and switch if I found premiums 10% to 15%
lower.

I have received quotes form
-- Liberty Mutual ==&gt; 11% lower
-- AMEX Assurance (Costco affiliate) ==&gt; 20% lower

I made sure to get the quote for EXACT SAME limits, deductibles and
discount factors, on all coverages, for both auto &amp; home policies.

Therefore, I am seeking your experiences and opinions about
Liberty Mutual and AMEX Assurance. I have looked up AM Best ratings.

I am more interested in people's experience about their SERVICE &amp;
REPUTATION. If they are your insurance carrier, or if you have ever
dealt with them in course of being hit by one of their insureds,
please relate your experience.

Thanks.
