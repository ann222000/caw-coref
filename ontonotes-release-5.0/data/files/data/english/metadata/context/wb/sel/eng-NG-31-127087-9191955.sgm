Today's question is being brought to you by our very own mystery person :)

snowfall?

In New England (VT):

1st frost used to be by Sept. 24th NOW October 10th to 15th.

1st snowfall used to be by Thanksgiving now we are lucky if there is
snow at Christmas.  Usually some snow by New Years.

We are now listed as one Plant Hardiness Zone warmer than we used to be.
Used to be zone 4 now we are 5A.

I heard that the &quot;Corn Belt&quot; would be in Canada (if they had they had the
correct soil - which they do not so there will be a problem) by 2085 at this
rate.

Ever see a wild animal(s) stop traffic? What animal did this and how?

Including morning dew, about an inch.  Except during El Nino years, when
there's more than the locals know how to measure.

Well, there was the time when that guy stole a tank and drove it down the
freeway.  He was some kind of animal.

Every once in a while, deer will wander onto the roads in my neighborhood.

I'm in my own *micro climate* so local weather reports, averages, or
records don't tell the averages here and in my 3 years here I haven't
kept track.

I will say that yesterday the high temp was 73F and today it barely went
over 40F and had snow flurries on and off all day.

No snow here in FL, but it does frost around Jan./Feb.  I have to cover my
plants at least 3 times in the winter months.
