FICTION!!!!!

It was night. Wyeth Hightower was reading.

Wyeth liked reading. It was one of the few pleasures that King's
Landing afforded him since the place was too crowded, too messy, and
too loud to afford him the comforts of home. The place had no culture,
no order, and stank to high heaven. He couldn't get any of his daily
meditations done since quiet solitude was hard enough to come by, he
is given queer looks by everyone who sees him about his daily regimens
and exercises, and he has been having a hell of a time avoiding all
the meat everyone insists on serving with every meal. The stench of
the place was even getting into his clothes, and he has only been
there for a couple of days.

That, and his assigned job was very, very boring.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

"You have grown very… different, Wyeth," his lord uncle, Elwyn
Hightower, had said to him when he was fifteen. "Your time abroad has
made you a stranger in your own home."

"What would you of me, my lord uncle?" he had asked.

"You must be away from Oldtown for now, for the distractions are too
numerous. I'm sending to you serve with Ser Daemon Tyrell of
Highgarden."

"What would you have me do there, my lord uncle?"

"You will squire under him. Perhaps your… interesting martial skills
will impress him enough to give you a knighthood."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Your skills are impressive, Wyeth," Ser Daemon had said a year later.
"Why you are a squire is not in that alone. You do not think like a
knight."

"What would you of me, Ser?" he had asked.

"I do not know how to tell you to be a knight. Your mind is too…
foreign. You must unwind your discipline and try to understand what it
is to be a man of Westeros and not an iron soldier of Yi Ti."

"How shall I do this, Ser?"

"I am sending you to live with Lord Axell Florent at Brightwater Keep.
The place is rustic enough to give you the peace you constantly crave
and the household is warm enough to melt even the most iron façade."

"You're definitely an… interesting fellow, Wyeth," Lord Axell had said
a year later. "In your time here you have kept yourself remarkably."

"What is the problem, my lord?" he had asked.

"Well, you're a young man. I somewhat expect you to… enjoy yourself.
Be young. Get into some trouble, perhaps. Acquaint yourself with the
girls of the scullery, drink merrily with the men, maybe periodically
just sit back and enjoy a glass of Arbor Gold and take in the
countryside."

"If you so desire, my lord, I can do said things."

"It's not only that, Wyeth! You insist on being alone, even amongst
people who would be your friends. In the training yard, instead of
exchanging pleasantries or engaging in banter you merely take up the
training sword and beat your opponent. You don't offer to teach them
afterwards, you don't help them up, nothing. This place is too open,
and there is too much room. For you to be alone, I mean. You can't
open up if you can always escape."

"What would you of me, my lord?"

"I am sending you to assist my son Jon in King's Landing. He does not
have a capable master of the guard with him, and he could use a
companion of some kind with him. Perhaps there you can open up."

It had been Wyeth's good fortune to arrive soon after the lord Jon
Florent had taken ill. He rarely saw Jon since the man had been
quarantined, though he did assist the Master of Law whilst he was ill.
Unfortunately, he really did not have anything to do. His task was to
open up, and yet here was merely more uncomfortable than Brighwater
Keep which was in turn more uncomfortable than Highgarden which was in
turn more uncomfortable than Oldtown. He certainly was learning to
deal with disappointment, or he would be had he not already known.

And now he was sitting in one of Jon's apartments reading a book.
Which was when he heard the sound of something falling.

Wyeth sat stock-still for a second, listening again, and he then heard
a muffled yell and a cracking noise, at which point he ran over to the
door that lead to Jon Florent's bedchamber.

Inside was an interesting tableau- a man laden with wounds was in the
process of attempting to stab lord Jon… again. There was also Jon's
bloodied sword on the ground nearby. Jon himself had been gagged and
bound whilst the man did his gristly work. Wyeth, instantly taking in
the scene, darted in behind the man and drew his blade from his
scabbard straight out across the back of the man's neck.
It's arguable that he never felt a thing.
The assailant looked puzzled (from behind, at least), then fell to the
floor, part of his torso sliding neatly off from the rest of him onto
the ground, and a pool of blood slowly spreading out from his landing
point.

It took Jon a couple of seconds to compose himself- he had suffered a
stab wound in the arm and another one across his thigh, though he was
able, with some pains, to get himself to a chair. Once the gag and the
bounds were off, that is.

"Wyeth… that was astounding," said the lord Jon.

"Shall I fetch Maester Riemann, my lord?" asked Wyeth.

"Yes… wait a second, though. Did this man not come by you on his way
to the door?"

"What are you talking about, my lord? No one came into your bedchamber
that way."

"Interesting," said lord Jon, looking pleasantly puzzled despite
having multiple stab wounds on him.

"Why did you not call out for help, my lord? Did you think you could
fight him yourself?"

"Whatever gives you that idea?"

"Your sword, my lord! It is on the ground and covered in the man's blood!"

"My sword? Oh, I see. Now it makes sense."

"What does, my lord?"

"Wyeth, this man woke me then knocked me out with a sleeping agent. I
woke again bound and gagged as you saw me. I never had a chance to
fight him, and even if I had, I would have opted to set up a hue and
cry instead. I'm still sick, you know."

"Then… what? Why is your sword on the ground and why does it have
blood on it? Why is that man covered in cuts?"

"This is part of an illusion, I fear. Someone wanted me dead but did
not want me to look like I died without putting up a fight."

"What? Why, my lord?"

"If I could tell you why, then this would not have happened in the first place."

"But…"
"The man must have come in by some route other than through the door.
The window, perhaps? The cuts might be self-inflicted. Or perhaps he
intended to then burst out and fight as many of the guards as he could
before he was killed."

"What does this mean, my lord?"

"I wish I knew. But in the meantime, please go get a hold of Maester
Riemann for me. And do not speak of this to anyone."

"Do we not wish to find who sent the assassin?"

"He could have been acting on his own. Actively looking for
accomplices or whoever set this up, if there is such a person, will
prevent them from trying again in a similar manner."

"I… see. I do not feel safe in leaving you here, my lord."

"If there were more then they would already have acted. I'll be safe
for the five minutes it will take you to rouse Maester Riemann and
return. Now, go, please."
