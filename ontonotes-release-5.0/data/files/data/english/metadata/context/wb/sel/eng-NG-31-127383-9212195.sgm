&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;To return to the issue at hand, the earliest writing I know of, 7000
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; years ago in SE Europe, such as the Gradesnica platter and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; inscription on a cave wall in Bulgaria, themselves seem to have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; evolved

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Still, if it turns out that some characters have an 8000 year

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bar the shouting.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Comments, please.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;As the article says, its a process of evolution.  Just when tax
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;stamps, or in the case of the Chinese, clan markings...become written
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;language is still a matter of discussion.  There is still disagreement
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;over whether the quipu is a language or not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And so far as I know, neither 8000 year old Chinese characters or Day's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are writing.  Symbols aren't writing.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When do symbols become writing?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When no one else can read them except those who speak the language of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; writer?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Seriously.  There are International Highway symbols which mean the same no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; matter what language you speak. You can tell by looking at them what they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mean (if you understand driving on roads). When you string symbols, or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; knots, or whatever into a sequence that can be understood as a sentence in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a specific language and only in that language, you've got writing.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Japanese uses Chinese &quot;symbols&quot;, characters to write Japanese. Often
&gt;&gt; &gt;the connection is in sound rather than the meaning of the Chinese
&gt;&gt; &gt;original.

&gt;The Chinese symbols used in Japanese, then, are uniquely Japanese?

&gt;&gt; &gt;In modern Japanese, kanji  (Chinese characters) are used to write
&gt;&gt; &gt;parts of the language such as nouns, adjective stems and verb stems,
&gt;&gt; &gt;while hiragana are used to write inflected verb and adjective endings
&gt;&gt; &gt;(okurigana), particles, native Japanese words, and words where the
&gt;&gt; &gt;kanji is too difficult to read or remember. Katakana is used for
&gt;&gt; &gt;representing onomatopoeia and non-Japanese loanwords.

&gt;&gt; Which goes back to the introduction of  written Chinese language to Japan
&gt;&gt; in the 4th century CE, right?  At the time, the only form of writing as
&gt;&gt; there was no written Japanese.  Gradually a written Japanese developed.

&gt;&gt; The symbols (our alphabet) we write in are used by a number of different
&gt;&gt; languages. This applies to the Cyrillic alphabet also.

&gt;&gt; I don't think you are disagreeing with me.

&gt;All the Japanese I can read/write is in Romanji.  ;-)

&gt;Underlying Kanji, like Chinese, are literal representational symbols,
&gt;aren't there? A man, a tree, 'two women under one roof,' etc. At some
&gt;point the women &amp; roof become a &quot;written&quot; symbol for trouble (IIRC).
&gt;It's the criteria for that transition I would like to know more about,
&gt;in the context of North American symbols &amp; 'apparent' languages, and
&gt;of course the archaeologist's point of view.

&gt;I've posted previously about 'tree language' but there seems little or
&gt;no evidence unambiguously pre-Columbian. To phrase the same question
&gt;differently, what about things like Lakota 'winter count' robes? Now I
&gt;can see how casual observation would toss out the majority of images
&gt;as representational pictographs, 'mere' symbols... but the Lakota
&gt;don't read them that way, and even photographs show quite extensive
&gt;detail, 'notation,' as part of the pictographs.

&gt;Here's one (there's more reputable sites, but this one from an amateur
&gt;traveler is easy to see in detail; I'm not sure it's Lakota):

&gt; http://www.katchmehere.mytraveljournals.com/j/image.asp?I=/JournalFil...

&gt;or

&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2gmves

&gt;There's various reasons the Lakota pictographs are more famous than
&gt;others, but many tribes, perhaps most, employed similar devices. They
&gt;consider them written language, in the respect that the pictographs
&gt;convey information for those who 'know the language.'

&gt;An example like 'trouble' might be the white or hollow buffalo. At one
&gt;level this refers to a sacred event, the arrival of the White Buffalo
&gt;Woman, who brought peace and the pipe ceremony to the People. At
&gt;another level, the white buffalo represents all sacred things, an
&gt;abstraction like the words 'biblical' or 'godlike.'

&gt;Some anthropologists seem to consider the 'picture language' to be
&gt;real language. I note that archaeologists sometimes refer to markings
&gt;unearthed in Central &amp; South America as 'possible' writing, but rarely
&gt;acknowledge North American writing systems. Something like the tax
&gt;stamps, and clan markings, maybe I understand why those are 'just
&gt;symbols,' but for a lot of North American markings, I'm trying to
&gt;better understand why they're not language.

I would say that two factors are (a) whether the symbols are associated
with specific words, rather than concepts, and (b) whether an utterance
can be rendered, word for word, into written form using the symbols.

To address the first point, a &quot;No Entry&quot; sign represents a concept, not
specific words. If one person relates the meaning of the symbol as &quot;No
Entry&quot;, another as &quot;Do Not Enter&quot;, and a third as &quot;Entry Prohibited&quot;,
then the symbol only represents a concept. It isn't a written
representation of the spoken language. Lest someone counter with an
example like the English word &quot;live&quot; which, without context, could just
as well be a verb rhyming with &quot;give&quot; as an adjective rhyming with
&quot;chive&quot;, I'm not talking about the caprices of the spelling system,
about random ambiguities within a writing system that in general follows
the principle.

Regarding the second point, since there isn't any way to use
international highway symbols to write &quot;He couldn't get into the garage
from Oak Street because there was a Do Not Enter sign&quot;, it's hard to
speak of the symbols as writing.

I believe that's backwards. As Japanese adopted Chinese characters to
represent Japanese words that were *semantically* related to the Chinese
words represented by the characters, Japanese also borrowed many of the
Chinese *spoken* words associated with the characters as alternatives to
their native words. The associations between the characters and the
native Japanese words to which they were applied were not phonetic.

Imagine that French of the early second millennium had been written
using characters comparable to the Chinese ones, and English had come to
use the character for &quot;veau&quot; to write the native word &quot;calf&quot; and, AT THE
SAME TIME, adopted the French word for special purposes (in this case,
culinary), resulting in the semantic pair (calf, veal) and, likewise,
(ox, beef), (sheep, mutton), (pig, pork), and (fowl, poultry).

When the Japanese began to adopt the Chinese writing system in the
fifth century, the Chinese writing system was already standardized and
was twenty centuries old. The earliest records show that the Japanese
adopted the system with little or no change even though the Japanese
and Chinese languages are completely different and have less
similarities than, say, Chinese and English. For example, Chinese is
monosyllabic and non-inflected, Japanese is polysyllabic and has a
great variety of suffixes for both adjectives and verbs. Also Chinese,
like English, uses the sentence structure of &quot;subject - verb -object&quot;
while Japanese uses the order &quot;subject - object - verb&quot;. The early
attempts at adopting the Chinese writing system for Japanese met with
many very difficult to overcome problems and the earliest solutions
often avoided the problem by using Chinese syntax.

One method of transcription was to use the Chinese sound associated
with the Chinese character, or what is known as the &quot;on-yomi&quot; (which
literally translates to &quot;sound - reading&quot;). The other method was to
use the the meaning of the Chinese character and pronounce the word
using the Japanese word. This method is known as &quot;kun-yomi&quot;.

The earliest attempt to use Chinese characters for the Japanese
language used the on-yomi to transcribe the Japanese word syllable for
syllable into a close sounding Chinese character. This led to the
Japanese having a lot of fun because many Chinese characters have the
same sound and so one could take a Japanese word and write it in
several different ways based on the pronunciation of the Chinese
character. The result could be funny when the meaning was then looked
at. And for the longest time the Japanese refused to standardize the
51 Japanese syllables into 51 standard symbols.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From a practical sense, something needed to be done however. Each
">

Chinese character (or kanji) required many brush strokes and it could
take a lot of work to write just one word. One solution was to forget
the pronunciation of the kanji and to use the meaning of the symbol
and to read the kanji using the Japanese word.

These two styles were used for a few hundred years and the result is
that Japanese kanji today will have many readings.

It is not necessary for writing to start with speaking.

The &quot;mathematical language&quot; is that of the use of certain
strings with few constants and an unlimited family of
&quot;prowords&quot;, which can stand for anything.  This can be
incorporated into other languages; the statement:

If x+y=z, then x=z-y.

is writing.  It could be put entirely into mathematical
symbols as well, and still be writing.  It is not necessary
to even have pronounceable &quot;words&quot;; we have guesses about
how the name of God should be pronounced in Hebrew, but
one could use it in writing even if it is never pronounced,
as is the case for religious Jews.

Writing need not be a written representation of a spoken
language; the punctuation characters are properties of
the written language only.  I believe that the earliest
written languages had no punctuation.

Suppose we found a dictionary between Elamite and the
language on the Mohenjo-Daro tablets.  We could then
read the language, but not pronounce it.

&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; original.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I believe that's backwards. As Japanese adopted Chinese characters to
&gt;represent Japanese words that were *semantically* related to the Chinese
&gt;words represented by the characters, Japanese also borrowed many of the
&gt;Chinese *spoken* words associated with the characters as alternatives to
&gt;their native words. The associations between the characters and the
&gt;native Japanese words to which they were applied were not phonetic.
&gt;Imagine that French of the early second millennium had been written
&gt;using characters comparable to the Chinese ones, and English had come to
&gt;use the character for &quot;veau&quot; to write the native word &quot;calf&quot; and, AT THE
&gt;SAME TIME, adopted the French word for special purposes (in this case,
&gt;culinary), resulting in the semantic pair (calf, veal) and, likewise,
&gt;(ox, beef), (sheep, mutton), (pig, pork), and (fowl, poultry).

&gt; &lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Seriously.  There are International Highway symbols which mean the same no
&gt; &lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; matter what language you speak. You can tell by looking at them what they
&gt; &lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mean (if you understand driving on roads). When you string symbols, or
&gt; &lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knots, or whatever into a sequence that can be understood as a sentence in
&gt; &lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a specific language and only in that language, you've got writing.

&gt;&gt; I would say that two factors are (a) whether the symbols are associated
&gt;&gt; with specific words, rather than concepts, and (b) whether an utterance
&gt;&gt; can be rendered, word for word, into written form using the symbols.

&gt; It is not necessary for writing to start with speaking.

&gt; The &quot;mathematical language&quot; is that of the use of certain
&gt; strings with few constants and an unlimited family of
&gt; &quot;prowords&quot;, which can stand for anything.

Do you imagine that you'll ever be able to slip this in without someone
pointing out that &quot;mathematical language&quot; is not *language* in the sense
of the word as discussed in sci.lang?

&gt; one could use it in writing even if it is never pronounced,

If it represented a pronounced word at the time that someone came up
with the spelling, then it was the written form of a spoken word, even
if we don't know for sure what that word was today. If the letters were
chosen for their symbolic purposes, then together they are a symbol, and
they are no more writing than is the heart in &quot;I [heart] you&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; To address the first point, a &quot;No Entry&quot; sign represents a concept, not
&gt;&gt; specific words. If one person relates the meaning of the symbol as &quot;No
&gt;&gt; Entry&quot;, another as &quot;Do Not Enter&quot;, and a third as &quot;Entry Prohibited&quot;,
&gt;&gt; then the symbol only represents a concept. It isn't a written
&gt;&gt; representation of the spoken language. Lest someone counter with an
&gt;&gt; example like the English word &quot;live&quot; which, without context, could just
&gt;&gt; as well be a verb rhyming with &quot;give&quot; as an adjective rhyming with
&gt;&gt; &quot;chive&quot;, I'm not talking about the caprices of the spelling system,
&gt;&gt; about random ambiguities within a writing system that in general follows

The language of mathematics has little connection to

limit a gauche).

The languages of chemistry and physics are partly that;

azote in French, and Stickstoff in German.  But it means

who cares how it is pronounced?  BTW, none of those
three words can be considered a translation of any
one of the others.

It MAY have been the case that, except in the recent

Gimbutas, last I read, reports she has seen @ 260 icon stamps, carved
in ivory, antler, bone, stone, and modeled in fired clay. 7000 or so
years old. She surmises that a vertical line with a leaf attached, is
for wheat, and says this is evolved into the lower case letter 'a'.
All of this would be pure conjecture until you look at the rest of the
chalcolithic culture in the Danube &amp; Dneister drainage basin.

The French found a chalcolithic 'trading post' not far from Paris, in
which they see beads and artifacts from the lower Danube. It looks a
lot like what Hudson Bay company was doing. The Germans found a copper
mine in SE Germany dating from the same era, and the salt mines at
Hallstaat and Salzburg were also in business at the time. Rumania
still has oil and tar. The Danube delta still has a fishing industry,
and Gimbutas shows us a pot with a plank hull sailboat from 4800 BC.

There are stretches of the riverine floodplains where the village tels
are carefully spaced out every 3km, which is about as far as the field
hands care to walk from the &quot;back 40&quot; to get back for lunch. And in
addition, there are dozens of large trading towns.

I dont imagine that every location used the same set of stamps to
label shipments, but the *idea* of labeling would have spread rapidly.
Then too, we have the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language which
has all these words related to resource management. Like manage.
arrange, regulate, region, garage. And that's just those handed down
in English, never mind what German, Latin, and Greek got.

When you have a mercantile empire this vast, inventory control becomes
important. Shippers need shopping lists too. Then too, there'd be
calculations of what different commodities were worth in different
areas at different times. All of this drives a need for writing, so we
should not be surprised to see pottery from this era which has it. The
combination of the writing, the trade, and the vast variety of
resources to be managed standardized the language. which is why we
have &quot;Proto-Indo-European&quot; in the first place.

Both from PIE *H3reg^-, to extend.  While words meaning &quot;king&quot; and
&quot;correct&quot; come from this root, it's far from clear that these meanings
go back to PIE, since most cognates in the daughter languages belong to
the semantic field &quot;extend&quot; or &quot;stretch&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

From French &lt;garer&gt;, to park, shelter, prob from Germanic *warjan, to
separate, prohibit.  Not from PIE *wer-, cover, or *wer-, perceive, or
*wer- bind, or *wer- find, or *wer-, boil, or *wer-, crow, AFAICS.

So, I see little evidence that these particular words have PIE
antecedents that had much, if anything, to do with resource management.

JP Mallory, &quot;In Search of the Indo-Europeans&quot; begins by saying that
the only PIE word for authority is &quot;raj&quot;, and goes on to mention all
these other words, as well as regina, raja, oregon (Lat, Skt, Grk),

efficacious, have mana&quot;. I can see how the Latin manus is related, but
see 'manage' as being the hand of the raj working magic. That last
word is another with that same soft &quot;g&quot; sound in it.

Then too, there's the Tocharians who were the most directly
descendant, isolated in the Taklamakhan oases, as Douglas Adams,
&quot;Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology&quot; argues from PIE.
Besides 'raj' as 'witch', Tocharian also has &quot;wiccasi&quot;, which means a
woman with magical skill. Related to what Pokorny has to say above,
'wicca' means to bend, as in basket weaving to produce 'wicker' ware.

The pre-eminent Tocharian city was Kucha. I have a copy of the
&quot;Maitreyasamiti Texts in Tocharian A', which is a conversation between
the living Buddha and the Gautamid Queen of Kucha. Had Kucha been
ruled by a king, Buddha would have been talking to HIM. And among the

No. ON p. 125 he says: &quot;The apex of Proto-Indo-European society,

Yes.  As, I believe, do most others today.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I can see how the Latin manus is related,  but see 'manage' as being
&gt;&gt; the hand of the raj working magic. That last word is another with
&gt;&gt; that same soft &quot;g&quot; sound in it.
">

Not the _same_ soft &quot;g&quot; sound'.  The two words have the same sound now,
but they obtained them in different ways, in different languages
thousands of miles and thousands of years apart, starting from different
sounds.

Note that the Latin cognate of Sanskrit &lt;ra:j&gt; is &lt;re:x&gt; &lt; *re:g-s,
which has a hard &quot;g&quot;.  Both come from PIE *H3re:g^-s, where /g^/ is a
palatal velar (arguably, something like the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;arguably&quot;). In
Italic, this sound became /g/ (hard &quot;g&quot;), while in Indo-Iranian it
became /dZ/ (soft &quot;g&quot;).

OTOH, &lt;manage&gt; is from popular Latin *manidiare, to handle, which has no
&quot;g&quot; at all.  Latin /-di-/ &gt; late Latin /-dj-/ &gt; Old French /-dZ-/ is a
regular change in this case.

Tocharian doesn't have &quot;raj&quot;.  The only branches of IE which have

Toch A na:t&amp;k, lord, Toch B na:Si, lady, from PIE *wnakts, lord (cf

Surely Day Brown's post was a joke.  He gave us a list of words English has
allegedly derived from PIE, wording the statement so as to suggest that they
were inherited directly.  However, the words, 'manage', 'arrange',
'regulate', 'region' and 'garage', are rather obviously loan words,
especially the last, for which a distinctly non-native pronunciation is
still in use.

It's the second such imitation of Agamemnon we've had recently, the other
being Harlan Messinger's excellent Socratic argument demonstrating that we
are all carpenters if a strong enough need arises.

you can clearly see *HER* left tit in the bronze. take a look
yourself: http://www.dc-pc.org/artifax/artifax.html

Take a look at that hat too. Gimbutas shows us that same form in many
objects. Its from the Danube delta, where geese in the millions
formerly wintered in the earliest Indo-European era when the river
emptied into a fresh water Euxine lake. The Goose Goddess was
everywhere. Where do you think the wisdom of &quot;Mother Goose&quot; came from?

Of course the Tocharians had words for male leadership. The Chinese,
Zongnu, Tibetans, and &quot;arrogant Sakyas&quot; (mentioned in the
&quot;Maitreyasamiti Texts in Tocharian A) were all around them. But if the
Tocharians had a king, then the Buddha would have been talking to
*him*, not the Gautamid Queen of Kucha.

And look at the horse on Mallory. You cant put a mighty Aryan warrior
on such a pony. He'd drive the poor thing into the ground in no time.
On p 199, Mallory notes that the original domesticated horses were
only 134cm at the withers. He also mentions that the Cucuteni, the
ones with the Goose goddess, were &quot;gracile&quot;. A 50kg Cucuteni girl
could hop on a horse and ride faster than a warrior could run. End of
the rule by the warrior class. And since Mallory published, the
Russians have found Amazon graves in the Permafrost, half way between
the Danbue and China. Women buried with both their weapons and horse
tack.

Mallory, P111:&quot;More importantly, our evidence for Indo-European war-
bands is derived from very different time periods with none before the
late bronze age. If we look back at the beginning of bronze, to the
7000BP Transylvanian mines, we should note that firstly, the
Chalcocite there is laced with arsenic, and that the resulting mineral
is also known as &quot;fool's gold&quot;, and no doubt used initially in women's
jewelry.

Throughout the original Aryan homeland from the Euxine lake and on up
the Danube &amp; Dneper river basins, there's a striking absence of
military defensive works. All I know of so far is one fort on the
Danube across from the Balkans (which is still pretty violent),
another on the upper Dneiper, and a 3rd at a later copper mine in
Southern Germany. Which were all at the fronteirs of the culture.

in the flyleaf of &quot;Ancient Goddesses&quot;, Goodison and Morris mention the
controversy about the Golden Age of Peace, and say they are going to
dig into a virgin tel to look for a general layer of burnt rubble; the
sure sign that a place was sacked and burnt after a successful seige.
They found a layer of burnt rubble all right, but in trenching out,
find it was a single house fire. They dont have the balls in the book
itself to mention the initial reason for the dig.

I grant you that matriarchy is rare. Nevertheless, the Mosou of SW
China still are matriarchic. Its been too many centuries since the
queens ruled Kucha, and the place itself too obscure, for it to be
come well known even among the archeological community. But I'm not
trying to sell a book, I dont have to pay attention to the
sensibilites of academia. What you make of all this is up to you.

Might makes right, always has, always will. but when there is
abundance, then people band together, and as with the early agrarians,
stay put. We see this at Chatal Hoyuk and the other dozen original
Anatolian cities. Sass, &quot;The Substance of Civilization&quot; doing an
economic analysis, finds that when agriculture started, the amount of
land needed to support a community shrank by a factor of 500. These
cities grew to thousands at a time when the nomadic war bands had but
a 100 warriors to put in the field. No way would they attack
thousands, and indeed I've yet to see any data indicating warfare.
&quot;The Leopard's Tale&quot; by Hodder does not report any signs of violence
in *1500* years of occupation that he has dug thru at Chatal Hoyuk.

And it is these early agrarians that show us women in postures of
authority. A cultural tradition that next shows up in the Danube/
Dneiper area, carried forward with the Amazons, and eventually the
Tocharians. Who now leave us *documents* written in a feminine hand
running the shipping business of what we know as the 'Silk Road'. The
power of women even carried into China, with Tang *empresses*.

And of course, we see women rising to positions of authority now, and
no doubt they will soon discover these obscure traces of matriarchy.
And when that happens, you'll see a lot more money thrown at the issue.

Day Brown's use of words is always interesting.  If you want to look this
matrilineal  Chinese group up on Wikipedia, Mosou works fine (and doesn't
exactly agree with Day, but then that's no surprise).
If you want to look up academic works and follow this up, search on Moso.

If you look up Kucha on Wikipedia, no mention of queens, just kings (and
if you google on my name and Kucha you'll find more about the Kucha
kings). If you look up Kucha Queens on Google, lots of posts by Day Brown.
He calls them Gautamid Queens. If you look up Guamid Queens on Google,
lots of posts by Day Brown, hard to find anything else. If you look up
Gautamid... you probably get the point by now. You do get 2 non-Day Brown
references on Google Scholar, one to Ananda the Gautamid (male), another
to a Gautamid prince.
Fragments of the Tocharian A Maitreyasamiti-Na-t.aka of the Xingjiang
Museum ...
By Werner Winter, Georges-Jean Pinault does have a reference to a
Gautamid Queen. But I think this is Queen Gautami
Anyway, it seems to be Day Brown's proof of Kucha Queens, and is found
here:
http://tinyurl.com/2n765u
Day Brown calls her an Aryan Queen.

We are dealing with a very diverse set of documents. they didnt have
an Oxford Dictionary. Or even a Homor to produce a masterwork that was
so popular it standardized the language. I can only go by the sources
I've seen, which are not those you've seen. But what it really all
boils down to is whether the original Aryans were matriarchic or not.
that's where the rubber hits the road. And even then, I dont spoze
they all were at any one time. We've seen the power of women in
European culture ebb and flow over time, and leave some anachronistic
elements from previous states, some of which persist, and some which
faded, and help us date a document.

Let me try to be more precise. From Neolithic Anatolia, to SE Europe,
then across the Steppes as the Amazons,  all the way to the
Taklamakhan and the Tocharian cities like Kucha, there was a
continuous string of matriarchic cultures that interacted with the
surrounding patriarchic tribes. I cant say, doubt anyone can, just how
extensive matriarchy was in the Aryan line at any one time. All I can
say, is that I see it arrived intact in what is now NW China, and was
finally wiped out by the Mongols. But not before leaving us extensive
documentation proving women were running things.

The usage of the patriarchic tribes that took PIE words changed the
gender. &quot;Raja&quot; is male. But in Tocharian, the final -a is the female
suffix. In adopting the name for the authority figure, they took the
whole name, and either ignored, or didnt know it was originally a
feminine form. In like manner, the pope wears a tall hollow hat that
was originally designed to cover a woman's beehive hairdo. He wears
lace cause the Aryan priestesses wore lace, and of course, he dont
wear pants. The pope is in drag.

So, similarly, he dont know that &quot;Deos&quot; was something that belonged to
the Goddess and not god. That it mite, never even crosses his mind
because he was so socialized to a patriarchic culture and religion.
But in Tocharian, we have the remnants of the original carried forward
in a matriarchic culture, so we can see more clearly what the original
state of affairs was rather than looking thru the sychophancy of
scribes in the pay of kings.

Douglas Adams, &quot;Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology&quot; is a
fine scholar, tracing out lots of connections in the evolution of the
language from the original PIE. P 138: 5.8 THE GENETIVE:
&quot;{Though the genetive, alogn with the nominative, accusative, and
vocative, was one of the four cases Proto-Tocharian inherited from
Proto-Indo-European, it has, unlike the nominative and acusative,
undergone severe remodelilng. One sees the Proto-Indo-European state
of affairs least changed in the 'nt-' stems. Both nouns and adjectives
of this declensional type show the expected relfexes of PIE *-so,, ie,
B -e, A-0. A typical example is BB 'lante' [A lant] &quot;King's&quot; from PIE
*wleAntos. If not a scribal error, the same PIE *-os is represented by
th B 'tkatre' &quot;daughter's&quot; from *dhugAtros [Greek 'thugatros'
&quot;daughter's&quot;.}&quot;

On p61 he discusses a curious shortage of the imperative case. &quot;In
this tiny group of survivals is... 'say!'... 'pick me up!', ...
'give!'&quot; then too, he also mentions that he cant find the first person
singluar possessive.

So, it would seem that a woman could not say &quot;my baby&quot;, but only &quot;our
baby&quot;. What's going on here. The Mosou of SW China, who are still
matriarchic offer a clue. The women bear their babies in large
communal houses owned by the grandmothers. They dont have marriage as
we know it. The women recognize that it is the house, and not a
husband, who support them. Adams dont seem to know about this. But
this tradition of women depicted in postures of authority go all the
way back to Hacilar 9,000 years ago. What he thinks is the PIE word
for king was taken up by patriarchic cultures in the same way that the
pope took up the icons of priestly authority, but in fact, the term
originally applied to queens.

Thus, the 5th century copy of the Maitreyasamiti Texts in Tocharian A
is a conversation between the living Buddha and the *queen* of Kucha.
If Kucha had a king, the Buddha would've been talking to him. But
because the place was run by women, the velvet glove was more common,
and so the imperative form is only represented by what little kids say
to their mothers.

http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/5_bloom.php
says the Brits and Chines are going to put scans and photos of 100,000
documents and artifacts collected from the ancient Silk Road online.
Hopefully, more documentation will also be posted by German and French
collections, and scholars with more skill than I will have a vastly
larger canon to draw on to figure out just what was going on- where,
and when. Matriarchy dont seem to build empires, but rather vast peer
to peer trading networks.

The Silk Road was, at the very least, 3 routes- summer, spring/fall,
and winter routes on the East end, and West of the Pamir, a myriad of
different trails running East/West with another set that run North/
South. Most of which, most of the time, beyond the hegemony of either
Chinese or Persian empires. The usual iron fist of patriarchy didnt
work. Competent men could, and did, hop on a horse and move to where
the local power structure was more polite and respectful of their
rights.

Kucha went one step further to accomodate the men traveling the Silk
Road. The brothels were owned by the city, and staffed by the Kuchi.
Hence, we still say &quot;Kuchi coo&quot;. And when the Kuchi get done providing
service, the men paid with the familiar perforated Kuchan coin known
as &quot;cash&quot;. Is there a man that does not know what this means?
Academics have a hard time getting into it.

Yes, Sanskrit &lt;raja&gt; is masculine gender.  And /a/ or /a:/ is a feminine
suffix in many IE families.  But in the development of Indo-Aryan, PIE
*re:g^s, male leader, evolved something like this (haven't checked on
the exact details):  *re:g^s &gt; *re:Dzes &gt; *ra:dZas &gt; /ra:dZa/.  That is,
as is standard in Sanskrit, /g^/ &gt; /dZ/, /e/, /a/, /o/ all merge to give
/a/, and final /s/ is dropped.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

These changes occurred in all sorts of words irrespective of meaning.
This explains why many masculine gender words in Sanskrit end in -a.  It
has nothing whatever to do with whether their speakers were patriarchal,
matriarchal, or worshippers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

As did the people of Kerala within the last century or so.  But if
Tocharian, uniquely among the world's languages, really didn't have
&quot;my&quot;, and if, as you say, this means a mother didn't identify her baby
as hers (both big &quot;if&quot;s!), then, by the same logic, it means that no
one, man or woman, could have thought of themself as possessing anything
at all, even a toothbrush.  Are you prepared to accept this?

Of course, all the Tocharian we have was spoken three or four millennia
after the breakup of PIE, so, whatever their social system was, what
they wrote tells us _nothing_ about that of the speakers of PIE.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;-si&quot; and &quot;-os&quot; were originally feminine suffixes.

&gt;&gt; No they weren't!  In early PIE, *-os was animate gender, later
&gt;&gt; specialising to masculine, while a new femine gender was developd with
&gt;&gt; ending *-eh2, which became -a: in Greek and other branches.  Neuter was
&gt;&gt; *-om.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Mallory mentions
&gt;&gt; &gt; the Greek &quot;Thugatros&quot; as meaning that which belonged to a daughter.

&gt;&gt; So, why does that make the -os a feminine suffix?  After all, a daughter
&gt;&gt; can own things that are masculine, feminine or neuter -- and one would
&gt;&gt; expect that Mallory, following convention, would have quoted an
&gt;&gt; adjective in its masculine nomimative form.
&gt;We are dealing with a very diverse set of documents. they didnt have
&gt;an Oxford Dictionary. Or even a Homor to produce a masterwork that was
&gt;so popular it standardized the language. I can only go by the sources
&gt;I've seen, which are not those you've seen. But what it really all
&gt;boils down to is whether the original Aryans were matriarchic or not.
&gt;that's where the rubber hits the road. And even then, I dont spoze
&gt;they all were at any one time. We've seen the power of women in
&gt;European culture ebb and flow over time, and leave some anachronistic
&gt;elements from previous states, some of which persist, and some which
&gt;faded, and help us date a document.

&gt;Let me try to be more precise. From Neolithic Anatolia, to SE Europe,
&gt;then across the Steppes as the Amazons,  all the way to the
&gt;Taklamakhan and the Tocharian cities like Kucha,
">

Kucha had kings.  Once again, Day Brown is making an assertion where the
only evidence is his statements all over the web.

there was a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;continuous string of matriarchic cultures that interacted with the
&gt;surrounding patriarchic tribes. I cant say, doubt anyone can, just how
&gt;extensive matriarchy was in the Aryan line at any one time. All I can
&gt;say, is that I see it arrived intact in what is now NW China, and was
&gt;finally wiped out by the Mongols. But not before leaving us extensive
&gt;documentation proving women were running things.

&gt;The usage of the patriarchic tribes that took PIE words changed the
&gt;gender. &quot;Raja&quot; is male. But in Tocharian, the final -a is the female
&gt;suffix. In adopting the name for the authority figure, they took the
&gt;whole name, and either ignored, or didnt know it was originally a
&gt;feminine form. In like manner, the pope wears a tall hollow hat that
&gt;was originally designed to cover a woman's beehive hairdo. He wears
&gt;lace cause the Aryan priestesses wore lace, and of course, he dont
&gt;wear pants. The pope is in drag.

&gt;So, similarly, he dont know that &quot;Deos&quot; was something that belonged to
&gt;the Goddess and not god. That it mite, never even crosses his mind
&gt;because he was so socialized to a patriarchic culture and religion.
&gt;But in Tocharian, we have the remnants of the original carried forward
&gt;in a matriarchic culture, so we can see more clearly what the original
&gt;state of affairs was rather than looking thru the sychophancy of
&gt;scribes in the pay of kings.

&gt;Douglas Adams, &quot;Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology&quot; is a
&gt;fine scholar, tracing out lots of connections in the evolution of the
&gt;language from the original PIE. P 138: 5.8 THE GENETIVE:
&gt;&quot;{Though the genetive, alogn with the nominative, accusative, and
&gt;vocative, was one of the four cases Proto-Tocharian inherited from
&gt;Proto-Indo-European, it has, unlike the nominative and acusative,
&gt;undergone severe remodelilng. One sees the Proto-Indo-European state
&gt;of affairs least changed in the 'nt-' stems. Both nouns and adjectives
&gt;of this declensional type show the expected relfexes of PIE *-so,, ie,
&gt;B -e, A-0. A typical example is BB 'lante' [A lant] &quot;King's&quot; from PIE
&gt;*wleAntos. If not a scribal error, the same PIE *-os is represented by
&gt;th B 'tkatre' &quot;daughter's&quot; from *dhugAtros [Greek 'thugatros'
&gt;&quot;daughter's&quot;.}&quot;

&gt;On p61 he discusses a curious shortage of the imperative case. &quot;In
&gt;this tiny group of survivals is... 'say!'... 'pick me up!', ...
&gt;'give!'&quot; then too, he also mentions that he cant find the first person
&gt;singluar possessive.

&gt;So, it would seem that a woman could not say &quot;my baby&quot;, but only &quot;our
&gt;baby&quot;. What's going on here. The Mosou of SW China, who are still
&gt;matriarchic offer a clue. The women bear their babies in large
&gt;communal houses owned by the grandmothers. They dont have marriage as
&gt;we know it. The women recognize that it is the house, and not a
&gt;husband, who support them. Adams dont seem to know about this. But
&gt;this tradition of women depicted in postures of authority go all the
&gt;way back to Hacilar 9,000 years ago. What he thinks is the PIE word
&gt;for king was taken up by patriarchic cultures in the same way that the
&gt;pope took up the icons of priestly authority, but in fact, the term
&gt;originally applied to queens.

&gt;Thus, the 5th century copy of the Maitreyasamiti Texts in Tocharian A
&gt;is a conversation between the living Buddha and the *queen* of Kucha.
&gt;If Kucha had a king, the Buddha would've been talking to him.
">

I wouldn't be surprised if the wife of a Kucha King was styled a Queen. I
wouldn't be surprised if a Queen ruled on her own at one point. But Kucha
had kings.

And what Day Brown isn't telling you is in the fragments of the text we
have (yes, fragments) the queen is offering Buddha some cloth she made for
him. The Buddha-god tells her to give it to the Community. This doesn't
show that Kucha didn't have a king, just that the king's role didn't
involve making cloth. This doesn't sound very matriarchal. :-)

The same fragment also has 'the Sakya Queen with the cotton cloth in her
hand'. This could be the same person (I see Day Brown doesn't like Sakya).

See my previous response.  As for communicating the ideas, I

Gosh, somehow that's *exactly* how these concepts have always been
discussed and explained: in human language. With remarkably successful
results. What aspects of discrete particles and shells and energy levels
and charge and spin and mass and charm and matter-like properties and
wave-like properties and particle acceleration do you find hard to

Before you reply, &quot;Because they're communicated using scientific
language&quot;, don't bother. The reason anyone is able to read scientific
notation is because it was explained to them *in human language*. So
it's impossible for this notation to communicate anything to someone
that couldn't be communicated to him in the language through which the
notation was explained to him.

Which was my point about the pope being in drag. The original symbols,
and words, had feminine referents that were later taken up by the male
power structure, mostly in the late bronze age when writing
facilitated the logistics needed to move large armies.

Before that, it was like barbarian tribes all over the planet, where a
&quot;king&quot; didnt really have the means to organize a large force much less
make them obey his authority. This was commonly misunderstood in the
colonial era when some male tribal leader signed away rights that he
in fact, did not have the authority to do. The term &quot;King&quot; was
translated from language A to language B, without either side really
understanding what the other meant by the term. But nevertheless
adopting it, as we see in early Indo-European languages.

So, when the Chinese army shows, up, the Kuchi give them a &quot;king&quot; for
hostage, the army takes him back to Xian, and Kucha goes on with
business just like before. And if the Chinese gets pissed and off the
king, well then the Kuchi can just give them another one. The Chinese
dont ever get it. I see guys here dont either.

But we understand the male ego, and the marks of a true &quot;king&quot;-
monumental architecture, preferably in stone, that he can put his name
and image on. Then, because the literacy needed for logistics is
there, the kings words become law, and we see their laws. What king
lacks the power to make law? If it walks like a duck, and if it cant
walk, then its not a duck.

What laws do we have from the Tocharians in the name of some king?
What laws do we have from the Minoans in the name of some king? Where
are their images? Where are their names inscribed in stone? Did they
have kings that didnt have balls? Well, there is that skeleton in the
Varna graveyard with the &quot;golden penis sheath&quot;. Why is that there?
cause its the only way she could have a dick.

And of course, the male ego gets its panties in a wad at the whole
idea of women running the show.

No.  What I am saying is that these concepts are not
expressible in English, or any other language.  One has
to get around this, and somehow get the idea across by
considerable effort, if indeed it can be done.

The one who claims that these ideas can be simply
expressed only has tiny parts of them.

In response to my assertion that the language is perfectly capable of

There are cultures, such as the Christian, which holds that the
universe is infinite, that time and space is infinitely divislble, and
that what they perceive as &quot;solid&quot; objects in real space time are
ultimately divisible to &quot;billiard balls&quot;, that they quite literally
dont get it when you try to explain how quantum physics says its all
just force fields.

But those raised in the Vedic tradition, with cycles of time that go
back for eons, well before Adam and 'creation', dont have any problem
with it at all. To the Christian culture, this world is all there is.
But when Bengalese Saint Ramrpasad says that everything you see, down
to the ink in your bible, is just part of a &quot;projected matrix&quot; out of
the mind of the Goddess, the Vedics get it, The Christians dont. And
so do the students of quantum physics.

Nietzsche mentions how we were so socialized by Christian culture that
like the fish, we dont feel the water, or realize the ways it
constrains the ways we can think. Use whatever language or diction
definitions you want; you are dealing with neurotic denial, and you
will not be able to translate the Vedic position to them. Nor will
you, if you yourself are part of that Christian zeitgeist, see the
evidence in the digs for what it is, understand the iconography (like
why Vedic deities have 8 arms), or be able to translate the ancient
texts and understand the allegorical meaning.

This is interesting:
matriarchy
From: The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition  |  Date: 2007
The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition

matriarchy familial and political rule by women. Many contemporary
anthropologists reject the claims of J. J. Bachofen and Lewis Morgan that
early societies were matriarchal, although some contemporary feminist
theory has suggested that a primitive matriarchy did indeed exist at one
time. Claims for the existence of matriarchy rest on three types of data:
societies in which women make the major contribution to subsistence,
societies in which descent is traced through women (i.e., matrilineal),
and myths of ancient rule by women. But myths of ancient female dominance
invariably highlight women's failure as rulers and end with men assuming
power. Anthropologists believe that these myths function as a
rationalization of contemporary male dominance. Women may have greater
political power in matrilineal societies than in other societies, but this
does not imply matriarchy. Thus, while Iroquois women could nominate and
depose members of their ruling council, the members were male and enjoyed
a veto over women. Crow women could take ritual offices, but their power
was severely limited by menstrual taboos. Women may also have indirect
influence through their involvement in material production. In many
horticultural societies women produce the bulk of the group's dietary
staples. Even so, men often devalue this vital contribution, and usually
have the power to expropriate it. The universality of male dominance is
not, however, natural or biological, because the form of, and reasons
given for, patriarchy differ in most cultures. Through studying the
various ways that male dominance is organized and justified,
anthropologists have concluded that it is culturally constructed.

Society (1974); R. Reiter, ed., Toward an Anthropology of Women (1975); C.

There is an interesting debate here and I don't know the answer. But Day

I dont care what Cynthia has to say. Show me the evidence. We see the
evidence of patriarchy all over the place in the historical record and
documentation. we know what it looks like-
1- monumental architecture, preferably in stone so the king can tell
us what his name was.
2- statues and frescos of the king and his goon squads with weapons
that tell us what he'll do if we dont go along with him.
3- lots of evidence of those weapons being used, and lots of defensive
works of monumental size to prevent that use.
4- in the documentation, we see his name used as the authority to
grant contracts, make laws, collect taxes, and set boundaries.

Now what are we to make of it when we find a culture, like the Mosou-
who also dont have any of this? What? that they had philosopher kings
who ruled by sheer wisdom? Where is the Mosou king? why are they
keeping their male leader hid from the world?

If the Tocharians had kings, then they had warriors. Has there ever
been a king who did not have warriors? Well, show me the evidence- the
graves of the warriors.

&gt; I dont care what Cynthia has to say. Show me the evidence. We see the
&gt; evidence of patriarchy all over the place in the historical record and
&gt; documentation. we know what it looks like-
&gt; 1- monumental architecture, preferably in stone so the king can tell
&gt; us what his name was.
&gt; 2- statues and frescos of the king and his goon squads with weapons
&gt; that tell us what he'll do if we dont go along with him.
&gt; 3- lots of evidence of those weapons being used, and lots of defensive
&gt; works of monumental size to prevent that use.
&gt; 4- in the documentation, we see his name used as the authority to
&gt; grant contracts, make laws, collect taxes, and set boundaries.

&gt; Now what are we to make of it when we find a culture, like the Mosou-
&gt; who also dont have any of this? What? that they had philosopher kings
&gt; who ruled by sheer wisdom? Where is the Mosou king? why are they
&gt; keeping their male leader hid from the world?

&gt; If the Tocharians had kings, then they had warriors. Has there ever
&gt; been a king who did not have warriors? Well, show me the evidence- the
&gt; graves of the warriors.

We are not in your phantasy world.
