WWE boss: Get off the drugs

By SIMON ROTHSTEIN of THE LILSBOYS
July 16, 2007

WWE boss Vince McMahon has ordered his wrestlers to 'say no to
drugs'.

Despite some WWE stars going public in the last week to deny there is
a problem in the wrestling business, privately Vince is said to be
determined not to be blamed for another Eddie Guerrero or Chris Benoit
style tragedy.

Reports coming out of the States say that Vince and Johnny Ace - the
head of talent relations - called their roster together before last
Monday's Raw TV show.

After giving a stern speech on drug use, they also offered counselling
for those affected by addictions, the Benoit killings or anything
else.

However critics note that Vince gave a similar talk after Guerrero
died of heart failure in November 2005 and re-introduced drug testing,
both of which don't appear to have worked.

They also point to the likes of Ken Kennedy and Fit Finlay appearing
on American telly and making misleading statements about the number of
recent wrestling deaths and the causes behind them, as well as the
McMahon family's recent &quot;disappearing act in public&quot;.

The funerals for Nancy, 43, and seven-year-old Daniel Benoit - who
were murdered by Chris, 40, before he committed suicide - were held
this weekend.

McMahon did not attend, but Fit Finlay, Jim Ross, Dean Malenko and
Eddie's widow Vickie Guerrero from the WWE all did.

In front of about 75 family and friends, Nancy's younger sister Sandra
cried while telling moving stories of the sister she so admired and
the nephew who &quot;completed my life&quot;.

Chris Benoit's name was not mentioned once during the touching
ceremony.

Afterwards Ross, the commentator on the WWE's Raw TV show, wrote: &quot;The
service was reserved and classy. I loved the music.

&quot;The structure of the service allowed for ample opportunities for one
to reflect on the lives of Nancy and Daniel.

&quot;Of course, Chris, too, crossed my mind during the service. How could
he not?

&quot;Daniel's full name is Daniel Christopher Benoit and I read the little
guy's name over and over during the service.

&quot;I thought of so many memories of the Benoit family especially at
WrestleManias which has a &quot;family reunion&quot; feel for many of us who
don't see the talents' spouses and their kids but a handful of times
per year.

&quot;I have literally seen Daniel grow up at WrestleMania as Nancy would
have the apple of her eye dressed to the &quot;nines&quot; in either a little
tuxedo or a handsome suit.

&quot;Indeed, Mom Nancy made her little boy a sharp dressed man. I loved it
when they danced together! I can still close my eyes and hear the
music and see their smiles.

&quot;Today, I needed to see those smiles. Today I needed to feel those
good memories.&quot;

Addressing the massive amount of steroids Benoit was being prescribed
at the time of the killings, Jim said he was upset that a debate on
'Roid Rage' overshadowed the day.

He added: &quot;This entire tragedy is about much more than alleged steroid
abuse, especially on this day that I will carry with me for the rest
of my days.

&quot;Today was a time of remembrance for the loved ones that have been
lost and for paying our respect to a devastated family.

&quot;The wrestling business, like our lives, is far from perfect and many
areas of it need to be addressed and improved upon.

&quot;Perhaps this mission should be approached as if tomorrow was our
first day on the job and we have the chance to start fresh and make
things better for everyone who wants to play by the rules and to do
the right things so the business will continue to thrive long after
guys like me are nothing more than a fleeting memory of bygone days.

&quot;But Saturday, July 14 wasn't about the business. It was about paying
respect to a grieving family who need all the courage they can muster
and all the prayers they can receive.

&quot;Today. Please remember these folks in your prayers.&quot;

Sure he says that. I mean, he's like the United States President. He's the
boss of WWE.
What he says, goes.
And even if he's on steroids himself, and I'm sure he is, he's never gonna
admit that.
It's a multi-million dollar business and he's not gonna go down without
lying through his teeth.
Don't all powerfull men do that?
Why do they? Because he can afford to hire people who can make sure that his
lies are believed.

Well, at least by the people stupid enough.

I fail to understand why anyone thinks that WWE will be under serious
investigation. What crime's been committed? Roid rage is so vague and the
Benoit deaths cannot belinked to roid rage. In fact, due to the time period
that these murders occurred, any type rage cannot be attributed to the
deaths. Rage indicates a quick, snap---killing your family and yourslef over
the coruse of 3 days is not an act of rage.So I fail to see any connect to
WWE, except in the case of employee/employer. I do not like what McMahan as
done to wrestling, and I hate to see him orhis kids on tv, but Isee no
relation or basis for a serious investigation.

The same reason the sports media jock sniffers went after the WWF in
the early 1990s. They don't have the balls to go after the other
sports they are marks for so they rip VKM and the WWF/WWE to shreds

after the WWE they'd better go after Baseball at least as hard and as

In New Jersey it's a matter of taxation and regulation.  Entertainment
is treated more generously by the state than sports.  That's why WWF
(at the time) execs testified before the NJ state legislature that
their operation was entertainment and not sports.  The suckers can
believe whatever they want to believe, but I think you can enjoy WWE
without fooling yourself into thinking anything about it is real.
People go to movies all the time and get a lot less bang for their buck
than they do from WWE.

Aside from the tax advantages, *not* considered a sport removes WWE from the
steroid regulations imposed from pro sports. Bottom line: they are not a
sport so they are not regulated like professional sports are.

Actually,none of this matters to me, but I find it odd that people seem to
think that WWE will be sanctioned. About the only thing the government can
actually do is go after the individuals. That is the only type investigation
&amp;/or imposition that may be initiated....by putting pressure on the
individuals and therefore affecting the WWE.

And that individual should be Vince McMahon, who is WWE for all intents and
purposes.  His speeches about saying &quot;No&quot; to drugs are bullshit, just like
all the past speeches by all the past wrestling promoters about saying no to
drugs are complete and utter lies.  The wrestlers know that the boss is
saying it to go on record as having said it, and know that if they do not
take their vitamins, they will not be promoted and elevated to main event
status and earn less as a result.  WWF actually had an honest to goodness
real drug policy.  It lasted from 1992 to 1996.  In 1991, the steroids story
came out in a big, big way and Vince was implicated and got scared.  They
did not have the impressive legal department they have now, and so he could
not figure out how bad of a scare was he facing from the legal point of
view.  Technically, the Federal case on Vince McMahon distributing
controlled substances was all smoke and mirrors and the plot of an ambitious
Federal attorney looking to rack up publicity, but the publicity was racked
up and all of it stacked up bad against Vince.  He got scared and he
implemented a real policy.

It was so real that he fired two of his three biggest stars when he got
suspicious that they were cheating the drug tests by taking substances that
at the time did not show up (mainly GHB and primitive doses of HGH - I say
primitive because the stacks of drugs done back then were not as refined as
they are now and less knowledge was had on the substances) - Ultimate
Warrior and Davey Boy Smith.  His competition responded by immediately
hiring Davey Boy Smith.

After the Federal trial ended and Vince was getting his ass kicked in the
ratings in '96, he concluded that the reason his ratings were down and the
competition's were up was that the older wrestlers on the competing program
had better and more muscular bodies - because competion did not test for any
kind of drugs - and that drew the fans.  In Vince's mind it had nothing to
do with piss poor writing of his show, or the lacking production values, and
inability to connect to the modern audience... no, the main issue as he saw
it was bodies.  Competition's wrestlers had bigger bodies than the ones on
his program, so he ended the drug testing, and never looked back.

All these pep talks about the industry changing and how pro-wrestling is
going to get cleaned up are a pack of lies.  People said this when Eddie
Guerrero died and nothing changed.  People will say this about Benoit, and
nothing will change.  The public at large says, &quot;these guys aren't real
athletes&quot; - whatever the Hell that is supposed to be - and ignores
everything.

As for people talking about legalities... well, lets start with this -
Federal gov't has the right to regulate interstate commerce.  WWE is a fine
example of it.  Federal gov't has the right to investigate labor
irregularities.  WWE officially does not employ wrestlers, they
independently contract then and then tell them what to do 24/7.  Federal
gov't has the right to investigate monopolies and how they stay that way.
WWE is a monopoly and it stays that way (and please don't say TNA or ROH are
competition, because then you'd just look silly.  One is a theme park ride
pretending to be wrestling federation, the other is the Star Trek of
wrestling.  Yes, it's beloved by hardcore fans, but it draws... hardcore
fans).

When it all comes down to it, it is the wrestlers decision to use the
steroids. They want the money and fame and are willing to do anything to get
it. And in regards to your comment WWE being a monopoly, your explanation is
a stretch. It is not a monopoly because it has not has been proven publicly
or privately to stifle other wrestling feds from starting and attempting to
compete, we all know they have tried but it has to be proven. That the rest
cant succeed is the promoters and investors problems.

In what way are pro sports regulated by the state? I'm not aware of
any steroid regulation imposed by the government on pro sports.
Congress has power over baseball due to anti-trust laws, not
steroids.
