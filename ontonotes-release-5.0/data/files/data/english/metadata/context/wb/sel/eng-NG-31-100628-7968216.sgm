It there a motorola usenet group that John Navas does not post to?
I know how a kill filter works but, is there a way to block your own
post so certain people can't read them.

Anyone notice that a usenet group is like a living organism?
12% Brain, 87% Supporting Structure, only 1% Ass.
But all the crap comes from the Ass.

Enligthen me, as an undeclared part of the 99% not comprising ass, where do
you fall?

As to your burning question of how to post and to remain invisible to
certain people.  Perhaps you would like to elucidate your reasons for
remaining invisible to some and visible to many before getting the answers
to your question?

As I have many questions I would like answers to I do not consider
myself to be the brain of this particular news group, as I do not spew
crap when someone asks a question that may in some way be flawed
neither do I feel I am part of the ass.

Where do you feel you fit in?

I would like to be able to post a question without the worry that some
self proclaimed God of usenet will take offense to it and release a
shit storm of replies that, rather than answer the question, serve
only to demonstrate moral or intellectual outrage at the questioner.

By the way, how did your reply try to answer my question?

Posts in Usenet Newsgroups are rather like being in a cocktail party.
Some folks want to have the same discussion while others want to steer
it towards different goals.  There are some who believe in a kind of
karmic process.  They truly want to help as a way of giving back for
help they've received.  And just as in a cocktail party, there are those
obnoxious drunken oafs who act like they know it all.

Just as with a cocktail party, you focus on what interests you and
ignore what doesn't.  Unless you text someone at the party, there is no
way to direct your thoughts as spoken word but not to certain ears.

If you Google for moderated Motorola discussion groups or forums, you
will find these.  Depending upon the structure of the forum it may be
possible to &quot;text&quot; some but not have your thoughts available to the
general forum public.

Given the structure of even moderated Usenet Newsgroups, I think you
will more likely meet your needs in moderated web forums.  There are
several which elude me at the moment.  But they shouldn't be hard to
locate with your favorite search engine.

Brian, That is the best analogy I've ever heard for Usenet. You hit the
nail squarly on the head!
As for the moderated groups, I frequent www.howardforums.com ,
www.motox.info , www.motomodders.net and a few others but those seem to
be the top 3.

I didn't try to answer your question, I mainly wondered what your reason(s)
was/were for remaining &quot;invisble&quot;.  I see and understand now and given the
analagous reply from Brian K and Bruce R's comments I think you have some of
your answers.

You asked where I fit, I don't fit anywhere, never have but I don't care.
Best thing is to just ignore the whingers, there are some good guys in here
and you'll soon get to know who they are.

Byee!

moderated Motorola discussion groups
Thanks for the tip on moderated Usenet Newsgroups, something I wasn't
even aware of.
