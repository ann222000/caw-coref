SLMM agrees only Forces can carry arms

The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) has endorsed the government's
position that only the security forces and the police can carry arms,
the Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process (SCOPP) said
yesterday(17).

SLMM Spokesperson Thorffnur Omarsson confirmed that the Head of the SLMM
Maj. Gen. (rtd) Lars Johan Solveberg had subscribed to the government
position reiterated by the SCOPP at a meeting with the Head of the SCOPP
Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha yesterday, that none other than the security
forces and the police could use arms in the country.

Defence Spokesman and Minister Keheliya Rambukwella welcomed the SLMM
position, which, he said, recognized the right of the security forces to
act against any group that carried arms. &quot;That is what we have been
doing right along and we will continue to do so,&quot; he said last night
from Geneva.

He said he was happy that the SLMM endorsement had come at a crucial
time when civilians in the areas adjacent to the conflict zone were
coming under constant attacks from the LTTE, which, he said, had no
right to use arms and therefore had to be disarmed. &quot;Our position is at
last gaining international recognition,&quot; he said.

The SLMM furnished details of the recent abductions reported from the
East and the SCOPP agreed to inquire into the allegations. The SLMM also
apprised the SCOPP of the situation in the North, where it said its
monitors had reported incidents of constant shelling. The SCOPP
undertook to look into the incidents.

The SCOPP expressed its concern over the media reports about continual
LTTE attacks on civilian targets in Weli Oya and an attack on civilians
in an uncleared area in Mannar.

The SLMM informed the SCOPP that it was paying special attention to
monitoring in Jaffna and a report would be published shortly.
