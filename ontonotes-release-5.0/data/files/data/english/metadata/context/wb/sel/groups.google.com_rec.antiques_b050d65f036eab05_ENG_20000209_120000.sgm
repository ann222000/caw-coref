I have recently acquired and old Carl Fischer French Horn. Can
anyone help me find out about it. I believe it was made in
Italy but I'm not sure about that. Is there someplace I can
find info about Carl Fischer and a history of their horns so I
can ascertain a manufacture date for mine.

Thanks

I have an old French Horn made by Carl Fischer. I believe it
was made in Italy. Anyway, does anybody have a good idea where
I can go to find more details about it. When and where it was
made, etc. The only reference to Carl Fischer I can find on the
web is for a music publishing house.

Any help would be appreciated.

"/> No. When you post a query to a newsgroup, it's assumed you will hang
around for the answer. It's pretty basic USENET courtesy. You didn't
know. Now you do.

As to your horn. Yes, you're finding only references to Carl Fischer as
a source of published music. But for some years during a part of their
long history they sold a variety of instruments. These were
manufactured by various makers but carried the house brand, so to
speak. So you find, for instance, their instruments that were very
alike in style year to year, since Fischer speced them to the maker, but
they may have been made by any number of makers, depending on who got
the contract that year.

It can be very difficult to discover at this late date just who made a
particular instrument. You may find clues in obscure places, like on
the valves and other places. I tried for a long time to find who made a
nice inlayed guitar with their name and never was able to pin it down.

There doesn't seem to be anyone left at Fischer who's been around long
enough to remember details and apparently no records left. I suggest
showing it to someone very familiar with brass instruments. They won't
know who made it, but they can give you a relative idea of its quality.
Just because Fischer outsourced their work doesn't mean they weren't
good instruments.

My search engine brought up 2242 sites regarding Carl Fischer. Most of
them related to his music publishing business established in 1872.

One entry was from someone with a Carl Fischer baritone horn American
model, and the response was that it was probably from the 30's or 40's.

It appears that Carl did a great deal of composing and arranging,
specializing in ensembles of horns.

There was also a reference to the Carl Fischer website, but I didn't
take the time to try and find it.

I suggest you go to alltheweb.com and search and maybe you can come up
with some more information.
