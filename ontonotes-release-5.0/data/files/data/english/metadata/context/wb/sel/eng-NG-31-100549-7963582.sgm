Hi,
I just purchased my first Saab.  It is a 2002 9-5 Linear sedan with
about 70k miles.  I love the car, however, the second day I owned it I
started having a couple of issues with it.  I hope you all can give me
some insight.

I purchased the car in Phoenix, AZ and headed for Denver, CO straight
from the dealer's lot.  It ran like a top until the end of the first
day, then when I stopped for fuel, the car would turn over, but
wouldn't start until the 2nd or 3rd attempt.  By the beginning of the
2nd day, I would have to wait 10 or 15 minutes, with the hood open,
before the car would start.  By the time I was 50 miles out of Denver,
the check engine light came on and I had to wait about 40 minutes
until the car would start.  All other gauges, idiot lights and
messages were normal. The oil, gas, transmission, and radiator fluids
were fresh and full.  Temp is completely normal, engine purrs like a
kitten and once it starts, the car runs like a top.

I called a Saab dealer in Denver to make an appointment to have it
checked, and to see if I needed to have it towed in the rest of the
way (due to the check engine light).  The service tech I spoke with
didn't address the issue of the car not starting, but did insist that
one fill up with Regular unleaded gasoline, rather than the Premium,
had probably done considerable damage to my engine.

Before I take it in on Monday, I would like to hear any opinions about
why the car isn't starting correctly and get your opinions about the
possibility of damage to the engine.  (I read an article prior to
purchase that Saabs could run on any grade of fuel, as the engine
senses engine knock and adjusts accordingly.)

I contacted the dealer in Phoenix (Mercedes Benz dealer) and his
service department felt the starting issue has to do with the change
in altitude and that it only needs an adjustment to the oxygen/fuel
ratio.

Again, I would be most grateful for any advice on sorting this all
out.
Thanks

Hi,
You want to know what the check-engine-light says.. have someone read the
error code from the computer so you know where to look for the cause.

Was there not an issue when the filler cap was not closed properly with some
models? But then again, that would not make the car start bad, only the
check engine light come on.

The talk of &quot;the wrong&quot; fuel is nonsense IMHO, the engine should be able to
adjust to anything reasonable  you give it, also to varying driving
conditions, such as temperature and air pressure/ height.
Thats what the engine management computer is for. No manual readjusting
necessary.

I would go right back to whoever sold you the car, and get them to fix the
problem. I mean: they did sell you a &quot;good&quot; car, right? Then it should not
fail within a day.

My guesses at the cause from half an earth away:
- a temperature sensor broke or loose connection (40%, there is more than 1
tempsensor I assume)
- air-mass-meter broke (5 %)
- cold-start valve broke or connection bad (5%)
- Bad electrical connection to any of the sensors or actuators (5%)
- REALLY bad fuel (not likely.. 0.01 %)
- Other cause (99%) ;)

Good luck,
Richard.

Your Saab will happily run on any version of unleaded fuel you put in
it.  It will run best on Super Unleaded but I usually put the midgrae
in mine and can't tell a difference.  The computer can sense knock
from lower octane fuel and dials everything back to make up for it.

You didn't do any damage to it with the gas and it doesn't need any
sort of air / fuel adjustment as all those kind of adjustment are
handled by the computer.  I would stay far far away from any place
that handed you a load like that.

Likely when the codes are checked (the reason the check engine light
is on) then a good mechanic will know what has failed or have a good
idea of what direction to go in.  My guess is that you have a sensor
that has failed and the codes will tell you which one it is.

Thank you for your answer.  I will take it to a (different) Saab
technician on Monday and have them check the computer.  I appreciate
you taking time to help me out.
Best, Ginger

Hi all and thank you for your input.  I did take the car to a
differnet Saab technician and the computer told him that the car
dieing when I idoled in gear, the trouble starting the car and the
other errors were all due to the &quot;crankcase&quot; sensor being bad.  That
was replaced, and I have happily driven by Saab 3/4 of the way across
the US with no problems.
Thanks again for your input and reassurance that I didn't damage the
engine by putting a tank of regular unleaded fuel into the tank.  I
have since been using only medium grade or premium grade unleaded fuel
(depending on the octane rating) and have been getting about 33mpg
highway.  You guys are terrific.
Best, Ginger
