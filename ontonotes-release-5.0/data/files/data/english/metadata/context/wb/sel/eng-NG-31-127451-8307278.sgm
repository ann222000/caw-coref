MORE CORPORATE WELFARE IN BUSHLANDIA

The deficit is high, the debt is growing, the war’s financial costs are
exorbitant, and the nation is just coming to grips with the need for a
sizable investment in the nation’s bridges and infrastructure.

Given this environment, the president has a plan: more tax cuts.

-    President Bush said yesterday that he is considering a fresh plan
to cut tax rates for U.S. corporations to make them more competitive
around the world, an initiative that could further inflame a battle with
the Democratic Congress over spending and taxes and help define the
remainder of his tenure.

Advisers presented Bush with a series of ideas to restructure
corporate taxes, possibly eliminating narrowly targeted breaks to pay
for a broader, across-the-board rate cut. In an interview with a small
group of journalists afterward, Bush said he was &quot;inclined&quot; to send a
corporate tax package to Congress, although he expressed uncertainty
about its political viability.   -
