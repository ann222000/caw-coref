Why live on a budget?
By Shelly K. Schwartz · Bankrate.com

If you're like most Americans, your monthly income never goes far
enough. After shelling out for house payments and groceries, it seems
there's little leftover for things that matter most to you -- weekly
dinners out, orchestra-row theater seats, a college savings plan for
your kids.
4 reasons to budget
1.      Help control debt
2.      Earn cheaper rates
3.      Improve relationships
4.      Save more money
Hate to break it to you, but it's not your salary that's to blame.
According to financial experts, it's a pattern of poor spending
choices.

"When my clients sit down and really look at where their money is
going, oftentimes they are shocked to find it has nothing to do with
what's really important to them," says Martin Siesta, a certified
financial planner for Compass Wealth Management in Maplewood, N.J.
"Five dollars a day on Starbucks, for example, is a big number when
you multiply it by 360. That takes away from things you may have been
struggling to attain."

Life's little extras are well within reach for those who know how to
budget.

By establishing reasonable spending limits and sticking to them, the
average consumer can do far more with less -- without sacrificing
daily conveniences, said Jim Tehan, a spokesman for the Myvesta
Foundation, a self-help consumer education Web site.

"Budgeting is all about controlling your finances instead of letting
your finances control you," Tehan says. "That element of control is
going to save you money in the long run."

Controlling debt
Financial mismanagement makes consumers more vulnerable to
overspending, which results in lower savings and higher credit card
debt.

Myvesta's 2005 annual Credit Card Survey, reports the average American
carries $2,328 in credit card debt, spread out across 2.9 cards. With
interest rates at or above 18 percent for most cards, that gets
expensive. For example, a $5,000 balance on a credit card with 18
percent interest would cost you more than $8,000 to pay off if you
made only the minimum payments (4 percent).

"The amount of money you wind up spending just servicing debt through
credit card interest could be extra money you could apply towards
something else," Siesta says, adding that following a monthly budget
can help you both pay down existing debt and prevent impulse spending
to begin with.

Cheaper rates
Another upside to life on a budget is that it forces you to become
organized. That, in turn, helps you avoid late payment penalties and
improves your credit score. Lenders use your credit score to determine
how much they should charge you for auto and mortgage loans. It also
can affect how much you pay for auto and homeowners insurance.

Improve your relationship
A less obvious benefit of budgeting is the positive effect it can have
on relationships. According to Siesta, sitting down with your
significant other to discuss financial goals helps prevent money
disputes down the road. It also provides a rare opportunity to define
your own spending philosophies. "Money is a huge source of stress for
many couples," he said. "The mere act of discussing your finances with
a spouse or significant other really does help create better
understanding and better relationships."

Saving for the future
Finally, learning to live within your means can help you get ahead. By
allocating a portion of your monthly budget towards savings, you can
simultaneously build a retirement nest egg for your future and a
financial safety net for short-term emergencies, in case you or your
spouse lose a job or suddenly fall ill.

"Budgets create financial security, which gives you the ability to
withstand the financial surprises that life throws your way," Tehan
said.

Budgets are all about financial freedom. Without a plan for saving and
spending, you'll never make the most of your income -- no matter how
much money you earn.

"Budgets are very empowering," Siesta says.

"They don't lead you away from something. They lead you toward your
financial goals."

I track my family's spending pretty closely. We don't do much frivolous
spending, no Starbucks and the like. Maybe we eat out more than we
should but our spending last year was a full 50% more than our income
and trust me, we don't eat out that much. I just finished reading Mary
Hunt's "Debt-Proof Living" and I'm trying to come up with a budget, but
I can't simply cut every category by 33% and I can't excise a category
to make my budget balance (none are big enough to turn things around
anyway.)

So where do I turn? How do I find someone who can give me solid
suggestions about how to reduce my outgo so I can save 10% rather than
spending 50%, but doesn't have a vested interest in me investing in a
particular plan or

Most people who are settled into a habit of spending more than they
earn will run into a 'reality wall' when they try to reduce their debt
load. They believe that they have eliminated every luxury and left
only the necessities, but are still spending too much.  Success
requires a real change in what you believe you need.

If your lifestyle was that much higher than your income, it means that
your idea of necessities is very screwed-up. It's going to hurt more
than you thought to come back to reality.

In order for someone to make meaningful suggestions, they'd have to know
what you're current spending is and how it breaks down, as well as where
you are. Otherwise, all you'll get is the generic stuff like:

Use store brands instead of national brand names;

Cook from scratch whenever possible;

Minimize or eliminate convenience foods;

Minimize driving, trade in for used/smaller/more fuel efficient
vehicles.

You can find that type of thing on numerous web sites.

Am I reading that right?  That would mean if you earned $50K you spent
$75K.  Did you suddenly have some big life event impact your income or

&lt;snip&gt;

If I were overspending my income at that rate--and even without knowing what
your income is that looks pretty extreme regardless--I wouldn't be eating
out AT ALL and I wouldn't be buying clothing or household goods anyplace
except thrift stores. I'd also be looking at every able-bodied adult in the
household getting a second job until the spending got back in line with the
income. I don't mean to focus on restaurant food as the source of your
problem, but "we don't eat out that much" tells me you have a mentality that
it's somehow okay to buy things you can't afford, things you might think
you're somehow entitled to anyway.

You're probably right, you can't excise an entire category (unless you've
budgeted for entertainment and vacations, in which case that should be the
first to go to zero), but I suspect you need to look first at the areas of
large expense which for most people are housing and cars. If you can't buy
the things your family needs and still make your mortgage payment, you need
to move to a cheaper house or even an apartment. If you're making one or
more car payments and can't afford them, you need to trade that car for one
you can afford. And so on. See a pattern here?

Actually the "big life event" happened a couple of years ago (my wife

handle on it since. Our savings (including the equity in the house) are
now spent and I simply can't let it happen again this year. I need to
sit down with someone smarter than myself in these matters who isn't out
to sell me something. How do I find such a person?

The only organization that I have found on the internet that sounds even
remotely close is Debtors Anonymous. Anyone have experience with them?

Part of the answer might be in the other post you just wrote. Maybe your
family can't afford for your wife and/or daughter to attend college, at
least not without making other major alterations in your spending. Higher
education, like it or not, is not a necessity.

How old is your daughter? I have 3 sons ages 22, 25, 27, who are all in
college, supporting themselves &amp; living on their own.  The first year the 2
youngest moved away to college (in 2002), we helped with their housing
expenses, but we only did that for a little over a year.  Ever since,
they've been working and paying their own way in life.  They are learning
first hand how to live within their means.  DS#2 took a year off school to
work extra hours to get himself a car (he and DS#1 were sharing a car that
first year).

All of them are working 35+ hours per week and taking at least 12 credit
hours in school.  It can be done by someone who really wants to do it. They
knew from the start that we were in no postition to put them all through
school. We just don't make that kind of money.

Just because your wife and daughter WANT to go to college doesn't mean you
have to go into major debt to make it happen.

It is easy to fool yourself into thinking that you don't have much
wasteful spending, if you don't actually track where the money is
going. Once I detailed precisely where I was spending my income, the
problems got fixed very quickly.

What you need is a support group or the like. This need not be a formal

the things that religious communities are famous for, providing support.

Not to sound trite, but the person you need to find is yourself.  Your
wife AND oldest daughter started college without your having the
funding to support that?  And you have more kids?!?  Are you expecting
the tooth fairy to fly in and rescue you?

In a way, you may be to blame for for the mess, by not including DW in
tracking of finances and leaving her out of "the loop."  If so, you'd
better admit that up front.

Sample script:
"Dear wife, this is a partnership and our finances are screwed up.  I
thought paying for college was possible, but it is not.  We have to
look at our long term survival and re-evaluate what we can afford.  As
the only one bringing in money, and not enough of it, I have to say
that we have to make a choice - dear daughter goes to college on our
money and you help support us - even if it means your dropping out of
college yourself - or dear daughter has to fend for herself and you
have to still help find a way of cutting our expenses and supporting
your college while we meet our other financial goals.  Otherwise, we
can't afford your going to college either.  Here is our situation and
this is the projection of where we will be if we continue like
this..."

You are not a sack of unlimited money with a protruding penis.  Your
family (and you) needs to recognize that.

BTW, do you plan to stiff the younger daughter on college funding,
either by intent or financial mismanagement?  You'll not create any
love doing that, especially if you have even partially funded daughter
#1.  Daughter #2 won't like mom either, for putting you in those
financial straits.

The bottom line is you cannot give what you do not have.  You are
avoiding a confrontation by trying to throw money at the problem to
make it go away.  It won't.   You must have the battle, and the sooner
the better.  Unless you plan to die before age 70, you have a
retirement and emergency fund that you absolutely must fund.
Daughter(s) may abandon you, wife may divorce you, and you may end up
with nothing but memories and their debts.  It didn't used to be that
way, but unless you have a rock solid marriage, then those are
possibilities.   Frankly, if you can't discuss financial realities,
then I don't think you have a rock solid marriage.  You might be
better off having the big fight now and divorcing while you have zero
financial worth, hoping that a judge has better financial sense than
you when he awards support and alimony.

If your wife is a worthy partner, she'll be angry and upset, but
willing to do what is needed to make things work.

If they don't think having to give up college  or find a way to help
out is fair, then I suggest you quit your job and go to college
yourself.

Obviously, I don't know the entire situation, only what you have
presented.  If DD and DW are in expensive colleges, they may have to
step into a less costly college.  If DW funded and supported your own
college education, you have a debt to repay, etc..

I think we forgot how to be frugal shortly after WWII. Being stuck with no
money in poor sections of China or India for six months is a guarantee for
anyone to become a budget guru. Ever wonder why many foreigners with so
little to start out with do so well in so short period of time.

One of my applicants has an annual income well over $150K but his credit
report was just a long lists of collections. Ugly and how could anyone with
that kind of income be in such a tight fix? Give him a $500K annual income
and he would still be screwed. It's not how big you paycheck is but what you
do with it that makes more of a difference.

Any standard public accountant can do what you describe.  Just let
them know, in advance, that you don't want them hawking products to
you. The problem that you will soon discover is that your issue isn't
just money management. You need a major reality check. Somebody is
going to have to hit you in the back of the head with a cast iron
frying pan to get you to realize the 'wrongness' of spending more than
you earn.

The things that an accountant would tell you are just common sense
that you already know. Your overspending is more like an addiction.
Your unsustainable lifestyle is like cocaine to you. You won't give it
up without a fight.

How about this?  Instead of starting with your current expenditures as a
baseline, start with your income as the baseline.  Then make a budget by
slicing it up according to your priorities, rather than what you are
spending in each category now.  This will give you the mental picture of
how you need to start living.  When you are done, *then* compare it to
what you are spending in each category now.

Then, if you haven't done it already, have a sit-down talk with your
wife and older kids.  Tell them about it a day or two in advance, make
it a real event.  Explain the problem with *specific numbers* and then
have a brainstorming session with the only criteria being, we only
consider things that will actually fix the problem.  In other words,
spending must re-align to what is available rather than the status quo
or what people deserve.  Start off the brainstorming by suggesting
something drastic, like moving to a smaller house and cutting back to 1
car.  If you're overspending by 50%, you have start right off by making
them realize the status quo is *dead*... but we can and will make it
through.

I sympathize.  Cutting back is very hard.  But if you've just burned
through your net worth in 2 years, now is the last possible moment to
hit the brakes before plunging into the abyss.  Just keep telling
yourself, the longer I wait, the larger the problem will be.

I'd personally tell the wife that having both her and your oldest

she should work instead, until the other kids have graduated
too if you plan to fund their time in college too.

Again, without any hard numbers its not even possible to say if you have that right.

Its unlikely that those who have your income are paying for two in
college simultaneously and not spending more than is coming in.

that outgoings 50% higher than incomings cant go on forever and that

Let me make sure I have this right. You spent 50% more than you earned last

expenses? I'm *almost* speechless, but I'll take this as a jumping-off point
to say that buying services that with some effort and education you can
provide for yourself (budgeting, cooking, basic home maintenance, etc.) is a

I realize that many people have limitations to how much they can handle.  In
our case, all 3 (at least to begin with) were going to private colleges and
had NO access to FASFA or any help at all.  They've done very well, and it's
been a huge growing experience for them.  They learned that nothing is
handed to them, they have to work hard to meet their goals.  My youngest son
and his wife are graduating in May after 5 long/hard years of working and
school.  They have no interest in living off of the government cheese.  No
loans, no Fed help, just plain hard work and living within their means.

I've seen too many couples learn how to work the system.  I am proud that my
kids refuse to go that route and are willing to make their own way in life.
Just like we did. Living on 1 income for 22 years while we raised our kids.
No State or Fed help. We had the kids, we supported them.

My oldest son has transferred to a State college, and will qualify for some
FASFA help.  Not much, but some. He and his wife work hard...she carries the
medical insurance, and they live with 1 car. He uses public transportation,
and works and studies his a** off to do it.  It can be done.   To many young
people today think they are "owed" help.  Mine don't. They realize they are
adults and responsable for their own lives. Imagine that...personal
responsability.

Hmm.  Maybe you're not earning enough?  Seriously - if you're cutting
all your expenses to the bone and it still doesn't make a difference,
maybe you need to earn more?

In my own struggle with credit card debt (paid off $16,000 while
unemployed), I found that it is frequently easier to just find a way
to make more money rather than torture yourself with yet another
budget cut.  I didn't give up Starbucks while paying off my debt.  In
fact, I gave up very little in the way of luxuries at all; most of the
luxuries I enjoy are fairly cheap.  What I did do, however, was take a
very serious look at my major expenses and trim those - cheaper
housing, cheaper car, etc. - and take every single odd-job and money-
earning opportunity I could get my hands on.  I was working every
single hour of the day, doing some odd job or other.  That's what made
the difference.

That's true. They used to work medical students to death at a
university near here, until somebody asked WHY? Doctors don't normally
work 36-hour shifts at hospitals in our state, so what are these
students preparing themselves to do? Now, medical students and interns
have more reasonable work schedules.

Working long hours on occasion is probably good for character, but
doing it for a prolonged period of time is probably a waste of life
and health.

you've
&gt; &gt; budgeted for entertainment and vacations, in which case that should be
the
&gt; &gt; first to go to zero), but I suspect you need to look first at the areas
of
&gt; &gt; large expense which for most people are housing and cars. If you can't
buy
&gt; &gt; the things your family needs and still make your mortgage payment, you
need
&gt; &gt; to move to a cheaper house or even an apartment. If you're making one or
&gt; &gt; more car payments and can't afford them, you need to trade that car for
one
&gt; &gt; you can afford. And so on. See a pattern here?

&gt; I've done all the things I can think of to cut our expenses, all the
&gt; normal things you read about, but I can't seem to get to that magic
&gt; number of saving 10% of my income.

&gt; I feel I'm to the point that generic answers aren't going to cut it. I
&gt; want someone who can help me take the next step, but I don't know where
&gt; to look. It seems that all of the &quot;personal financial consultants&quot; I can
&gt; find are trying to sell some sort of loan or product. What I would like
&gt; to find is someone who can look at my particular situation, go over my
&gt; expenses with me and help me create a budget. I'm willing to pay for the
&gt; services of a professional but how do I find one?
">

In some circumstances, it's pretty normal to spend more than you make.  For
instance, most people going to college spend more during their college years
than they make during their college years.  The day you buy a house, you've
probably spent more than you make in a year, or two, or three.

There are generally two ways to cover gaps like this.  One is save up for
them beforehand.  The other is borrow the money and pay it back in the
future.  Or both.

One thing that will probably not help much is spending even more, even if
it's for the professional services of an astute money manager.  If your
family is spending 50% more than it takes in, no professional advice is
going to magically produce more money.

As to how do you find a professional, you do it the same way you find a
doctor, dentist, auto mechanic, or whatever.  Ask your colleagues at work
and your neighbors who they use and shop around.

&gt; &gt; Not everyone can do that, it is not just a matter of will power.

&gt; I realize that many people have limitations to how much they can handle.
In
&gt; our case, all 3 (at least to begin with) were going to private colleges
and
&gt; had NO access to FASFA or any help at all.  They've done very well, and
it's
&gt; been a huge growing experience for them.  They learned that nothing is
&gt; handed to them, they have to work hard to meet their goals.  My youngest
son
&gt; and his wife are graduating in May after 5 long/hard years of working and
&gt; school.  They have no interest in living off of the government cheese.  No
&gt; loans, no Fed help, just plain hard work and living within their means.

&gt; I've seen too many couples learn how to work the system.  I am proud that
my
&gt; kids refuse to go that route and are willing to make their own way in
life.
&gt; Just like we did. Living on 1 income for 22 years while we raised our
kids.
&gt; No State or Fed help. We had the kids, we supported them.

&gt; My oldest son has transferred to a State college, and will qualify for
some
&gt; FASFA help.  Not much, but some. He and his wife work hard...she carries
the
&gt; medical insurance, and they live with 1 car. He uses public
transportation,
&gt; and works and studies his a** off to do it.  It can be done.   To many
young
&gt; people today think they are &quot;owed&quot; help.  Mine don't. They realize they
are
&gt; adults and responsable for their own lives. Imagine that...personal
&gt; responsability.

I don't know quite what nospam had in mind, but some education is just so
expensive and so time consuming (medical school, for example) that is just
not possible to work your way through.

&gt; You can seriously wreck your health doing that.  I know someone who
&gt; did this; worked 80 hours a week and went to school full-time.  Yeah,
&gt; she graduated.  But now she has a really horrifying autoimmune problem
&gt; with her eyes, a thyroid disorder, and all sorts of other things that

Well, if there was actually a cause and effect relationship, I'd agree.  On
the other hand, there are 168 hours in a week.  Leaving aside 8 hours a day
for sleep, there are 112 hours at your disposal.  Working 80 hours a week is
a huge chunk, and leaves only 32 hours for school, commuting, personal care,
etc.  I'd agree that your acquaintance overreached.  But just because she
now has some medical problems that she didn't have before doesn't, by
itself, mean much when it comes to assigning causes.  People with ordinary
schedules come down with these problems too, after all.  In my own case, I
aged several years while I was in school.

I'm beginning to feel that I've done my wife a disservice. Our actual
spending on "Education" (college for both my wife and daughter) last
year was only 4% of my income. Even if both of them quit college, the
dent would be minor.

This is not a situation where I'm working my ass off while my wife milks
off of me. If anything, it's the opposite, she works her ass off while I
provide little more than a paycheck. Part of my spending problem is
probably because she works so hard to give me a good life I feel like I
owe her more than I can repay.

Pay cash for everything. No cash, no purchase.  If in a given month you
throw your cash around frivolously and then miss some required payments
(utilities, car, house, ins, etc), the bite in the ass you'll get from those
entities will cause you to pay them first the next time.  If you run out of
cash before you run out of month, you may have to eat beans out of your
pantry for a while or maybe you'll have to go to a food bank or soup
kitchen.  The humiliation you'll feel (or should feel) if that happens will
cause you to do anything to avoid that experience again. Don't ever again
spend more than you make, or you will end up at the food bank.

It reminds me of those breast implant cases. It was noticed after

This had nothing to do with them turning 60, it had to be the
