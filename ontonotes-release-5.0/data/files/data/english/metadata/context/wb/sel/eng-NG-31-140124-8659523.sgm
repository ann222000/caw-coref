&quot;I just gets better and better&quot;

Come with us on this nice little stroll through time, Patriot style.

By: Bob George/BosSports.net

We begin in 1970, when the AFL officially became the AFC and perched
itself under the aegis of the NFL. The Boston Patriots played their home
games at Harvard Stadium, the fourth venue they called home since their
inception in 1960. Their head case head coach was Clive Rush, who was
somehow okay to be on a Jet staff that won a Super Bowl two years prior
yet melted down as Patriot head man. Rush is the perfect poster child
for the beginning of this story, as he was a symbol of what things were
like for the Patriots in this time period.
1970:
2-12. 1971: 6-8. 1972: 3-11. 1973: 5-9

What a coup the Patriots thought they scored in getting a Super Bowl
quarterback. Trouble is, Joe Kapp lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in his
only big show, 23-7. He then came to Boston and played like Joe Crapp.
His passer rating for 1970 was 32.5.

Mike Taliaferro did only a little bit better at 41.6. The Patriots did
get the number four selection in the draft, Phil Olsen, but the Patriots
mistook him for his more talented brother Merlin.

Billy Sullivan didnt do a whole lot of things right in his tenure as
Patriot founder and owner. But he did two things for which he will never
be forgotten, in a good way. He brought the team into being. And he kept
them here with a Wal-Mart-ish stadium out in the sticks, built on time
and under budget. Schaefer Stadium opened in 1971 down in Foxborough.

The team was to be renamed the Bay State Patriots, but fearful of the
team becoming the B.S. Patriots, the team instead changed its name to
the New England Patriots.

The Patriots finally had a permanent home, its vagabond days over. Home?
A 61,000-seat high school facility? Located off the Boston Post Road
with traffic logistics to choke a pig? And with toilets which backed up
when test flushed? Only the Patriots.

Jim Plunkett came along with the new stadium. He would go on to win two
Super Bowls,..........elsewhere. These were the first days of Carl
Garrett and Randy Vataha and the last days of Gino Cappelletti and Jim
Nance. Nobody could protect Plunkett, and there were too many Steve
Kiners, George Hoeys and Ron Boltons who couldnt stop the other guys if
they had to.

10/18/76: Fans disgrace the organization on a Monday night against the
Jets, with fans running on the field, fans throwing objects on the
field, and dozens of arrests for drunken disorderly conduct. A drunken
fan urinates on an EMT trying to revive a heart attack patient.

12/18/76: Ben Dreith ruins the Patriot season with a horrid roughing the
passer call on Ray Hamilton during a playoff game at Oakland which
prevented the Patriots from likely winning Super Bowl XI that year.

12/18/78: Before a Monday night season finale at Miami, Howard Cosell
gleefully tells the world that Fairbanks has signed a contract to coach
the University of Colorado in 1979, and has been fired as Patriot head
coach immediately.

The AFC East champs lose to Miami, then suffer the only home playoff
loss in history to Houston two weeks later. A ray of hope came in 1973
with the arrivals of John Hannah, Sam Cunningham, Darryl Stingley, and a
new head coach, Oklahomas Chuck Fairbanks.

The Patriots embarked on a seven-year run where they had a few tastes of
the playoffs and some excruciating near misses. Along with Russ Francis
and Steve Nelson in 1974 and Mike Haynes and Tim Fox in 1976, the
Patriots suddenly became a playoff team.

The Patriots went 0-2 in their two playoff tilts in the 1970s, 24-21 at
Oakland in 1976, and punked at home by Houston, 31-14 two years later.

During this period, the Patriots became known as a football version of
the Red Sox. They became a good team which choked in the clutch, and had
the talent to go all the way but lost key games which they should have
won.

They also became known for having some of the worst behaved fans in the
league, with drunken riots permeating the stands every game. It was
worse in the evening, such that ABC stayed away from Foxborough from
1982 to 1995.

Fairbanks messy departure on the eve of the 1978 playoffs typified how
things worked for the Patriots back then. How could something like this
happen, one week after clinching their first-ever division championship
at home in front of a delirious home crowd? Bill Parcells had a messy
departure, yes, but Fairbanks exodus from Foxborough was far worse and
ultimately more damaging.

1980: Ten wins, no playoffs. On final weekend, Pats make playoffs if one
of four teams loses. All four teams win.

1981: 2-14. Pats lose finale to 1-14 to win top draft pick for 1982.
Pats pass on USC running back Marcus Allen and take Texas defensive
lineman Ken Sims.

1984: Head coach Ron Meyer fires defensive coordinator Rod Rust.
Sullivan fires Meyer. Raymond Berry takes over as head coach and
immediately re-hires Rust.

Even when things went good, they went bad. In 1985, the 11-5 Patriots
became the first team in NFL history to advance to the Super Bowl by
winning three road playoff games. Imagine a six seed making it to the
big show today. Thats tantamount to what the 1985 Patriots did. So what
happens? They suffer the worst loss (at the time) in Super Bowl history,
losing to Chicago 46-10 in Super Bowl XX in a total and utter
humiliation.

Days later, several Patriots are revealed to having been on drugs for
the contest.
1989: 5-11.
1990: 1-15.
1991: 6-10.
1992: 2-14.

If 1970-73 was Dark Ages I, 1989-92 was Dark Ages II. Dark Ages II is
the time period in Patriot history which is the main reason why you
should love forever what is happening today, and continue to crave more
championships. Sullivan had sold the team in 1988 to Victor Kiam of
Remington, but no one knew, despite Billy finally pulling out of the
organization he created and kept in the area, that Kiam would lead the
Patriots into deeper shame than Sullivan or his sons ever did.

1990 remains the worst single season in Patriot history. A Week 2 16-14
win at Indianapolis begat a 14-game losing streak to finish the season.
Marc Wilson and Tommy Hodson were eminently forgettable Patriot
quarterbacks in this Steve Grogans final season. The Patriots were
outscored by their opponents 446-181. During the 14-game losing streak
the offense was held under 20 points 12 times.

And the scandal involving Patriot players exposing themselves to
then-Herald reporter Lisa Olson (now with the New York Daily News)
remains the low water mark in franchise history.

Rust coached the team in 1990, then gave way to former UMass head coach
Dick MacPherson. While he restored dignity to the team, along with a
cheerleader style of coaching, he could not bring his team to win
consistently and he had to step down due to health problems.

By 1992, the team was a total woebegone organization, with a disgruntled
fan base and players who most likely hated being there.

1996: 11-5 Patriots get into Super Bowl XXXI. Six days before the
contest, a story leaks that Bill Parcells intends to leave the Patriots
after the Super Bowl to become head coach of the Jets. Patriots go on to
lose Super Bowl XXXI to Green Bay, 35-21.

1998: Jets make a now-illegal offer sheet to restricted free agent
Curtis Martin which the Patriots have no choice but to decline. Patriots
get six draft picks from the Jets over three years for Parcells and
Martin, but GM Bobby Grier selects six total busts.

1999: Pete Carroll, who took over as head coach from Bill Parcells in
1997, is fired at seasons end after his players quit on him in several
late-season games.

The advent of Parcells in 1993 was a huge boon for the Patriots. It
brought them instant respectability and a playoff berth after only two
seasons. While Patriot fans could not get enough of the former Giant
head man and all his wonderful press conferences and coaching dogma,
nobody cared about or realized his dark side. That dark side would
eventually, as well as ironically, come to a head when the most
important event in team history happened on January 21, 1994.

James B. Orthwein had the Patriots all gift-wrapped for his hometown of
St. Louis when Foxborough Stadium owner Bob Kraft stepped up and decided
to buy the team and keep them here in the area. Kraft was taking a huge
risk, and would make several learning curve mistakes along the way. But
his ownership of the Patriots became the cornerstone of what was to
follow, and the reason why Parcells would eventually bolt the Patriots
after the Super Bowl season of 1996.

Kraft became a meddling owner, and in 1996 overruled Parcells on draft
day by selecting Ohio State WR Terry Glenn.
Parcells asked for his contract to be shortened a year, and in January
1997 he was off to coach the Jets in return for four draft picks. The
Carroll years taught Kraft a lot about letting football people do their
jobs.

In January of 2000, he cut Carroll loose, and finally smartened up by
bringing in football people who he decided to leave alone and let them
do their thing.

In came Bill Belichick. In came Scott Pioli. We assume you know the
rest.

Yes, we do. And we also know that the Raiders history is the converse of the
Pats. Once a great team, now a league doormat. My, how times have changed.

No doubt about that, which is what makes Steve's posts so strange. Posting
about the Pat's pathetic past is worthless and means nothing. It's like
saying that because the Raiders aren't winning now they weren't the
winningest franchise at one time. We all know they were, so what's the
point? All that matters is the next game.

Schaefer Stadium and The Great Flush

A New England Patriots Tale of Yore...

The Boston Patriots were a team of wandering souls. Since their
inception in 1960, the team had played in five separate locations -
Soldiers Field (Harvard University), Nickerson Field (Boston
University), Alumni Stadium (Boston College), beloved Fenway Park, and
Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. After a great deal of legal and
financial wrangling, owner Billy Sullivan acquired a piece of land on
Route 1 in Foxboro that was nearly equidistant from Providence and
Boston. The Boston Patriots would become the New England Patriots, and a
new stadium in the town of Foxboro would become their permanent home.

In traditional Billy Sullivan fashion, the owner built the stadium at a
bare minimum of cost, skimping and cutting corners in every phase of
design. Sullivan was reportedly irate when the initial estimate of $6.9
million was overrun by $200,000 (or just less than the cost of a bottled
water at Yankee Stadium). The bargain-basement stadium was completed in
just under 11 months. And because of the dealings that had to be made
with local authorities, the Foxboro Board of Selectmen are the only
independent group that can determine the NFL's schedule, and the town of
Foxboro also receives a share of every ticket sold for events at the
stadium. It is one of the few times that a community has taken such
advantage of a sports team.

Sullivan also became one of the pioneers in selling stadium naming
rights. He convinced the Schaefer Brewing Company to put their name on
the stadium, and Schaefer Stadium was born. Schaefer could not have been
a more fitting sponsor for the team and its fans. Their first slogan
&quot;The one beer to have when you're having more than one&quot; symbolized the
unruliness of the fans, who rarely if ever had only one.

So what about The Great Flush?

Ah, yes. The Great Flush. As the 1971 season approached, the shameful
Schaefer Stadium was ready to be introduced to the world. The preseason
began and thousands of fans suffered the first of many Route 1 traffic
jams on their way to see the Patriots play. But a funny thing happened.
Someone at the stadium went to the bathroom (presumably after a few cans
of smooth Schaefer Beer). And then someone else did. And then a whole
bunch of people did. And the system couldn't handle it. The sinks and
toilets began to overflow. All of them. The bathrooms filled with water.
It was disgusting.

With the Board of Health threatening the shut down the stadium just
weeks before the season opener against the Oakland Raiders, Sullivan
hired an emergency team to fix the flow control problems, and organized
what has come to be known as The Great Flush. Members of the Patriots
front office, stadium workers, local journalists and Sullivan himself
organized into teams and were positioned throughout the stadium.

At the sound of the scoreboard horn, everyone ran around, comically
flushing every toilet to prove to the Board of Health that such a
situation wouldn't happen again. One journalist wrote of the event, &quot;it
was the first time that the sportswriters in this town all pulled for
the Patriots.&quot;

Sounds like a case of wishful thinking. Odd that nothing in his post had
anything resembling a sexual innurendo, yet you took the liberty to create
a homosexual fantasy from his statement. Prof, are you sure you and

You really need to be reminded of EVERY funny anecdote, don'tcha.

TWO posts and nothing about the time Patrick Sullivan took a swings at
Matt Millen and Howie Long.

Some historian you are.

Why do I bring these up?  Well, if you can't laugh at yourself, who CAN
you laugh it?  Of course, you probably weren't laughing at this one
considering the above game was the middle of the 1985 Patriots' road
playoff run.

The New England franchise under the Sullivans was consistently one of
the worst in football, if not all of sports. The current Kraft
ownership, as measured by any possible factor: profitability, on-field
performance, ticket sales, etc.

For those who don't remember, the Millen-Sullivan fisticuffs stands
symbolic of the second-rate ownership of the Sullivan years.

The Patriots were fresh off a shocking upset in L.A. over the heavily
favored Raiders, in the divisional round of the 1985 playoffs. It was at
the time the biggest victory in franchise history. As the story goes,
Patrick Sullivan, son of owner William Sullivan, celebrated by mouthing
off to already pissed-off (and much bigger) Matt Millen.

The Raiders linebacker responded by cracking Sullivan in the head with
his helmet, as luck would have it, it was caught on film.

Boom!
http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Images/Millen-Sullivan.jpg

The futility of the New England franchise is summed up by this: The
franchise won just four playoff games in more than 30 years – three of
them in that 1985 postseason -13 playoff games over 10 years under Kraft
in a concrete death-trap called Foxboro Stadium.

The Patriots went on to the Super Bowl that year where William Sullivan
took his next shot to the head via a pounding by the Chicago Bears 46-10

Boom!
