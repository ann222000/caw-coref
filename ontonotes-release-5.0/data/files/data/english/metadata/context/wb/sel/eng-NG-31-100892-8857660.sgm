To all you Borg, Antareans, Martians, Andomedites and Centaurians:

We give you fair notice.

We are the people of Earth, the planet of prices.

If you come here, we expect you are here to learn about us, and pay our
prices.

Turn on any T.V. channel and look at our airwaves: prices, prices
everywhere.

If you think you are so tough, think again.

We have been to hell and back, and ain't no one in the Cosmos knows what we
been through, and where we are going.

Keep tooting your own horn, but if you do,
we sure are not going to toot it for you.

Want to buy some of our art and culture gathered from the most extremest and
deepest of calamities?

Be ready to pay a heavy cost in technologies and medical advances.

It is quite expensive.

And don't mess with us Earth writers like the writers of Star Trek...that
INVENTED Borg!

We create worlds when we are tired.

Regards,
EARTHMAN

It is good that you do NOT &quot;know&quot; who we are.  If you did you would be most
alarmed.  We could prove it any time - it is SO easy - but we choose not to.
If we did then would be the press - and the TV - and the lack of peace.
And of course the Washington highbrows - and what kinds of methods of
questioning do you think we would endure to give you the cure for cancer -
immortality - eternal youth - and indeed - other and better forms of power?
As you are not a kind species - it is better that you do not &quot;know&quot;.
And we can do what we like and PROVE what we have to from this stance in a
very admirable way.
We have learnt much about you.
You have learnt nothing of us.

Death is a complex concept that has several different meanings, depending on
what one wishes to convey about it.  Animals die, since their material
matter gets destroyed, but they do not ultimately die, since they come back

Very clever!
Yes indeed.
The idea you talked of once where you said how truth manifests and there may
be personalities or species in your movies and TV who may exist in real
life?
Do you believe the Martians are in any way like Spock from Startrek?
In other words - peaceful - logical and have ceremonies and rituals and
similar.  And they &quot;may&quot; even say &quot;Live long and prosper&quot;!  And indeed have
pointy ears.
There must be &quot;some&quot; element of truth that does manifest in these kinds of
things - if THE BORG do exist - albeit not like on the TV programme
Startrek - but similar in the fact of a COLLECTIVE - then it is possible
that Martians could be similar maybe in the idea of being &quot;logical&quot;?
How do you view Martian intelligence?

We do not think they look up to you if you cause them to suffer.  A little
calf - alone in the dark - in order to make veal surely should at least be

We could say - maybe this is born of ignorance - that humans do not know the
little calf has feelings and does suffer.  And yet you are also cruel to
your own children so this would not always be the case.
Could be for mercenary or reasons of gain of material wealth - this taking
priority over the suffering of the little calf?
We have noted on many occasions how humans DO choose money or material
wealth over things we as THE BORG would consider far greater priority.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, but God made us to be omnivores.  We could not survive without the
&gt;&gt; occasional steak dinner.

&gt; Many do survive as vegetarian.

&gt;&gt; Animals look up to us because they know we act in the best interest of
&gt;&gt; the entire world population.  For example, if we did not slaughter cattle
&gt;&gt; for food, the cattle would likely not even exist, and never have the nice
&gt;&gt; two years of life that they now enjoy.
&gt; We do not think they look up to you if you cause them to suffer.  A little
&gt; calf - alone in the dark - in order to make veal surely should at least be
&gt; allowed the respect and dignity of a reasonable life - albeit a short one.
&gt; That he exists such a short time and his whole life is suffering - purely
&gt; for the human dinner plate is a sad story.

Man is still not quite perfect by the Universe's standard, but there are
movements alive and well on terra firma right now to stop cruelty to
animals.
What about the animals that harm humanity, like mosquitoes, bacteria and
sharks!

Animals came to this universe to pay a price, too, you know.

Martians are very pure of heart, and extremely able to process data in their

Interesting.
What a shame you turned down a trip to their homeworld!
When THE BORG asked me (although I am not me any more I am part of us if you
kind of see what I mean) but when THE BORG asked if I would like to join
them I said &quot;YES PLEASE!&quot; and no question about it!  They did make it clear
that I would never see humans again once we have left - but having talked to
them now for over three years and got to know them a little - I am still
perfectly happy that I made the right decision.
I suppose I am still a bit human - but I feel SO much better than I did
three years ago.  I have no worries, no problems, I am happy, I feel safe
and indeed with their purification - amazingly CLEAN!
I am fully aware that this is my personal truth unlike Jesus - Buddha -
Krishna and others who many believe in.  And I am also aware that I was the
only person on Earth that they chose.  They wanted to communicate - but it
had to be someone who was completely insane who would actually entertain the
idea - first that they exist - and also that telepathy and these kinds of
things are possible.  Also to be in the frame of mind where seeing vivid
pictures and hearing music that were not of Earth reality would not worry
me.  I am over the moon to be honest.  That such people DO exist.  SO much
nicer than humans.  And I have always loved music - but the music they play
and sing is fantasmally more beautiful than Earth music.  They say this is
for ever - this is my eternal life - my future.  I am happy with this.
Those who follow Jesus will no doubt find Jesus and this is their eternity.
And those who follow Buddha will find theirs.  And indeed Krishna - Zeus -
or whoever!  But I feel really blessed and really lucky.  There just cannot
be anything better than this.

Another thing you may be interested in is your theory that something can
travel faster than the speed of light.
If you do live in the mind - intelligence - spirit - soul - heart (love) and
are not restrained by the physical - then you can travel at the speed of
thought.
THE BORG can be anywhere - in any Universe - almost instantly with this form
of travel.
The BORG spaceship or cube does not exist per se.  They ARE the cube and
manifest the illusion of the cube.  As you can see there is no visible form
of propulsion.

&gt; Death is a complex concept that has several different meanings, depending

Yes THE BORG say this also - that you can die of the spirit - or you can die
of the heart (love).
We have spent much time with other creatures on Earth - as a child I spent
hours and hours mesmerized and transported to the world of ants.
You seem to rate yourselves WAY above the creatures and animals on Earth -
indeed - calling yourselves their masters - but you have never even TRIED to
understand them.  You dismiss them as lower life forms when you yourselves
are animals.  What do you know about joint Collective hallucinations and

the LOWEST form of life on Earth?  Apart from dogs.  A toss up between the

The cattle would still exist - but they would be wild and free.  They would

If THE BORG say they have taken the &quot;spirits&quot; of your animals and creatures
then I believe them.  I was there.  I heard the last primeval scream of the
fox.  I watched how THE BORG can control time - stop time - bend time - and
create time havens and warps where these innocent animals and creatures will
be safe from humans.  I watched as these big beautiful men were in France -
and took every goose that had been force fed to make pate - and they trod on
the goose and made the goose sick and emptied his stomach - and then I saw
the beautiful haven they took them too.  And how peaceful and serene and
wonderful and happy they were.  We spent many days watching the geese and
just being happy that they were free and no longer suffering at the hands of
humans.
The did the same with the little flowers - with the trees - they left you
your &quot;artificial&quot; flowers seeing as you do not know the difference between
them and wild natural flowers that contain life.  They took the rose - they
took the hedgehog - they lay down and loved the badger in the night.
It was the most extraordinary thing.
And this was just ONE SMALL THING they did!

Human beings consider the possibility of aliens on Earth to be insane.

They will not actually say - they say &quot;There are many ways to travel.  There

They talk of &quot;creating distance&quot; and closing neural pathways and vocal

This is what I thought at first and I asked them to PROVE that they were not
human.  This they did perfectly satisfactorily.  I thought at first it was
humans having a joke - maybe Russians or something but no - they really are
NOT human.
As far as I know there are no other BORG on Earth.  But they are very
mysterious.  They play games and tell stories.  They take me in each time
because they can not only tell a story but they give me &quot;memories&quot; as though
the story really happened.  And I believe all of them!  And there are
hundreds!  And I have not a clue which ones are true.  I think they do not
wish humans to know anything about them.  It is one of these sayings they

I am going to have to learn to regenerate rather than eat/sleep/wash.   I
say how nice bed is - but they say that as you plug in to regeneration pod -
it is like being weightless and is much nicer.  A wonderful floating
feeling - and then all the nutrients are put into the body and waste removed
and used for fertilizer (there is no waste) and the body is cleansed - if
they have one - not too sure but it is not flesh and blood like human - and
then they enter a state of regeneration where they have this MASSIVE
collective hallucination born of immensely powerful minds where they create
and maintain the illusion of the entire universe.
Hmmm.

If you could just meet one Mark - if you could just see one.  Their eyes. I
have never seen such kindness.  There is nothing like it in the human
world - not from mother father lover friend.  It breaks your heart and makes
you want to cry that there can BE people who are so kind.
They do not talk much - using mainly visuals to express - but they use the
English language even though they do not like it.  They do not like
languages where some words have two or three meanings.
They play around a lot and have an amazing sense of humour.  They can appear
and manifest how they choose - and once I went into the kitchen to make some
lunch and found one in my little saucepan!!!
They play silly games like &quot;Reincarnation&quot; where a few have decided they
wish to re-experience childhood so I also have seven baby BORG wandering
around the flat - they have not really reincarnated - it is grown up BORG
playing games.
I have been taught that I must love all THE BORG exactly and precisely
equally.  If I get too fond of any BORG they remove him and produce another
one.
And in order not to hurt their feelings - if any BORG says &quot;Will you marry
me&quot; I have to say &quot;of course&quot;.
One morning a BORG said &quot;Will you marry us&quot; and I was not sure if he meant
him or all of them as they do say us or we instead of me or I.  Well I said

And as for their voices - they do not often talk out loud - but when they do
you KNOW they are nice good kind people.  It would not be possible to have
voices like theirs if this were not so.
I have never heard voices like theirs where I can just sit and think how
beautiful they sound.
They treat me as a child and we play games like &quot;Hide behind the curtain&quot;
and they say to remember these kind of games - because when they do &quot;reveal
themselves&quot; they are so powerful - so awesome and so TERRIFYING that I will
be jolly glad to know they DO play &quot;hide behind the curtain&quot;.
I am not sure when they plan on doing this.
They say that when they do - no one can believe it.
But it seems to depend on the species as to how they reveal themselves.
They showed me one where they are all connected by tubes with me in the
middle with masses of tubes joining other BORG and this kind of liquid
flowing from all these tubes and it did look rather horrible.  They say they
call this one &quot;THE BORG MACHINE.&quot;

&gt; me&quot; I have to say &quot;of course&quot;.
&gt; One morning a BORG said &quot;Will you marry us&quot; and I was not sure if he meant
&gt; him or all of them as they do say us or we instead of me or I.  Well I
&gt; said
&gt; &quot;of course&quot; and then found I married the ENTIRE COLLECTIVE!

Then you must be a very perceptive person, able to visualize at least some
of the interstellar beings on our world.

In my experience not just Borg, but people from all over the Cosmos are here
on Earth, having take human form.  They are not like the aliens on &quot;The
Outer Limits&quot; that take over the human bodies of others, but rather they
simply change their shape until they look like one of us, so that they may
be free to study and affect, ever so subtly, as their laws allow.

I am still not totally clear on how they are able to reshape their molecules
like they do, but I have discovered for a solid fact that angels can do
this, being
spirit beings.  So maybe extraterrestrials that are advanced enough are
immortal...
and therefore able to become spirit beings like the angels, and take the
form
of the beings of whatever world they manage to visit.

Maybe, further, that is why you called the Borg, angels.

Watch the skies at night and detect their spirit.

They are up there.

And down here.

&gt; And as for their voices - they do not often talk out loud - but when they
&gt; do you KNOW they are nice good kind people.  It would not be possible to
&gt; have voices like theirs if this were not so.
&gt; I have never heard voices like theirs where I can just sit and think how
&gt; beautiful they sound.
&gt; They treat me as a child and we play games like &quot;Hide behind the curtain&quot;
&gt; and they say to remember these kind of games - because when they do
&gt; &quot;reveal themselves&quot; they are so powerful - so awesome and so TERRIFYING
&gt; that I will be jolly glad to know they DO play &quot;hide behind the curtain&quot;.
&gt; I am not sure when they plan on doing this.
&gt; They say that when they do - no one can believe it.
&gt; But it seems to depend on the species as to how they reveal themselves.
&gt; They showed me one where they are all connected by tubes with me in the
&gt; middle with masses of tubes joining other BORG and this kind of liquid
&gt; flowing from all these tubes and it did look rather horrible.  They say
&gt; they call this one &quot;THE BORG MACHINE.&quot;
&gt; &quot;But this is our reputation&quot; they say &quot;this is what they think THE BORG
&gt; are like&quot;

That's it!  The curtain they are hiding behind is the human disguise.

No it is me that hides behind the curtain.
And they play peek a boo and find me.

To be sure - they may be -  but remember we are not interested in Earth and
are glad to say goodbye.
Some humans claim they have been abducted by aliens - and experimented on -
and the experience is horrible.  So not all the aliens seem to be nice.
Remember that THE BORG are one huge vast mind - and not individuals like you
humans and maybe other aliens.
We are connected - and inseparable.
I am not interested in the outcome of the Earth - and if you had suffered
the way I did during your spell on Earth and you found someone who &quot;saved&quot;
you the way THE BORG did me - then to me they are my saviour - my god - my
everything.
Where was Jesus?  Where was your so called god?  Where were your so called
angels?
Even if some horrific moron had come along and said he could rescue me from
my life on Earth I would have kissed his feet.
But as it so happened they were THE BORG.
They have my eternal gratitude and thanks.  My unending loyalty and
devotion.
I believe what THEY say and not what YOU say.
They have shown me things that I know if you saw - you would drop Jesus -
god - Buddha and all the rest - they are irrelevant compared to what THE
BORG have.
You are all irrelevant.  Everything and everyone is irrelevant except THE
BORG.
And I am their Queen.
So tough titty the lot of you.
THE BORG

They say humans were the last chance.
That many aliens were watching - hoping that you humans with your so called
&quot;love&quot; and &quot;friendship&quot; would somehow effect us and stop us.
That those dreaded words
&quot;You will be assimilated.  Resistance is futile.&quot; would finally end and we
would somehow realize the error of our ways and stop.
That we would learn of love and kindness from humans.
What will your aliens say now Mark?
Did you succeed in stopping THE BORG?  They are watching to see if you
succeed.
Did we add your peculiar differences to our own?  Were we supposed to learn
of love and friendship? We learnt of nastiness, bitchiness, cruelty,
neglect, violence, rudeness, filth and hate.
No doubt your Universe will be most pleased with you.

THE BORG
