Amen to that concept. I get tired of seeing over-restored radios for sale on
eBay or at swaps. Bakelites are painted all colors of the rainbow in an auto
body shop (&quot;No extra charge for the metallic flake!&quot;). Metal parts that
should look satiny and aged are buffed and lacquered until they hurt your
eyes. Wooden cabinets are done with 17 coats of hand-rubbed finish. Anybody
who imagines that these assembly-line made radios originally looked like
that must have a screw loose.

I know a cat with that old Citroen saloon with the suicide doors,
gangster kinda car. '37? Been in a few music video (not that car mind
you). His wife has an E-type, her brother a Porsche 356 and '58 Chevy,
both black. Ever seen a purple 911? My sixth grade art teacher (named
Frisch owned Porsche of course).

My 6th grade band teacher had the ugliest GMC 1952 or 3 panel van in
town, so they say as he won a contest with it (in spite of it too).
That one was cool ;-)

I've been saying it for years.....we do more harm than good as
collectors of old radios. Our idea of strip and mohawk toner every
radio in sight, rip out old capacitors, polish escutcheons, and hand
rub til our fingers bleed is NOT doing a thing to help these old
radios.  All it is going to do is drive the value of unrestored sets
through the roof.
When the true collector rises above the tinkerers and takes control of
this hobby, then and only then will this hobby rise up and live up to
the true meaning of its creed. Go forth and collect. Do no harm to an
old radio.

I don't know.  I agree about the strip and refinish problems, unless
it's extremely damaged cabinet.  And even so, if you refinish it,
don't get carried away and make it gleam like a mirror.  The assembly
lines never did that.

The only things I do on my radios when I repair them is the electronic
stuff -- usually that DOES mean capacitor replacement.  You can't get
around that.  Those things do go bad, so unless you just want the
radio sitting pretty,  you are going to have to cut out the old caps
and replace with new.

The cabinets may get washed out in my kitchen sink if they're
plastic.  Wooden ones just get the dust blown out of them inside.
But I doubt very much that you'll catch me sanding and refinishing
something.  I'm just too lazy for that. :)

WHO does these things eddie? JoeMagi don't post to my knowledge. I've been
telling you for  years I've never stripped a cabinet that wouldn't normally
be THROWN AWAY but you seem to think 1) everyone strips everything with one
scratch and 2) you can't fix the scratch even because it's ruined then.

I'd be afraid to drive a car with 50 year old rubber seals and brake hoses,
and single master cylinder. Cars are treated differently that other
collectibles because people often want to drive them and might get killed.
How often does a Shaker chair kill anyone? You'd be an idiot not to leave
utterly alone a REALLY well preserved example of a classic car, but you have
to be content with not or barely driving it. Likewise, I sell anything I
find that is really rare before my cats ruin it, and my remaining radios,

Doesn't it depend on the radio?

I agree that stripping/refinishing, or sanding and painting, etc. are not a
good idea for a truly rare, valuable radio like a Walton, Stratosphere or
(insert your favorite here).  Just like that Jaguar.

But when you're talking about something as common as say, a TransOceanic or
one of the many run-of-the-mill table radios or tombstones, maybe it's OK to
see just how &quot;perfect&quot; or better-than-new you can make it.   Just like a
1969 Camaro SS, with candy-apple red paint, custom motor, ripped and
replaced interior, state of the art sound system, etc.  Some would say that
too is a travesty, but it's common and (I think) perfectly acceptable.

And what about the cheap metal-cabinet table radios that just beg to be
repainted?   With a really good paint job, new caps and other parts, maybe
even replacement of chipped knobs with (gasp!) non-original ones, you can
keep the old girl &quot;on the road&quot; for another several decades.  There's
certainly honor in that too.

Well, there is not much of ANYTHING here anymore. However, the forum
is full of nice original sets that are stripped and mohawked that were
nice to begin with. Same thing goes with rubbing them down with
linseed oil, overspraying them, (or rubbing them down whatever
concoction that is the mix of the week) etc.. As the owner of the
radio, it is entirely up to them to do as they please. I am like you
John (as you know). my collection is either A. basket cases that I
have put back together, or....B. totally original sets. I TOTALLY get
the pleasure everybody gets from rebuilding these old radios, but as
far as &quot;preserving&quot; them.....nothing could be further from reality.
You NEVER help an antique by refinishing it. Myself. I am guilty of
refinishing sets that didn't really need it. I think everybody is. The
fact remains that you are forever destoying the originality of the
radio and once it is gone, it is gone. There is a place for
originallity and a place for restoring. As time goes on, more and more
thought will go into what that means. I guarantee it. As for drivers
or show...of course there is a place for both.

Well, sure.

I try to find a balance that lets me preserve as much originality as
possible, yet (in most cases) make the radio safe and reliable to use.

Of course, a ruined cabinet will need to be stripped, re-veneered, whatever,
but a nice original with some ordinary marks of wear is simply left alone,
or given light touch-ups. The S-C console sitting in our entryway looks
great as-is, and I have no intention to refinish it to &quot;perfect&quot; condition,
although I did restore the electronics.

Different radios get different treatment.

If I am recapping a special radio -- a better-than-average one that I plan
to keep forever and want to use in the meantime -- I will restuff the caps,
including the little old paper ones.

If it's a cheap plastic AA5 and I just want to make it work, then who cares
what it looks like under the chassis?

I have a couple of radios, like my TransOceanic 7G605 &quot;bomber,&quot; which I am
leaving completely untouched, just as a piece of history. Maybe some future
owner will want to restore them, but for now, I don't mind leaving them as
shelf queens. The only downside is that I can never use them.

When I restore a radio as a gift to a friend or family member, I take extra
pains to make sure that it will be safe, and work some for reasonable length
of time before breaking down -- as compared to an average radio that I might
play only a few times a year.

I have never met anybody who bought one of the over-restored &quot;hot rod&quot;
radios seen on eBay, however I suspect that some of them are not radio
people at all, but un-savvy shoppers who want a &quot;cool old radio&quot; for some
reason. Like the dude who paid a foolish price for one of my restored TVs as
a gift for an executive retiring from that company. I also get occasional
emails from people who want to buy a special anniversary present from the
year when their spouse was born, etc., etc.

Anyway, it's your radio. If you find a raggedy TO and want to make it look
and work better than any original ever did . . . nobody can stop you :-)

[Restoration vs. as-found condition]

There's a neat pair of novels by Jack Finney called &quot;Time
and Again&quot; and &quot;From Time to Time&quot; that deal with time travel
into the late Victorian period and the early 20th century,
respectively.

In the beginning of the second book the protagonist is
in a museum, studying the clothing and styles of the time,
touching the materials used.  Later on he's shown a period
correct shoe that was newly made in the exact same way.
He remarks how the museum piece seemd lifeless by comparison,
how one could never feel the pride and joy the original owner
must have had.  By contrast, the fresh example allowed him
to, in a small way, experience time travel with that object
and help prepare him for the actual jump.

This has always stuck with me.  Obviously over-restoration
isn't true to form, but it doesn't take much &quot;patina&quot; to
kill any feel for what it was like back then.

To an extent I think it depends -- and I don't mean this
to be as freighted as it sounds -- on whether one is interested
in viewing history from a distance, or travelling in time.
I'm interested, in an admittedly very selective and narrow
way, in the latter.

No flames here. I owned three Triumphs and one MGB, all daily drivers in
their time. One of them (the '68 TR-250) I drove from Minneapolis to New
York City to Mexico City and back to Minneapolis, in the dead of winter. A
two-week jaunt with extremes of temperature &amp; elevation, and plenty of hard
miles packing a full load.

Had to give up the '70 MGB about eight years ago when my kids grew too big
to fit into the &quot;back seat.&quot;

I've been doing that with all my Atwater Kents. They are just too difficult
to rebuild as the wiring is always rubber and shot, and often are
electronically primitive (old Atwater went bankrupt just as the science of
radio was taking off). I do restore AK chasse occasionally when the whole
set IS totally shot and can't even be displayed. I can't just do the case
and put back that ratty chassis!

If it's in that nice of original condition then yeah I'd leave it

Oh man, that brings back memories from about 30 years ago.

I used to work in a motorcycle shop. (between aerospace jobs)
And one of the characters there was a large fellow who went
by the nickname Mute Ron.

So one day, he brings in his late '50s Jaguar. He's all excited
because the guy across the street fixed his horn.

I asked him (he reads lips very well. Dangerously well.) &quot;How
do you know?&quot;

He just grinned and dragged the shop owners wife outside and
pointed repeatedly under the hood until she bent down to see
what he was pointing at.

Then he pressed the horn ring.

He handed me a note, &quot;See, I told you it works.&quot;

Ya know, I haven't see Ron in about 25 years or so.

Yah, gotta admit Britmobiles have their issues. I just get
tired of uninformed people bashing them. I've had
at least 1 Brit sports car since I was 15 (almost 40 years ago!),
and they are wonderful cars. That is *if* they are maintained
properly. My current collection numbers a dozen.

The fact of the matter is Brit sports cars have a HUGE following
in the USA. Far larger than many other hobbies. There's a good
reason for that.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I collect and restore Britmobiles myself.

Sure is.

a) they are (relatively) cheap.
b) they are (relatively) simple-minded.
c) they look good, mostly.
d) they are (relatively) safe as they don't run much and one isn't
tempted to drive them very far.
e) and they can (actually) be made relatively reliable with
replacement of the ignition systems, carburettors (Brit-spell), brake
system, steering links, suspension parts, instruments...

I once had my hands on a Spitfire, from a guy that was also selling a
Volvo 1800, a Saab Sonnet and a TR3. The Spit was great fun to drive,
but not to steer or stop, the Volvo drove like a truck but stopped on
a dime, the Sonnet was a joy and a pleasure but outside my price range
even to consider, the TR3 drove like the Spit but could steer much
better.

The next day, all were gone... This was back before ubiquitous cash
machines, and it was a *WHOA, WHAT'S THAT??&quot; Roadside stop so I was
not prepared.

Anyone ever hear of Sterling? They took one of the more dependable
Japanese cars of the day (Honda Accord) and put in British made leather
seats and burlwood interior.....and Lucas electrics and gauges!

A friend of mine had one for awhile. He later got a same-model-year
Honda Accord that had been totaled by the insurance company because it
had been completely submerged in water. He was going to use it as a
parts car for the Sterling, but he gave up that idea when it became
apparent that the Honda was the more dependable of the two cars, even
after submersion.

Hi!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; All it is going to do is drive the value of unrestored sets

I'm not so sure I agree with that. Some time ago, I picked up a total of
four radios from the curb. Two have been electrically restored, one is a
project for a rainy day and the last may never play again...it has been
heavily damaged.

None were especially rare or valuable sets--at least not so far as I
know--but if they'd gone to the trash truck, they'd be gone more or less
forever...mashed up and ruined. Now that half of them are playing again, I
think the repaired ones stand a much better chance of staying out of the
landfill for a good long time to come.

I suppose there is a time and place for unrestored classics. But they will
probably always be more endangered than restored and working units of the
same type. Not everyone appreciates something that has never been fixed up
or repaired.

aaa, sure - I have a morgan +4 - It was really reliable - I drove it home
with a broken crank shaft, both my wife and I learned how to change the
clutch linkage, it's the only car that ever unwound the field coil on the
generator and wrapped it around the armature (and then ran for years on the
remaining coil), the wheels stress fatigued from vibration and required
regular welding, the fenders also stress fatigued and required similar
treatment, the car had two fuses, one for the horn, and the other as a
spare, the remainder of the wiring was unfused (and it shorted out one day
causing a surprised yelp from my passanger), it has no gas vent so it spits
gas back at you when you try and fill it, it uses two 6 volt batteries, and
to start it you open the hood and put your arm across the dual SU's throats
while pressing teh under hood starter button -

Yep, great cars those british cars - I've had it for about 40 years, it
looks great on blocks

I think there's something else going on here, too.  For a long
time antiques really weren't much different than present day objects,
only older.  After all, there's only so many ways to arrange four
sticks of wood and put a fifth on top to make a table.  Sure, styles
change, but for most of history they changed slowly, especially over
the short lifespan of most people in the past.

Thus, people greatly valued &quot;patina&quot; and old, original finishes
because that was about the only way to tell an antique.

Technology, specifically obsolete technology, changed that.
A lot of the reason I collect is that this stuff looks totally
unlike anything else on the planet today.  No way is anyone going
to mistake my Wappler for a modern-day anything.  Same with tube
radios, no matter how perfect you made the finish.

A lot of my friends in high school had these British cars-Triumphs, MGs,
and the occasional Jensen-Healey. Total shit, all of them. Alas, they
were such babe-magnets that the guys would pour buckets of bucks into
them to keep them going. I never had one because I couldn't afford it,
probably one of the few times where not having any money was a good thing.

I still think we're talking about apples and oranges here.
If the radios are of the era when they were factory built by
the thousands, and were just a basic consumer POS from the
the beginning... Then by all means restore them, make them play,
modify them to make them play better, paint them pink with
green poke a dots, what ever you want.

I have found if an antique is in pretty bad condition say beyond display
in a house or collection it is usually passed by and either storred
where it will get worse or thrown away .
I cant remember how many people said they ``threw it away`` because the
wood was peeling or the joints were apart .
If these same objects at least get fixed up by someone enough for people
to want them in their homes it will save stuff .

Talking radios mostly or i suppose furniture pieces .. if i try to sell
one with the finish badly flaking it wont sell , everyone will rub their
fingers across it and say ``thats to bad``

Gota give those ``shiney new`` retorers a hand for making thousands of
dollars on the stuff though .

My friend has a Sonnet III, it's a neat car, very weird V4 engine in it
though and the brakes leave something to be desired, you could almost stop
better by dragging your feet out the door. Volvo has a long history of
superb brakes, the 240 series came with four wheel discs, vacuum assist,
twin circuit four piston fixed calipers in front and two piston fixed
calipers in the rear, in 1975.

By all means, if it's a falling apart piece of crap
and you want to rescue it, DO IT.
Some of you may know Stan Watkins who lives
near by in Charlotte, I was with him at the big
local antiques market about 20 years or so ago when
he got a Philco model 90, it was a piece of CRAP.
Most of the cabinet was completely falling apart,
what was just rotten. The fret work in the grill
was all busted out, and the chassis looked like
it had been at the bottom of lake Erie.
I would not have carried it home, if it had been
FREE. Stan took it and made a Blue ribbon winner
and Best Restoration winner out of it.
Heroic Restoration is what it's called.
Anyone else would have tossed it in the garbage.

BUT, not everything need to be restored!!!

Yeah...that's what I was trying to get at. Well said, I think.

It's nice to happen across something unrestored, but without upkeep and
restoration, anything will fall into disrepair and then you run a much
higher risk of it being lost forever--in any condition. Any radio that
anyone owns was designed to play--and if it happens to be in condition
suitable to do so, that will make the history behind the item more relevant
to the general population. While that has it plusses and minuses, awareness
does help to preserve many things.

I'm definitely not an advocate of taking a radio (or anything else) and
making it into something that it never was. However, if it keeps something
from being lost to the trash forever, it may not be as bad as it seems.

You should blame the government for that. This car was designed for a 3
cylinder 2-stroke engine. To meet environmental legislation, Saab
put in -with some effort- a German Ford V4 engine.

I agree with Phil. I own two 7G605's. One looks like it has been through
a war zone, and the other is in decent shape. The one in decent shape is
going to get the heavy restoration treatment, polish all the metal,
replace all the caps, new leather handle, glue down any loose material,
etc, make the commander proud of the radio he built all those years ago.
The &quot;war zone&quot; one is going to have a different treatment: I'm going to
leave the outside in its rough shape, but only change what is necessary
to make it play safely, keeping the unrestored look. I'll probably
restuff all the caps though. This radio was some soldier's lifeline to
America, his ties to family and home. He kept that radio playing even in
the most severe environments. The commander passed along stories of what
GI's did to keep their radios playing, and I want that idea and feeling
to remain with this radio.
