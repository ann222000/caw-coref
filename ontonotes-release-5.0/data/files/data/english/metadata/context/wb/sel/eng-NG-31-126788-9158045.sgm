An
injury to one is an injury to all: Fight exploitation and poverty in the arts
and performance industry

SACP
congratulatory remarks and message to the Founding Congress of the Creative
Workers Union of South Africa, 7 September 2007

Blade
Nzimande, General Secretary

Introduction

The SACP would like to take this opportunity to
congratulate yourselves for merging the Peforming Arts Equity (PAWE) and
the Musicians Union of South Africa (MUSA) to found CWUSA. The SACP
particularly congratulates the leaders and members of CWUSA, and all the
formations that have agreed to constitute a single coordinated Union in
the Creativity industry, for a job well done in ensuring that there is
working class unity in the industry to advocate for and protect workers’
rights and interests.

The SACP is particularly happy that
the Creative Workers Union of South Africa is affiliated to the most
revolutionary trade union federation in the country and continent, COSATU
and therefore joining the thousands of the South African working class,
that appreciate that the struggle for complete liberation cannot be
limited to boardrooms and factory floors, but should include.

One lesson, which the working class in South
Africa should learn is that unity of the workers could fundamentally
transform society as a whole and change the value systems that have been
sown by apartheid capitalism. The sector in which you operate is one of
the highly exploitative sectors, dominated by powerful monopolies and
other interests; yet the workers’ struggles in this sector are somehow
hidden. The pattern has been that your situation only comes out when your
colleagues die poor, and only then is the exploitation of workers in this
sector is highlighted and that it recedes from the public eye again

Society and our Communities are constantly
exposed to, entertained by and enjoy the talents and hard work of creative
workers, yet the strains, non-recognition they suffer in the industry is
not of public knowledge.

There is no doubt that Creative workers in South
Africa have significantly contributed to the struggle for national
liberation in South Africa, and should continue to raise through music,
arts, poetry and other means the challenges that society is facing in the
present period.

Some key tasks
and challenges for CWUSA

The first and most critical challenge for your
union is to ensure that you do indeed organise the many creative workers,
who often work in isolation, suffering quietly from the exploitative
practices in this industry. You must know that it is one thing to form a
union, but a bigger challenge lies ahead in ensuring that you recruit as
many workers as possible. The SACP knows very well that your task would
not be an easy one, since it is not very easy to organise workers who tend
to work individually or in small groups and tend to sign individual
contracts.

A related task is that of confronting the key
capitalist companies who precisely exploit the fact that you tend to sign
individual or small group contracts thereby offering pathetic amounts. In
addition they use this reality to sow divisions and competition amongst
yourselves thus undermining the unity of the struggle of the creative
workers

A critical challenge facing CWUSA will be that
of conducting political education within your sector. This is absolutely
important so that your members understand their role within the broader
context of the challenges facing South African society. In addition you
peform a very important intellectual and ideological role in society. You
are the interpreters and communicators of the trial and tribulations, joys
and sadness facing society, as well as the many challenges facing our
society, including poverty, unemployment and joblessness. It is therefore
important that our creative workers have the correct ideological
orientation, articulating the interests of the workers and the poor of our
country. It is also important to understand that the fundamental source of
your problems is capitalism. Labour is the only ‘commodity’ that does not
set its own ‘price’ in the ‘market’. When you go to a shop you buy on the
basis of prices set by the shop owner. But in the case of labour you are
told how much you will be paid for your ‘product’. The SACP is committed
to partnering with you in this important task of political education and
ideological development of your members.

One of the big struggles you have to wage is
that of campaigning for the promotion on local creative work in the local
broadcasting and media industry, especially the public broadcaster, the
SABC. This is a struggle you can never wage individually, but can only be
waged collectively. As the SACP we are concerned about the dominance of
American and Western material in television, creative work, arts and
culture. Whilst we cannot and should not isolate ourselves from the rest
of the world, but our local creative work must be given priority. This
must include the struggle to confront corruption in the broadcasting and
media industry, whereby only those who can cough up money, usually backed by
powerful capitalist interests, have their work broadcast.

We also wish to congratulate you for the
efforts you are putting into fighting piracy, especially of your music.
The SACP regards this as one of the critical tasks for CWUSA and as the
SACP we pledge full support for you in this regard, as this constitutes
one of the biggest threats to our creative work in our country

The formation of CWUSA should also be seen as
part of the struggle to reclaim your work, your originality and your
creativity. Capitalism is actually the biggest destroyer of this
creativity, since more often than not you are asked to modify or even
change some of your own creative work in order to suit the interests of
those who pay for your work. In many instances you become alienated from
your own; sometimes you can hardly even recognise some of your work in
order that you make a living. The struggle to reclaim your work is
fundamental to the advancement of the kind of South Africa that serves the
interests of the overwhelming majority of our people – the workers
and the poor

The SACP also calls upon those of our creative
workers who have made it and are successful not to stand aside, but to
join in with the rest of the creative workers. We also use this occasion
to call upon all the creative workers of our country to join CWUSA in
their numbers

The struggle
of creative workers is part of the broader struggles of the working class as a
whole

It is going to be very important that the
struggle of creative workers concretely becomes part of the struggles of
the working class as a whole.

The SACP has just emerged from its highly
successful 12 th National Congress. Incidentally it is for this
reason that we see the renewed class offensive against the SACP in the
wake of this Congress. There is a concerted campaign to try and discredit
not just the image of the SACP, but this is part of a broader offensive
against the working class as a whole

Our 12 th Congress has identified the
key task facing the working class in the short to medium term as that of
building working class power in all key sites of influence and power in
society. To this end the SACP has identified six key areas of priority in
this regard; building working class power in the state, the economy, the
workplace, the community, ideologically and in the international sphere.
What does this mean for creative workers?

In so far as the state is concerned this means
that government in particular needs to develop policies that recognise and
seek to advance the interests of the arts and culture, and that seeks to
nurture local talent. This means state intervention to seek to pressure
private capital for instance to invest more resources in fostering local
talent. Government is for instance developing an industrial strategy aimed
at growing and developing our economy. Creative workers need to ensure
that their own interests are strongly factored, and we need a sectoral
strategy to transform the creative industry and seek to end the
exploitative practices in this sphere

Building working class power in the economy,
means in your case, amongst other things, precisely what you are starting
today, building a strong progressive trade union in this sector. But it
also means strong challenging the colonial character of our economy which
is still in the hands of the same old white capitalist class. Together
with COSATU we have committed ourselves to the struggle for making the
second decade of our freedom a decade for the workers and the poor. We
came to this commitment given the reality that, in economic terms, the
first decade of freedom has benefited the same old capitalist class, now
joined by a tiny black elite. Your struggle therefore is to ensure that if
the first decade of our freedom was not a decade for creative workers,
then the second decade of our freedom must be a decade for creative
workers!

Building working class power in the workplace
means in your case transforming the unequal relations between the big
capitalist companies and creative workers, especially black creative
workers. Whilst to many people your workplace appears to be the stage, but
behind that stage lie deeply rooted exploitative practices. Part of your
challenge in this regard is also to eradicate the problems of drugs in
this industry. Whilst the SACP knows that the problem of drugs is a
society wide problem, not just in the creative sector, your sector remains
particularly vulnerable. The SACP would like to join in with you in
fighting this scourge.

Creative workers are part of the community. You
are also in many ways the custodians and articulators of the many
challenges facing our communities. CWUSA will have to be part of the many
struggles being waged by our communities for a better life. You should
seek to continue to be, in your own way, the voice of the struggles of
these communities.

I have already above highlighted the importance
of creative work in the broader struggle for ideas in society. In many
ways creative work is about ideas, is about communicating message and
influencing society on the kind of society we would like to build. As a
progressive union of creative workers, you have an important role to play
in propagating ideas of caring, social solidarity, selfless commitment to
service of people. Our country is threatened by the growing mentality of self-enrichment,
dog eat dog, threatening to erode the values that have liberated this
country. CWUSA must be the foremost carriers of a pro-poor, pro-working
class messages in our country

It is also going to be important that CWUSA uses
the very extensive international linkages that COSATU has, to forge
international links with your counterparts in other countries, especially
in the developing world. We live in a unipolar world, dominated by an
increasingly militaristic and arrogant United States. Creative work is a
very important component in the struggle against imperialism and its
neo-liberal values and practices. The struggle of the working class must
truly be international if we hope to build a better, humane world, which
as far as we are concerned can only be a socialist world, in which the
working class determines its own destiny and that of the rest of humanity.

We wish to commit ourselves to building a
partnership with CWUSA, throw our full weight behind your struggles. The
immediate challenge will be that of forging common programmes and how our
respective campaigns can help to strengthen our two formations. We also
call upon CWUSA to join in and support our campaigns for the
transformation of the financial sector, transforming the faceless credit
bureaux and for a once off amnesty for all from these institutions, in the
struggle for land and agrarian transformation, in the struggle for safe
and affordable public transport and the struggle for an affordable and
accessible public health system

With these words
we wish you a successful congress!
