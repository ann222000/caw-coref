Hmmm, let's see what Georg Hegel, who lived close to Kant's time and
spoke Kant's native language, thought Kant meant by the term
"intuition (anschauung)":

"Now that the triplicity, adopted in the system of Kant--a method
rediscovered, to begin with, by instinctive insight, but left lifeless
and uncomprehended--has been raised to its significance as an
absolute method, true form is thereby set up in its true content, and
the conception of science has come to light...Instead of the inner
activity and self-movement of its own actual life, such a simple
determination of direct intuition (Anschauung) - which means here
sense-knowledge..."

Intuition requires, and often it is a sub-conscious, a recollection of
past events and experiences and then making predictions or judgements
based upon that knowledge.

That entire process can happen as quick as a reflex or can take a
while. Often it is regarded as something like chemical reactions at
work, mysterious unexplained events and or miraculous mumbojumbo and
so a god or a witch-doctor or the likes is given all of the credit.

Yesterday as our son, a mechanic, was repairing a broken fan belt on
our 4x4, I watched our grandson, my son's son, 11months old, who was
obviously being a Daddy's boy and had to get involved, as he spotted a
steel bar lying on the ground that our son had used as a tool to do
the job.
The bar was about 14 inches long, 3/4inch thick and I guess it weighs
around 10lb, our grandson at first attempt placed his hand half way
along the bar to pick it up, his previous experience had taught him
that that is where it is easier to pick up things of that size and
shape (his intuition as work), however the bar was obviously too
heavy, so another experiment was required, he looked at it again, but
only for a brief moment, and then placed his hand at one end of the
bar and tried to lift again.
This time that end of the bar came off the ground, he was struggling,
but determined, he then paused again while holding the bar, placed his
other hand in the middle of the bar while leaving the first hand where
it was, with a grunt, but now using both hands, he managed to get the
bar off the ground, delighted with himself, (not as much as I was) he
placed the bar back on the ground and went away to find something else
to learn.
He eventually went back to the bar, an hour or so later, although this
time his intuition kicked in, and he placed both hands right in the
middle of the bar and lifted it again.

If a mystic or a Kantian had not seen his first effort to pick up the
bar, but who arrived as he picked the bar up for what they thought was
the first time, they would have just said *intuition* was totally
responsible for where he placed both hands to pick up the bar and
therefore they treat intuition as something much more complicated to
understand and explain.

The Kantians also do exactly that when it comes to their explanation
of space and time, they refuse to acknowledge that something existing,
something existing in sensory reality outside of their minds, is the
origin of both space and time.

">

Even common dictionary definitions of *intuition* include (3) "An
event perceived immediately and without reason". IOW, raw input from
the senses that has not been processed into any conceptual
understanding of "what it is" yet.

For Kant, as well, the type of representations (intutions) that are
most directly caused by external conditions (objects) don't become
*experience* until they're combined with concepts. Even many cognitive
scientists would surely agree that a full apprehension of what one is
perceiving doesn't happen until there is an either a private
linguistic classification (in humans) or feeling (in animals) that the
sensation (image, odor, sound, etc) is *food*, *threat*, etc.

Kant Glossary:

INTUITION [B33/A19] Intuitions are one of two sorts of representations
which we synthesize to form experience; they are connected with the
sensibility (concepts are the other sort of representation; they are
connected with the understanding). Through intuitions, "objects are
given to us by means of sensibility". Intuitions rest on
"affectations": objects affect our mind in certain ways in which we
are "receptive"; in us are produced "sensations" and thereby we
"receive representations", viz. intuitions. Since "in no other way can
an object be given to us...all thought must...relate ultimately to
intuitions". Intuitions are the only sort of representations which
"relate immediately to the object".

But of course Kant never used the term sense-knowledge, he always used

Kant, in his very first paragraph of his C of R talked of there having
to be *objects* existing to *awaken* man's senses to gain all of his
knowledge and soooooo sense-knowedge is just Hegel's interpretation of
what he wished the git Kant had meant.

There are no *objects* immediately existing to awaken an intuition,
therefore Kant would not have even been thinking in the context of
Hegel's interpretation.

Kant says, again in the first paragraph, there are no objects to
awaken man's senses for his knowledge of time, which was the bizarre
reasoning for Kant saying that, time were a priori knowledge, other
Kantian gits since have used mindless contradicting nonsensical
slogans such, time is pre-supposed, or time is innate knowledge, or
time is memory etc etc etc.

*in-tuition* is how I see the word intuition.

There is previous knowledge gained and stored *in* the mind (the *in*)
from previous reasoning, tuition meaning something learnt, therefore
an intuition is a recall of previous knowledge applied to something
current.

I like your interpretation of the word, and the story you explicated
to give it a more personal twist, but it fails as a distinctly
heterodox interpretation of Kant.  The reason why Kant used the terms
intuition and concepts, was to help distinguish between the ambiguous
concept of an "idea" used by such philosophers as Locke, Berkeley and
Hume.  It was never clear whether they meant brute awareness of an
object (intuition, as Kant calls it), or whether they meant ideas or
concepts in the mind.  Hume quite rightly thought that you can have
nothing but ideas of things, but that usage was ambiguous.  You can
have concepts without being aware of an object (You can think about
coins, and use the concept of coins, without being aware of any
particular coins), and you could be aware of coins without having the
concept of a coin.  Concepts are not perceived, but thought, Kant says.

That depends on whether or not the object under reflection was

As I have been explaining for years (beginning on APK), an "intuition"
is a simple fact of knowledge that we take for granted as a given,
sometimes given in the form of "examples and other concrete
illustrations." Your pictorial story about the mechanical son was
based in intuitive knowledge that we all have of things such as cars
and bars of metal. These objects are given in intuition, but not
previously to their experience, as Kant says "we have no knowledge
antecedent to experience."

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;There is previous knowledge gained and stored *in* the mind (the *in*)
&gt;from previous reasoning, tuition meaning something learnt, therefore
&gt;an intuition is a recall of previous knowledge applied to something
&gt;current.
">

B1 -- "For how should our faculty of knowledge be
awakened into action did not objects affecting our senses
partly of themselves produce representations, partly arouse
the activity of our understanding to compare these
representations, and, by combining or separating them, work
up the raw material of the sensible impressions into that
knowledge of objects which is entitled experience? In the
order of time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to
experience, and with experience all our knowledge begins."

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;work, mysterious unexplained events and or miraculous mumbojumbo and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;so a god or a witch-doctor or the likes is given all of the credit.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Yesterday as our son, a mechanic, was repairing a broken fan belt on
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;our 4x4, I watched our grandson, my son's son, 11months old, who was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;obviously being a Daddy's boy and had to get involved, as he spotted a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;steel bar lying on the ground that our son had used as a tool to do
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the job.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The bar was about 14 inches long, 3/4inch thick and I guess it weighs
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;around 10lb, our grandson at first attempt placed his hand half way
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;along the bar to pick it up, his previous experience had taught him
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that that is where it is easier to pick up things of that size and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;shape (his intuition as work), however the bar was obviously too
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;heavy, so another experiment was required, he looked at it again, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;only for a brief moment, and then placed his hand at one end of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bar and tried to lift again.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This time that end of the bar came off the ground, he was struggling,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;but determined, he then paused again while holding the bar, placed his
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;other hand in the middle of the bar while leaving the first hand where
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;it was, with a grunt, but now using both hands, he managed to get the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bar off the ground, delighted with himself, (not as much as I was) he
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;placed the bar back on the ground and went away to find something else
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to learn.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;He eventually went back to the bar, an hour or so later, although this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;time his intuition kicked in, and he placed both hands right in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;middle of the bar and lifted it again.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If a mystic or a Kantian had not seen his first effort to pick up the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bar, but who arrived as he picked the bar up for what they thought was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the first time, they would have just said *intuition* was totally
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;responsible for where he placed both hands to pick up the bar and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;therefore they treat intuition as something much more complicated to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;understand and explain.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The Kantians also do exactly that when it comes to their explanation
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of space and time, they refuse to acknowledge that something existing,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;something existing in sensory reality outside of their minds, is the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;origin of both space and time.

&gt; &gt;&gt; However, Hegel said that &quot;Intuition,&quot; for Kant, means
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;sense-knowledge.&quot;

&gt; &gt;But of course Kant never used the term sense-knowledge, he always used
&gt; &gt;*experience*.

&gt; That depends on whether or not the object under reflection was
&gt; determined or undetermined. If the former, then it was called
&gt; experience; if the latter, then it was called appearance.
">

What nonsense, if an object exists, then HOW it is identified does NOT
change what that object exists in reality as.

Kant's use of the term *experience*, as the means of man's knowledge,
was for no other reason than he needed an excuse to blame his
stupidity in not being able to identify the meaning of space and time
from existing and sensory evidence.

Kant's use of experience and your use of that determined undetermined
mumbojumbo is identical in every respect to what is required to keep
the mystic's god crap alive, it is what enables Kantians and mystics
alike to say such idiotic contradicting nonsenses such as *man can not
be certain of anything*.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A19 -- &quot;IN whatever manner and by whatever means a mode of

Yeah bizarre, absolute stupidity, that implies there was knowledge in
man's mind BEFORE matter and before action, of existing matter, which
is requird in reality to give rise to any tuition, bizarre.

Kant confirms this idiotic nonsense when he calls space and time a
priori knowledge, what HE termed as, knowledge without objects to
awaken man's experience bizarre, irrational stupidity contradicting
nonsense.

Rand identified the axiom of that irrational philosophy as Primacy Of
Consciousness, i.e. reality is what you make it and not something to
be identified BY MAN without contradiction. Why identify without
contradiction? Because there are no contradictions in reality because
what is real is real.

I did that with the explanation and example of intuition, I called

then is it possible for Kant to then turn around claim, WITHOUT

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; B1 -- &quot;For how should our faculty of knowledge be

Explain, because Kant, the dopey git, didn't even think about it, how
action e.g. motion, does not awaken the mind?

By what reasoning are *objects* alone the ONLY means to awaken the
mind, why not also non-contradictory identification of motion or
action?

Bottom line, intuition IS knowledge recalled.

I recall another example, a fire-cheif in charge, with about 30 other
firemen attending a huge blaze in an industrial complex, for what
appeared to be no apparent reason, the fire cheif screamed into the
radios GET OUT - GET OUT - GET OUT ALL PERSONAL LEAVE THE BUILDING
IMMEDIATELY, the last two chaps were almost clear of the building when
a massize fireball exploded and the building where the fireman were
collapsed, certain death would have occured.

The fire-cheif said he couldn't explain it as anything other than his
intuition.

After years of research, on this particular event, it was discovered
that with the 40 odd years experience the fire-cheif had stored in his
mind many 1000's of examples of fires and the nature of fires, the
direction of wind, the smoke hanging low, the obvious suction of air
occuring in certain areas etc etc his mind was able to recollect and
put all this data from 1,000's of fires into a logical sequence, hence
screaming to get out NOW.

There is NOTHING mystical or unknowable about intuition, it is nothing
more than a sub-conscious recallling of previous knowledge applied to
a current event.

Sorry guys and girls if you want a god in your lives you're gonna have
to do better than this.

And for those wanting a reason not to let the Kantian piffle poison
your mind, there has to be something existing in sensory reality for
all three to be of any use.

cognition of what
intuition of what
reasoning of what

If matter is not the what, then the what matters not.

NOTE, the origin of time is action and the nature of action is
duration, time is a tool of measurement of that duration and of course
there can be no action without there being existing matter acting.
Time like all concepts requires a standard, the standard of man's time
is one revolution of the earth around the sun.

Non-contradictory Identification and integration of existing matter
(which cant exist with contradiction) and NOT man's experience, is the
origin of all of man's knowledge, Kant was a twit, you read and follow
at your peril.

Time and Space are not called "knowledge" or even "concepts," they
are called "forms of intuition." Those are not Platonic "forms," since
Platonic "forms" are knowledge existing in the mind innately, remnants
of perhaps a life in some previous existence or another dimension or
what-have-you. None of this Platonism forms any part of Kant's
doctrine of Space and Time. His doctrine differs substantially from
that of Plato's, in that he simply takes the given in sensory
experience and boils it down to its formal essence -- time and space.
This is demonstrated in an example in which Kant removed all
predicates from the concept of an external object, leaving nothing but
that which cannot be removed: the space which the object formerly
resided in.

If you don't believe me, ask your Objectivist compatriot Diana Hsieh,
(who, by the way, has a doctrate in philosophy). Her email address is
readily available.

Something has to get the "ball" rolling. Experiencing is automatically
and instantaneously generated for us, but in a tiny infant, upon first
opening its eyes, things only slowly begin to take shape and
substance. Without the activity of the mind, no experience at all
would be possible.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Now that the triplicity, adopted in the system of Kant--a method

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Phenomenology of Mind, §14

&gt;&gt; &gt;Intuition requires, and often it is a sub-conscious, a recollection of
&gt;&gt; &gt;past events and experiences and then making predictions or judgements
&gt;&gt; &gt;based upon that knowledge.

&gt;&gt; Yet this Objectivist seems to think otherwise:

&gt;&gt; 'For those unfamiliar with Kant's terminology, &quot;cognition&quot; concerns
&gt;&gt; any mental representation, &quot;intuition&quot; is sense perception, and
&gt;&gt; &quot;understanding&quot; is reason.'- Hide quoted text -

&gt;And for those wanting a reason not to let the Kantian piffle poison
&gt;your mind, there has to be something existing in sensory reality for
&gt;all three to be of any use.

&gt;cognition of what
&gt;intuition of what
&gt;reasoning of what

&gt;If matter is not the what, then the what matters not.

&gt;NOTE, the origin of time is action and the nature of action is
&gt;duration, time is a tool of measurement of that duration and of course
&gt;there can be no action without there being existing matter acting.
&gt;Time like all concepts requires a standard, the standard of man's time
&gt;is one revolution of the earth around the sun.

&gt;Non-contradictory Identification and integration of existing matter
&gt;(which cant exist with contradiction) and NOT man's experience, is the
&gt;origin of all of man's knowledge, Kant was a twit, you read and follow

And yet this Objectivist STILL seems to think otherwise concerning the

Consciousness simply means a state of mind able to identify that which
exists, it is not possible to be conscious of nothing, there has to be
something to be conscious of.

Existence triggers the process of gaining knowledge and NOT the mind.

All Kant is saying is that you cannot have a sensible content that is
not spatial and/or temporal. Everything else in perception comes and
goes, but space and/or time are ubiquitous (especially time, which is
present even when there is no spatial content). When you consider
time to be a relational concept, you are implying that you had an
experience of a duration, any moment of which you were capable of
measuring just like any other existent in perception. Time, however,
was not made by the measuring of it, any more than your concept of
a computer monitor created the monitor. Time, like anything else, is
already there, waiting for someone to measure its passage. The issue
then becomes: what is time, the 'thing' that your relational concept
relates to?

M G seems motivated by political agenda, whereas others in here
(barring religious zealots and etc) may have a "screw the human
context" --what little can we undogmatically say about the situation
independent of serving the interests of particular social squabblings?

Before early 19th century positivism also split off into the
philosophy of science direction, it was rather cult-like and the
ancestor of what's popularly called *scientism* today. The motivation
for its being intensely anti-metempirical was to nuke religion and etc
as Mike is doing, and thus its leaning toward phenomenalism or quality
realism: the world is the way it appears to humans, end of story
(atoms did not really exist, for instance, there were no things-in-
themselves).

The problem for such radical empiricism today however, is not just an
old Enlightenment philosopher like Kant and the anti-Enlightenment
postmodernists of the 20th century as this or that nemesis. Physics
has acquired a mounting pile of evidence for its theories (beyond just
atoms and particles). General Relativity and quantuam mechanics
question 3-dimensional space being fundamental (in different ways) and
also the absolute objectivity of time (as Brian Green says, even the
order of what we call past and future becomes mangled at the Planck
level).

While none of these necessarily lead to the plenum of possibility that
Kant's unknown or "empty" brand of metaphysics provides (Niels Bohr
fans should keep brushing that Everett interpretation of QM aside),
they do lend a kind of credence to his prescient undermining of the
objectivity of space and time. Something that 19th century criticism
of Kant probably didn't have to deal with --one could always respond
then that there was no evidence at all to counter our commonsense
belief of the spatiotemporal appearance of the universe being mind-
independent.

So the enemy of naive or phenomenal realists with anti-theist bent
isn't just indirect realism or representationalism --it is also
certain areas of physics which carry more clout than philosophical
arguments. And although the reductionism approach in the "unity of
science" is declining in other science disciplines (in favor of
emergence and etc), the effort to explanatorily reduce everything to
their strange and bizarre behaving level remains very much alive in
particle physics.

So what remains is arguing that it is necessary to believe in naive
realism (in the political arena) regardless of whether or not such so-
called *appearances* are actually the case in an external world or
human-independent realm (so as to leave religion no metempirics in
which to even squirm).

An irony, though, is that Kant was also an empirical realist --we are
confined to the natural world that the innate templates of our minds
produce in response to the influence of external (but unknown)
objects. Certainty is possible about that phenomenal world, if not the
noumenal one.

But the theists can then proclaim, "But after death the natural world
ceases for us and we enter blah, blah, blah.... (dogmatic
metaphysics)."

This is what you said:

quote
"Time and Space are not called "knowledge" or even "concepts," they
are called "forms of intuition."

I have defined or explained the *concept* of intuition as; a sometimes
instant and other times slightly delayed *recall* of previous events
*tuition* (meaning something learnt) stored *in* the mind and used or
applied to judge or make a decision or a prediction upon or about
current events.

I gave two real life sensory examples to explain how it works.

Your version so far has been this bloody trash, FFS

"a special ultimate mental power of INTUITIVELY"

give me break.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Time, however,
&gt; was not made by the measuring of it,

That is NOT what I said.

I explaind that time is a relational concept, that time is duration of
one entity moving in its relationship to another entity through a
process called action, action meaning, two or more entities acting
according to their own nature.

I said that man discovered a way to measure that duration, in the
identical manner as he dicovered a way to measure the quantity of
units with a concept called numbers, in the identical manner as he
discoverd a way to measure distance, the effects of gravity, density,
temperate etc etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You are by your above statement about time, clearly claiming to have
knowledge of a thing called time without any reference to any sensory
objects, according to you (a brain dead Kantian) time is and times
remains nothing more than idea about an idea, bizarre, which is
identical in every single respect as to what is required to hold the
mumbojumbo crap ideas of gods, tooth fairies, voodooism, the greater
good, we are our brother's keeper, bizarre.

You are saying that the origin of time is a *a soley dependent upon
the mind thing* an idea about an idea, something that man must just
accept as his knowledge, accept as existing as reality and without any
sensory evidence required bizarre.

Which IS identical in every respect as to what the mystics say about
the reality of their god crap, that you must just accept god that you
can get to know god without any reference to sensory evidence.

&gt;This is what you said:

&gt;quote
&gt;&quot;Time and Space are not called &quot;knowledge&quot; or even &quot;concepts,&quot; they
&gt;are called &quot;forms of intuition.&quot;

&gt;I have defined or explained the *concept* of intuition as; a sometimes

&gt;*tuition* (meaning something learnt) stored *in* the mind and used or
&gt;applied to judge or make a decision or a prediction upon or about
&gt;current events.

&gt;I gave two real life sensory examples to explain how it works.

&gt;Your version so far has been this bloody trash, FFS

&gt;&quot;a special ultimate mental power of INTUITIVELY&quot;

&gt;give me break.

&gt;&gt; Time, however,
&gt;&gt; was not made by the measuring of it,

&gt;That is NOT what I said.

&gt;I explaind that time is a relational concept, that time is duration of
&gt;one entity moving in its relationship to another entity through a
&gt;process called action, action meaning, two or more entities acting
&gt;according to their own nature.

&gt;I said that man discovered a way to measure that duration, in the
&gt;identical manner as he dicovered a way to measure the quantity of
&gt;units with a concept called numbers, in the identical manner as he
&gt;discoverd a way to measure distance, the effects of gravity, density,
&gt;temperate etc etc.

&gt;&gt; any more than your concept of
&gt;&gt; a computer monitor created the monitor. Time, like anything else, is
&gt;&gt; already there, waiting for someone to measure its passage.

&gt;You are by your above statement about time, clearly claiming to have
&gt;knowledge of a thing called time without any reference to any sensory
&gt;objects, according to you (a brain dead Kantian) time is and times
&gt;remains nothing more than idea about an idea, bizarre, which is
&gt;identical in every single respect as to what is required to hold the
&gt;mumbojumbo crap ideas of gods, tooth fairies, voodooism, the greater
&gt;good, we are our brother's keeper, bizarre.

&gt;You are saying that the origin of time is a *a soley dependent upon
&gt;the mind thing* an idea about an idea, something that man must just
&gt;accept as his knowledge, accept as existing as reality and without any
&gt;sensory evidence required bizarre.

&gt;Which IS identical in every respect as to what the mystics say about
&gt;the reality of their god crap, that you must just accept god that you
&gt;can get to know god without any reference to sensory evidence.

No, you are claiming to have a concept called "time" without
any referent. I am asking you what the referent of 'time' is.
Almost everything you mentioned above (with the exception
of distance) can be measured by its effects. Gravity, density,
temperature, etc. But you cannot measure time (or space, as in
distances) by its effects.

I certainly agree that you can measure duration and call that time.
However, this duration is not caused by time, as when the displacement
of water is caused by the density of the object immersed in it. On the
other hand, if you believe you can somehow locate time as the source
of action, then you have reduced gravity, density, temperature, etc.
etc. to just as odd a bugaboo as "time," a "thing" that can have
effects without there being any "thing" present to serve as a cause,
as with density (a property of objects as is temperature and gravity).

I also agree that it requires the presence of objects to have
knowledge of time. However, as with anything else we can claim as
knowledge, things must be present to us, in this case, in time, BEFORE
we can have knowledge of time. Or, to put it in Kant's lingo, things
must be PRESENTED (sometimes translated as "represented") to us in
time before we can have knowledge of time. Or else you have reduced
'time' to a merely useful fiction for measuring the duration of
events. And in that case, you have also reduced the causality of
events to a merely useful fiction, and Hume wins.

I hope by now that you can see that there is a big difference between
'time' or 'space,' and these other concepts you mentioned, 'gravity,'
'density,' and 'temperature.' The next step is to see that 'time' is
not the thing being measured, but the form the relationship you
mentioned takes for us.

Answer, for about the 1000th time

EXISTING MATTER IN ACTION

specifically,

THE DURATION OF THE ACTION OF TWO OR MORE ENTITIES ACTING ACCORDING TO
THEIR OWN NATURE.

no matter = no action = no duration = no time

there is time, when there is action, there is action when there is two
or more entities of existing matter acting in accordance of their
nature.

Time is a concept. A relational concept. Specifically the relationship
of one entity in action against another entity.

There can be no action without matter acting, therefore the concept
man has called time, has its origin in sensory matter.

Man can sense action. Your knowledge of time comes from your ability
or faculty of perception to sense action.

Like ALL measuring systems, the measuring of duration of ANY entities
in action, requires a standard, that standard is one orbit of the
earth around the sun.

Dont believe me? well try and explain 10 minutes ago without using
that standard.

2 o'clock and ten minutes ago mean nothing to a martian, time depends
upon where you are in the universe.

Only matter matters, matter acts, when it does there is duration.

To make sense of duration man has given it a standard so as it can be
measured.

No different to the fact that to give meaning to distance, man has
devised a way to measure it, using as it happens numerous standards.

Check your premises, the horse goes in front of the cart.

You simply cant have knowledge of time without there being matter in
action. Time is the duration of matter in action, nothing more nothing

You are giving time an order or an importance in your knowledge that
is illogical because it doesn't have that order in sensory reality.

You said

"There is no such thing as a particle of space."

In fact there is, why? because space is not nothing, space exists as
something and as it happens science has discovered the particles which
make up what man calls space.

In sensory reality, the ONLY reality that counts, there is no space
where the apple sits, unless of course you imagine it to be, and yet
reality is not imagined, unless of course you are Kantian and or
mystic, same thing.

Nope. I am asking for the physical referent of time, either as an
object or as a property of objects. If you say there isn't any, and
that 'time' is only the concept (of duration), that is close to
admitting Kant is right, and it is only a matter of 'time' before you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I have already stated as much, but you can't see that I am way
ahead of you here. As I wrote in the response: "I also agree that it
requires the presence of objects to have knowledge of time." I am
arguing that you have to sense entities or their properties in order
to have knowledge of them, but 'time' is neither an entity nor a
property.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Now you are moving forward into the ITOE, regurgitating some of its
simple doctrine, but you still haven't explained whether 'time' is a
property or an entity, or if its a property of a relationship between
entities or how such a property is even possible.

By the way, the standard of measuring time is not one orbit of the
earth around the sun. According to your own goddess, the standard of
any measurement must be reducible to that which is within range of
your perceptions. You can't measure a light-year until you can measure
an inch or a centimeter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Dont believe me? well try and explain 10 minutes ago without using
&gt;that standard.
">

It's not a question of me not believing you, but of you not believing
me. First you completely miscomprehend Kant, then when I explain it
to you, you complain that Kant is wrong; and now, you are delving into
completely unrelated topics found in ITOE, a work by the way which has
never found respect within the intellectual community and never will.

In fact, neither you nor ITOE can explain what makes the relationship
you call 'time' *epistemically* possible, that is, you cannot explain
what makes its apprehension possible qua relationship and not merely
as two unrelated events or actions. You can employ all the standards
you want, omit every measurement in the universe, but you will never
derive your *ability* to perceive temporal relationships in that way.
You simply take your ability to perceive it as an unexplained
common-sensical given that is not necessary to explain. You fail to
comprehend that the relationship between two objects in time is not
simply given to you analytically, its very apprehension by your mind
requires the immediate addition by your mind of the time element
which you take as merely conceptual. But if 'time' were conceptual,
apprehension would not be immediate, it would be mediated through
the understanding by the concept 'time.'

"Against this theory, which admits the empirical reality of
time, but denies its absolute and transcendental reality, I have
heard men of intelligence so unanimously voicing an objection,
that I must suppose it to occur spontaneously to every reader
to whom this way of thinking is unfamiliar. The objection is
this. Alterations are real, this being proved by change of our A37
own representations -- even if all outer appearances, together
with their alterations, be denied. Now alterations are possible
only in time, and time is therefore something real. There is no
difficulty in meeting this objection. I grant the whole argument.
Certainly time is something real, namely, the real form of inner
intuition. It has therefore subjective reality in respect of inner
experience; that is, I really have the representation of time and B54
of my determinations in it. Time is therefore to be regarded
as real, not indeed as object but as the mode of representation
of myself as object. If without this condition of sensibility I
could intuit myself, or be intuited by another being, the very
same determinations which we now represent to ourselves as
alterations would yield knowledge into which the representation
of time, and therefore also of alteration, would in no way enter.
Thus empirical reality has to be allowed to time, as the condition of
all our experiences; on our theory, it is only its absolute reality
that has to be denied. It is nothing but the form of our inner
intuition. If we take away from our inner intuition the peculiar
condition of our sensibility, the concept of time likewise vanishes;
it does not inhere in the objects, but merely in the subject which
intuits them. A38
I can indeed say that my representations follow one another;
but this is only to say that we are conscious of them as in a time-
sequence, that is, in conformity with the form of inner sense. Time
is not, therefore, something in itself, nor is it an objective
determination inherent in things."

in reality, for man to claim ANY REAL knowledge of time, then like any

have an objective, meaning, INDEPENDENT OF MAN'S MIND, meaning, which

*origin of time* must be able to (and using Kantian crap only because
it gets you hard) *awaken man's senses* in order for man to claim
knowledge of time, or else it is nothing more than an idea based upon
an idea, no different to the mystics god crap.

Kant is in effect saying, we must just accept time like the mystics
accept a god, as a subjective idea based upon a subjective idea.

Kant tries to excuse his stupidity by calling time the trash of a
priori knowledge, which is a total fucking load of senseless
contradicting fucking nonsense, in the literal sense of senseless.

Point to anywhere in Kant's trash where he explains what time is
objectively, i.e. something that exists independently of man's mind,
something that has its origin in man's faculty of sensory perceptions
to be identified and intergated into knowledge WITHOUT CONTRADICTION
IE REASONED, which is what Kant claims IS the standard of ALL of man's
knowledge, something that *awakens* man's senses.

Kant says there are no objects to awaken man's seness for his
knowledge of time, I am saying there are, its that fucking simple.

I am saying, that what *awakens* man's seneses, to the concept called
time, is, matter in action and I am saying that duration is a part of
the identity of any and all action.

Furthermore, I am saying that action is not possible without matter
and its nature, therefore I am saying, that the origin of time can be
sensed.

I am saying there IS something to awaken man's senses to claim his
knowledge of time and I am sayng that time is NOT something that man
must just be accepting subjectively as any Kantian a priori fucking
crap, is that clear?

I cant make it any clearer than that, but no doubt I will have to try,
because you are so fucking brain dead and indoctrinated and besotted
by the stupid confused cunt.

When you say above that time is only a concept, then you yourself have
reduced it to the subjective. You can only objectify a concept when a
referent for it has been found in reality. So far you have not done
this.

Kant explains that if time exists objectively (and this you have never
shown even as you claim it to be truth), then everything else is
reduced to the subjective.

Kant showed that It is only when you have time (and space) as merely
the subjective form of appearances that you may then apply objectivity
to everything else.

You have to accept that time and space are subjective in order to
provide for an objective world.

Nope, subjective means totally dependent upon the mind, it means an

meaning and standard.

A concept I define as, the *trigger word* which ignites inside the
mind a mental abstraction or a story of an event or events which when
combined result in a single piece of knowledge.

e.g. the concept *evoluation*, ignites inside the mind a picture of
things changing slowly to adapt to environmental changes, e.g. a plant
adapting over many years to survive herbicide.

Duration is a part of the identity of an action, you can sense action
in many ways, e.g. try more fibre in your diet.

Time starts with action, action does not start with time.

Just because the mind is in action, doesn't mean that any single thing
the mind is active on, can then just be invented out of the blue.

Kant clearly did not recognise what it was that IS existing, in
sensory reality, that triggers man's mind into working out what it is
that gives rise to what man calls time / duration.

Which is why, he then said that man must just accept time as, a priori
knowledge, (knowledge without SENSORY EVIDENCE FAITH BASED CRP) from
which all other events happen and need, which IS just complete and
utter CRAP.

Time does not exist in sensory reality, it is a concept, BUT what DOES
exist is, what gives time its meaning to MAN and that is, its an
event, the moving relationship, that man can sense, of one entity in
action against another.

You get sugar with an apple whether you want it or not, you get

Matter can act, when it does you automatically get duration.

Always matter first, or it doesn't matter if there's not.

Dont worry yourself about no matter, because when you do, you set

If you want time to be an idea originating of or from no matter, then
what makes that idea different in principle, to the mystic's idea that
god doesn't need to exist or originate of or from matter?

What makes Kant's idea of things needing space and time to exist, that
man must just accept them both as, **a priori knowledge**,
(contradicting and senseless faith based bullshit) different in

Kant had no need of defining "a set." Find a better example, something
from the actual work and not something your dopey consciousness just
made up.

This statement seems quite clear and unambiguous to me:

"The question, famed of old, by which logicians were
supposed to be driven into a corner, obliged either to have
recourse to a pitiful sophism, or to confess their ignorance
and consequently the emptiness of their whole art, is the
question: What is truth? The nominal definition of truth,
that it is the agreement of knowledge with its object, is
assumed as granted; the question asked is as to what is
the general and sure criterion of the truth of any and every
knowledge." (B82)

Kant asked you a clear-cut and concise question. Now, what is your
answer, dopey?

That would be transcendental realism, not transcendental idealism.
It is only transcendental realism which claims that the transcendental
is real, that it comprises some substance "in and around solid
matter," which is to say in more technical language, that it either
inheres or subsists as a substance of things. If you want to learn
more about that view, study Aristotle.

Furthermore, your transcendental realism, Kant argues, is the theory
which leads to subjectivism, because it places that which is merely
the form of appearances (time and space) squarely in the realm of the
thing-in-itself, thus reducing everything to mere subjective
appearances.

It is only by admitting the subjectivity of time and space that you
can preserve the objectivity of the world around you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I have explained to you, but you are once agan required to ignore me
&gt;to keep your Kantian nightmare alive, that scientists have now
&gt;identified the shape and size of the particles or substance of what
&gt;man calls space.

&gt;Space is NOT nothing, space exists as some THING, so get used to it,

&gt;A is A

&gt;Space is some THING.

&gt;There is no space where the apple sits.

&gt;A is A

I never claimed that empty space actually exists, that is the point of
locating it in the realm of appearances.

You are close to being Kantian when you admit that 'space' or 'time'
is only a concept, which is an Aristotlean view in its origin.
However, it ignores hundreds of years of philosophical questions and
theories which came afterward. It ignores the entire Enlightenment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But so far you haven't
&gt;&gt; responded to my challenge to show us the referent of 'space' or 'time'
&gt;&gt; as either a thing or a property of things.

&gt;Action comprises of duration, duration is a part of the identity of an
&gt;action, you can sense it, the origin of the concept called time is
&gt;matter and then action.

&gt;You get sugar with an apple whether you want it or not, you get
&gt;duration with action whether you want it or not.

&gt;Matter can act, when it does you automatically get duration.

&gt;Always matter first, or it doesn't matter if there's not.

&gt;Dont worry yourself about no matter, because when you do, you set
&gt;yourself up to be the next suicide bomber, even worse a Kantian.
">

Kant discusses "matter" in the cpr, but not from an attitude of
skepticism towards it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If you want time to be an idea originating of or from no matter, then
&gt;what makes that idea different in principle, to the mystic's idea that
&gt;god doesn't need to exist or originate of or from matter?
">

If you believe that space actually surrounds things, then there is no
difference in principle with the mystic's view that God imbues all
matter, or some such.

"That in the appearance which corresponds to sensation I term its
matter..." (A20)

"...while the matter of all appearance is given to us a posteriori
only, its form must lie ready for the sensations a priori in the mind,
and so must allow of being considered apart from all sensation." (A20)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What makes Kant's idea of things needing space and time to exist, that
&gt;man must just accept them both as, **a priori knowledge**,
&gt;(contradicting and senseless faith based bullshit) different in
&gt;principle to the mystics who say, there can be no space or time exist
&gt;without god?
">

Irrelevant. What matters is that he CAN do so, and not mystically but
rationally, thus leaving God out of it. It is, to the contrary, your
idea that matter is imbued with space that leaves an opening for the
mystic.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Now that the triplicity, adopted in the system of Kant--a method

Of course he was correct in that Anschauung for Kant is
sense-knowledge. But that is an English translation from what may have
been a single word (knowing how Germans do these things):
"Senseknowledge," which I take to be describing a combination of the
matter of the senses with the form it takes for us. Sense + Knowledge
gives rise to the Anschauung. And it is always appropriate, with Kant,
to see this in terms of a synthesis of some sort.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Time is a concept, nothing more nothing less.

&gt;&gt; &gt;The subject is the epistemology of time, the meaning of time, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;explanation of time, the theory of time.

&gt;&gt; &gt;For the concept time, like ANY of man's ideas about what he claims are
&gt;&gt; &gt;ideas about reality, like any theory of any claim of man's knowledge
&gt;&gt; &gt;about something in reality, for the concept time to have any meaning
&gt;&gt; &gt;in reality, for man to claim ANY REAL knowledge of time, then like any
&gt;&gt; &gt;and ALL of man's seperate pieces of knowledge of reality, time must
&gt;&gt; &gt;have an objective, meaning, INDEPENDENT OF MAN'S MIND, meaning, which
&gt;&gt; &gt;means, that meaning must be linked directly to sensory evidence, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;*origin of time* must be able to (and using Kantian crap only because
&gt;&gt; &gt;it gets you hard) *awaken man's senses* in order for man to claim
&gt;&gt; &gt;knowledge of time, or else it is nothing more than an idea based upon
&gt;&gt; &gt;an idea, no different to the mystics god crap.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Kant is in effect saying, we must just accept time like the mystics
&gt;&gt; &gt;accept a god, as a subjective idea based upon a subjective idea.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Kant tries to excuse his stupidity by calling time the trash of a
&gt;&gt; &gt;priori knowledge, which is a total fucking load of senseless
&gt;&gt; &gt;contradicting fucking nonsense, in the literal sense of senseless.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Point to anywhere in Kant's trash where he explains what time is
&gt;&gt; &gt;objectively, i.e. something that exists independently of man's mind,
&gt;&gt; &gt;something that has its origin in man's faculty of sensory perceptions
&gt;&gt; &gt;to be identified and intergated into knowledge WITHOUT CONTRADICTION
&gt;&gt; &gt;IE REASONED, which is what Kant claims IS the standard of ALL of man's
&gt;&gt; &gt;knowledge, something that *awakens* man's senses.

&gt;&gt; When you say above that time is only a concept, then you yourself have
&gt;&gt; reduced it to the subjective.

&gt;Nope, subjective means totally dependent upon the mind, it means an
&gt;idea not originating from any sensory evidence, I am saying time is a
&gt;concept based upon sensory evidence, that time has an objective
&gt;meaning and standard.

Understood. But in this case, it wouldn't be man's subjective mind, it
would be totally dependent upon God's mind, subjectively.

It is your theory of space that gives rise to mystics with their God.
It is your theory of space that leads to the notion that everything
exists in the mind of God. But if space is only the form of our
external appearances, then that leaves God out of the picture
entirely.

Let's put it this way: "appearance" is that element (the matter) of
experience which is left over when you abstract out the objective
element of experience. This does not involve any ontology, all it
involves is the knowledge that when this matter impinges upon the
senses, it is taken up by your senses and your mind generates
conscious experience. The subjective aspect is that which, a priori
to the experience, brings the matter of the senses to the form this
experience takes for us.

It is a non-arbitrarily known fact that color is not part of the realm
of the thing-in-itself, what exists there are light-waves vibrating at
certain frequencies. The color is the unexplained phenomenon at the
end of the process, you can explain it to an extent as the result of
rods and cones in the retina, but the consciousness per se is left
unexplained. This color coincides utterly with your experience or
consciousness of it. There is no difference between your experience
of color and the color itself.

From here, Kant then reduces all experience in this manner. It is not
only color, or sound, or texture, but also the very shape of things
that coincides utterly with our experience of them. Therefore there is
no distinction between primary and secondary qualities, everything is
reduced to the 'secondary,' which means there is no 'primary' and the
distinction has been invalidated. They are neither primary nor
secondary, they are simply the given in consciousness.

On the other hand, if you merely claim that all qualities are
objective, this does nothing to answer the question of
primary/secondary duality except to say that it is what it is. And
this does nothing but express a vacuous formula which tells people
that evading the facts of reality is unwise or "irrational." But in
arguing about these questions, Objectivists do nothing but evade
these questions: see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil. Their
vaunted objectivity has done nothing more for them then wall them
off from the very facts of reality they parade around as the source of
truth.
