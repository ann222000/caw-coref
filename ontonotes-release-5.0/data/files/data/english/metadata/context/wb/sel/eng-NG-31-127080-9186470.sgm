I agree with their conclusion that this is complex and
deserving of further study, but I won't rush out and buy any
donuts just yet.

First, a media article based on an interview with one of the
authors, then one of the relevant papers:

&quot;NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The &quot;obesity paradox&quot; -- an
unexpected decrease in illness and death with increasing
body weight or BMI, which has been described in people with
heart failure and in patients having angioplasty -- exists
in people with high blood pressure and diseased heart
arteries as well, new study findings show.

In the study, researchers found that overweight and obese
adults with high blood pressure and coronary artery disease
had a lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death, compared
with their normal-weight counterparts.&quot;

An obesity paradox in acute heart failure: Analysis of body
mass index and inhospital mortality for 108927 patients in
the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry.

http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:17174642

BACKGROUND: Prior studies on chronic systolic heart failure
(HF) have demonstrated that body mass index (BMI) is
inversely associated with mortality, the so-called obesity
paradox. The aim of this study was to determine whether BMI
influences the mortality risk in acute decompensated HF, a
subject not previously studied.
&lt;snip&gt;

CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with
HF, higher BMI was associated with lower inhospital
mortality risk. The relationship between BMI and adverse
outcomes in HF appears to be complex and deserving of
further study.

The obesity paradox is puzzling only for those who don't understand
the difference between VAT and SAT.
