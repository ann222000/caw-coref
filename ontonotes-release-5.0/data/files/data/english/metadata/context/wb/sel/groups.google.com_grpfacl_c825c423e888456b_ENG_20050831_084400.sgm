Dear Friends,
Over the past month or so, colleagues in UK have been on my mind. I was surprised to not see some mention of their status or some expression of condolence or some offer of help here on this list, or some action by the Facilitator Intervention team (Gil's group). After a few days, I thought maybe there had been and I just missed it. As days went by with no news, I thought about posting to the group but got paranoid that facilinazi's would flame the heck outta me for using our public forum for private messages blahblahblah. I'm particularly thinking about Jean-Anne where are you are you OK and Gary and all our FAS and IAF colleagues.

Now I find myself compelled to reach out to colleagues in Louisiana, as well as London. Having been through &quot;Andrew&quot; I imagine there is much we can offer, even spread out around the globe the way we are. It's a sinking feeling to watch the world's attention just meander from one tragedy to the next, and I suspect colleagues in UK are still reeling even though we've moved on to Katrina. Months after Andrew headlines had come and gone I remember wondering, &quot;Don't they (the huge faceless sea of they's) know it isn't over yet?&quot;

So, hollow and useless as these few words are, my thoughts and prayers go out to those living in aftermaths.
Are there any list members who need help? Who know what kinds of help they need? Mostly people need cash money because with electricity out, there's no banks, no cash machines, and no gas or food without cash. In my own experiece, it was way better to give to individuals rather than groups purporting to benefit individuals. The trickle down is slow as stink, the volunteer armies are uncoordinated and bumbling all over themselves for weeks, and &quot;help&quot; gets bottlenecked by bureacracy.

Anything happening with the Gil team? Any list members in the midst of disaster who could steer me toward most useful expressions of care?

Jim Wiegel here. I had the opportunity, since the Tampa conference, to read the WHOLE IAF Handbook on group facilitation. (just carrying it around produced aerobic and upper body strength benefits . . . ) and the focus there on techniques and approaches and training and being good at our professional craft got me wondering about the results of our work. A colleague referred me to The Age of Participation by Patricia McLagan &amp; Christo Nel which was published back in 1995. Their point was that participation, though an important trend, has mainly been tried out piecemeal and with short term interventions (retreats, initiatives, etc.) and there were not many examples where participation and facilitation had been integrated and structured into the fabric of teams, organizations and initiatives for lasting success.

So, I am launching a personal inquiry, over the next couple of weeks to find a variety of good examples of lasting success with facilitation and participation and identify some patterns of what sustains that success. You can access the survey at the link below if you know of examples to share. It is only available for the next 2 weeks.

Feel free, as well, to forward the link to colleagues, clients and associates who you consider to be living illustrations so they can outline their own perspective. They might be honored that you thought of them.

As is the custom on this list serve, I will make the summary of responses available by the end of October.

CONFIDENTIALITY: You have the option, in filling the survey, to enter actual names and contact information or give generic descriptions or even aliases to protect your identity or the identity of clients and associates.

Thanks for your wisdom on this.

Dear Friends,
I want to thank James for asking this question. I am writing a series for
the facilitation section of Mediate.com on this very issue, and would also
welcome your stories of long term success.

James, I would very much like to get your results, and I invite others to
write privately to me with their stories. Most particularly, what you
believe contributed to that success and what challenges you and the group
had to overcome. You can read my first two articles (and others on
facilitation) at  .
Best wishes, Sterling

Very interesting comment! It is no mere coincidence that the
forthcoming IAF book is &quot;Creating a Culture of Collaboration.&quot;

Another useful source on this subject is: &quot;The appeal and
difficulties of participative systems&quot; DP McCaffrey, SR Faerman,

Jim, I wonder how broadly the writers were thinking about this topic to call
it a &quot;trend.&quot; For example, I learned facilitation through my work in the
1970s with the American Friends Service Committee. AFSC used the &quot;Quaker
Process&quot; of the Society of Friends which has a long history of
consensus-based decision-making and facilitative leadership.

I must confess I skimmed the book over fish and chips at the local Red Robin -- in the book, they suggested the &quot;Age of Participation&quot; was over 220 years old, in 1995 when the book was published . . . which caused me to read Miracle At Philadelphia : The Story of the Constitutional Convention May - September 1787: by Catherine Drinker Bowen (along with a question asked by a participant in a facilitation I did who wondered if &quot;this was the same process used to produce the (US) Declaration of Independence&quot; . . .

Jo Nelson has talked about the infamous Roberts Rules of Order also as a milestone . . .

There are a number of case studies, and it might be possible to
analyze them this way, but I have not -- at least not yet. Most
of the authors have their own sense of what makes collaboration
work, and these views permeate the book.

For example, see David Straus' book, &quot;How to Make Collaboration
Work,&quot; in which he describes five practices that contribute to
the success of collaborative work:

- Involve the relevant stakeholders
- Build consensus phase by phase
- Design a process map
- Designate a process facilitator
- Harness the power of group memory

Are there other sources that suggest what makes for lasting
success in participation, facilitation, collaboration ...?

Sandy, from the perspective of public participation collaboration with
policy makers:

Barbara Gray's book: Collaboration. Particularly when collaborative vs.
adversarial processes make sense (not always in stakeholders interests to
engage in collaborative process). Also, recognizing and compensating for the
unequal level of resources that stakeholders have that allow them to
participate in the first place.

IAP2's core values, which address many of the key points of authentic
collaboration.   eg. the promise that the contribution will
influence the decision, participants are involved in defining how they
participate, etc.

Bjoinka Bishops work (Toward Trust and Understanding) on the Seven
Principles of Authentic Communications and clarity on what level on input
into decision making collaborative processes have: Informational only,
review and comment, advice and consultation, and negotiation and consensus.

Tom Webler's analysis on Collaborative Process.

I draw on these and Tom Webler's analysis of public engagement and
participatory process in developing the six points I articulate in my book
&quot;Meaningful Participation&quot; on what factors make for meaningful engagement of
citizens in collaborative policy making:

1. Open: accessible and public processes for information sharing and
deliberation
2. Truthful: Promote accuracy and authenticity in fact and spirit
3, Broad-based: represents the diversity of interests
4. Deliberative: provides enough time for comtemplation and thoughtful
response to a variety of perspectives
5.Responsive: considers and is influenced by contributions of participants
6. Fair: acknowledges biases and works to create a level playing field
7. Competent: results in better decisions

In addition, these processes need to recognize inner ring and outer ring
stakeholders, with expectations that stakeholders are fluid and will change
over time.

One more:

That collaborators understand and can seek to level or balance the power
relationships within the group (see Bolman and Deal in &quot;Reframing
Organizations&quot; on discussions of types of power)

Dear Friends,
I want to acknowledge and thank all those who have put forward their ideas
about what makes facilitation and participation successful, including those
who have pointed towards informative reading material.

I can't speak for Jim, but my request was somewhat different. Perhaps folks
were not intending to reply to my request. What I am looking for is
specific examples of facilitation projects that produced changes over time
successfully; i.e. that the client was wanting change, that the change took
place, and that you can comment in some specific ways about what you believe
went into creating those changes. I am not looking for you to break any
confidentiality by giving away identifiable information about organizations
or individuals. I am interested in long term sustainable changes, and I'm
open to your definition of what that might mean. For myself, that means the
changes are still in effect and working after two years (I assume tthat
after that new changes will be in the offing).

What say you?

Sterling,
How about an example of a 20-year participatory collaboration that has
convened 25 cities and towns, across two states, involving a very diverse
group of nonprofits, private citizens, government officials (municipal,
state and federal) interests, to define, preserve and promote their shared
cultural, economic and environmental heritage and to work together to
preserve this identity?

The John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor is
that example. You can get a copy of their recent Sustainability Study, which
discusses how it all works and its future challenges at
