He's upped my Abilify from 5 to 10mg.  So now I'm on Abilify 10mg + Zyprexa 15mg + mirtazapine 60mg + diazepam 10mg.  I really really want to stop the Zyprexa altogether, but he wants to take things slowly building up the Abilify dose before he takes me off Zyprexa.  I don't know why; it says in the official product information that it's safe to stop other antipsychotics immediately when switching to Abilify.  I'm just so sick of being fat (well, a little) and impotent.  Oh well, I suppose another couple of weeks of Zyprexa won't kill me after putting up with it this long.

Tim,

With all due respect, your doctor is a dope.

Abilify binds very tightly to the various dopamine receptors (as a partial
antagonist) that the zyprexa isn't going to do anything more than the
abilify alone, it just muddies up the waters.  When I was on risperdal and
navane together and switched to abilify, I started the abilify at a full
dose (for me 15mg), and stopped the risperdal/navane at the same time.  My
doc and I figured if the abilify didn't work, I'd know in the first week or
so, and I would just switch back to the med combo before we started abilify
(risperdal/navane).

Maybe your shrink should get the latest abilify info from the drug reps....

That's what I thought, jerasmus.  I see him again on Friday, and I'll talk to him about this.  Today was only a 5 minute visit because I'd finished the starter pack of Abilify 5mg, and he gave me another starter pack of 10mg.  I have 45 minutes with him on Friday, so we'll have time to talk together at length.  I have been on Abilify briefly before, my GP had me on 15mg, which I switched to immediately from Risperdal (which had been causing severe movement disorders).  I sometimes think I'd be just as well off ditching this psychiatrist altogether and just having longer consultations with my GP.

Hi Tim

(It's Jan from Adelaide)

Sorry to but in but just read your post and just wanted to say my eldest
son Chris who has had schizophrenia for many years now only actually sees
his GP (even then very infrequently) for his medication.  Nothing much
changes with Chris' meds so quite often our GP just writes him a 'script
out without seeing him.  Only his normal medication of course.

Regards

Hi Jan,

Yes, my GP normally writes my psych meds scripts too, and often without seeing me.  My pdoc (he's at a government clinic) doesn't write scripts for me, he phones my GP to tell him what to prescribe.  I need a script at least every 25 days, because I'm taking diazepam 5mg twice daily, so a bottle of 50 only lasts 25 days, and that's all he can prescribe at once on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  But the other meds are all six months supply scripts.  So once I'm stabilised on the Abilify, I'll only neeed to see him once every six months, and just pick up a diazepam script once a month.  I'll see him more often though, if I do decide to ditch my psych.

Tim:

This is a Cheap Advise Warning:

I am no doctor, and you and your doctor are approaching a med change
cautiously.  That is a good thing.  Gradually starting the new meds then
tapering off the old meds is generally accepted as good sound advice.  I do
remember, however, that I was told that changing to abilify would be
different.  Maybe my doc was just telling me a load of crap that he got from
the drug peddlers.  Damn doctors.

Best of luck to you in your medicine change.  I have been on Abilify for
several years now and 15mg of it in the morning has been very good for me
(though I can get quite restless on it, and my hands tremor a bit).

Thanks for your input, jerasmus.  I'll keep posting about my progress as the Abilify is increased and the Zyprexa decreased.
