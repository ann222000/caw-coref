Young diaspora Greeks and ethnic identity

The Hellenext network connects younger Greek Americans with eminent
personalities who come from the same background

Many Greek Americans have only one parent of Greek origin. The young

and Asian parentage. He was one of those who paraded down Fifth Avenue
last year to celebrate Greek Independence Day. Right: A child, wearing

By Margarita Pournara - Kathimerini

Every year, cities in the United States that have sizable Greek
communities commemorate March 25, Greek Independence Day, with
parades.

In New York City, Fifth Avenue overflows for a few hours with
decorated floats as Greek Americans of all ages in traditional
costumes form a vast procession. The spectators drape themselves in
Greek flags or Greek national soccer team jerseys.

For decades, the trio of history-religion-language has linked Greeks
abroad to their place of origin. But to what extent can names like
Karaiskakis and Androutsos, heroes of the struggle for Greek
independence, inspire young Greek Americans to build an intellectual
and emotional relationship with Greece?

Hellenext

Some of them do not speak a word of Greek; others have one or both
parents of Greek origin, while some never go to church and have no
idea of the Greek struggles for freedom in 1921 and 1940. Who can
imbue the new generation with a sense of Greekness? The answer comes
from Hellenext, an endeavor to put leading figures in the
Greek-American community, such as Michael Dukakis, George
Stephanopoulos, George Genet, John Brandemas and Barbara Spyridon Pope
into contact with fourth- and fifth-generation Greek Americans.

Kathimerini spoke to one of the people who started Hellenext, Leon Stavrou.

He has distinguished credentials. As the membership development
director of AHEPA (the largest association of Greek Americans),
regional marketing manager of the American Chamber of Commerce and
creator of a major network of American and Greek enterprises, who has
also helped win battles for Greece and Cyprus in Congress, he is the
right man in the right position.

"The question we had to answer is how one can help 20-year-olds with
Greek roots who have grown up in America to make a connection with the
Greek cultural heritage. They may never go to Greece, may not speak
Greek, may not be religious, yet still want to understand what being
Greek means. On the other hand, many successful Greek Americans who
are now of mature years feel they want to help the community,"
explained Stavrou. "So we thought that both sides could come into
contact through a website ( www.hellenext.org ) that will introduce them
to each other.

"The young ones will find proper guidance opportunities for work and
study, and feel part of a network that operates not on the theoretical
level but also on the practical level. The older ones will be able to
help the young ones find their way.

"Besides, most of the seniors are in key positions in fields from
research and politics to show business and academia, and they know how
to make use of talent. Just think: What budding journalist wouldn't
like to talk to

George Stephanopoulos? What aspiring politician wouldn't like to meet
Doukakis? I wish I'd had that opportunity when I was 20."

Hellenext is growing slowly but steadily. "First we had to find a team
of eminent personalities from fields who wanted to contribute to the
effort. Then we had to see how to approach young Greeks in America and
later all around the world through the Internet. After that we
organized ways we could help out members, from scholarships to work
experience. So far, we have held two events in which 500 people
participated, and we're doing better every day. Through the Internet
we have contact with 6,000 Greek-American students."

The idea sounds excellent. Why haven't existing diaspora organizations
done something like it in the past? "Those organizations are going
through a difficult phase. They are trying to survive and to deal with
a series of important issues. It's very hard for them to locate
thousands of young Greek Americans and bring them into contact with
each other and help with their future careers. It's also clear that
the mechanisms that keep the members of an ethic community united have
to evolve over time. It's not just the message that is important, but
also how the messenger brings it. Ours is the only Internet-based
program aimed at contacting young people."

Being Greek

What makes the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of migrants feel Greek?

"A certain spirit that I think makes us differ from other ethnic
groups and makes us feel proud. Ethos, passion. Things that typify
many of the Greek Americans who managed not only to survive and get
ahead but also to do extremely well in many fields. Hellenext may give
youngsters chance to gain inspiration, not in the abstract sense of
our national cultural heritage but in how those values are an
intrinsic part of the personalities of many eminent individuals who
come from the Greek-American community.

"If the network does well, then in years to come, today's youth will
give their advice and support to future generations."
