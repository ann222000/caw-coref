I would file it . I like to use nut slotting files but these are costly
might want to take it to a shop.

This is something that is widely discussed so your bound to hear a
multitude of solutions.  I battled with my nut for a while before I
just wound up locking the trem completely.  Nonetheless, whatever you
do, do NOT adjust the nut by filing, chiseling, or whatever until you
are totally certain you have to.  Sometimes trem problems are from
having slots that are too deep.  I learned the hard way with this when
I first started fooling around with filing, totally screwed up my nut
and had to have it replaced.  Start off with the simple solutions like
graphite rubbings from pencil lead, mineral oil, etc.  Also make sure
your setup is correct on the bridge end of your guitar.  Occasionally
the springs are too light or you need an extra one.  If you're getting
the "ping" noises from your nut, then that is main culprit though.

You probably don't have a file that is correct for that job.  It is pretty
easy to wreck the nut if you are using average - joe's tools.

If you don't have a proper nut file you can gently work a thin blade knive
in the slot, which has worked for me.  Also, try a slightly thinner guage
string set.

As Markd said, graphite... a pencil lead.

Best bet is to take it to a pro for a checkup and set up.

The nut slots should only be as deep as half the diameter of the string.
Most factory nuts are way too tall which makes the slots too deep. If your
action is good then you dont want to deepen them. Just widen slightly. The
slots should be round on their bottom though flat will work. What you dont
want is  V shaped.

I totally agree with this one. Start with a little graphite, you can't
screw anything up with that.

take it to a luthier and have him cut you a graphite nut.
if done correctly that ends all the problems and the graphite
nut will last a very long time.  It will slightly darken the
tone but that's ok for most strats.
Either that or have a nice bone nut cut.
The plastic/resin Fender nuts (even on the USA models) are
begging to get replaced with something better. So be done with it
and that is yet another thing not to worry about and have done correctly.

While you're at it - if you like to wank you should also replace
the saddles with Graphtech String Savers.  Nice and easy slide
over the saddles and smooth going.  Easy to do - all you need is
a screwdriver.  Adjust the saddles for string height after the change
and re-intonate.  The Graphtech saddles also make string bending
slightly easier too since they are super slippery (but they hold
the strings perfectly in the saddle groove from moving or wandering laterally).

If you take a guitar in to have a nut cut in Southern Ca. you probably wont
see your guitar for a year. A graphite nut wont last all that long. They're
slippery because they're soft.  They lubricate themselves from coming apart.
I've gotten to where I prefer aluminum or heavy guage copper wire for nut
material over anything else.
The stuff really makes a guitar sing.

I've always liked brass for similar reasons, though I guess it's not
as hard.

R.

I'd try lubrication first. You don't mention it but a slightly lighter
gauge set of strings might fix things, too.

I'm not so sure on that Keith - perhaps theorectically the graphite nuts
might seem to not last as long because they are softer - but because they
are so slippery and have so little friction they actually last a long time.
my 1984 Ibanez Roadstar II still has the original graphite nut it came
with and our luthier is amazed at the nearly zero wear on it - still perfect.
And this is the only guitar that I have that I have the trem unblocked and
use the trem occasionally (and it was used a lot when I first got it and
it was used a lot before I got it).  Nut is still fine and should be good
for another 20 years.  I have my guitars checked twice a year and I'm tellinh
you there is no wear on it. It was cut from the factory low and hasn't opened
up laterally or slipped down lower.  No wear.  really.
Maybe the Japanese made better graphite nuts back in the 80's from
what is made now ??  Not sure about that so maybe _newer_ graphite nuts
are made different ?   Anyways - this MIJ graphite nut is bulletproof
and wank proof.  no binds ever.

I played a guitar (not mine) that had a brass nut on it (along with
brass saddles) and it was certainly a super bright sounding guitar.
Not sure whether this had to do with the brass.
Kinda cool though.  Unique sound.

Possibly both.   It's cheap and easy to apply lubrication; all you need is a
pencil.   Lift the string out of the slot, roll the pencil point in the slot
to grind off a little of the lead (which is graphite, a good lubricant), and
put the string back.   Repeat for the other strings.

Now, connect the guitar to a tuner, and tune a string.  Then, while holding
the bridge down so it can't come up (swing the arm towards the tail and hold
it down), press on the section of that string between the nut and the gear,
and release it.  Recheck the pitch with the tuner.   If it's gone up, the
string is almost certainly sticking in the nut and a little widening with a
needle file would be in order.

If you hear any pinging noises while tuning, it's definitely the nut, and if
lubrication doesn't help, you must widen the slots or use lighter strings.

Note that it's really easy to deepen nut slots to the point where they have
to be re-filled or the nut shimmed, so be very careful!

That "should" is generally inappropriate outside of the "classical" context,
where guitars aren't played with a very heavy touch,  strings are never bent
and vibrato bridges don't exist.

When players bend strings or bash at the guitars, it's entirely possible to
have the string come right out of a half-diameter deep slot.   When a trem
arm is pushed down, out they come.

The player has to stop and move the strings back into the nut, with
accompanying undesirable sounds.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's an accurate assessment only if the guitars are played in the
classical style.

Most electrics aren't.

Hope this helps.

If it's new, have the store finish setting it up.
Strings shouldn't bind in the nut.
