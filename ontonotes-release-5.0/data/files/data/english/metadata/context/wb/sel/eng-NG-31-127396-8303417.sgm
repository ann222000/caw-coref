If I were Musharraf,
I would go shake hands with Iftikhar Chaudhry, and say:
&quot;Hey buddy, congratulations;
PAKISTAN's JUDICIARY IS NOW OF AGE; now
let's heal sohni-DHarTy with the help of the masses.&quot;

This is RAHi

But you didn't explain, what happens if he neither leaves nor gets assassinated. I see him in power even after November. I only see a conspiracy being cooked to assassinate him in December and that's about it. The Picture is very clear for a whole year after that. He rules.

If somehow he doesn't remain in power, I see Pakistan dis-integrating fast and more than half a dozen new countries being carved out of it. Go figuer ...!

Dear All,

BBC TV World News Showed the jubilient crowds of Pakistanis celebrating the re-instatement of the Chief Justice, Iftekhar Chowdhary. They were all shouting GO MUSHARRAF GO.

What is next?

It is true that the supremacy of civil law has once again been established in the country.

But what is in store for Pakistan in the political arena?

Musharraf has stayed in power for eight years by way of two forces, one internal and the other external.

The internal force was his own pesonal popularity with the Pakistani people in view of the large scale corruption, bribery and extortion by two successive regimes which were ostensibly elected governments.

The external force was and still is the unequivocal support both monetary as well as political and military by the GWB White House.

The internal force of local popularity has been weakened by the CJ episode. His opponents have been emboldened. They would want to ride the banwagon of the popular unrest to their own vested interests and would want to dislodge him from power.

If that happens and Musharraf loses power, the support from the US would immediately be re-evaluated (I will not be surprised if that process is already unbderway and alternative plans have been set).

If the next regime in Pakistan, which is either civil or military, continues to tow the American line of anti-terror war, then hopefully, very little will change.

However, if the new regime fails to accomodate the Americans, then, it is fairly certain that Americans will, first of all, attack in the NWFP area with an overwhelming force to wipe out the Al-Quaeda base. That will be easy for them because of their presence in the neighbouring Afghanistan. It is debatable as to how successful will they be in that effort, given the record in Iraq. They will then turn to the nuclear arsenal of Pakistan.

If the democrats come to power in 2008 in the US, their first priority will be to unfang Pakistan of their nuclear arsenal. Barak Obama has already made that clear in one of his speeches. India will, of course, give three cheers to see that happen.

If somehow, Musharraf does stay in power, hopefully, the new emboldened Supreme Court will force the military regime to account for the missing Pakistanis.

However, if I had my say, I would bring that despicable wretch of a DSP Police who manhandled the CJ by holding him by his hair and pushing him down inside the government veicle. He should go to jail for a minimum of twenty years. The Police force in Pakistan thinks and behaves as an instrument of enforcement of the policies of the rulers - a frame of mind set by the British back in the 19th century. They have to be disabused of that role and should be retrained as true public servants.

If Musharraf does stay in power, he will be forced to shed his uniform and fight in a civil election procedure. That might take a period of six months. In all likleihood, he will lose his power as soon as he sheds his uniform and a new general will emerge as the army Chief.

The new elected government, in association with the new forceful and effective judiciary, will be able to reign in the army which has been taking over the Pakistani society like a cancer.

There is though a wild card which I have not discussed in the above scenarios. And that is the religious extremists in the country. It is certain that even in the army general officer corps there are Mullah-Generals. There is all the likelihood of a new Zia-ul-Haq showing up in the ranks.

The Lal Masjid episode has told us that many Madarssas have become full scale arsenals and they are full of misguided enthusiasts who are much too keen to become instant martyrs by becoming suicide bombers.

If a Mullah-General does emerge, and the elected government can come to a deal with him, it will be easier to reign in the religious extremists -- if not, there is all the likelihood of a civil war in the country.

There are two things which have been feeding the religious extremism in Pakistan - a free flow of Saudi money through the undocumented HAWAALA system and the local arms industry in the tribal areas.

As Parvez Hoodbhoy of Quaid-e-Azam UNiversity mentioned in one of his recent articles, even if we make America disappear instantly, the religious extremism from the Pakistani society is not going to disappear overhight.

To control those two phenomena will be a tall order for any new regime in Pakistan.

I am sure other readers/writers will bring in more ideas into this thread.

Thank you for reading.

Sincerely,

Syed-Mohsin Naquvi
