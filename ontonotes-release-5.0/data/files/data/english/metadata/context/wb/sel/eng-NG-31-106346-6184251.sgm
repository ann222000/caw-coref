A girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on a motorcycle
Girl: Slow down. Im scared.

Guy: No this is fun.

Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!

Guy: Then tell me you love me.

Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down!

Guy: Now give me a BIG hug. (Girl hugs him)

Guy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on? Its bugging me.

In the paper the next day: A motorcycle had crashed into a building
because
of break failure. Two people were on the motorcycle, but only one
survived.
The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his
breaks
broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her
say
she loved him, felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his
helmet so she
would live even though it meant he would die.

That makes no fucking sense.  The guy had a couple minutes to mess with his
girlfriend, but he didn't have half a second to disengage the clutch, close
the fuel petcock, and/or kill the engine???  (after which, he could have
partially engaged the clutch to stop the bike)  -Dave

I had occasion once to have a motorcyclist pass me on an exit ramp.
Guy had a full face helmet, girl had none. I stopped by him at the

Well, it does 1/3 of the time:

Excerpt from "Benefits of Safety Belts and Motorcycle Helmets",
Report to Congress February 1996
U.S. Department of Transportation
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

"The study results also showed that motorcycle helmet effectiveness
ranged from 9 percent in preventing any kind of injury to 35 percent in
preventing a fatality. These results confirm previous NHTSA estimates."

"Helmets cannot protect the rider from most types of injuries. But
further analysis of the CODES data, possible because of the linked
medical outcome, showed that motorcycle helmets are 67 percent effective
in preventing brain injuries. Thus, if all motorcyclists had been
wearing helmets, 67 percent of those unhelmeted motorcyclists who
received inpatient care for a brain injury would not have sustained the
brain injury."

Why the hell did she agree to ride on the bike to begin with?

I once rode a bike all over the quiet and deserted streets of
Placentia and Anaheim (OC) when I was 16 and young and dumb and even

today though.

USAF Study done in 195x on helmet design, for one.  I wish I still had my
copy.  If it doesn't fit properly and/or if it's too heavy, a blow to the
front of the helmet will rotate the too-large helmet backwards and snap the
neck.  Or at least injure it.  That's why helmet fit is so important.  Even
bicycle helmet fit.

So wearing a helmet does not increase neck injuries; wearing a helmet
improperly or a too-heavy helmet made in 1950-something increases neck
injuries.

Motorcycle helmet use is MANDATORY for Air Force personnel, whether on
or off duty, regardless of state law (AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 91-207 1-
OCTOBER 1995).

It would seem that the USAF has changed their opinion since 1950-
something.

Under Department of Defense Instruction # 6055.4 July 20, 1999:

E3.2.7.1. The following PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] is mandatory
for all persons ... while operating or riding as a passenger on a
motorcycle or ATV.

E3.2.7.1.1. Helmets. Certified to meet Department of Transportation
(DOT) standards properly fastened under the chin. If stationed outside
CONUS and the host nation does not have an equivalent helmet standard,
the helmet will meet the U.S. Department of Transportation standard.

**********

So, how about a cite from some time this century, or at least the past
fifteen years, indicating increased risk of injury from WEARING a
helmet?

I don't think so.  The booklet to which I referred considered the proper
design and fit of helmets, not whether or not one should be worn.  It was
interesting to note that they found that even a cloth cap or long hair
prevented or mitigated certain types of head injury.

I'm pretty sure the laws of physics haven't changed all that much since the
fifties.  If you wear an improperly-fitting helmet, you can break your neck.
That's still true today.

What, you need an example?  Consider that you are wearing a
properly-fastened but ill-fitting helmet.  You pass under a tree limb just
high enough to snag the front of your helmet, rotating it backward and
slamming the rear part down on your neck with sufficient force to smash one
or more vertebrae.  Had you NOT been wearing a helmet you might have just
gotten a few leaves or twigs stuck in your hair.  Piss-poor example, but
possible.

There are a lot of DOT/Snell-approved helmets that can't possibly fit the
heads of individual wearers -- some people's heads are Arai-shaped, others'
heads are Bell-shaped.  It behooves you to try on a lot of different brands
of helmets to find the brand that fits YOUR head.

Ski boots work the same way.  People with duck feet can't wear Lange boots.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Cite, please.

&gt; &gt;&gt; USAF Study done in 195x on helmet design, for one.  I wish I still had my
&gt; &gt;&gt; copy.  If it doesn't fit properly and/or if it's too heavy, a blow to the

&gt; &gt;&gt; neck.  Or at least injure it.  That's why helmet fit is so important.  Even
&gt; &gt;&gt; bicycle helmet fit.

&gt; &gt; So wearing a helmet does not increase neck injuries; wearing a helmet
&gt; &gt; improperly or a too-heavy helmet made in 1950-something increases neck
&gt; &gt; injuries.

&gt; &gt; Motorcycle helmet use is MANDATORY for Air Force personnel, whether on
&gt; &gt; or off duty, regardless of state law (AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 91-207 1-
&gt; &gt; OCTOBER 1995).

&gt; &gt; It would seem that the USAF has changed their opinion since 1950-
&gt; &gt; something.

&gt; I don't think so.  The booklet to which I referred considered the proper
&gt; design and fit of helmets, not whether or not one should be worn.  It was
&gt; interesting to note that they found that even a cloth cap or long hair
&gt; prevented or mitigated certain types of head injury.

&gt; &gt; Under Department of Defense Instruction # 6055.4 July 20, 1999:

&gt; &gt; E3.2.7.1. The following PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] is mandatory

Since the fifties, helmet materials and design have improved radically.
The AF was still using aluminum shells in the 50's, not fiberglass or
carbon fiber resins at a fraction of the weight.

And if you don't wear a helmet, you are more likely to die, or end up
brain-damaged.  That's backed by NHTSA statistics.

It's theoretically possible, and just one more reason to want manual windows.

The badly-fitting-helmet thing is much more likely to happen than the
seat-belt-drowning thing.

If you're that interested, check with some organizations -- like the
motorcycle police -- that require members to wear helmets.  If you want to
wear your helmet backwards that's fine with me.

What I worry about is yet another generation spouting gibberish like
"helmets will kill you", based on rumor and urban legends, such as
timeOday Dave's "in fact, wearing the helmet increases neck injuries".

I asked for a cite that gives any credence to this nonsense, and none
has been forthcoming.

Frankly, I personally don't really care whether or not a rider wears a
helmet, as long as I don't have to pay for their stupidity through
higher insurance premiums.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wearing a helmet usually does not make the difference between life and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; death.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yup, I didn't want to mention that as too many people who do NOT ride
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; motorcycles would scream BULLSHIT.  But it's true.  In fact, wearing the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; helmet increases neck injuries, some of them fatal.  -Dave

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Cite, please.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; USAF Study done in 195x on helmet design, for one.  I wish I still had my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; copy.  If it doesn't fit properly and/or if it's too heavy, a blow to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; front of the helmet will rotate the too-large helmet backwards and snap the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; neck.  Or at least injure it.  That's why helmet fit is so important.  Even
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bicycle helmet fit.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So wearing a helmet does not increase neck injuries; wearing a helmet
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; improperly or a too-heavy helmet made in 1950-something increases neck
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; injuries.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Motorcycle helmet use is MANDATORY for Air Force personnel, whether on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; or off duty, regardless of state law (AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 91-207 1-
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; OCTOBER 1995).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It would seem that the USAF has changed their opinion since 1950-
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't think so.  The booklet to which I referred considered the proper
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; design and fit of helmets, not whether or not one should be worn.  It was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; interesting to note that they found that even a cloth cap or long hair
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; prevented or mitigated certain types of head injury.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Under Department of Defense Instruction # 6055.4 July 20, 1999:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; E3.2.7.1. The following PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] is mandatory
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for all persons ... while operating or riding as a passenger on a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; motorcycle or ATV.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; E3.2.7.1.1. Helmets. Certified to meet Department of Transportation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (DOT) standards properly fastened under the chin. If stationed outside
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; CONUS and the host nation does not have an equivalent helmet standard,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the helmet will meet the U.S. Department of Transportation standard.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, how about a cite from some time this century, or at least the past
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fifteen years, indicating increased risk of injury from WEARING a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; helmet?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure the laws of physics haven't changed all that much since the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fifties.  If you wear an improperly-fitting helmet, you can break your neck.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That's still true today.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Since the fifties, helmet materials and design have improved radically.
&gt;&gt; &gt; The AF was still using aluminum shells in the 50's, not fiberglass or
&gt;&gt; &gt; carbon fiber resins at a fraction of the weight.

&gt;&gt; &gt; And if you don't wear a helmet, you are more likely to die, or end up
&gt;&gt; &gt; brain-damaged.  That's backed by NHTSA statistics.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What, you need an example?  Consider that you are wearing a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; properly-fastened but ill-fitting helmet.  You pass under a tree limb just
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; high enough to snag the front of your helmet, rotating it backward and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slamming the rear part down on your neck with sufficient force to smash one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or more vertebrae.  Had you NOT been wearing a helmet you might have just
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gotten a few leaves or twigs stuck in your hair.  Piss-poor example, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; possible.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Which, of course, has nothing to do with whether or not a helmet is worn
&gt;&gt; &gt; at all. Don't make up a straw-man about killer tree branches.  You won't
&gt;&gt; &gt; wear a helmet because it MIGHT not fit properly?

&gt;&gt; NONONONONONONONO!  I always wear a helmet AND it fits right.  I see people
&gt;&gt; thinking they're safe because they're wearing a helmet on the back of their
&gt;&gt; head or with the straps unfastened or backwards (yes, I actually saw that)
&gt;&gt; and figure that their brains probably AREN'T worth saving.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So, once again, present a citation that more people are injured by
&gt;&gt; &gt; wearing helmets than are killed or injured by NOT wearing them.

&gt;&gt; I never said that at all.  I said it's possible for a helmet to kill you,
&gt;&gt; which is true.

&gt;&gt; Don't you have better things to worry about?

&gt; What I worry about is yet another generation spouting gibberish like
&gt; &quot;helmets will kill you&quot;, based on rumor and urban legends, such as
&gt; timeOday Dave's &quot;in fact, wearing the helmet increases neck injuries&quot;.
">

Didn't you learn the difference between "can" and "will" in school?  There
is one, you know.  Really.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I asked for a cite that gives any credence to this nonsense, and none
&gt; has been forthcoming.

&gt; Frankly, I personally don't really care whether or not a rider wears a
&gt; helmet, as long as I don't have to pay for their stupidity through
&gt; higher insurance premiums.
">

The AMA (find your own damn URL) a number of years ago quoted a study that
indicated that automobile drivers had as many serious head injuries per
capita (yeahyeahyeah, I know, one head per person) as motorcyclists and were
as likely to be uninsured likewise, but there's no big whining campaign to
make drivers wear helmets out of civic responsibility.

Are we finished yet?

Even under water the electric windows should work for a short time.  I've
seen pictures of cars underwater with their headlights still working.
The remote possibility of being in a car in the water is not much of
a reason to want manual windows.  I mean, fine if it worries you, but
it's really low on my list of things to worry about.

First and only time I drove with one uncle, I fastened my seatbelt.
They were uncommon then.  We were going to get a case of beer.
He looked at me and said, "What the hell you doing?"
I said, "I always wear it."
He said, almost shouting at me, like he never heard anything so
stupid, "And what you gonna do if you go in the river!?!?"

&gt; &gt;&gt; head or with the straps unfastened or backwards (yes, I actually saw that)
&gt; &gt;&gt; and figure that their brains probably AREN'T worth saving.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, once again, present a citation that more people are injured by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wearing helmets than are killed or injured by NOT wearing them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I never said that at all.  I said it's possible for a helmet to kill you,
&gt; &gt;&gt; which is true.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Don't you have better things to worry about?

&gt; &gt; What I worry about is yet another generation spouting gibberish like
&gt; &gt; &quot;helmets will kill you&quot;, based on rumor and urban legends, such as
&gt; &gt; timeOday Dave's &quot;in fact, wearing the helmet increases neck injuries&quot;.

&gt; Didn't you learn the difference between &quot;can&quot; and &quot;will&quot; in school?  There
&gt; is one, you know.  Really.

&gt; &gt; I asked for a cite that gives any credence to this nonsense, and none
&gt; &gt; has been forthcoming.

&gt; &gt; Frankly, I personally don't really care whether or not a rider wears a
&gt; &gt; helmet, as long as I don't have to pay for their stupidity through
&gt; &gt; higher insurance premiums.

&gt; The AMA (find your own damn URL) a number of years ago quoted a study that
&gt; indicated that automobile drivers had as many serious head injuries per
&gt; capita (yeahyeahyeah, I know, one head per person) as motorcyclists and were
&gt; as likely to be uninsured likewise,
">

I did learn what a proper citation looks like, and that's far from it.
"The AMA a number of years ago quoted a study" is equivalent to "a
friend of a friend".

&gt; but there's no big whining campaign to
&gt; make drivers wear helmets out of civic responsibility.

My car came standard with side curtain airbags for that reason.
I do believe that cars should have the option of 5-point harnesses
instead of just shoulder/lap belts.

Driving into the water worries you?  How often does that happen?

Okay, let's say it does...

If you open the windows, water will rush in and splash you in the
face.

If not, water will slowly seep in, during which time you can breathe
and unbuckle your seat belt.

Either way, you won't be able to open the door until the car is full
of water.

WHEN it's full, you can open the door and get out.

The difference is-- with open windows it happens really fast and
you're caught off-guard.

With closed windows, you have time to think (yeah, or panic), but
still, to BREATHE, and then to escape.
