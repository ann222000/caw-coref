Has anyone tried chelation therapy for whatever purpose and known how
it works?  I read it somewhere that it can help clean the blood.  Once
the blood is cleaned, the blood flow will be made smoother and many
illnesses may disappear or become less severe.

Sounds simple?

It is used to treat lead poisoning in kids. It removes lead from the blood.

It's the kidneys that clean the blood. Chelation doesn't.

The NIH is conducting a very large multi center study on IV EDTA for
cardiovascular related concerns.

As to cleaning the blood, it tends to remove heavy metals.

I recommend you speak to a doctor at a clinic that offers such services and see
if their is some potential for what concerns you.  The statement you made &quot;many
illnesses may disappear or become less severe&quot; is way too generalized.

Personally, I've had a heart attack and have had about 40+ IV EDTA treatments
because the potential was promising, I have a local clinic, and for me the cost
was not significant.  I had no angina so I cannot say it lowered mine but it has
for many of the people I've talked with in the clinic.  You get to spend 4 hours
or so sitting and talking in each IV session so you get to know people.  I've
seen a few personal outcomes that &quot;might&quot; be related.  Fasting blood glucose has
gone down and blood pressure is lower for a while after a session and standing
pulse rate has dropped 10 points while cardiac variability has improved.

As to safety, it is a very safe procedure, just time consuming.

And yet, the NIH is still conducting a large multi center multi year multi
million dollar study.

Again, the procedure is very safe and far far far safer than say angioplasty
which doesn't decrease mortality over medication alone.

Richard Russell is apparently shilling gold; that's not apt to be sound
economic advice that fits all investors.  I'm afraid he doesn't have the
qualifications or reputation to be &quot;the great American financial
analyst.&quot;  Probably gold is the closest he's come to heavy metal
poisoning.

Garlic is not a chelating substance. This usually requires free form
amino acids that can bond to the metals and make them larger particles
so the kidneys can detect and filter them.

The main question a person should ask themself is do I have toxic
heavy metals stored in my body and if so which ones and how much. You
can find the answer to that question by being tested with a provoked
urine test. You can also find out what essential elements you may be
low on if you pay extra. Here are the people that know how to test:

If you have toxic metals in your body, it is because they don't
excrete in your urine. Testng for them in urine is a waste of money.

I am glad I 'wasted' my money because now I have a chart showing which
metals and how much. I now take cuprimine to chealte the excessive

Janice, where are toxic metals excreted once they are chelated? You
say urine testing is not an indicator of toxic metals? The procedure I
went throuh required me to take DSMA pills for 3 days to chelate
metals in my body and then have the urine tested to show the results.
My lithium levels were very very low, for example, and this was later
confirmed with blood testing. Other metals, like lead, do not stay
circulating in the blood so blood testing is useless. If you want to
argue your beliefs on how to test for toxic heavy metals start with
the certified medical doctors at http://www.abctm.org .
