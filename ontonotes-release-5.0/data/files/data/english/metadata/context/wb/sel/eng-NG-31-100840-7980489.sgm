Communication theory posits that there is a sender, receiver, and
information transmited for communication to take place.

If any of these components is missing, communication does not take place.

Re-posting a message does not contain any new information, so it is a
waste of time and bandwidth.

I guess you never passed any courses in communications theory, did you?

Never heard of redundancy I take it?

Abstract:

Any human communication has intrinsic objectives, to reach maximum
communication efficiency and dependability.

Because of &quot;equivocation&quot; and &quot;noise,&quot; these absolute maximums are
unobtainable; only relative maximums are possible. Based on Shannon's
information theory principles, various information terms and different
forms of &quot;redundancy&quot; are discussed to expound the optimal ratio
between input and redundancy which is prerequisite to reaching the
relative maximums of efficiency and dependability.

The merits and deficiencies of information theory in communication
and learning research are examined.

The conclusion is that information theory, because of its simplicity
and universality, may be one of the best instruments for the
development of a general, systematic communication-and-learning
theory.

Redundancy, in its many forms, is seen as the best device to reduce
equivocation and the effects of noise.

Information theory differentiates error and equivocation (i.e., error
by projection and error by omission) which are of different origins
and natures and which may be capable of explaining many communication
and learning phenomena such as the relative efficiency of different
media.
