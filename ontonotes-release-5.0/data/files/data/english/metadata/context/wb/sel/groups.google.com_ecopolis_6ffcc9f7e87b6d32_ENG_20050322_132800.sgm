-------------------------------------------------------------
Environment and development ministers meet for the first time
-------------------------------------------------------------

The world's richest nations agreed March 18 to tackle climate change in
Africa and illegal logging. According to a press release from the
University of Toronto Group of Eight (G8) Information Centre, the
agreements came from the first-ever meeting of G8 environment and
development ministers, held in the Derby, England, March 17-18. The G8
includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the
United States and Russia.

On the impact of climate change on Africa, the ministers noted that
African countries are particularly vulnerable to climate variability
and climate change and, like many developing countries, are already
experiencing more dangerous climate effects.

They also discussed the urgent need to help Africa reduce vulnerability
by building resilience to climate variability and developing the
capacity to adapt to climate change.

&quot;It is disturbing that scientists tell us that climate change will
mean Africa can expect more frequent droughts and more serious
floods,&quot; said Margaret Beckett, United Kingdom secretary of state for
environment, food and rural affairs. The United Kingdom holds the G8
presidency in 2005.

&quot;This will severely affect farming, health and infrastructure,
undermining efforts to tackle Africa's poverty,&quot; she added.

On illegal logging, the ministers agreed to tackle supply of and demand
for illegal timber by taking steps to halt the import and marketing of
illegally logged timber and doing more to support developing countries'
own efforts to enforce forest law and improve governance.

The ministers agreed to review progress on these commitments next year
and discussed how G8 members could support timber-producing and
timber-exporting countries' efforts to implement domestic reforms.

G8 Environment and Development Ministers Agree Action on Illegal
Logging and Put Climate Change in Africa on Agenda for G8 Heads

Derby, [England,] March 18, 2005

The world's richest nations agreed today to implement measures to
tackle climate change in Africa and illegal logging.

Margaret Beckett, UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs and Hilary Benn, UK Secretary of State for International
Development agreed actions where G8 members could make a real
difference to tackle illegal logging and addressed the impact of
climate change on Africa's development. This came out of the first-ever
meeting of G8 Environment and Development Ministers, held in Derbyshire
under the UK Government's Presidency of the Group of Eight Countries.

On the impact of climate change on Africa, Ministers:

* noted that African countries are particularly vulnerable to climate
variability and climate change and, like many developing countries, are
already experiencing more dangerous climate effects.

* discussed the urgent need to assist Africa to reduce vulnerability by
building resilience to climate variability and by developing capacity
to adapt to climate change

* committed to supporting the need for an effective international
response to build scientific capacity and integrate measures to address
the impact of climate change in international development assistance
and national development plans.

Margaret Beckett said:

'It is disturbing that scientists tell us that climate change will mean
Africa can expect more frequent droughts and more serious floods. This
will severely affect farming, health and infrastructure, undermining
efforts to tackle Africa's poverty. Our discussions today represent a
significant step forward in tackling the growing problem of climate
change and will help to save lives. I am particularly encouraged by the
growing engagement of development and finance Ministers in recognising
the impact of climate change, this greatest of global threats.'

In reaching their conclusions, Ministers discussed a specially
commissioned report, 'Climate proofing Africa' which outlined what
little is known about the impact of climate change on development and
poverty in Africa; the weaknesses of the African network for observing
the climate; the lack of scientific and technical capacity; and what
more needs to be done to help &quot;climate proof&quot; Africa's development.

Mrs Beckett added:

'Today the UK announced that we are committing a further £100K towards
regional predictions of climate change for Africa and £400K over the
next three years towards a new multi-country initiative on advancing
knowledge, capacity and networks in support of climate change in
Africa.

The priority for Africa must be to reduce its vulnerability to existing
extremes of climate and to prepare it for longer-term effects in
future. This means helping Africa to build its climate monitoring
capacity and improving the way we manage climate risks in development.'

On illegal logging, Ministers agreed to tackle both the supply of and
demand for illegal timber by:

* taking steps to halt the import and marketing of illegally logged
timber, for example through border control and voluntary bilateral
agreements;

* doing more to support developing countries' own efforts to enforce
forest law and improve governance;

* using government procurement to ensure that governments do not
contribute to the problem of illegal logging; and

* reviewing progress on these commitments next year.

Hilary Benn said:

'This is a very important agreement. Illegal logging is a problem
shared by those producing and exporting timber and timber products and
those that import them. Tackling illegal logging will enable the
poorest countries to manage their forests better, reduce poverty and
protect natural resources. It does not make sense to give development
assistance on the one hand while importing cheap illegal timber on the
other. The UK is also delighted today with the support shown by our G8
partners to practical action, so that we can try to improve people's
livelihoods and stop further damage to the environment.'

Ministers discussed how G8 members could support timber producing and
exporting countries to implement domestic reforms. They also discussed
how G8 countries must ensure that, as major importers of timber, their
own policies supported good practice.

Ministers agreed to look at what action they could take to prevent
illegally logged timber from entering their markets including
preventing the import of illegally logged timber through voluntary
partnership agreements with timber producing countries.

Ministers also looked at what governments could do as consumers of
timber and timber products, particularly implementing or extending
public procurement policies that discriminate against illegally logged
timber.

Hilary Benn added:

'Attacking poverty and managing the environment are key goals of the UK
international development programme. Forests play an important role in
meeting those goals -- but illegal logging directly undermines them.
The UK central government has already set an example by seeking to buy
timber only from legal sources -- and today DEFRA is announcing over
half a million pounds over three years, to extend guidance on legal
timber procurement to the wider public sector, and to share our
knowledge on procurement with the G8 and other countries.

We are also going to support producer countries, particularly those in
west and central Africa. Today DEFRA is also granting £1 million for
forestry biodiversity projects under the Darwin Initiative. We will
continue to support the innovative EU scheme that will deny access to
EU markets for illegally harvested timber.

Ministers also welcomed the recently published Commission for Africa
Report, and discussed proposals to reform the humanitarian aid process
and the importance of biodiversity in sustainable livelihoods....
