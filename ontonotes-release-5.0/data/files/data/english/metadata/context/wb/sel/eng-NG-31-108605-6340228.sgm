OTSMN - my great uncle probably witnessed last U-boat sinkings of WW2

My Mom started going through her mother's letters, many of which were
written by my grandmother's brother, a merchant mariner. He ended up
effectively in the British merchant marine when WW2 started.

In one letter, not fully transcribed, he describes a Norwegian ship being
sunk, and then a progression of depth charging by destroyer(s). The
identifying feature is that we (the family) also know that at the time he
was doing local convoys around the UK, as opposed to earlier in the war, and
that the sinking happened after the end of the war (as he described it).

My best guess is that he is referring to D/S Sneland I
( http://www.warsailors.com/singleships/snelandI.html ), torpedoed along with
S/S Avondale Park May 7 1945, part of convoy EN91, by U-2336 under Emil
Klusmeier ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Klusmeier ).

With the sole exception that my great-uncle must have meant that the order
had gone out to U-boats to cease and desist, not that the war was officially
over, I am 95% certain that he must have been in EN91 on that date.

I have had no luck discovering the composition of EN91. I suspect also that
it's likely that it would be possible to find out ship's articles that would
pin down whether or not that is the convoy he meant. Any sources people know
of?

Did this letter from your Great Uncle have a date?  The Avondale Park
was sunk on May 7, 1945.

While not directly related to the EN convoy, I recommend a book called
"Convoy" by Martin Middlebrook, published 1976.  It's a good write up
of two convoy groups (HX.229 &amp; SC.122)  from the U.S. that faced 41
UBoats.  Some 21 ships were sunk.   The author has many first-person
stories from the merchantmen and sailors (both sides).   Just a good
book if one wanted to learn more about what your great-uncle may have
experienced.

Be proud of your Great-Uncle, he and his shipmates saw a side of war
most know nothing about.  Good luck in your research.

The letter has a date, yes. :-) But I believe not the event date precisely.
What we have to go on boils down to roughly what I described.  I think my
detective work was reasonable; but crew lists for the ships in the convoy
would almost 100% confirm my guess.

I have it. My flyleaf date indicates I bought it in 1978, in paperback. It's
pretty much falling apart.

I agree with the book recommendation. It's a great read. In general I am
well supplied with books that describe the Battle of the Atlantic, both from
the escort standpoint, the U-boat standpoint, and some that touch on the
Merchant Marine, but unless a specific convoy is described (as with "Convoy"
by Middlebrook) , it's a bit of work for me to figure out a convoy's
composition.

Another book recommendation I have is "Kriegsmarine U-Boats 1939-45", by
Chris Bishop, Amber Books, 2006. It's a very nice reference, and an easy
read. Because of the huge amount of information it attempts to summarize, it
is able only to confirm that U-2336 did an operational patrol in the correct
time span, sinking 2 ships.

"On the Triangle Run', by James B. Lamb, MacMillan, 1986, is another good
read about the Battle of the North Atlantic. Not highly technical, but a
good fireside book.

I am pretty proud of the old guy. He ended out his days in Edinburgh at a
seaman's home, and used to write me postcards. He was hardcore merchie,
serving as such before, during and after WW2. We're exceptionally lucky that
letters to both his sisters were preserved; not only is it a precious bit of
family history but it's also raw history of wider interest.

He confirms, incidentally, things that were touched upon by Middlebrook. The
hiring system, the loneliness of merchant mariners who couldn't go home in
WW2, and the difficulty one faced when deciding what ship to sign on with
for a convoy. One of his anecdotes describes him really, really not wanting
to go on a certain ship, until he was persuaded to do so by the chief
engineer who already knew him as a reliable lad. Another describes being
laid up in Mombasa sick with malaria for about 3 months, and he beomans the
fact that in English Africa at the time, if you were European, you were
expected to meet certain standards, which wasn't so easy to do for a seaman
not being paid.

One does end up with a great deal of respect for military historians who
work with these personal accounts as an important part of their sources.
Very typically the material is not intended to delight a future historian,
and in many cases the wartime merchant seaman was badly informed
(deliberately so) about quite a few details not relevant to his specific
job.

Avondale Park was one of a class of widely (if not mass) produced cargo ships
that Canadian yards could handle. My father-in-law sailed in them when he was
a merchant mariner.

Well it certainly sound like you know what you're doing AFA as
research.  I did find a book on Amazon that covers ALL the North
Atlantic convoys, but sadly it appears to ignore the local convoys
and  the one's bound for Russia/Med/Africa.

My interest in the subject comes in the roundabout way as I used be be
on a submarine back in the 70s (SSBN type) and became interested in
the history of them.  Then I started playing a game called "Silent
Hunter" that is a u-boat simulation, which then led into reseaching
the convoy's that often were the "prey" for the game. Hence I just
finished the book "Convoy".

Anyway, good luck on the research,  I just never stop being amazed at
all the true stories of WWII.  A remarkable time.

I do some volunteer work for Disabled American Veterans where I drive
a van to the regional VA hospital.  Next time I drive I think I'll ask
if anyone has some convoy stories.

It's not often considered but the Germans learned to convoy pretty fast too.

In WW1 British submarines in the Baltic significantly affected German
imports of Swedish iron ore, and by 1917 merchant shipping in the Baltic was
convoyed. There were never very many E-boats, and later C-class,  in the
Baltic (they started arriving in 1914), but the German High Seas Fleet lost
the freedom to think of the Baltic as their own sea, and as I mentioned,
Swedish imports of iron were affected.

http://www.naval-history.net/WW1CampaignsBaltic.htm

The Germans ended up doing the same at times in WW2 in the Baltic, albeit
for different reasons. For most of that war they had complete control of
those waters. But near the end, when evacuations started, and the Russians
got more active, between January '44 and May '45 over 400,000 civilians and
wounded military were evacuated by the Kriegsmarine under fierce attack from
the Baltics and eastern Germany. Much of this was done under a convoy
system.

There was good reason to do it. The Wilhelm Gustloff
( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Gustloff_(Schiff )) is by far the worst
loss of life disaster in nautical history, with an estimated 9300 dead. Most
were civilians. Russian submarine S-13 torpedoed her on January 30, 1945,
and the commander of the submarine (a certain Marinesko) surely knew what he
was sinking. But Russians being what Russians are...

However, the Germans did use convoys themselves, including their own coastal
movements in the North Sea or getting up to Norway. It was pretty much only
the Americans who clued in slow, only getting smart after the second Happy
Time in WW2 off the US coast.

I have no idea what the Japanese did in response to American fleet boats in
WW2. Did they convoy? They must have done so to some extent.

From reading O'Kane, they did try convoys and they were not terribly
successful at it. TANG fairly ripped apart some by getting in among them --
not pretty.

The japanese used convoy systems - both the army and the navy. A major
problem was lack of decent escorts. Many of the war-built escorts were
slower and less-armed than the US submarines. Furthermore, at night
the lack of decent radar and turn of speed made things even
worse. There was also no doctrine to speak of, and lastly, the air
cover was abysmal. Most aircraft used, like the B5N Kate witted with
metric radar, were patrol only, with little offensive capability. The
radars were of low quality compared to equivalent Allied sets. Other
dedicated aircraft, like the Kyushu Q1W Lorna, had only one or two
anti-submarine bombs, no offensive guns (mostly), and a magnetic
detection system because the ASW radar was not developed in
time. Plus, always too few planes, and way too late. It is thought,
wishfully maybe, that Lornas sank or helped in the sinking of 3 US
subs in 1945.
