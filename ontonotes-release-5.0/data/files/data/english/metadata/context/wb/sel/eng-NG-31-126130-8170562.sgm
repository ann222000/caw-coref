The Washington Post
Why Bush Will Be A Winner

By William Kristol
Sunday, July 15, 2007; B01

I suppose I'll merely expose myself to harmless ridicule if I make the
following assertion: George W. Bush's presidency will probably be a
successful one.

Let's step back from the unnecessary mistakes and the self-inflicted
wounds that have characterized the Bush administration. Let's look at
the broad forest rather than the often unlovely trees. What do we see?
First, no second terrorist attack on U.S. soil -- not something we
could have taken for granted. Second, a strong economy -- also
something that wasn't inevitable.

And third, and most important, a war in Iraq that has been very
difficult, but where -- despite some confusion engendered by an almost
meaningless &quot;benchmark&quot; report last week -- we now seem to be on
course to a successful outcome.

The economy first: After the bursting of the dot-com bubble, followed
by the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, we've had more than five years of
steady growth, low unemployment and a stock market recovery. Did this
just happen? No. Bush pushed through the tax cuts of 2001 and
especially 2003 by arguing that they would produce growth. His
opponents predicted dire consequences. But the president was
overwhelmingly right. Even the budget deficit, the most universally
criticized consequence of the tax cuts, is coming down and is lower
than it was when the 2003 supply-side tax cuts were passed.

Bush has also (on the whole) resisted domestic protectionist pressures
(remember the Democratic presidential candidates in 2004 complaining
about outsourcing?), thereby helping sustain global economic growth.

The year 2003 also featured a close congressional vote on Bush's other
major first-term initiative, the Medicare prescription drug benefit.
Liberals denounced it as doing nothing for the elderly; conservatives
worried that it would bust the budget. Experts of all stripes foresaw
great challenges in its implementation. In fact, it has all gone
surprisingly smoothly, providing broad and welcome coverage for
seniors and coming in under projected costs.

So on the two biggest pieces of domestic legislation the president has
gotten passed, he has been vindicated. And with respect to the two
second-term proposals that failed -- private Social Security accounts
and immigration -- I suspect that something similar to what Bush
proposed will end up as law over the next several years.

Meanwhile, 2005-06 saw the confirmation of two Supreme Court nominees,
John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr. Your judgment of these two
appointments will depend on your general view of the courts and the
Constitution. But even if you're a judicial progressive, you have to
admit that Roberts and Alito are impressive judges (well, you don't
have to admit it -- but deep down, you know it). And if you're a
conservative constitutionalist, putting Roberts and Alito on the court
constitutes a huge accomplishment.

What about terrorism? Apart from Iraq, there has been less of it, here
and abroad, than many experts predicted on Sept. 12, 2001. So Bush and
Vice President Cheney probably are doing some important things right.
The war in Afghanistan has gone reasonably well.

Western Pakistan, where President Pervez Musharraf's deals with the
Taliban are apparently creating something like havens for terrorists,
is an increasing problem. That's why our intelligence agencies are
worried about a resurgent al-Qaeda -- because al-Qaeda may once again
have a place where it can plan, organize and train. These Waziristan
havens may well have to be dealt with in the near future. I assume
Bush will deal with them, using some combination of air strikes and
special operations.

As for foreign policy in general, it has mostly been the usual mixed
bag. We've deepened our friendships with Japan and India; we've had
better outcomes than expected in the two largest Latin American
countries, Mexico and Brazil; and we've gotten friendlier governments
than expected in France and Germany. China is stable. There has been
slippage in Russia. The situation with North Korea is bad but
containable.

But wait, wait, wait: What about Iraq? It's Iraq, stupid -- you (and
65 percent of your fellow Americans) say -- that makes Bush an
unsuccessful president.

Not necessarily. First of all, we would have to compare the situation
in Iraq now, with all its difficulties and all the administration's
mistakes, with what it would be if we hadn't gone in. Saddam Hussein
would be alive and in power and, I dare say, victorious, with the
United States (and the United Nations) by now having backed off
sanctions and the no-fly zone. He might well have restarted his
nuclear program, and his connections with al-Qaeda and other terrorist
groups would be intact or revived and even strengthened.

Still, that's speculative, and the losses and costs of the war are
real. Bush is a war president, and war presidents are judged by
whether they win or lose their war. So to be a successful president,
Bush has to win in Iraq.

Which I now think we can. Indeed, I think we will. In late 2006, I
didn't think we would win, as Bush stuck with the failed
Rumsfeld-Abizaid-Casey strategy of &quot;standing down&quot; as the Iraqis were
able to &quot;stand up,&quot; based on the mistaken theory that if we had a
&quot;small footprint&quot; in Iraq, we'd be more successful. With the new
counterinsurgency strategy announced on Jan. 10, backed up by the
troop &quot;surge,&quot; I think the odds are finally better than 50-50 that we
will prevail. We are routing al-Qaeda in Iraq, we are beginning to
curb the Iranian-backed sectarian Shiite militias and we are
increasingly able to protect more of the Iraqi population.

If we sustain the surge for a year and continue to train Iraqi troops
effectively, we can probably begin to draw down in mid- to late 2008.
The fact is that military progress on the ground in Iraq in the past
few months has been greater than even surge proponents like me
expected, and political progress is beginning to follow. Iran is a
problem, and we will have to do more to curb Tehran's meddling -- but
we can. So if we keep our nerve here at home, we have a good shot at
achieving a real, though messy, victory in Iraq.

But can Bush maintain adequate support at home? Yes. It would help if
the administration would make its case more effectively and less
apologetically. It would help if Bush had more aides who believed in
his policy, who understood that the war is winnable and who didn't
desperately want to get back in (or stay in) the good graces of the
foreign policy establishment.

But Bush has the good fortune of having finally found his Ulysses S.
Grant, or his Creighton Abrams, in Gen. David H. Petraeus. If the
president stands with Petraeus and progress continues on the ground,
Bush will be able to prevent a sellout in Washington. And then he
could leave office with the nation on course to a successful (though
painful and difficult) outcome in Iraq. With that, the rest of the
Middle East, where so much hangs in the balance, could start to tip in
the direction of our friends and away from the jihadists, the mullahs
and the dictators.

Following through to secure the victory in Iraq and to extend its
benefits to neighboring countries will be the task of the next
president. And that brings us to Bush's final test.

The truly successful American presidents tend to find vindication in,
and guarantee an extension of their policies through, the election of
a successor from their own party. Can Bush hand the presidency off to
a Republican who will (broadly) continue along the path of his
post-9/11 foreign policy, nominate judges who solidify a Roberts-Alito
court, make his tax cuts permanent and the like?

Sure. Even at Bush's current low point in popularity, the leading GOP
presidential candidates are competitive in the polls with Democratic
Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. Furthermore, one great
advantage of the current partisan squabbling in Washington is that
while it hurts Bush, it also damages the popularity of the Democratic
Congress-- where both Clinton and Obama serve. A little mutual assured
destruction between the Bush administration and Congress could leave
the Republican nominee, who will most likely have no affiliation with
either, in decent shape.

And what happens when voters realize in November 2008 that, if they
choose a Democrat for president, they'll also get a Democratic
Congress and therefore liberal Supreme Court justices? Many Americans
will recoil from the prospect of being governed by an unchecked
triumvirate of Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. So the
chances of a Republican winning the presidency in 2008 aren't bad.

What it comes down to is this: If Petraeus succeeds in Iraq, and a
Republican wins in 2008, Bush will be viewed as a successful
president.

I like the odds.

Steve,
Are you like Kristol?  Have you no shame?  Why post that garbage here?  Of

&gt; choose a Democrat for president, they'll also get a Democratic
&gt; Congress and therefore liberal Supreme Court justices? Many Americans
&gt; will recoil from the prospect of being governed by an unchecked
&gt; triumvirate of Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. So the
&gt; chances of a Republican winning the presidency in 2008 aren't bad.

&gt; What it comes down to is this: If Petraeus succeeds in Iraq, and a
&gt; Republican wins in 2008, Bush will be viewed as a successful
&gt; president.

&gt; I like the odds.

US intel says Al-Qaida's threat has increased
By ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON

Al-Qaida is using its growing strength in Pakistan and Iraq to plot
attacks on U.S. soil, heightening the terror threat facing the United
States over the next few years, US intelligence agencies say.

At the same time, intelligence analysts worry that international
cooperation against terrorism will be hard to sustain as memories of the
Sept. 11,2001, attacks on the United States fade and nations' views
diverge on what the real threat is.

In the National Intelligence Estimate prepared for President George W.
Bush and other top policymakers, analysts laid out a range of dangers -
al-Qaida, Lebanese Hizbullah, non-Muslim radical groups - that pose a
&quot;persistent and evolving threat&quot; to the country over the next three years.

Ohh Patrick. You are such a fool.

If you explore the polls a little you'll see that Republicans in congress
have a higher unfavoribility than Democrats by about 10 points. But then you

filed in the Patrick's bullshit assertions with no proof file.

Approval of Congress lowest in a decade
Only about a quarter of Americans approve of how it's doing its job, a
poll shows; most see 'business as usual.'
By Noam N. Levey, Times Staff Writer
June 12, 2007

WASHINGTON - Fueled by disappointment at the pace of change since
Democrats assumed the majority on Capitol Hill, public approval of
Congress has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade,
according to a new Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll.

Just 27% of Americans now approve of the way Congress is doing its
job, the poll found, down from 36% in January, when Democrats assumed
control of the House and the Senate.

And 63% of Americans say that the new Democratic Congress is governing
in a &quot;business as usual&quot; manner, rather than working to bring the
fundamental change that party leaders promised after November's
midterm election.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the first woman to hold
that position, has also failed to impress many Americans. Only 36%
approve of the way she is handling the job, the poll found.

In contrast, 46% of Americans in the current poll said they approved
of the way Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia handled the job after he
led the GOP into the majority in 1994.

The poll also found continued public unhappiness with President Bush,
whose approval ratings have been stuck below 40% since last year.

Public disappointment with Congress swelled before Republicans lost
power in November. Democrats swept in on promises to end the war and
tackle a host of popular domestic issues, including raising the
minimum wage, reducing prices on prescription drugs, promoting stem
cell research and ending corruption.

Although some Democratic initiatives have passed the House, few have
won passage in the Senate, where the party has held the majority by
one vote.

Bush and his Capitol Hill allies have thus far managed to block every
Democratic attempt to force a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq,
much to the chagrin of Democrats around the country.

&quot;They just haven't seemed to have gathered things together the way
they should,&quot; said Martha Wilde, 81, a Democrat from Remer, Minn., who
said she had been particularly disappointed in congressional
Democrats' lack of progress confronting the Bush administration over
the war.

&quot;I think they should force them more,&quot; Wilde said.

A third of liberal Democrats, who constitute the party's base, approve
of the job Congress is doing; 58% disapprove, the poll found.

That's a dramatic change from January, when a Los Angeles Times/
Bloomberg poll found that 43% of liberal Democrats approved of the job
Congress was doing and 36% disapproved.

Representatives of Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-
Nev.) said Democrats were undeterred by the public's anger.

&quot;The American people are rightly frustrated with the ongoing war in
Iraq, and Democrats will continue to work with Republicans to force
the president to change direction in Iraq so our troops can come home
and we can refocus our efforts on fighting terrorism,&quot; said Pelosi
spokesman Nadeam Elshami.

The poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday; 1,183 adults were
surveyed by telephone. The margin of error was plus or minus 3
percentage points.

The reason people are not happy with Congress right now is that they are
not doing enough to stand up to Bush.  I can not even imagine why anyone
on the right would hold these numbers up as something positive.

If I were polled right now I would voice disapproval of this Congress,
at this point, as well.  That certainly doesn't mean I am a conservative
or a Bushie.

Someone PLEASE explain to me why people keep repeating this mantra... we
have terrorist attacks on our citizens nearly every day... does it
matter if it's on our soil?  More Americans have been killed since 9/11
by terrorists than on 9/11.  This is considered an accomplishment how?
Because they were killed overseas instead of here?  Absurd!

What you say is technically true.  It's also technically true that the
military death rate during the 1990s resulting from military accidents
and other means was also greater than has been the military death rate
from the Iraq War.  When just comparing Bush's first term with
Clinton's first term, total military deaths from all means including
combat was 4,302 during Clinton's first term and 5,187 during Bush's
first term.  Joining the military is a dangerous undertaking,
especially when we're at war, but even when we're not at war.

The  fact that we haven't been attacked on our soil spells
accomplishment, it means the war is not being fought over here, and
make no mistake about it... if the war wasn't being fought over there,
it would be being fought here.  Maybe you just don't appreciate the
fact that you can take a bus or train to work or take a plane wherever
you are going without worrying about a bomb being planted on it, or
maybe your hatred for Bush is so deep that you are incapable of seeing
what a good job he has done protecting the homeland.

Yes, they do count more than soldiers. Soldiers take a risk, and they
know the risks. They are well aware that their service can and often
does result in their deaths or maiming. Latte drinking office workers
should not be subjected to that risk. That's why we have a military.
That's why we have a police force. Those risks are not meant to be
shouldered by civilian office workers. Homeland security is working

Patrick, we Republicans would appreciate it if whenever you refer to
Al Gore you use the word &quot;Sore&quot;, as in &quot;Sore / Loserman '00&quot;.

These crybabys on here need to be reminded that there was a massive
cleansing of Sore / Loserman / Kerry / Edwards in the past two
elections.

They just can't seem to take it, it's as if 8 years with President
Clinton wasn't enough for them. They have to have ALL the elections,
or else

It's a shame Springsteen doesn't have a sense of humor, he could
really fuck with these nitwits who jump at his every command.

&quot;Go ahead boy, order the PBS special&quot;

Go ahead boy, buy my 4th release of Thunder Road in the 90's...Asbury

assholes to finance it&quot;.

&gt; If I were polled right now I would voice disapproval of this Congress,

When will your griping end? You gripe about Bush AND you gripe about
the people you voted for who promised to stand up to him. Welcome to
REALITY. Sounds like you are abit letdown by your leaders.

Sorry buddy, you're just gonna have to live with it. Your congress
only really cares about the next election, so guess what, they will
sell you Dems on the next election and they will keep the war strung
out and make some excuse why they didnt &quot;Bring Em Home&quot;. Because when
it comes down to it, they won't have the guts to end the war and then
deal with the consequences.

Sure, your but buddy Black Obama wants it ended next April. Why? Why
doesn't he just say........&quot;Elect me and I will end the War on the
morning after my inauguration....I'll order 100% of them home on that
January morning.

Well you friggin' Dunce,...it's because he does not have the gonads to
do it. He needs to Bush to do it otherwise it's all on his ass. And
you pussies will buy it hook line and sinker.

Oh sure, what he'll do is he'll say that he inherited some
impossibility or he was set-up for failure.

Well, either him or that lesbian hillary.

I'm going to bed, you're like a broken record with the same stupid
shit.

When we stop adding to the huge pile of bodies being created by George
Bush's war of lies.

Clear enough for you, buddy?

And since a large majority want the war to end, and since Iraq will
still be the number one issue in the next election, I am fine with that,
buddy.

&gt; Yes, they do count more than soldiers. Soldiers take a risk, and they
&gt; know the risks. They are well aware that their service can and often
&gt; does result in their deaths or maiming. Latte drinking office workers
&gt; should not be subjected to that risk. That's why we have a military.
&gt; That's why we have a police force. Those risks are not meant to be
&gt; shouldered by civilian office workers. Homeland security is working

Right, so as long as we sacrifice 1000 soldiers/year, you think that
there won't be any terrorist attacks over here... Good luck finding the
1000 sacrifices every year.

Also, you obviously think that Iraqi civilian lives are worth less than
American lives, if you think that it's okay to fight our wars in another
country which has nothing to do with al qaeda's beef with us.  Maybe,
just maybe, they'd prefer we fight our war in our own country?  What
makes you think it's okay to make the Iraqis suffer so that (even if it
were true) Americans don't have to face violence?
