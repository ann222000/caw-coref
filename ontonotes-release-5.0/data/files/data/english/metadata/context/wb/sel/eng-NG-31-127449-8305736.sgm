So, I'm reading a lot of various blogs recently, particularly science
blogs in the area of natural history.  My list of FF bookmarks for
these various blogs is still growing, and most of the time my daily
checks on a blog don't show anything new, and the comments (which are
often just as interesting) are hidden behind a &quot;Read on ...&quot; link or
something.

Is there anything like an RSS client for Windows (and, preferably, for
Linux too) that will pull in all this stuff and present summaries that
I can follow through if they look interesting?

And could something like that also subscribe to news feeds - BBC, etc?
That's less important, but still would be nice.

Recommendations would be helpful if such a thing exists.

Funny you should ask. I just looked at  these last weekend. I have
been getting into podcast lately and I was looking to alternatives to
using iTunes.

JUICE seems to be a popular one:

http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/

And this one looked interesting too:

http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,22971-page,1-c,internettool...

Neither of these seemed to meet my needs as they would not get the
files to my mp3 player directly, so I'm still using the drag and drop
feature of iTunes to get the podcast to my device.

I've been using FeedReader for some time. It has its problems but
overall it is fairly good.

Thanks, Neal.  I've spent an entertaining couple of hours playing with
both of those.

Feedreader is working fine on the science blogs I read, and I'll see
how that goes.  In fact, I'm tempted to go trawling for more at
scienceblogs.com.

Juice I haven't got to grips with yet, probably because I'm trying to
get BBC podcasts working, and it ain't playing ball.  This could be
the Beeb's problem.  I'll keep messing about a bit later.

Bloglines &lt; http://www.bloglines.com/ &gt; may not be quite what you are
looking for, but it has served me well.  Since it's web-based, it also
allows me to read from multiple PCs (ie, articles I have already read on
one PC won't pop up on another one).

If you ever stumble across a way to get a random MP3 file onto an iPod and
have it treat it as a podcast/audiobook (that is, put it in the
podcast/audiobook directory), PLEASE send me an email. I would be forever
in your debt. I have tried in vain to find a simple way to do this and have
come to the conclusion that the only way to do it is to publish the file on
a feedserver as a podcast, which is too much of a PITA for me to figure out
how to do.

OK, I did it. For the record, Dover, I hate you, hate you, hate you,
hate you, hate you.

I remember now why doing this is such a PITA. I don't have these files
on a webpage somewhere, I have them on my hard drive. And I don't have
an active web page anywhere, which you need to have for Blogger to go
get the file(s). So I had to set up a web page. No big deal, right?

I get my internet access through sbc/yahoo. And they give me a free web
page...on geocities. Which means you have to go through a bunch of
&quot;tools&quot; to make it &quot;easy&quot; to create your web page. I finally got this
working, including their fucked-up interface for uploading files (you
have to pay extra to be able to use FTP). Then I had to create a blog
using Blogger, then convert it using Feedburner, then subscribe to the
resulting podcast using iTunes. And it worked.

I can't imagine jumping through all of these hoops dozens of times to
convince my iPod that an audiobook or radioshow is not music. Although
it should be easier for the next ones.

Yeah, Comcast has that too.  They do allow you to use your own authoring
tools and FTP if you insist though.  They try to hide the pages where
they tell you that.

Geocities explicitly says you can only use FTP if you pay them more money.

Anyone know of a place that allows users to put up web pages, for free,
with a large amount of storage? I need on the order of 500MB to put up a
whole audiobook ripped at 96Kbps.

I don't understand enough about RSS feeds to know the answer to either
of your questions. My understanding is that you need your properly

that really entails or means. And I really don't want to know. I just

I believe that Jerry is right -- you could do the whole thing locally,
but you'd need to install something like Listgarden to create the RSS
