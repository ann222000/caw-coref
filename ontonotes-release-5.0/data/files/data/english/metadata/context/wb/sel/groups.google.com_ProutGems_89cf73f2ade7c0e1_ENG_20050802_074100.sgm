Animal Rights - some summary points

World Prout Assembly, inspired by the words of Shrii Prabhat Ranjan
Sarkar, believes that before killing birds and animals for food, we
must think hundred times whether we can stay alive without killing
them. In the Magna Carta of the future world government, Sarkar has
clearly stipulated that it is a fundamental principle to also guarantee

complete security to all plants and animals, not just human beings.

Prout is dedicated to promoting the inalienable rights of animals to
live out their lives in peace and security, and to expose violations of

this fundamental right.

Animal Rights Advocacy is a Growing Field, by Rachana Rathi. More law
schools are offering classes for students interested in issues of
animal cruelty, cosmetics testing. veterinary malpractice and
regulation of factory farms. Harvard Law School just hosted a national
moot court competition debating animal rights issues. Law students at
Loyola Law School, Chapman Univ. School of Law and Massaachusetts
School of Law petitioned for courses on animal law and now all three
Law Schools offer animal law courses. This heralds a great change in
the collective mindset, as people become more and more conscious of the

rights of animals to live in peace, unharmed by human beings!

Animal Rights: The Future, by Gary Francione. More and more people are
giving up meat and dairy products, reject the use of animals in
biomedical experiments, cannot justify that zoos are essentially animal

prisons. Most people are horrified when told how that steak got to
their dinner plate. But, simultaneously more and more animals are used
and in more horrible ways than ever before. Eight billion animals are
consumed for food every year in the US, through barbaric rearing
practices. Pigs are unable to even turn around in their stalls or
escape the suckling of constant streams of litters they are forced to
have. Calves live in small crates in dark, windowless buildings so that

the veal meat we eat is soft and tender. Laying hens are put four in a
cage measuring one foot square. Broiler hens are confined so horribly
that cannibalism and disease kills many. Francione says there is no
difference between the animal rights movement and the movement for
other forms of social justice. Francionie is to be heralded for his
relentless struggle to better the lives of animals and bring them
justice! Maybe it is time for us to become animal rights extremists and

be proud of it!

On the Meaning of &quot;Elitism.&quot; The modern animal protection movement
contains two groups. Animal rightists want total liberation for
animals. Animal welfarists consider animals as the property of humans,
that humans have an obligation to treat animals &quot;humanely,&quot; and that
animals have no rights to any particular treatment. World Prout
Assembly supports animal rights, i.e., total animal liberation from
harm, from torture, from slaughter by humans. Animal rights means
radical egalitarianism. Many people believe meat eating and vivisection

are okay because federal laws regulate these activities and keep them
&quot;humane.&quot; Can rape be made &quot;humane&quot; or should it end altogether? We
must demand full rights and freedoms for all animals - nothing less!

Animal Rights Commentary: Vegetarian Diets in Prisons. Anna Charlton
tells us that today prisoners have no right to a vegetarian diet
regardless of the reason. Jail authorities are not interested. There
are some prisoners who want to learn and understand why they are in
prison, how they became violent, and they are ready to unlearn their
ways to the extent of becoming vegetarians. Prisoners everywhere must
have the right to a vegetarian diet.

How Cruel Human Beings Are, by Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. In this
simple article, Shrii Sarkar demonstrates how courteous, kind and
compassionate the vultures are when taking their food. They will never
come close to an animal while it is still alive. Rather it will wait
even for one hour after it has died, and then only go to have its food.

Why can't human beings have the same level of compassion?

FAQ on Animal Rights, by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals). For people wondering why animal rights are important or
should even be considered, PETA has given very good answers to 21
questions regarding the ethics of hurting animals. The answers are a
good starting point on the journey towards developing higher levels of
compassion for our fellow beings.

Dec 17, 2004 Investigation Reveals Slaughter Horrors at Agriprocessors.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) continues its
investigation which reveals unspeakable crimes committed against
defenseless animals inside corporate slaughterhouses. Shrii Prabhat
Sarkar, founder of PROUT, gave maximum importance to the protection of
all animals and plants. He provided humanity with what should become
the fundamental principles of the future world government. The first of

those principles is a guarantee of complete security to all plants and
animals.

Their Tears, by Garda Ghista. Animals also have rights. Animals also do

not want to suffer. They want to be treated humanely. They want to
receive love and affection. And they certainly want to live out their
natural lives. They do not want to die or be killed before their
natural end. This is also their right. World Prout Assembly upholds the

right of all animals to be safe from harm, particularly harm caused by
human beings.

Neo-Humanist Policy, by Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. The author
explains simply and clearly that our first serve human beings, then
animals, then plants and finally inanimate objects. Human beings should

not kill animals for their own pleasure. People should stop killing
cows and other milk-giving animals out of respect for higher forms of
life. For this same reason, the slaughter of buffaloes and goats must
be stopped immediately.

One world, One humanity, One family!
