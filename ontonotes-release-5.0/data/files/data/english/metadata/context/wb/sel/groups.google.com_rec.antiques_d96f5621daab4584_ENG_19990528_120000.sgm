I have been lurking on this group for weeks. I am NOT selling
anything....(unless you come to MY gift shop, then I reserve the right to
give you my sales spiel)...I don't want to know how much ANYTHING is
worth...and I won't whine if I don't get immediate answers to any questions.
I'm a collector of Blue and White Transferware dishes, and I mean collector
in the truest sense. I love them because they are pretty. I like the way
they look on a shelf, or in a holder, and am always on the lookout for an
unusual pattern or shape. There are two different kinds of plates I don't
collect......Willow Ware, or Currier &amp; Ives. Willow because it's so common
and everybody made one version or another...Currier &amp; Ives because, while I
like the scenes, I don't like the color. I love Flo blue, but it's spendy so
I don't have too much of it. The crown jewel of my collection is my Clarice
Cliff, Tonquin blue, Royal Staffordshire.....and that is the point of my
entire post. Some dear person pointed me to the Replacements LTD. site, and
I have been in seventh heaven ever since. Thank you soooo much, for listing
that site. I've been able to identify several pieces of my collection.
I do have one piece that so far no one has been able to help me with. It is
a 9 &amp;7/8 dinner plate, ironstone I think, the front has a Scottish thistle
decal....the back has the name Glasgow. The color is blue but with a bit of
a green tint. I'll be taking pictures of it, front and back, this weekend
and posting them on a site....NOT HERE, so nobody get mad at me!! My maiden
name was Campbell, and great Grandfather came from Scotland in the early
1800's, so nearly anything about Scotland is of great interest to me. I
don't want to sell this plate, but if I could find out more about it, I
would be VERY interested in buying matching pieces. In fact I'm in the
market for blue and white pieces all the time and would be willing to
consider making purchases.
Again thank you for pointing me to a wonderful source.
Respectfully
Lois E.

Lois, the CC Tonquin pattern is quite pretty! But, before you spend any
more money at Replacements Ltd., check out eBay - there are always
pieces up for auction there, just deal with a reputable dealer and
you'll get perfect pieces at better prices.

(Note to everyone: I have no Tonquin up for sale, I'm not soliciting
here!)

Personally, I like the Willow pattern - I have tons of the Japanese
stuff because it is so readily available, and until recently was using
it as my everyday dishware - even ran it through the dishwasher! &lt;grin&gt;
I also have some lovely English Willow, but because of cost (and because
a lot of it is in cups and saucers), most of it sits in my cupboard
where I can enjoy looking at it.

Lately, I'm beginning to appreciate Arts &amp; Crafts pottery more and more.
Unfortunately I have to keep selling it every time I find a nice piece,
but eventually I'm going to keep some of it - I like the organic colors,
the matte glazes, the &quot;feel&quot; of them, and they just look so darn good!
&lt;grin&gt;

Have fun, Michele

Thank you for your kind post Michele. I've considered looking on eBay....but
I've been leery of collecting from private sales. You hear so much about
things looking great in a picture, but when you receive them they've either
been broken in shipping, or they have a flaw that you weren't told of....but
I will keep my eyes open. I will be taking pictures of my &quot;special&quot; plates
this weekend, and will be posting them on a website. Hopefully someone will
be able to help me identify the patterns. Thank you again.
Lois E.

Lois, my rough guestimate is that 90% of eBay sales go off without a
hitch. As a seller, I may be biased, &lt;grin&gt; but I've bought from there
quite often too. The most important thing to do as a bidder is to check
the seller's feedback... don't just look at a high number and assume
they're reliable... they could have 20 negative feedbacks for every 100
good ones, and still have a 2,000 feedback rating. Check their return
policy (if it isn't stated, email them). If condition isn't listed,
email them. If they say there's a small chip, ask them how big in
inches/cm. A lot of times, _how_ they reply to your email can tell you
alot about the dealer... if they don't reply at all, that says a lot
too. &lt;grin&gt;

I, and most good dealers there, give very detailed descriptions. I
include photos of any damage if it's big enough to photograph, (which is
rare, since I try to sell only undamaged items). I take as many photos
as necessary to depict an item fairly, and I'm far from the only
reputable dealer there.

There are a few items I would probably not buy there very often, mostly
because they're heavily reproduced, and it's hard to always tell from a
photo if it's fake or genuine. That includes a lot of Roseville, Nippon,
and RS Prussia... but even so, if the dealer guarantees a refund if not
genuine, and they've got excellent feedback, I'd buy those items too.

Oh... and one more thing, REQUIRE insurance on every item you buy. As
well as I pack items, I've sent a very few that arrived in more pieces
than I sent. Insurance protects both the seller and the buyer, IMHO, and
I require it on anything over $10, and anything breakable, regardless of
price. If an item is grossly misrepresented, and the seller won't make
good on it, you can file mail fraud charges, and both the USPS and eBay
take those charges very seriously... but it doesn't happen as often as
folks think. It's like computer viruses - very few folks get infected,
but when they do, the news makes a big stink about it. &lt;g&gt;

Have fun, Michele
