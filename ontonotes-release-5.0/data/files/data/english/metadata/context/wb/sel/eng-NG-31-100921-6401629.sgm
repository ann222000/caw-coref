There have been many debates in the lifestyle about single males, and
whether or not they are actually in the lifestyle of swinging or not.
Though I have been a participant in the lifestyle for many years (11)
as a single male swinger, I don't really consider myself as a
swinger.  The reason is .. I don't have a partner to share, and that
is what the lifestyle of swinging is about.

It is ok to be a participant in the lifestyle but you've gotta
know and understand the rules of swinging with couples.  I have heard
nightmare stories of many single males trying to contact couples.
Most either don't have their profile filled out on the internet, don't
know how to have a decent conversation, or just have no clue about the
lifestyle....and many more things might I add.  We should appreciate
the opportunity to have a good time with them and show the couple the
respect that they deserve.  Just because a lady enjoys sex, don't make
her a slut.

I'd like to make things easier for the single males:

Rules for the single males:

#1.   This is the number one rule in the lifestyle.  No means No.  It
deals with the initial conversation with  the couple.  If they are not
interested, don't persue it.  Stop immediately

#2.   If you are on the internet and looking for people to party with,
make sure to read their profile thoroughly.  Don't just contact them,
because  many of you know that there are couples out there not looking
for single males.

#3.   Your initial contact with the couple should not be sending a
picture of your "dick"..  that sends the wrong signal immediately.
What are you telling them, that you are a "dick?".    If your profile
is filled out correctly, you will have a face photo.  If not, then
send a face photo.  Make sure to let them know about you... not just
about sex.   Actually who you are and what you like to do.

#4.   Don't ask to webcam.  So many couples get that from guys.
Especially guys with no profiles.   If a couple wants to webcam with
you, they will ask you.

#5.  Find out what their likes and dislikes are .   Not only sexually,
but what their hobbies are.

#6.   Don't push to meet them.  They will decide when they want to
meet you.  You might let them know that you are interested in meeting
sometime in the future, but don't push the issue.  Let them decide
when the best time is.  Don't expect them to drop everything in their
life to meet you that day.  Do you realize how many single males
contact a couple in a day????!!!!  C'mon, what makes us think we are
so special.

#7.   Want a wall built immediatly.  Just ask a wife or the female
part of the couple to meet you alone without the male counterpart.
You will have an immdiate dropped conversation, and will never be
talked to again.  Don't ask a man's wife to meet you alone.  If after
meeting with them for awhile and partying; they ask you to do it, it's
ok.  But don't ever suggest it.

Overall, we just need to understand that having an opportunity to
have fun in the lifestyle is great, and we shouldn't take advantage of
it.  Just be nice, and be yourself.   Single males will always be
scrutinized in the lifestyle, but there is always an opportunity to
have fun with couples.  It takes time and patience.

Hope you all enjoyed the reading

Single males arent really 'swingers' since swinging involves a married
couple who grant the practice of adultery to one another , or, to use
others for temporary stimulation to orgasm.   So, single males would be
more accurately classified as 'Fornicators'  because they are sexual
predators who also use others for a mere copulation.   Regardless, both
are sexual predators who capitalize on adults who have suppressed their
moral conscience like themselves.

Hope that helps.

Since you don't get this term, why should we believe you about any of
the others?  Your whole attempt to "help" just demonstrated how clueless
you are about the whole enterprise.

But oh, well... that's no surprise.

Rave on, silly man... rave on.
