55

Not marble, nor the guilded monument,
Of Princes shall out-liue this powrefull rime,
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Then vnswept stone, besmeer'd with sluttish time.
When wastefull warre shall Statues ouer-turne,
And broiles roote out the worke of masonry,
Nor Mars is sword, nor warres quick fire shall burne:
The liuing record of your memory.
Gainst death,and all obliuious emnity
Shall you pace forth, your praise shall stil finde roome,
Euen in the eyes of all posterity
That weare this world out to the ending doome.
So til the iudgement that your selfe arise,
You liue in this,and dwell in louers eies.

Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Nor Mars's sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.
'Gainst death and all oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth: your praise shall still find room
Ev'n in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.

you remain alive in this poem, living in those lovers that read it.

The poem is worse printed than average.
In line 1, sense could be made of the Quarto's 'monument', but not
rhyme, since it has to rhyme with 'contents'. So Malone's 'monuments'.
The colon at the end of line 7 spoils the sense by cutting off the
verb 'burn' from its direct object 'record'.
The spelling 'emnity' in line 8 is a simple transposition error.

Sonnet 54 was mostly about roses, but at the end 'verse distils your
truth' introduces the subject of the power of poetry which is taken up
in this sonnet.

Line 1. I may be overdoing the contrast between the marble and the
monuments. But there should be one and this seems to fit the need and
the words.

Line 2, 'powerful'. This word has since become commonplace. It used to
be associated with 'the word of power' and other supernatural things,
like Orpheus' singing which moved mountains and halted waterfalls:
'The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call,
And headlong streams hang list'ning in their fall' (Pope, second
Pastoral.)

Line 4, 'wasteful'. In the case of war, this goes back to the original
meaning of 'waste', uncultivated, uninhabitable. William the Conqueror
laid waste to the North; Domesday Book records the wealth of every
village in the kingdom, but in the North many times it says only
'waste'. Note the alliteration.
Even modern wars often end in the overturning of statues - I take it
that is the reason why they get first mention, before the general
'work of masonry'.

Line 7. All editors seem to print 'Mars his'. The Quarto has 'Mars
is', which is plainly wrong. I see no reason why Mars's should be
different from war's, or why the rather odd use of 'his' for
apostrophe S should appear here. As I understand it, someone who wrote
John Smith His Book would actually say John Smith's Book. The plural
written with '-is' may be relevant but I think it is mostly Scottish
(there was a game played with 'clubbis' and 'ballis').

Line 13. I take 'judgment' to mean the proceedings of the Day of
Judgment, in which (if I have got them straight) the Last Trumpet is
the part that sets off the Resurrection of the Dead. 1 Corinthians 15:
'51. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed,
52. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for
the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed.'
After that they are judged and go off to Heaven or to Hell. There is
no prior judgment about who is to be raised and who not. They are all
raised, except those who happen to be still alive at the time and so
do not need it.

Line 14. So one of the things Shakespeare wanted for his sonnets was
that they should 'dwell in lovers' eyes'. They were to live for ever
and be read by people in the state of mind he depicts. Going a little
beyond the plain statement, those people can apply his words to their
own situations where they are apt. On the surface, the addressee is
being immortalised: but we do not know his name and none of his
actions appear. Deeper, therefore, this is a set of poems to be read
by an audience for all time to come, especially (since they are
sonnets) by lovers.

This poem is related to the concluding poem of Horace's Odes as
originally published (3.30) and to other poets who followed Horace.
Ideas may have been suggested by various poets, but the atmosphere,
the grandeur, is Horatian. To the 16th century Horace was mainly the
author of Satires and Epistles. Shakespeare, exceptionally, mainly
uses the Odes, the work in which Horace is most poet.

The poem, with interlinear translation. (Warning: Horace is the great
untranslatable, not Homer as some have said.)

The end of Ovid's Metamorphoses (15.871 ff.) has 'iron', 'I shall be
recited by the mouth of the people' (the ancients read aloud and
Ovid's poem is of a kind to read aloud)

Propertius 3.2 is not the conclusion of a book (as this Sonnet is
not). It calls poems 'monuments' and mentions pyramids, but also the
tomb of King Mausolus (the Mausoleum) which is more like Shakespeare's
'gilded monuments'.

If we are meant to think of any of these while reading sonnet 55, I
would say it was Horace. But it seems unfortunate for Kerrigan to say
'Shakespeare adapted Ovid and Horace', seeming to impugn the
originality of this poem. It is very different from either.

Shakespeare 55

Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.

From Spenser's *Ruines of Rome*, a translation from the
French of poems by Bellay. The whole series is available
at

32.
Hope ye my verses that posteritie
Of age ensuing shall you euer read?
Hope ye that euer immortalitie
So meane Harpes worke may chalenge for her meed?
If vnder heauen anie endurance were,
These moniments, which not in paper writ,
But in Porphyre and Marble doo appeare,
Might well haue hop'd to haue obtained it.
Nath'les my Lute, whom Phoebus deignd to giue,
Cease not to sound these olde antiquities:
For if that time doo let thy glorie liue,
Well maist thou boast, how euer base thou bee,
That thou art first, which of thy Nation song
Th'olde honour of the people gowned long.

L'Enuoy (33)

Bellay, first garland of free Poësie
That France brought forth, though fruitfull of braue wits,
Well worthie thou of immortalitie,
That long hast traueld by thy learned writs,
Olde Rome out of her ashes to reuiue,
And giue a second life to dead decayes:
Needes must he all eternitie suruiue,
That can to other giue eternall dayes.
Thy dayes therefore are endles, and thy prayse
Excelling all, that euer went before;
And after thee, gins Bartas hie to rayse
His heauenly Muse, th' Almightie to adore.
Liue happie spirits, th' honour of your name,
And fill the world with neuer dying fame.

The following commentary is from a paper by
Kent Hieatt titled &quot;The Genesis of Shakespeare's
*Sonnets*: Spenser's *Ruines of Rome: by Bellay*
PMLA, 1983, pp800-814.

&quot;In thematic matters (to which we now turn) the limits
of an article impose selectivity. The last two sonnets of
Spenser's sequence reenact a paradox that has been
his concern throughout: in *Ruines* 32, a translation
of Du Bellay's final sonnet, Spenser doubts that the paper
on which his verses are written can survive, considering
that the stone in which Rome was embodied has decayed;
but *Ruines* 33, Spenser's own envoy sonnet, asserts that
in fact Du Bellay has, through the foregoing sonnets,
conferred eternity on the city. *Ruines* 32 begins:

Hope ye my verses that posteritie
Of age ensuing shall you euer read?
Hope ye that euer immortalitie
So meane Harpes worke may chalenge for her meed?
If vnder heauen anie endurance were,
These moniments, which not in paper writ,
But in Porphyre and Marble doo appeare,
Might well haue hop'd to haue obtained it.

Clearly Spenser and Du Bellay before him were
manipulating and reversing the Horatian *exegi
monumentum aere perennius* (&quot;I have erected
a monument outlasting brass&quot;), and Spenser
returns to the simple assertion of that topos in
his next and concluding sonnet. Probably
Shakespeare was as conscious of the ultimate
source of this theme as we are, but his use of
the same topos in *Sonnets* 55 and his subsequent
development of that sonnet are so full of reminiscences
of *Ruines* that his dependence on Spenser's work
seems clear. What he appears to have done with
*Ruines* 32 itself is what Spenser did in *Ruines* 33 -
reverse the roles of the marble and the verse - but
in a characteristically exclamatory way:

Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.
'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.

To begin with, this sonnet repeats Spenser's &quot;marble&quot;
and &quot;moniments&quot; with identical contextual bearing
and includes, in the line &quot;Ev'n in the eyes of all
posterity,&quot; Spenser's idea of a reading posterity.
*Sonnets* 55 also repeats a personified time
from line 11 of *Ruines* 32 (&quot;...if that time do let
thy glory live&quot;) and preserves in &quot;living record&quot; and
&quot;live&quot; a verbal expression from that line. Shakespeare
seems to employ here the same strategy of contradiction
of his source as in his treatment of Spenser's quietist
interpretation of the fallen walls, arches, and palaces
of Rome and of Rome herself in &quot;...hath tamed herself
at last,/The prey of time, which all things doth devour&quot;
(*Ruines* 3). In *Sonnets* 19, that is, Shakespeare's
opening is the exclamatory, vivifying &quot;Devouring Time,
blunt thou the lion's paws,&quot; in which the prey-devouring
lion is offered to Time, tamer of lions and of much
else in the following lines, on the pro tem understanding
that Time will not use his antic pen to furrow the lover's
brow. In the eternity topos of *Sonnets* 55, &quot;Not marble
nor the gilded monuments,&quot; Shakespeare is close to
*Ruines* at a number of points beyond the verbal
repetitions and the inversion of the theme; similarly,
*Ruines* 32 contains material paralleled elsewhere
in *Sonnets*. Shakespeare's references in *Sonnets*
55 to stone structures affected by age - the unswept
stone, the overturned statues, and the uprooted masonry -
relate to what amounts to a massive, shared subtheme
in the two sequences.&quot;

Certainly not. It is merely that the editors
(who, while not being able to make sense of
anything, really know what Shake-speare
intended to write) more than usually fail to
grasp the degree of sophistication of the
poet and the extent of his poetic devices.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It doesn't have to rhyme -- not closely
in any event.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So Malone's 'monuments'.

"/>

Malone's 'correction' is insensitive and
clumsy. We should be able to sense that
the original is right, even if we are not sure
why. Firstly, a final 's' on 'monuments'
would clash with that on 'Princes'. But,
more importantly, the amended statement
lacks meaning. As long civilisation exists
-- and people can read this sonnet --
'princes' (or rulers) will reign and will have
monuments. The sonnet cannot outlive
civilisation.

1. Not marble, nor the guilded monument,
2. Of Princes shall out-live this powrefull rime,
3. But you shall shine more bright in these contents
4. Then unswept stone, besmeer'd with sluttish time.

The poet was talking about one particular
monument of one particular 'prince' (or
princess).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The colon at the end of line 7 spoils the sense by cutting off the
&gt; verb 'burn' from its direct object 'record'.

"/>

It is there for a purpose. The poet is
pointing to the next few lines of his own
poem. It's a self-conscious reflexive
device.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The spelling 'emnity' in line 8 is a simple transposition error.

"/>

Nope. Wrong again. (And it's in line 9)
Although the poet was fully aware that it
would be taken as such. He is indicating
'pseudo-n-emnity'. That 'all oblivious'
factor would militate against the living
record of the memory of his addressee.

&quot;Oblivious&quot; (OED)
&quot;2. Of or pertaining to forgetfulness; attended by or associated
with oblivion.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Line 7. All editors seem to print 'Mars his'. The Quarto
&gt; has 'Mars is', which is plainly wrong.

"/>

The Quarto versions printed in Booth
and Vendler both show 'Mars his'.
What are you reading?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I see no reason why Mars's should be
&gt; different from war's, or why the rather odd use of 'his' for
&gt; apostrophe S should appear here.

"/>

What's wrong with metre as a reason?
Apostrophe S was not really available to
the poet (it was coming in, but slowly);
and here it both looks and sounds wrong
-- even to us. The original (with 'his') is
fine -- even if we may find it a little archaic.
But that is a small price to pay.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Line 14. So one of the things Shakespeare wanted for his
&gt; sonnets was that they should 'dwell in lovers' eyes'.

"/>

Most unlikely. He may have meant
'lovers' in a wider sense. Or (more likely
IMHO) he may have meant 'your selfe'
as referring to himself (the poet). In
other sonnets he states that they share
an identity. If so, he would be saying
that until his own identity was recognised,
that of his addressee (the Queen) would
not be seen either, and she would be
condemned to 'live' (in a limited, pointless
and quite misunderstood manner) solely
in the eyes of lovers.

1. Not marble, nor the guilded monument,
2. Of Princes shall out-live this powrefull rime,

The BOAR &amp; The SOW [© L. MacDonald CELTIC TOTEM ANIMALS 1992]

&lt;&lt;The PIG and its wild relative, the BOAR, are probably the most
important totem animals of the Gaelic Celts, particularly in terms
of their connections with the Otherworld, as providers of spiritual
nourishment. When we consider that the Celtic / Gaelic system is in
fact two systems, incorporating the 'realms of the MOON' and the
'realms of the SUN', that have over time merged into one system,
we begin to realise why the BOAR and the SOW have become the totem
animals par excellence of the Gaelic Celts. They represent the
twin forces of masculinity &amp; femininity - the wild, untamed BOAR,
the warrior's challenge, and the SOW as the giver of Life and Death.&gt;&gt;

May Day's (Beltane's) Pagan Roots
what.html

&lt;&lt;&quot;Beltane&quot; is derived from the Irish Gaelic 'Bealtaine'
or the Scottish Gaelic 'Beatuinn', meaning 'Belfire',
the fire of the Celtic god of light (Bel, Beli, or Belinus).
He in turn can be traced back to the Middle Eastern god Baal.

The Beltane celebration should begin on April 30 at SUNset, as SUNset
is the proper time to kindle the great Bel-fires on the tops of the
nearest beacon hill. These fires are said to have healing properties,
and would offer protection to nude celebrants leaping through them,
or dancing clock-wise around them. It is legend that children
conceived as a result of the festivities of Beltane
(known as Merry-Be-Gots) were gifted by the gods.&gt;&gt;

May 1 The Beltane Sabbat. Beltane is derived from an ancient Druid fire
festival celebrating the union of the Goddess and the Horned God. It
also celebrates the rebirth of the SUN, marking the &quot;death&quot; of Winter
and the &quot;birth&quot; of Spring. At dawn, morning dew is gathered from
grass &amp; wildflowers to be used in mystical potions for good luck.

The BOAR &amp; The SOW [© L. MacDonald CELTIC TOTEM ANIMALS 1992]

&lt;&lt;The white SOW is historically sacred to Cerridwen.
The Cerridwen I know, has laughingly informed me
that her totem is a PIG with wings.

If you understand the full import of that statement
then you have met Cerridwen as the Goddess of Change.

The strong, wild BOAR is one of the most important totem animals of
the Gaelic Celts. Many bronze statues of BOARs have been discovered
and there are numerous references to be found in the legends that
bear testimony to the importance of this fierce, untamed beast.

In the ancient Celtic system the BOAR is associated with the South &amp;
the element of Fire. It is connected with the life giving power of the
SUN. At the festival of Beltaine PIGs bladders used to be carried by
the Fool. On a spiritual level the BOAR acts as a guide that leads the
warrior-hunter on a quest to the Otherworld. In the voyage of Maeldun,
found in 'The Book of the Dun Cow', the tenth otherworld island the
voyagers reach is described as 'The Island of the Fiery Swine',
inhabited by red PIGs that feed on apples
(a very Otherworldly food source).

The BOAR is also the traditional food of the Samhain feast,
a time when the two worlds meet.

&lt;&lt;On 23 July 1567,
while practicing fencing with Edward Baynam, a TAILOR,
in the backyard of Cecil's house in the Strand, the
17-year-old Oxford killed an unarmed UNDERCOOK named
THOMAS BRINCKNELL with a thrust to the thigh.

Condemned as a suicide, Brincknell was denied Christian burial,

and his pregnant widow AGNES &amp; 3-year-old son QUYNTYN

were stripped of their assets &amp; abandoned to her relatives

'The Eve of Saint AGNES' - KEATS

She hurried at his words, beset with fears,
For there were sleeping dragons all around,
At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready SPEARS-
Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.-
In all the house was heard no human sound.
A chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door;
The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound,
Flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar;
And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.
They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall;
Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide;
Where lay the PORTER, in uneasy sprawl,
With a huge empty flaggon by his side;
The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,
But his sagacious eye an inmate owns:
By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:-
The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;-
The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groan.
And they are gone: ay, ages long ago
These lovers fled away into the storm.

&gt;&gt; The poem is worse printed than average.

&gt;Certainly not. It is merely that the editors
&gt;(who, while not being able to make sense of
&gt;anything, really know what Shake-speare
&gt;intended to write) more than usually fail to
&gt;grasp the degree of sophistication of the
&gt;poet and the extent of his poetic devices.

&gt;&gt; In line 1, sense could be made of the Quarto's 'monument', but not
&gt;&gt; rhyme, since it has to rhyme with 'contents'.

&gt;It doesn't have to rhyme -- not closely
&gt;in any event.

"/>

Shakespeare's rhymes are generally good. We only get the opposite
impression because of changes in pronunciation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So Malone's 'monuments'.

&gt;Malone's 'correction' is insensitive and
&gt;clumsy. We should be able to sense that
&gt;the original is right, even if we are not sure
&gt;why.

"/>

I go a lot on the feel of the verse, but to post on Usenet we need to
_say_ why. I too find it a problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Firstly, a final 's' on 'monuments'
&gt;would clash with that on 'Princes'.

"/>

No, it would agree with it. Many princes and one monument would clash.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But,
&gt;more importantly, the amended statement
&gt;lacks meaning. As long civilisation exists
&gt;-- and people can read this sonnet --
&gt;'princes' (or rulers) will reign and will have
&gt;monuments. The sonnet cannot outlive
&gt;civilisation.

"/>

It can outlive the monuments erected on particular occasions to
particular princes. Shakespeare is not talking about the _practice_ of
erecting memorials, but about the concrete things themselves.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;1. Not marble, nor the guilded monument,
&gt;2. Of Princes shall out-live this powrefull rime,
&gt;3. But you shall shine more bright in these contents
&gt;4. Then unswept stone, besmeer'd with sluttish time.

&gt;The poet was talking about one particular
&gt;monument of one particular 'prince' (or
&gt;princess).

"/>

Do you mean we should read 'Princess'?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The colon at the end of line 7 spoils the sense by cutting off the
&gt;&gt; verb 'burn' from its direct object 'record'.

&gt;It is there for a purpose. The poet is
&gt;pointing to the next few lines of his own
&gt;poem. It's a self-conscious reflexive
&gt;device.

&gt;&gt; The spelling 'emnity' in line 8 is a simple transposition error.

&gt;Nope. Wrong again. (And it's in line 9)
&gt;Although the poet was fully aware that it
&gt;would be taken as such. He is indicating
&gt;'pseudo-n-emnity'. That 'all oblivious'
&gt;factor would militate against the living
&gt;record of the memory of his addressee.

"/>

Do you mean 'pseudonymity'? I'm not sure there is such a word, or what
it would mean. 'Anonymity' is easy by comparison.
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;Oblivious&quot; (OED)
&gt;&quot;2. Of or pertaining to forgetfulness; attended by or associated
&gt;with oblivion.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Line 7. All editors seem to print 'Mars his'. The Quarto
&gt;&gt; has 'Mars is', which is plainly wrong.

&gt;The Quarto versions printed in Booth
&gt;and Vendler both show 'Mars his'.
&gt;What are you reading?

"/>

So they do: I can't think where I got this from. So I accept 'Mars
his'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I see no reason why Mars's should be
&gt;&gt; different from war's, or why the rather odd use of 'his' for
&gt;&gt; apostrophe S should appear here.

&gt;What's wrong with metre as a reason?
&gt;Apostrophe S was not really available to
&gt;the poet (it was coming in, but slowly);
&gt;and here it both looks and sounds wrong
&gt;-- even to us. The original (with 'his') is
&gt;fine -- even if we may find it a little archaic.
&gt;But that is a small price to pay.

"/>

Metrically it seems much of a muchness. 'Mars's' and 'Mars his' are
both two syllables, the second more emphatically so. The possessive
with S had existed for a long time (longer than the 'his' elaboration)
but the apostrophe itself was only just coming in as a punctuation
mark.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Line 14. So one of the things Shakespeare wanted for his
&gt;&gt; sonnets was that they should 'dwell in lovers' eyes'.

&gt;Most unlikely. He may have meant
&gt;'lovers' in a wider sense. Or (more likely
&gt;IMHO) he may have meant 'your selfe'
&gt;as referring to himself (the poet). In
&gt;other sonnets he states that they share
&gt;an identity. If so, he would be saying
&gt;that until his own identity was recognised,
&gt;that of his addressee (the Queen) would
&gt;not be seen either, and she would be
&gt;condemned to 'live' (in a limited, pointless
&gt;and quite misunderstood manner) solely
&gt;in the eyes of lovers.

"/>

'Dwell in' means 'inhabit', not 'survive'. Line 13 is an adverbial
clause qualifying the verbs in line 14: the subject of those verbs is
'You' at the beginning of the line. So I do not see that what you
suggest can be right, though I have some trouble following the
argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;1. Not marble, nor the guilded monument,
&gt;2. Of Princes shall out-live this powrefull rime,
&gt;3. But you shall shine more bright in these contents
&gt;4. Then unswept stone, besmeer'd with sluttish time.
&gt;5. When wastefull warre shall &lt;it&gt;Statues&lt;/it&gt; over-turne,
&gt;6. And broiles roote out the worke of masonry,
&gt;7. Nor &lt;it&gt;Mars&lt;/it&gt; his sword, nor warres quick fire shall burne:
&gt;8. The living record of your memory.
&gt;9. Gainst death, and all oblivious emnity
&gt;10. Shall you pace forth, your praise shall stil finde roome,
&gt;11. Even in the eyes of all posterity
&gt;12. That weare this world out to the ending doome.
&gt;13. So til the judgement that your selfe arise,
&gt;14. You live in this, and dwell in lovers eies.
