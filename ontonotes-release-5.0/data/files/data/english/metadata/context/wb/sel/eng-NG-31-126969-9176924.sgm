What can only be described as a total and complete waste of a
potential tropical tourist destination, Haiti once again proves that
it is incapable of providing for its people and well being.  If that
country was run by anyone with an understanding for business or an IQ
over 50, it would be raking in the money hand over fists.

A 40 mph windstorm crosses the island and they claim at least 20
killed and as many missing.

I visited Haiti a few years ago.  Not the Haiti that everyone
visualizes with the grubby, fly covered people walking dirt streets
carrying dead chickens, but the civilized side of the island that
was/is owned by the French.  It was once a Club Med and now is used by
Royal Caribbean as a stop off point.

It appears to be a little peninsula that is fortified against the
unwashed masses.  There was a portal leading to the real Haiti, which
was connected to an outdoor market where the 'natives' would peddle
their shit to rich tourists and whatnot.

The vendors had to wear government badges and there were plenty of
armed officers around.  From what I know of the REAL Haiti, the armed
officers made me more nervous than the AIDS infected vendors.

Really a pathetic condition, if you think about it.  What makes Haiti
different than St. Martin or Bermuda or any other island in the
Atlantic?

Any way, good for Noel, and a big nod to Darwin...

Haiti's been a basket case from the day it declared independence two
centuries ago. Two hundred years from now, provided we haven't nuked one
another into oblivion, Haiti will STILL be a shithole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Haiti's been a basket case from the day it declared independence two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;centuries ago. Two hundred years from now, provided we haven't nuked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;another into oblivion, Haiti will STILL be a shithole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe a tropical storm will blow the inhabitants into the ocean and it

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What can only be described as a total and complete waste of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; potential tropical tourist destination, Haiti once again proves that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country was run by anyone with an understanding for business or an IQ
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over 50, it would be raking in the money hand over fists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A 40 mph windstorm crosses the island and they claim at least 20
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; killed and as many missing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I visited Haiti a few years ago.  Not the Haiti that everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; visualizes with the grubby, fly covered people walking dirt streets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carrying dead chickens, but the civilized side of the island that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was/is owned by the French.  It was once a Club Med and now is used
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Royal Caribbean as a stop off point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It appears to be a little peninsula that is fortified against the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unwashed masses.  There was a portal leading to the real Haiti, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was connected to an outdoor market where the 'natives' would peddle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their shit to rich tourists and whatnot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The vendors had to wear government badges and there were plenty of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armed officers around.  From what I know of the REAL Haiti, the armed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officers made me more nervous than the AIDS infected vendors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really a pathetic condition, if you think about it.  What makes Haiti
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different than St. Martin or Bermuda or any other island in the

Too bad we can't get them [the sharks] to breed like rodents or rabbits or
roaches .. The puddle jumpers and the fence climbers are already breeding
like that and getting our welfare to raise more of them ..

This type of conversation sure gets me going first thing in the morning.

So You Diane I

PS .. Land sharks ?? good idea ??

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Haiti's been a basket case from the day it declared independence two

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;another into oblivion, Haiti will STILL be a shithole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What can only be described as a total and complete waste of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; potential tropical tourist destination, Haiti once again proves that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is incapable of providing for its people and well being.  If that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country was run by anyone with an understanding for business or an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IQ
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over 50, it would be raking in the money hand over fists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A 40 mph windstorm crosses the island and they claim at least 20
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; killed and as many missing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I visited Haiti a few years ago.  Not the Haiti that everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; visualizes with the grubby, fly covered people walking dirt streets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carrying dead chickens, but the civilized side of the island that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was/is owned by the French.  It was once a Club Med and now is used
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Royal Caribbean as a stop off point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It appears to be a little peninsula that is fortified against the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unwashed masses.  There was a portal leading to the real Haiti,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was connected to an outdoor market where the 'natives' would peddle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their shit to rich tourists and whatnot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The vendors had to wear government badges and there were plenty of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armed officers around.  From what I know of the REAL Haiti, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officers made me more nervous than the AIDS infected vendors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really a pathetic condition, if you think about it.  What makes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Haiti
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different than St. Martin or Bermuda or any other island in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Atlantic?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any way, good for Noel, and a big nod to Darwin...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought they were all here .. in miami, now .. I was in N. Miami a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;years ago. .  NE 6th avenue, near my old high school.  The Haitians have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;completely taken over that area.  Anyway .. saw a woman walking down the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;street with a basket ON HER HEAD !!! No kidding !!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They're the ones that washed up from previous hurricanes...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe while we are putting up fences to keep the mexicans etc out .. we
&gt;&gt;&gt;can
&gt;&gt;&gt;put up some sort of netting to catch the haitians, jamaicans and cubans
&gt;&gt;&gt;before they reach shore ??

&gt;&gt; All we need is sharks...

&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt; lab~rat  &gt;:-)
&gt;&gt; Stupid humans...''

&gt;Too bad we can't get them [the sharks] to breed like rodents or rabbits or
&gt;roaches .. The puddle jumpers and the fence climbers are already breeding
&gt;like that and getting our welfare to raise more of them ..

&gt;This type of conversation sure gets me going first thing in the morning.

&gt;So You Diane I

&gt;PS .. Land sharks ?? good idea ??
