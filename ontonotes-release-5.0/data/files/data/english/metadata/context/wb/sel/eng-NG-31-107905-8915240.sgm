So the radiator got replaced, started up the car and it was running
fine, I went to check for tube leaks and found one with the trans.
fluid slowly dripping out, I fixed it and when I went to restart the
car it wont, just a single click. I checked the oil, its okay but it
still wont start, I'm currently taking the battery out to let the car
discharge for a bit before I start again..

any suggestions?

Hi...

A couple, if I may - though be forewarned that I'm no mechanic.

Put the battery back, try to start it again.  If just a single click,
then turn on the dome lights, try to crank it again.  Do the dome lights
remain unaffected, or do they dim noticeably, or do they go out completely?

If the courtesy lights remain unaffected, then did you happen to do the
same real dumb thing that I once did?  Leave one of the many connections
to the battery off? :)

If you didn't, then disassemble and clean with a bit of sandpaper all
the connections at the battery.

On the other hand, if the dome lights go out completely, then charge the
battery.

Take care.

Ken

If it's not a poor electrical connection as others have suggested, then
the starter solenoid contacts may be worn out.  The Denso/Nippondenso
starters that Chrysler uses in a lot of its vehicles is known for this
problem after some age/wear (starter operation becomes intermittent due
to worn solenoid contacts).

If this is the problem, then it's just coincidence that it happened when
you replaced the radiator.

Here's a good source for new solenoid contacts and plunger:

I had to put a set in my '98 Concorde about a month ago - same car and
engine as yours.

the local stores don't stock and can't order this particular part (at
least not my local Advance store) - you have to order off the
partsamerica web site.)

Bill,

Thanks for the reply, do you really think it was such a coincidence
that the solenoid went out right when I fixed the one tube, it was
literally no more than 5 minutes later.  I don't know exactly what
these things do so if this single click is usually suspect of a bad
solenoid then I trust ya :)

Well - definitely get a multimeter out and rule out any poor connections
in the power feed (look for voltage drop or loss with key in the start
position) before you assume it's the solenoid contacts.  The starter is
a moderate PITA to get out.  Cycle the key to &quot;start&quot; several times also
- usually the solenoid contacts will be intermittent, at least when the
problem first shows up.  IOW - if you cycle the key several times, it
might decide to start about the 5th time.

Yeah, I tried to start it about 15 times straight and it was a no go.
Could it be something with the transmission tube I messed with? Could
that be blocking something by the starter?

I tried jumping the battery but it was a no-go. I checked all the
electrical I could but I just dont understand why it would be doing
this. Im looking for my OBDII Reader to check for codes, I only had a
little oil in it because I was about to change it when the rad when
bad and a tiny bit leaked out the tube when I replaced the radiator. I
have since filled it and its all clean, do you think it could be a
precaution system not letting the car start? The car literally only
ran for like 15 seconds with the low oil.

There is no computer input for low oil.  The oil pressure switch is a
dumb switch (contact closure) and controls the idiot light directly (no
computer knows if the light is on), and that's it.  IOW - it would let
you run the  engine with zero oil in it until the engine destroyed itself.

Tme for multimeter and schematics (of the power/starting system to
begine with).

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks for the reply, do you really think it was such a coincidence
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that the solenoid went out right when I fixed the one tube, it was
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;literally no more than 5 minutes later.  I don't know exactly what
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;these things do so if this single click is usually suspect of a bad

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Well - definitely get a multimeter out and rule out any poor connections
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;in the power feed (look for voltage drop or loss with key in the start

Hi...

Having trouble accepting the coincidence of the starter solenoid
contacts going from good as new to nothing simultaneous with the work
the OP did, so...

Hoping that Winnipeg, Canada is too far away for either you or the OP
to come and punch me in the nose, I'd like to suggest once more that
he take a real good careful look at the battery positive (or extension
connection post) and make absolutely sure that he replaced all the
cables.  Looking for a real thick stiff heavy cable; one that may have
fallen down out of sight.  If you can't see it anywhere, try to trace
the heavy cable back from the starter, make sure it's there.

And if that's not it; this saga made a flashback for me.  A gazillion
years ago, when I studied and worked both a full time and a part time
job - there were never ever enough dollars to buy a new solenoid or the
time to install it if there were.  Had an old Olds, would start only
once in a while.  Rest of the time, I had to make durn sure it was in
Park, parking brake on.  Get down under the car with a screwdriver and
a small hammer.  Use the screwdriver to connect battery to the solenoid
input (get the click) and then tap gently on the starter 'till she started.

Thinking that you said it wasn't fun to r+r the starter, maybe sorta
the same thing would work if the OP really wants to check.  Safer and
easier - get a trusty friend to put 'er in park, hand brake on, foot
firmly on the service brake, and hold the key in the start position.
Then a few sharp raps on the starter with a hammer, or maybe a broom
stick (don't know where it is in his car) should confirm.

Take care.

Ken

Hi...

Houston, we have a problem.

Can't turn the starter 'till there's oil pressure, can't possibly
have any oil pressure 'till the engine's at least cranking...

Take care.

No oil pressure should kill the fuel pump. She should still crank all day
long. Not that it's a good idea.  ;)

&gt;&gt; There is no computer input for low oil.  The oil pressure switch is a

&gt;&gt; let you run the  engine with zero oil in it until the engine destroyed

I agree - that's why I said &quot;Well - definitely get a multimeter out and
rule out any poor connections in the power feed (look for voltage drop

No I agree.  This is why I have suggested twice to get a multimeter out.

Ken,

I've confirmed bad solenoid contacts using the hammer method (not with the
screwdriver though ... I have a partner in the vehicle turn the key to start
while I rap lightly on the starter and take car not to be anywhere near
anything that turns/moves under the vehicle) on many occasions!

I find Nippondenso starter contacts last us about 5-7 years and 50-80K
miles.  I buy them now from a source on the Internet for pretty cheap and
have them here ready and waiting since I have 3 Chryslers and a Mitsubishi
that all use them!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any suggestions?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If it's not a poor electrical connection as others have suggested,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the starter solenoid contacts may be worn out.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Denso/Nippondenso
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; starters that Chrysler uses in a lot of its vehicles is known for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem after some age/wear (starter operation becomes intermittent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; due
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to worn solenoid contacts).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If this is the problem, then it's just coincidence that it happened
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you replaced the radiator.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for the reply, do you really think it was such a coincidence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the solenoid went out right when I fixed the one tube, it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literally no more than 5 minutes later.  I don't know exactly what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these things do so if this single click is usually suspect of a bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solenoid then I trust ya :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well - definitely get a multimeter out and rule out any poor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; connections
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the power feed (look for voltage drop or loss with key in the start
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; position) before you assume it's the solenoid contacts.  The starter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a moderate PITA to get out.  Cycle the key to &quot;start&quot; several times
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - usually the solenoid contacts will be intermittent, at least when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem first shows up.  IOW - if you cycle the key several times, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; might decide to start about the 5th time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I tried to start it about 15 times straight and it was a no go.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I tried jumping the battery but it was a no-go. I checked all the

&gt;&gt;&gt; little oil in it because I was about to change it when the rad when
&gt;&gt;&gt; bad and a tiny bit leaked out the tube when I replaced the radiator. I

&gt; Hi...

&gt; Having trouble accepting the coincidence of the starter solenoid contacts
&gt; going from good as new to nothing simultaneous with the work the OP did,
&gt; so...

&gt; Hoping that Winnipeg, Canada is too far away for either you or the OP
&gt; to come and punch me in the nose, I'd like to suggest once more that
&gt; he take a real good careful look at the battery positive (or extension
&gt; connection post) and make absolutely sure that he replaced all the
&gt; cables.  Looking for a real thick stiff heavy cable; one that may have
&gt; fallen down out of sight.  If you can't see it anywhere, try to trace
&gt; the heavy cable back from the starter, make sure it's there.

&gt; And if that's not it; this saga made a flashback for me.  A gazillion
&gt; years ago, when I studied and worked both a full time and a part time
&gt; job - there were never ever enough dollars to buy a new solenoid or the
&gt; time to install it if there were.  Had an old Olds, would start only once
&gt; in a while.  Rest of the time, I had to make durn sure it was in
&gt; Park, parking brake on.  Get down under the car with a screwdriver and
&gt; a small hammer.  Use the screwdriver to connect battery to the solenoid
&gt; input (get the click) and then tap gently on the starter 'till she
&gt; started.

&gt; Thinking that you said it wasn't fun to r+r the starter, maybe sorta
&gt; the same thing would work if the OP really wants to check.  Safer and
&gt; easier - get a trusty friend to put 'er in park, hand brake on, foot
&gt; firmly on the service brake, and hold the key in the start position.
&gt; Then a few sharp raps on the starter with a hammer, or maybe a broom
&gt; stick (don't know where it is in his car) should confirm.

&gt; Take care.

Ken, Bill, Blackfoot,

Thanks for the flurry of replies, I really do appreciate you taking
time out of your night to help me :)

Ill try the starter trick tonight, I had an old Hyundai and I had to
get under with a hammer for a while to get it to start sometimes.

I just have one thing I cant get off my mind, if you can put it to
rest that would help.

The car started just fine when we first put the radiator in, I turned
it off for not all of 30 seconds to fix the transmission fluid hose
then it wouldn't start, is their anything I could have done to a
battery terminal or switch that I wouldn't have noticed? I tend to
have okay luck with cars when I work on em and hope that a starter
going bad (or solenoid) at the exact time I was fixing another part
would be improbable but Ive checked everything else I can think!

I let the battery charge for about 15 minutes and it still wont turn.
I have the day off tomorrow to sit in the 112 degree heat and work on
this thing :)

Again, if I see any of you in a bar, first rounds on me....I don't
drink much so Ill have a Dr. Pepper...

Excuse me - but there is only one engine oil pressure sensor on this
vehicle, and it is the pressure switch for the idiot light on the
instrument cluster.  It does nothing but control that light.  Its output
does not go to any of the computers, and has no control whatsoever of
the fuel pump or the fuel pump relay.

LOW OIL PRESSURE WILL NOT SHUT THIS ENGINE DOWN.

Here is the schematic from the '98/'99 LH vehicle FSM of the one and
only engine oil pressure sensor (a switch) on this vehicle:
ttp://images27.fotki.com/v972/photos/4/42816/143201/ncordeoilpressurewiring diagram-vi.jpg

I defy you and challenge anyone to present a schematic or a second
engine oil pressure sensing part of any kind on this vehicle.  There is
no other on ANY 2nd gen LH car (probably 1st gen. too, but I don't know
for sure on that), and the schematic is correct in showing no connection
to anything other than the power from the fuse and the low oil pressure
indicator in the cluster - ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION TO ANYTHING THAT
WOULD SHUT IT DOWN FOR LOW ENGINE OIL PRESSURE.

Would everyone please quit saying that there is any sensor that will
shut this engine down for low oil pressure.  If you disagree with that,
then put up or shut up: Present either an accurate (i.e., from Chrysler
FSM) schematic of the 2nd gen. LH car showing a second engine oil
pressure sensor and/or a part number for an engine oil pressure sensor
other than the low oil pressure light switch shown in the shcematic
linked above.

Not trying to be rude, but I find it necessary to be emphatic about this.

Just to add - I suppose it it possible that an engine could shut off
when its lifters totally collapse (if that happens before the bearings
get destoyed) - certainly power would be reduced as lifters lost their
oil supply.  I can accept that as a possibility.  But there is
absolutley no shut down wired into any low engine oil pressure sensor or
switch on this vehicle.

The neutral interlock has NOTHING to do with the car shifting out of
park and to neutral. Its a switch that disables the starter whenever the
gear selector is in anything but neutral or park. If the wires get
knocked off, its the same as if the car were in &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;reverse.&quot;

Bill,

Excellent site.  Great prices!  In the past I've managed to simply replace
the contacts and wire brush the plunger.  This has worked fine and I've
always sold the vehicles before they needed a second set, but at this price,
I agree it would be best to replace the plunger second time around!

I will file this site for future reference.

Glad to give you something to be excited about, Bob. :)

Seriously - I was happy when I found it too.  Saves all the looking up
the various Denso starter applications and replacement contacts parts
that seems to be the norm for the various internet sources for the
contacts that people have provided links to in the past.  And - yes -
about the best price I've seen for what you get.

Hence the word 'should'. My point was that in no way would it prevent the

So are you bound and determined *NOT* to get the voltmeter out and
troubleshoot it, i.e., find out where the power gets interupted on the
way to the starter?

OK, divide and conquer.

Get a multimeter with alligator clips.  Put it right on the starter bolt
that
feeds the high current power to the starter, then the frame of the car.
If you have a built in solenoid it should read 12v.  If you have an external
solenoid, it might read 0 or 12v.

Try to start the car and watch the meter.  What it does when it doesn't
start will help tell you where to look.

If it drops to a volt or so and the starter doesn't crank, it's PROBABLY
a battery/cable issue before where you're measuring.  Start moving back
towards the battery.  If you measure the voltage right on the battery post
and it drops and still doesn't start, it's gotta be something with the
battery.
As you move back toward the battery, if you suddenly see it STAY at
12v or at least stay somewhat high where previously it was diving to 0
you know you just passed the bad point.

If you have a solenoid in the starter, put the meter on the 'control' post
for
the solenoid.  If you see it change when you try to start, chances are the
problem is internal.  If it doesn't change, then it's a problem somewhere
else in the car like an interlock or even the key switch.

All right guys, heres what I did,

I didnt want to break out a multimeter for one good reason, I didnt
have one :)

Yesterday I bought a new negative cable, positive cable, fusable link
and battery....and a multimeter :)

I put all the goodies in and it still gives me a single click, I got
the meter out but right when I was about to test a huge downpour came
and has kept me from the car since.

ill post when I go at it with the MM

The numbers you've quoted below do not make much sense, at least to me since
nominal battery voltage should be between 12 and 14 volts DC.

Can you explain where you had the multi-meter leads attached?  Also, which
jacks on the MM were you using and what range had you selected at the time
you saw these numbers?

What DC voltage do you read across the battery terminals before attempting
to start the vehicle and again during the period when the ignition key is
turned to start?

Not necessarily.

If it's a cheap meter and it's reading a bit high that could be valid.  If
the
starter is not engaging at all, and turning the key to start turns off other
loads (like headlights), it's quite normal to see a voltage rise like this.

At this point, you have to look why the starter is not engaging, and the
next step is to see if the solenoid is triggering.  If it is, then the
problem
is in the high-current patch between the solenoid and the starter.
I had an older Dodge Caravan that the 'transfer bar' was pitted and
had this exact symptom.  I couldn't get a replacement part on a Sunday,
so I took it apart and put it back together with the bolts used for
contact rotated 180 degrees (they were pitted only on one side of the
bolthead so this exposed it to fresh metal) and put it back together.
I picked up new parts from the dealer on Monday, but they stayed in
the glove box for 10 years and were still there when the van was gone.

If the problem is no signal to trigger the solenoid, then you have to
backtrack from there.

I agree with the others - something's not right there.  You are not
using the meter right or the meter is defective.

AND - you have to know *where* on the starter you are putting the meter
lead.  The hot lead from the battery goes to the input side of the
solenoid.  That would always be &quot;hot&quot;.  *IF* the solenoid contacts are
bad, you need the meter lead on the ouput side of the solenoid/input
side of the starter motor which *should* b ground with ignition switch
off, and nominal 12 volts when igntion switch is in the &quot;start&quot;
position.  If that last reading is significantly lower than 12 volts
(say, anywhere from 0 to 9 volts), then the contacts are bad like I've
been suggesting since my very first post in this thread.

To reiterate: You have to realize that the contact is a large relay that
passes the huge current from the battery to the starter.  It's the
output of the solnoid contacts that you have to look at with the
ignition switch in the &quot;start&quot; position - *not* the hot wire from the
battery.

I agree with the others - bad meter or you're not using it right.  No
way you have over 13 volts anywhere with the engine not running and no
charger on it.

You need to be looking at the *output* side of the solenoid
contacts/input to the starter motor - *not* the hot wire from the
battery to the solenoid.

Bull Crap.  The chances of an electronic meter being 40% off is nil.
Hell I've got a handful of meters here that came from Harbor Freight
for $1 each.  You aren't going to get much cheaper than that and they
are dead on every time.

To the OP:
You need to have the meter on the DC Volt scale and on the setting
somewhere near 20V (depends on the scales on your meter)  Mae sure you
have the leads plugged in to the right two hole.  The black one should
be in the common and the red in the voltage (usually indicated by a
straight line for DC and a wave line for AC and the letter V).  Start
by checking the voltage across the battery terminals.  This will tell
you that the battery is charged and that the meter is set and working
properly. Voltage should read somewhere close to 12v.

You want the black lead to go to ground and the red lead to go to the
power lug on the starter itself (not the solenoid).  It should read
0.0 until you turn the key to crank then it should go to whatever
voltage the battery was at from the step above.  Decimal points don't
matter but if you read 12v at the battery and 8 volts at the starter
then you know you either have a bad connection / bad points in the
solenoid or the engine is locked up and the starter can't move it.  If
the engine is locked up the cables should get warm to the touch after
a few seconds of trying to crank.

CAUTION:  You most likely have bad contacts in the starter as others
here have said.  Those contacts can suddenly work again at any point
in time!  You should connect your meter using alligator clip leads and
have yourself safely away from the car when someone attempts to crank
it.  If it cranks while you are under there holding leads to the
starter and not expecting it you will jump and that jump could cause
you a great deal of injury.  You can have the car fixed but you can't
necessarily get a mangled arm put back right again.

Bull Crap?  You obviously don't know anything about meters!

I've seen a cheap flea market meters read a whole volt offset across the
board.  While that is a cheap meter, better meters rarely have problems
like this.

I've seen an otherwise decent B&amp;K meter read over 1.5x high on every
scale as the battery went weak.  Most meters don't do this until well
after the batteries are too way too low for use, but if someone doesn't
notice the battery indicator.

In either case, you can still use the meter to see a trend or what is going
on, it's just not valid for quantitative measurements.

Why?  Do you have hidden knowledge of this situation?  Or are you
all powerful.

Just asking.

I'd have to ask what color your hair is.  You may be mechanically inclined,
but you obviously know little or nothing about meters or how to use them

I really hope you're not in a position to service anything electrical in a

&gt; If it's a cheap meter and it's reading a bit high that could be valid.  If
&gt; the
&gt; starter is not engaging at all, and turning the key to start turns off other
&gt; loads (like headlights), it's quite normal to see a voltage rise like this.

&gt; At this point, you have to look why the starter is not engaging, and the
&gt; next step is to see if the solenoid is triggering.  If it is, then the
&gt; problem
&gt; is in the high-current patch between the solenoid and the starter.

&gt; I had an older Dodge Caravan that the 'transfer bar' was pitted and
&gt; had this exact symptom.  I couldn't get a replacement part on a Sunday,
&gt; so I took it apart and put it back together with the bolts used for
&gt; contact rotated 180 degrees (they were pitted only on one side of the
&gt; bolthead so this exposed it to fresh metal) and put it back together.
&gt; I picked up new parts from the dealer on Monday, but they stayed in
&gt; the glove box for 10 years and were still there when the van was gone.

This particular starter/solenoid is not the type that you can rotate the
solenoid contacts 180°.  Again - read my earlier posts in this thread.
I have this exact year and option package/engine Concorde, and I
replaced the solenoid plunger/contacts (Nippon Denso starter) just a
couple of months ago.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If the problem is no signal to trigger the solenoid, then you have to

Yes - we (several of us) have been addressing that with the OP, giving
specific details.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bull Crap?  You obviously don't know anything about meters!

&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen a cheap flea market meters read a whole volt offset across the
&gt;&gt;&gt;board.  While that is a cheap meter, better meters rarely have problems
&gt;&gt;&gt;like this.

&gt;&gt;That's nice but the OP said he was reading 17v.  Don't know where you
&gt;&gt;live but here 17 - 12 = more than 1

&gt; Now YOU don't know what you're talking about.  Vehicles are not 12v!
&gt; It's the nominal voltage if you want to pick nits.  And that seems to be the
&gt; extent of your ability in this.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen an otherwise decent B&amp;K meter read over 1.5x high on every
&gt;&gt;&gt;scale as the battery went weak.  Most meters don't do this until well
&gt;&gt;&gt;after the batteries are too way too low for use, but if someone doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;notice the battery indicator.
">

Without knowing what kind of meter (analog or digital) or anything else
about it, if the batteries are going out, all bets are off about what
any reading means.  IOW - I wouldn't draw any conclusions whatsoever
from the OP's post on his readings whether it's due to low batteries or
something else.

If a meter is reading 17 volts on a wire that can't possibly be at more
than 13 volts (engine not running), I don't draw any conclusions (other
than something is seriously wrong with the reading).

The tension between you two aside, I have to side with Steve on this.

I'm just saying that a lot of  non-electrical type people leave the meter in
the
box and forget about it.  They don't use it for quantitative work on a
regular
enough basis to trust absolute readings.  The meter may be in there for
weeks without use, then when they use it it's lucky to work at all.

In that case, even a bad meter still tells you something.  A failing meter
may not be close at all to registering an accurate voltage, but you can
STILL use it to see what's going on.  Does it matter that it reads 12v, or
14, or even 18?  The meter is going to be used to see the 'trend' and
see 'what happens', not take a measurement.  In fact, I'd go so far as
to say that 99% of the time with automotive work, a test lamp
would tell a good tech almost as much as a meter.  Especially when it
comes to diagnosing a starter issue.

Sorry, I guess I just tripped off on the incredibly helpful comment
telling the original poster nothing other than that he didn't know how to
use a meter.

Again, I don't know how the do math where you live but down here in
the South 40% is more than a nit.  This car hasn't run since the 27th
of August and the battery was charged on that date so it is reasonable
to expect his battery is still in the neighborhood of 12v.  If he was
reading 13 and it should be 12.6 thats a nit... 5 volts on a 12v
system is not a nit.

Yes, God forbid I can't afford to run down to Harbor Freight and pick
up another DVM for $1.07.  Have a handful running around here now and
each is as close to accurate as I will ever need to get.  And yes, I
still have the Simpson with a needle for the stuff that matters but
have never needed it on a car.

Yeah Yeah Yeah.  You don't know me and I don't know you.  You really
