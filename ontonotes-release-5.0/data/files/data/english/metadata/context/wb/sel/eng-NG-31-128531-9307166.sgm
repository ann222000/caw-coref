Recently I launched a new group:
http://groups.google.com/group/3d-printing-applications

I can access the group to manage things OK. I can participate using
email.

I can not participate via the web.

Help says to use the web as a participant I need to log in using my
gmail address. Obviously, I have logged on using my gmail account, for
some reason I still can't post and read messages using my browser.

I have several groups. This one, 3D Printing Methods and Applications,
is the only one not showing a discussion tab (link).

Have I set something up incorrectly in the settings or is something
broken&lt;grin&gt;

Thanks. I set the setting for discussions to &quot;hide&quot; and discussions
now display.

I guess when you have selected the word &quot;hide&quot; it means display on the
page. One might think that selecting the setting as hide it would mean
hide:)

You're right, it's quite unintuitive. You're not the first one to
notice it!
;-)
