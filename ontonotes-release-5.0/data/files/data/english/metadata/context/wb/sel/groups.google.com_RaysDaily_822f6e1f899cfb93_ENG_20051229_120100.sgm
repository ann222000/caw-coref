&quot;If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving be me&quot;

W. H. Auden

~~~

A friend and I were ringing bells for the Salvation Army's Christmas fund
last week. It is something I always enjoy doing since it provides me the
opportunity to see people as they really are. Too often we judge people by
their outward image without ever seeing who they really are below the
surface. Let's face it we all sometimes judge someone else on the basis of
our own prejudice and unfortunately we are wrong more often then not. It is
on these occasions that I learn how good hearts come in many disguises.

I am drifting again, I really wanted to tell you how much I enjoy spending
time with my fellow bell ringers and the other night was no exception. As
always we talked about this and that, things that we don't talk about when
we don't have hours to spend together. My pal shared with me her concern for
a friend of hers who is despondent and unhappy in her marriage of only three
years.

Our conversation got me thinking about relationships. As relationships
mature things change and often we change as well. Sometimes we become more
dependent on our partner and sometimes we become more independent. Too often
problems arise when couples move in different directions as their
relationship matures. Sadly too many fail to understand and support their
partner as they grow and pursue interests different than their own.
Generally love is still in place, it just takes on a different face, too
often it is a face we don't recognize.

Why is it that so many of us profess our love for another and then require
them to conform to our wishes? We all have the capacity to build
relationships based upon mutual affection and understanding, I know that the
people I care about still care about me even when I am off pursuing my own
interests. I also know I am happiest when they find pleasure in their
pursuits. Life is much more pleasant when those we care about live their
lives without facing any jealousy, fear, or unfounded criticism from us.

Passion fades and over time we may express our love for each other
differently then we once did. Happily true affection and compatibility can
grow as each year passes by. While the wine may not be as strong, it is so
much sweeter. This does not mean that romance dies; it only means that we
might run through the daisies on a spring day a little slower than we once
did, but that is OK since it gives us a chance to see things we might have
missed otherwise.

~~~

&quot;Affection, like melancholy, magnifies trifles; but the magnifying of the
one is like looking through a telescope at heavenly objects; that of the
other, like enlarging monsters with a microscope.&quot;

Pope Paul VI

~~~

Doug: I know you're crazy about that little daughter of yours. What are you
going to do when she starts to date?

Bill: I figure I'll take the first young man aside, put my arm around his
shoulder, and pull him close to me so that only he can hear. Then I'll say,
&quot;Do you see that sweet, little young lady? She's my only daughter, and I
love her very much. If you were thinking about touching, kissing, or being
physically affectionate to her in any way, just remember this: I don't mind
going back to prison.&quot;

Can our minds exist separately from our bodies?

If they could, we'd just send our minds to work and sleep in every morning.

~~~

SHE SAID THAT AT LAST, SOMEONE SUMMED IT UP....

1. The nice men are ugly.

2. The handsome men are not nice.

3. The handsome and nice men are gay.

4. The handsome, nice and heterosexual men are married.

5. The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men, have no money.

6. The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men with money think we are
only after their money.

7. The handsome men without money are after our money.

8. The handsome men, who are not so nice and somewhat heterosexual, don't
think we are beautiful enough.

9. The men who think we are beautiful, that are heterosexual, somewhat nice
and have money, are cowards.

10. The men who are somewhat handsome, somewhat nice and have some money and
thank God are heterosexual, are shy and NEVER MAKE THE FIRST MOVE!!!!

11. The men who never make the first move, automatically lose interest in us
when we take the initiative.

NOW ... WHO THE HECK UNDERSTANDS MEN??

She said: A man called the government office where I work and requested an
estimate of his benefits upon retirement. After I gave him the information,
he went on to inquire about his wife's benefits. I asked if she had ever
worked.

&quot;She has worked all her life making me happy,&quot; he replied.

That was nice, I commented, but had she ever contributed to a pension plan?

&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;We made an agreement when we got married. I would make the
living and she would make the living worthwhile.&quot;

Why get a Philosophy degree?

It's more respectable than a theatre degree, but you still get to drink lots
of espresso.

She said: Waiting for our aerobics class to begin, several of us were
standing around in our leotards chatting about fitness and diets. One woman
said that her brother-in-law had quit smoking, gone on a diet and lost
weight all at the same time.

Thinking to myself that no human being could possibly do this without
acquiring at least one other undesirable habit for compensation, I jokingly
asked her, &quot;What did he start doing instead of these things?&quot;

After a slight pause, she smiled and said, &quot;Well, my sister is pregnant
now.&quot;

It's not hard to meet expenses, they're everywhere.

~~~

Mrs. Rosen is having her house painted, and her husband comes home from work
and leans against the freshly painted wall.

The next day, she says to the painter, &quot;You want to see where my husband put
his hand last night?&quot;

He sighs and says, &quot;Look, lady, I got a tough day's work ahead of me. Why
don't you just make us a cup of tea?&quot;

I once bought my kids a set of batteries for Christmas with a note on it
saying, toys not included.

Bernard Manning

As I left the grocery store, I noticed two little kids, maybe six or seven
years old, selling candy bars in front of the store to raise money for their
school band.

&quot;I'll buy a chocolate bar on one condition,&quot; I said to the boys. &quot;You eat it
for me.&quot;

I bought one and handed the candy back to one of the boys.

He shook his head. &quot;I can't,&quot; he said.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

Looking me in the eye, he responded gravely, &quot;I'm not supposed to take candy
from strangers.&quot;

Remember, we all stumble, every one of us.

That's why it's a comfort to go hand in hand.

Stay well, do good work, and have fun.
