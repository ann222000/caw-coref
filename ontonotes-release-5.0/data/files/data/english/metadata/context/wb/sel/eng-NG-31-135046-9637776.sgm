So, how many people are takeing classes with John up at IVC? My reason
for asking is a little self serving. I don't know how many of you know
what happened to me, but I was in 2 car accedents over the summer, so
I don't have a car at the moment. I had been wondering that if any one
was headed up that way, if I could hitch a ride. If not, okay.

Thanks if anyone can,
Kenny
