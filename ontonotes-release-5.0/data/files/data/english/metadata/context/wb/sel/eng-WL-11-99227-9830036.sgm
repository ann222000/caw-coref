Click here for a larger version of the temperature graph shown smaller above. These are space measured mean temperatures by month. You can see that after the big spike in 1998, it's been pretty stable, but now it's in a nose dive. Were there any computer programs which predicted stability through the first decade of the 21st Century and then a full degree (fahrenheit) drop? Let me rephrase that, the computer models on which the Warmies base all of their alarmism, and for which they want us to hobble our economy forever, did one of those predict the past 10 years of reality?

Correction : The graph does not show the temperatures but is an anomaly graph, showing the difference from the 'normal' mean as measured betewen 1979 amd 2000. When it dips below the zero line, it's colder than usual. Sorry for not reading that closely. There are several systems of satellite remote sensing. SST is measurement of sea surface temperature. RSS is one of the satellite measurements, remote sensing system, which are the only reliable ones now (at least more reliable than surface stations but not without some controversy as the raw data needs to be adjusted for many factors , including the ever downward drift of satellites as a result of gravitational attraction). The other one generally referred to is called the UAH (University of Alabama at Huntsville) which has further fine tuned the raw data (and come to different numbers). There's also a measurement called GISS but I don't know what that stands for. It is much different recently from the RSS. Here's a good discussion of the reliabilty of each system. I'm an RSS man.
