This morning when I arrived at work, I noticed a dove hip hopping down
the sidewalk. Turtle dove, I think. I didn't think too much about it. He
(or she) is somewhat young.  We have had several dove nests on the
building this year -- one on the fire escape, and another in the 'a' of
the logo on the building.  I'm sure there are others, too.  I just
haven't found them.

So, when I go out to plug my meter at 09:30, he's camped out on my
windshield wiper.  And wouldn't you know, I didn't bring my camera
today.  I do have a crappy camera in my cell phone, so I've been using
it to take pictures.  Given its crappiness, I have to get too close for
his comfort. So he's been moving further away as I've gone out to take
pics.

The big dilemma is what to do at 4pm when I want to go home if he is
still there.  I'm hoping he will find someplace else once the sun comes
around, and the car starts getting hot.  A co-worker said she would go
out with me at 4pm, and try to catch him if he's still there.  She lives
in the country, and will take him home to live there. Sadly, dove season
opened this weekend.

I really hope his little pooplets didn't fall into the well of my
sunroof!

His pictures are at http://picasaweb.google.com/raineontheplain/Squatter
as bad as they are.

Aww, it looks and sounds sweet! (unless it decorates your car, of
course). I can't imagine that it will still be there later today, or
that it would stick around when you get in the car. Just in case
though, maybe you can bring along some bread or cracker crumbs to
tempt it off the car?

Cheers

Momma found him!

She took off across the street when I got too close taking pictures, but
she's back now. My co-worker said there were a couple more in the
driveway when she left earlier.  She stopped, and they hopped out of the
way.    It might be learn-to-fly day or something.  He got up on my car
somehow though.  Must have scared him getting up there.

I'll make a trip to the burger place next door before I leave if needed.
As many pooplets that he's left already, I'd hate to give him more ammo
until I have to!

We decided that if we have to move him off the car, we'll put him back
in the parking lot behind the building.  There's very little traffic
there, especially so after hours, and it's out of sight of those just
passing by.

I've been watching him from inside for a while.  He doesn't appear to be
injured. However, I really don't know how to tell. His wings appear to
be intact.  He gets close to the edge of the car, but when someone walks
close to the car, he flutters back a bit towards the middle.  Momma has
left him again.

Momma looks more like a mourning dove, and they are quite common around
here.  I read somewhere that doves start flying at three weeks.  I have
no idea how old he is, but he is much smaller than momma.

How cute to see them together!  The little one looks well on its way
to independence.

Learn-to-fly day is so much fun to watch.  We sit on our back porch
and enjoy!  This past time we had cardinals hanging upside down from
the feeder, someone slipped while trying to sit on the hook holding
the humming bird feeder and careened off into the bird bath...It was
really funny!!!

Well, Momma got tired of sitting on the hot black car, so she took off
and left him on his own again.  I went to the burger place next door and
bought some unsalted sunflower seeds.  My co-worker approached the car
from the street side, while I approached sideways from the front of the
car.  He decided he could fly then.  First he flew towards the building,
but he couldn't get past it as it is two stories tall, and he just
wasn't up to flying that far up.  He finally noticed the tree that had
been there all day right next to the car, and after a couple of false
landings on small branches, he found one big enough to support his
weight.  And there he stayed.  I dumped the sunflower seeds out on a
branch and the ground.  Then I filled the little cup they came in with
water and set it at the bottom of the tree.

Meanwhile, his brother(?) was off wandering around the parking lot.  I
started walking towards him, and he would just run as fast as his little
legs would carry him, but he didn't try to fly either.  Too cute. They
are fun to watch.  I'm sure they're OK, just a little unsure on their
wings.
