The words "Dirk Gently" caught my eye, so I got curious enough to see
what this post was.

Snip...

Sure enough, it seemed to be a work of fiction.

Scanning the paragraphs, the post even seemed to have a bit of humor
to it.  The guy's no Douglas Adams, but it seemed that there might
even be some narrative worth taking the time to read.

I keps seeing all these "MI5 Persecution" posts and I assumed they
were by some guy with "non-fiction" conspiracy theories but, at a
glance, this seemed to be someone trying to write a Dirk Gently story
-- maybe about a man who dies in a restaurant while eating a cat?

To be honest, I still can't get myself to read more than a couple
consecutive paragraphs.  My current theory is that while the guy can
write decent paragraphs, he can't get them to form a story.

But still...  Who is this author?  And why write odd short stories and
then post them randomly in such a way that they look like some kind of
lunatic spammings?

The BBC's h2g2 page on Mike Corley (the "MI5 Persecution" bloke) also
links to this page. I assume there's some connection, but I can't quite
see it myself.
