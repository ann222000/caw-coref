Hello! I'm very much a novice at the antique furniture collecting
business, but I've owned a piece of furniture for about the last five
years that has my wife and I completely baffled. It's a heavy oak
&quot;box&quot;, about 4' high by 2' deep by 3' wide. This &quot;box&quot; opens in the
front into two halves which swing outwards to reveal an internal
arrangement not unlike a secretary's desk or a rolltop, with a writing
desk that slides out, with two small oak supports that swing out and
underneath it. The writing desk also has two leaves which fold onto
the top from the left and right edges, giving more desk area while
stowing nicely. The exterior halves, or wings, also contain shelves
and filing trays, all in oak. The only reference I have to this piece
is from a family friend, who called it an Officer's or General
Officer's Field Desk. This name has gotten me nowhere with regards to
references in the furniture world, am I calling this desk something
wrong, or are they that obscure? Thank you very much for any help or
directions you can send me!

They were used by various businesses (wells fargo, for one)
because they could be folded and locked, stashing the stuff
tidily away from the cleaning lady's prying eyes.

Going off at a tangent (as ever) we cannot recall reading many enquiries
from the US about writing slopes (A.K.A writing boxes). Don't you have
them? or are they uncommon?

In what is now the UK every middle class household had one and often it
seems every adult member of that household.

If you are not sure what we are referring to they are usually featured
in Millars or Lyle's Christmas annuals.

One of the first Urban Legends that J-H came across when he started
dealing in the early seventies was about these boxes. It went thus- 'a
friend of a friend bought two slopes in Auction. When he got home he
discovered that one of them had a secret drawer inside that opened with
a spring mechanism (not uncommon). He opened it up to find some Gold
Coins.' He never did meet that friend of a friend and is convinced it
was a marketing ploy by unscrupulous auctioneers to drum up business
when writing boxes were two a penny. For our opinions on the scruples of
auctioneers please refer to earlier postings.

Hi---
My son has 1 of the 2'x2'x18&quot; boxes which
opens &amp; has pigeon holes, with a fold-down
writing surface. I think THAT is a field offic-
er's desk? At least it will fit on a pack mule &amp;
1 person can handle it--even has 2 leather
handles at the sides for lifting.

You're right, these are not common items in
the US. I've got 1, usually called a &quot;lap desk&quot;
in this country. Not sure why they aren't
popular, maybe because they are a little
uncomfortable on the lap?

They do turn up but not often. Lately I found a primitive
American one, rather too large and crude.
Two feet wide, about. Bigger than the fancy English ones
I've seen.
Condition was not perfect.
Mixed woods, hardwood top and pine for the secondary wood.
Had a lock marked &quot;London&quot; but it was a country piece.
Old square nails, too. Mid-ish 19th C., I would guess.
Nice old red paint on it though.
The sort of thing that would have flown out the door when &quot;country&quot; was
on
the word on everyone's lips over here.
It was a fun find.

"/>  There is no American equivalent to the British &quot;campaign
furniture&quot; because of the difference in the way the officer corps
was selected and the campaigns were conducted.

What a bachelor British officer would have toted along in the
baggage wagons as &quot;campaign furniture&quot; for his tent was purchased
with his own funds and intended for his private use, to be bought
and sold (along with his commission and rank, should he decide to
leave the service) or kept as a souvenier of his service.
Judging from accounts of the Napoleanic wars and the Crimea,
British officers who could afford it created a home away from
home atmosphere whenever possible, and some of them had excellent
taste. I have one book on London furniture makers that includes
sometrade cards and ads for &quot;campaign&quot; furniture. Some of it was
probably intended for travelling to the colonies as much as for
military use.

The motto of the US military has been for years, &quot;If we want
you to have it, we'll issue it to you.&quot; What my military
ancestors had as &quot;field equipment&quot; at any time after the
Revolution was almost always procured by the quartermaster,
constructed according to Army specs, often made by Army
carpenters, and issued to the officer.
There was very little chance of poshly furnished officer's
tents on an American military campaign. For one, the country was
too big and had too few roads to be hauling all that stuff
around. To put things into perspective, a typical western USA
fort had to take care of an area several hundred miles or more
across, but without roads and villages. My great-uncle's travels
through nortnern Mexico in pursuit of Pancho Villa covered more
territory than Wellington's Spanish campaign in 1/5 the time, and
the chase after Chief Joseph covered 1500 miles. Supply wagons
and mule trains hauled food and ammo, not officer's furniture,
rugs, and claret.
For two, the enlisted men would have lost all respect for
officers who used such falderols when they were in the middle of
a war. To quote great-uncle Ward, who was one of the officers
for the Buffalo Soldiers at Fort Huachuca ... &quot;you can't command
them to do a damned thing, but they'll follow anywhere you want
to lead them.&quot;

Married officers whose wives accompanied them to a post would
have better quarters, but the furnishings for the most part went
with the post housing because of the difficulty of moving
furniture in an enormous country with few roads and fewer
railroads. The posts within reach of the railroads and sailing
ships could be quite comfortable, but the rest of it was
hellaciously primitive.

In truth, most officers didn't do much writing at a desk in the
middle of a campaign. They normally carried a journal and wrote
out occasional notes to send back to headquarters, but if you
look at the photos and drawings of the civil war, you see darn
little furniture.

Don't think son's is as old as Civil War, I'd
put it at more like Spanish American or maybe
even WWI. Gotta be &quot;military&quot; çause he buys a lot of militaria &amp; it has &quot;the
look&quot;if you
understand what I mean.
The US military DOES issue ëverything' it
wants its personnel to have &amp; it has a fairly
distinctive style to it. Like you can spot a US
ammo box in the middle of a flea market?

It was as we say a good dinner and ink was not the only thing that

"/> Not only have *I* never had a writing box/slope that could be used on
the lap, but I doubt very much that they were ever intended to be used
on the lap. I would imagine, that they normally sat either on a desk
top, or on some other piece of general purpose furniture that was used
as a writing desk come whatever. For example, on a pembroke, library
table, sofa table or the like, and acted much like a stationery box
but with the additional feature of a writing slope. Further, some
writing boxes in my experience, have carrying handles, either to the
sides or to the top, other &quot;writing boxes&quot; have no handles at all.
These handless boxes I generally find are referred to as a &quot;lap (desk)
box&quot; IMO incorrectly referred. These of course don't open in the
&quot;middle&quot; like a writing box/slope, more like the action and look of
the top of a small davenport desk.

I would doubt very much that the quality or variation of the writing
boxes/slopes that normally turn up in the UK ever turn up in the
States. Any of the American dealers that I have had in my shop/s over
the years, have always been amazed (Gee-whiz!! Wow-wee!) when
presented with a fine Geogian/19th century writing box. IMO these
boxes are still undervalued. I sold a rosewood, brass inlaid c1840s
box (ink bottles missing) a week or two ago for under a 100 pounds,
now try buying a useless tea-caddy for under a ton, can't be done :-)

inside for holding pen, ink and paper. Just because it's called a
lap desk doesn't mean you have to hold it on your lap. Have you

However, don't expect things to have the same names over here

"/> Combining the writing box theme, along with the campaign furniture
theme, and throwing in a twist of lemon to boot, is a reminder of a
box I sold to a friend several years ago. A campaign piece no doubt,
with its brass mounted corners and retractable carrying handles, it
also bore a brass plate with the officer's name, rank and date c1830s.

Dimensions about (approx), 20&quot; long x 15&quot; high x 10&quot;-12&quot; deep, with
recessed handles to the sides and a recessed handle to the top. Having
an opening fall front, which acted as a writing slope, when opened,
and revealing a bank of drawers.The bottom drawer contained a pair of
ink bottles with pen tray in between and fitted divisions at the rear
of this drawer, the next drawer above that, designed for stationery.
The drawers above that again all being dummy (sham) The box lid (top)
also opened, and contained a pair of spirit decanters as well as 4
small drinking glasses, (lemon long gone) all held with-in their own
divisions, these drink items obviously being contained behind the
dummy drawers (thence the dummy drawers in the first place) The
decanters being &quot;period&quot; to the box, glasses of a later date and

"/>  The only real stuff I have owned was a chest my husband
purchased in Jamaica when his ship was surveying and running
water studies near there in the late 70s. He kept it after the
divorce (drat!). It was mahogany by Morgan and Sanders, of
Catherine Street, London, according to a pencilled note on the
underside of a drawer. Finish and construction matched the
claim, and if someone was going to make a fake, they would
certainly have picked a more prominent cabinet maker. As I

"/>  There were a few &quot;real&quot; ones to fondle and admire.
There were a lot of glaringly obvious repros of English pieces
on the east coast during the late 70s and early 80s. They had the
wrong mahogany (a look-alike from the Phillippines), the finish
was wrong (polyurethane!), and the brass was artillery shell
brass (darker and more orange than normal cabinetmaker's brass).
There were also some straight-lined old pieces tarted up with
brass mounts on the corners and inset handles to give them a
passing resemblance to the military style. I'm not sure what
style these had originally been.

much in price in Phoenix. I saw one about a month ago for $1700.

I've seen one of those, when I was on a buying trip with a friend
in the mid 1970s. It was a 1870s &quot;centennial&quot; repro of a Federal
table, with totally bogus date and shop info in ball-point pen on
the skirt. That was the same trip where the &quot;Italian Renaissance
wardrobe&quot; had thistle carvings and copper inlay. It flunked the

unpegged for shipping.

**Please note** Canadians and English hoteliers ban from answering.

btw ... Morgan and Sanders were a famous cabinetmaker, we aren't

Times up indeed, just missed your post by about 10 minutes. I have only
ever seen one campaign chest in the flesh and it's back boards were
horizontal. I've always wanted to build a copy of one these beasts, but
need a good measured drawing to work from. If you know of anywhere I
could locate a good set of plans let me know. Man, I love this business!

"/> Hope you didn't buy it Mike? :) I'm surprised that our expert missus
no name didn't get this one, perhaps, it was just too obvious and she
couldn't be assed in responding. Yea, that must have been it. Guess
you are not paying close enough attention to the current repro market
Mike, otherwise, you would have a better idea to what your doing, and
wouldn't be making such a fool of yourself. ;&gt;))

Nope Mike, not horizontal or even vertical ... in fact, no backboards
at all Maybe, missus no name will explain why and expand on that, but
then, this may be rather too obvious as well. :&gt;)))

Nope didn't buy it, it was in a museum travelling exhibit, there's not
much pre 1820 furniture of any sort here that isn't in a private
collection or museum. There is at present not much of a market for
military reproductions here, but I enjoy working on unusual pieces for
my own use and education. I find that when I actually build a piece, I
get a better insight as to why it was put together that way and the
thinking behind it's design, but when they won't let you behind the
ropes for a good squint at it , it's hard to come up with a good
measured drawing. This piece was in three sections and had a backboards
that slid in place like a drawer bottom to stiffen it up (according to
the diagram), having seen none other, except for those in auction
catalogues in the last 12 years, I gathered they were all built along
those lines.

Thanks for the information Ronnie, I've got a good source for Mahogany
@ $ 8.00 CDN a board ft and the shop is always full of bits of every
wood species know to man ( I haven't forgotten your Hardwood samples) to
build the rest out of. I usually build copies from original pieces I
like that come through the shop for repair, or at least take some
pictures and make measured drawings to work from. Our climate here is
really hard on antique furniture, with winter temperatures to -40 with 0
humidity and summers with + 38 and 100% humidity only pieces made in
larger numbers survive, so pieces like campaign furniture are almost an
extinct species here, but you never know, everyday in this business is
an adventure!

"/> Mike, military chests (English) were always made in solid wood. All
sides of the chest being in solid wood built like a trunk, and with no
backboard planking. Usually made in mahogany, although padouk, cedar
and camphorwood were also used ~ solid strong woods ~ never pine or
veneered as the repros would have one believe. Padouk, cedar and
camphorwood being used as it was proof against damp as well as a
repellant against moths.

The chest 'usually' made in two halves, with a variety of different
fittings, such as small secretaire drawers or deep helmet drawer. Both
halves of equal depth, and more or less regulation-sized, both halves
will include lock and lock rail to the top drawers on both (sections)
halves.

The construction although &quot;simple&quot; is strong and of high craftmanship,
unlike most of the normal 19th century furniture. Construction is by
mitred dovetailing, no nails being used in the main construction.
Drawers will have oak linings with pine reinforced runners and
half-round corner moulding on the inside, firmly glued to the sides
and bottom. All joints originally coated with strong glue and clamped
together. The side carrying handle would originally have been made of
iron, but most of them have been replaced with brass handles to match
the normal flush, sunk drawer fittings. For obvious reasons, military
chests were not mounted on any kind of feet or base, sometimes small
castors mounted on additional blocks have been fitted, no protruding
hardware or indeed any other parts, everything flush, with recessed
brass mounted corners with counter-sunk screws.

The mass-market repro of these over here, are pretty dire, usually
pine or veneer, low quality and all wrong. A few companies make the
inevitable &quot;replica&quot; still doesn't come close to an &quot;old&quot; one. The
biggest proportion sold as &quot;antique&quot; that I see, are either heavily
restored or just made-up from some other period piece that could be
converted cheaply and easily and passed off as a military chest.

I am no expert on costing, but I would imagine to make a copy from a
working drawing alone of any quality and with a passing resemblance to
an original would cost considerable, both in material cost and man
work hours. Provided of course, one could get enough &quot;old&quot; Padouk or
camphorwood, (the most desirable of woods, for these pieces) in the
first place. At the end of the day, it's usually more practical to buy
a rough or damaged piece, and have it properly restored. Rough
examples still demand high prices within the furniture trade. At the
likes of the Newark fair (Notts England) there are usually military
chests to be had. I see a lot turn up from that source in my neck of
the woods, and either passed on within the trade &quot;as is&quot; or fully
restored and offered to the private buyer by the High Street antique
shops. They are still in demand over here and as I said before sell
easily, at high cost, with near originals costing an arm and a legs,
all depends on one pocket size. :)
