Exodus 27
20 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring
thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn
always. 21 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail,
which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it
from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for
ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.

Exodus 28

1 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him,
from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in
the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and
Ithamar, Aaron's sons. 2 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron
thy brother for glory and for beauty. 3 And thou shalt speak unto
all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of
wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that
he may minister unto me in the priest's office. 4 And these are the
garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a
robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall
make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may
minister unto me in the priest's office. 5 And they shall take gold,
and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen. 6 And they shall
make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine
twined linen, with cunning work. 7 It shall have the two
shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and so it
shall be joined together. 8 And the curious girdle of the ephod,
which is upon it, shall be of the same, according to the work
thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
twined linen. 9 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on
them the names of the children of Israel: 10 Six of their names on
one stone, and the other six names of the rest on the other stone,
according to their birth. 11 With the work of an engraver in stone,
like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones
with the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be
set in ouches of gold. 12 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the
shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of
Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his
two shoulders for a memorial. 13 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;
14 And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work shalt
thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches. 15 And
thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after
the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and of
purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shalt thou make
it. 16 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the
length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof. 17 And thou
shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the
first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall
be the first row. 18 And the second row shall be an emerald, a
sapphire, and a diamond. 19 And the third row a ligure, an agate,
and an amethyst. 20 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a
jasper: they shall be set in gold in their inclosings. 21 And the
stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve,
according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every one
with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes. 22 And
thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen
work of pure gold. 23 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two
rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the
breastplate. 24 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold
in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate. 25 And
the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in
the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod
before it. 26 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt
put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof,
which is in the side of the ephod inward. 27 And two other rings of
gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the two sides of the
ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the
other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. 28
And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the
rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the
curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed
from the ephod. 29 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of
Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth
in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.
30 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in
before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children
of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually. 31 And thou
shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. 32 And there shall be
an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it shall have a
binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the
hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent. 33 And beneath upon the
hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and
of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between
them round about: 34 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell
and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about. 35 And it
shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when
he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh
out, that he die not. 36 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold,
and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE
LORD. 37 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon
the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be. 38 And it
shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of
the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all
their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that
they may be accepted before the LORD. 39 And thou shalt embroider
the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen,
and thou shalt make the girdle of needlework. 40 And for Aaron's
sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles,
and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty. 41
And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them,
that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. 42 And thou
shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the
loins even unto the thighs they shall reach: 43 And they shall be
upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle
of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to
minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it
shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.

Exodus 29

1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them,
to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock,
and two rams without blemish, 2 And unleavened bread, and cakes
unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with
oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them. 3 And thou shalt put
them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock
and the two rams. 4 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with
water. 5 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the
coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,
and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: 6 And thou shalt
put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.
7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head,
and anoint him. 8 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon
them. 9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons,
and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs
for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his
sons. 10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put
their hands upon the head of the bullock. 11 And thou shalt kill the
bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation. 12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock,
and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all
the blood beside the bottom of the altar. 13 And thou shalt take all
the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the
liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn
them upon the altar. 14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin,
and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a
sin offering. 15 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his
sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 16 And thou
shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it
round about upon the altar. 17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces,
and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his
pieces, and unto his head. 18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon
the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet
savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 19 And thou shalt
take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands
upon the head of the ram. 20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take
of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and
upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of
their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and
sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 21 And thou shalt
take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil,
and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his
sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be
hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments
with him. 22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump,
and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver,
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right
shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration: 23 And one loaf of bread,
and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the
unleavened bread that is before the LORD: 24 And thou shalt put all
in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave
them for a wave offering before the LORD. 25 And thou shalt receive
them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt
offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made
by fire unto the LORD. 26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram
of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the
LORD: and it shall be thy part. 27 And thou shalt sanctify the
breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering,
which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the
consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is
for his sons: 28 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute
for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering:
and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the
sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto
the LORD. 29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after
him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. 30 And
that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days,
when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister
in the holy place. 31 And thou shalt take the ram of the
consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. 32 And Aaron
and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is
in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 33
And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to
consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat
thereof, because they are holy. 34 And if ought of the flesh of the
consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou
shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because
it is holy. 35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons,
according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days
shalt thou consecrate them. 36 And thou shalt offer every day a
bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the
altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt
anoint it, to sanctify it. 37 Seven days thou shalt make an
atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar
most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. 38 Now this
is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the
first year day by day continually. 39 The one lamb thou shalt offer
in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: 40 And
with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part
of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a
drink offering. 41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and
shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and
according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an
offering made by fire unto the LORD. 42 This shall be a continual
burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet
you, to speak there unto thee. 43 And there I will meet with the
children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my
glory. 44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation,
and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to
minister to me in the priest's office. 45 And I will dwell among the
children of Israel, and will be their God. 46 And they shall know
that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the
land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their
God.

Exodus 30
1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood
shalt thou make it. 2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a
cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits
shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.
3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the
sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt
make unto it a crown of gold round about. 4 And two golden rings
shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners
thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall
be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 5 And thou shalt
make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 6 And
thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the
testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I
will meet with thee. 7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense
every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense
upon it. 8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your
generations. 9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt
sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering
thereon. 10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it
once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements:
once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

Ezekiel 43

Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they
may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the
pattern. 11 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew
them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings
out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof,
and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all
the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep
the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
12 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the
whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is
the law of the house. 13 And these are the measures of the altar
after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the
bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border
thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this
shall be the higher place of the altar. 14 And from the bottom upon
the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the
breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater
settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit. 15 So the
altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be
four horns. 16 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve
broad, square in the four squares thereof. 17 And the settle shall
be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares
thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the
bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look
toward the east. 18 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the
Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they
shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle
blood thereon. 19 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites
that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister
unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering. 20
And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four
horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the
border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. 21 Thou
shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn
it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 22
And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without
blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as
they did cleanse it with the bullock. 23 When thou hast made an end
of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish,
and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 24 And thou shalt offer
them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and
they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD. 25
Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering:
they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock,
without blemish. 26 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify
it; and they shall consecrate themselves. 27 And when these days are
expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the
priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your
peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.
