1)  Dylan (no question Bob Dylan was and still is THE MAN)

2)  Lennon (despite his tragic exit, Lennon was the soul of the The
Beatles.  His place is secure forever.)

3)  Many others (Bowie, Merle Haggard, McCartney...  Hell, even Angus
Young still gets his groove on!)

4)  Townshend (Pete simply stinks up the joint now.  Look at what
Dylan can still do!  Townshend reeks.  Get the cane and pull him
away. Even Daltrey is much cooler than Pete nowdays.)

Are you kidding me? Yes, Dylan was the rebel of the sixties, very
similar to James Dean of the fifties, but musically the guy couldn't
even sing his way out of a paper bag. He influenced countless
musicians and is still an icon of the &quot;do what thou wilt&quot; era, but I
never found him appealing to me personally or musically. Come to think
of it...his harmonica playing was and still is brilliant. Since I play
harmonica as well as the drums, I have to work extra hard to achieve
the sound he got on &quot;Rainy Day Women: 12 and 35&quot;. He is one of the
best harmonica players in rock.

I think Joan Baez answered this question a long time ago. He's
brilliant, he's talented but he's also vulnerable and a human being
like all others.

Beings humans we tend to value people by what they can do, not who
they are. Once in a while we artificially inflate that value for one
thing and forget the rest of them and look over those who have most of
the qualities we value in the first place. The most effective are
often the 'silent' ones.

That's your right but it's irrelevant to the man's stature as a composer and
performer.  What you need to consider is the number of musicians from the
60s who say Dylan opened the door to a whole different form of music, only
Elvis and The Beatles are mentioned as frequently in that sense.  Dylan's
importance is unrelated to his singing voice, it was his ability to
transform popular music from entertainment--boy-meets-girl dance songs--to a
vehicle for social and political expression that made him so different and
so significant.

You're also overlooking that Dylan has reinvented himself repeatedly
throughout his career, the world decides he's done and can safely be
consigned to the museum and bang, he comes back with a startling new album
that is not only commercially successful but establishes his musical
credentials all over again, and he's done that in every decade.  This guy
had a No. 1 album at age 65, he's the oldest person ever to do so, what
other performers from the 60s are winning best album awards at that age?

Aside from the fact that we're responding to a troll, anyone who has seen
Pete Townshend work a stage in the past eight years or so knows the remark
above is garbage, Pete is working his ass off again.  Anyone is free to like
or dislike the man's work as they please, but pretending he isn't delivering
work of a very high quality these days is demonstrably false.
