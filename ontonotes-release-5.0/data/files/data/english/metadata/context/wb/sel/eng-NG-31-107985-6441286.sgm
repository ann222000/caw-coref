Aaah, a spa. It used to be that you needed a Hollywood mansion to even
entertain
the thought; but now, home spas are popping up everywhere you look and
with good reason.
The basis for all the "ooh-ing" and "aah-ing" when people
settle down to soak
in their home spas is "hydrotherapy" or "water healing" which
was first made
famous by the Greek Hippocrates, the "father" of medicine, in the
4th century BC.
He used to prescribed bathing and drinking spring water for its
medicinal
benefits. Soaking in hot springs was another Greek favorite which was
quickly
picked up by the Romans who built thousands of communal baths which
were the
forerunner of modern home spas!
Although the number one "official" reason for the remarkable
increase in the
installations of home spas is to sooth overworked muscles and soak away
the
effects of stress caused by our hectic lifestyles, home spas are also a
wonderful socializing tool as many people have found out over the
years.
Having access to home spas means that although parties may start out in
the
living rooms, they often end up in the "spa room" accompanied by
soft music, low
lights, a little wine or spirits and a whole lot of relaxing. Bathing
suits are,
of course, optional depending upon the "house" rules!
