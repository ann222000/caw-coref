In almost every job, there comes that moment of dreadful clarity when
you finally realize that your employers have no intention of providing
adequate compensation for your efforts on their behalf. They may be
perfectly willing to shower you with attaboys, but steadily maintain
that business conditions prevent them from giving you any raises.

You realize that the long days, the late nighters, and the sacrificed
holidays with your family were all for nothing. This is such a
catastrophic letdown that your normally ebulent/hopeful/cynical mood
(choose one) can change to chronic apathy. Read on, because there is a
way out of this apparent dead end.

Sometimes, the best of jobs can turn into a dead-end job even though
you are pulling off miracles every week. Human nature being what it is,
you can find that your accomplishments are being ignored while other
employees find favor for work that is slipshod and erratic. Sometimes
this is due to nepotism, but more often it is due to subtle prejudices
that your employer is not even aware that he has.

Owner/managers tend to validate activities that they understand and
devalue those that they don't understand. They may view your activities
as a necessary evil. Technical people in a non-technical firm experience
this, but it also happens to salesmen, contract negotiators, and the
backbone of all small businesses, the office manager!

So, if you find yourself in a dead-end job, you are not alone. If you
are like most employees in this situation, you have been seeking
appropriate recognition for many years. Somewhere, back in your early
youth, you were given the idea that if you worked hard and followed the
rules, you would be rewarded for it. You probably ignored those who told
you that most employers were out to exploit you and would discard you
when you were no longer useful.

I know that I did. My father, a thirty year veteran of Westinghouse,
had this advice when I first began my career. "You can't rely on their
promises. They will suck you dry and then spit you out." He wasn't
bitter, just concerned for my welfare. I shrugged off his concerns,
because I wasn't a commodity, a clerical worker, I was a highly
sought-after design engineer.

He was right, of course, but for the first twenty years of my career,
I changed jobs whenever my pay failed to keep up with my contributions.
What I didn't realize was that I was a commodity with an openly quoted
market price. My ability to find new jobs was determined by supply and
demand for design engineers. If my current employer didn't want to pay
the going rate, someone else would. I changed jobs every three years,
each time getting a fifteen to twenty percent increase in salary.

Eventually, the days of reckoning came when I reached the executive
ranks. Being a Director of Product development or a VP of Operations, I
was much closer to the political maelstrom that exists in some
companies. Performance was secondary to political correctness, and I
have issues with that sort of ranking. As a result, I began to
experience the pangs of being ignored at raise time and found that there
was little apparent demand for my specialized abilities elsewhere.

I was able to handle this, but it took many iterations over the next
twenty-five years to be able to escape dead-end jobs cheerfully. Here is
some basic data which can help you: 1. Do the best work that you are
capable of every day. This will give you the confidence to seek new work
when it becomes time.

2. Consider yourself a long-term contractor, not an employee. The
company will discard you when it becomes expedient. You should be
prepared to do the same.

3. When it becomes apparent that you are not going to be rewarded for
your work, don't whine, get busy locating another job immediately. Stay
employed, but network like crazy until you turn up another opportunity.
I am not going to repeat how to prepare yourself for this next job
because I have written many posts about this already.

4. I discovered another useful escape route from a dead-end job when
there is no one to network with.

This came from observing a young relative who found herself in this
situation after eight years of major accomplishments. Promised raises
never seem to occur, although others in the company fare better. She has
decided to go back to school and get another degree to give her
professional standing in an area which she is already competent.

She had gotten herself into the trap of immersing herself into her
work and failed to develop a network of other professionals she could
consult with. Her expectation is that she will be able to develop a
network of useful contacts through the graduate business courses she
will be taking. I think she will have a good chance of doing that.

Hope this helps those of you in similar circumstances. To make it
easier in the future, I plan on compiling my articles on surviving work
into a book which will be available on line. I have the cover photo in
mind, but the title is still up in the air.

Good luck on making a clean escape! I was just going to write that
this should be a book :-) Glad to know you're authoring. You have
accurate and helpful info. Wish I'd known you years ago!

Good choice of cover photo! I'm looking forward to it. Your posts are
sometimes painful to read (ie. close to home!) but always useful.

I would like to hear what others have to say about the benefits and
pitfalls of continuing education. P.S. I like your cover photo too!

Here here. I left a dead-end job about 3 months ago, and for my
trouble and heartache, I now earn 15% more at my new job. Best thing
that I ever did.

I made the jump 5 years ago now, but the circumstances you describe
are absolutely spot on. Rules to think about - the company will only do
just enough to keep you there, it will never give anything away.
Redundancy is an everyday occurrence - it can happen to YOU.

Your post could not have come at a better time. I've been thinking
about taking my little marketing company full-time (It is a home-based
business now that I do on the side.), because I'm in such a job. I've
contributed to this organization for five years and have helped them
make great headway in terms of developing a strong internet presence.
But, there is no room to advance and I'm tired of the cubicle I call
home! So, again, thanks for your timely, much needed and much
appreciated advice!
