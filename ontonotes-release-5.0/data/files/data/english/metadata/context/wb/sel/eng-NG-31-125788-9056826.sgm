&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  So you want a business to have corporate welfare?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grumpy

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So you want hopefully profit making businesses to be all paid for by
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In that case, Grumpy.  How you give me 10 million so I can build a golf
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;course to make good money from with you not getting the money that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you've
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;given me to build it in the first pace, and with you not even getting 1
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fucking cent of the profits.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just make the cheque out to Scrooge Developments thanks, Grumpy.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You fucking rugby fanatics expect everyone else to pay for something
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the NZ Rugby Union hope to collect real big fucking profits from.  And
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;real
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;big profits they will be if they expect other mugs to do all the funding
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their big dreams for them.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the government wants it as well and expects to make big profits out
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;any hair brain ideas then let the government fund such money making
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;claimed
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;new stadiums themselves.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;E. Scrooge

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I notice it is National's darling Banks that has his hand out already
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- auckland deserve what they get.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;At least he got rid of the Labor boot licking  Hubbard..

&gt; &gt;&gt; Does winning the election excuse Banks from presenting Auckland as not
&gt; &gt;&gt; being prepared to take responsibility for their own affairs and
&gt; &gt;&gt; seeking yet another handout subsidy from the rest of New Zealand?

&gt; &gt;Fuck off!
&gt; &gt;Why should every other poor bugger pay for what's meant to be a huge money
&gt; &gt;making professional sport?

&gt; &gt;If rugby is making millions each year then let the bastards support
&gt; &gt;themselves, or at least find investors who will take the gamble on condition
&gt; &gt;that real investors of course get to share in the profits as well.

&gt; &gt;It could well be worth putting money into as long as investors got at least
&gt; &gt;a decent 12% interest return for the next 10 or 12 years.

&gt; &gt;Any new stadium should be considered as a good property investment if there
&gt; &gt;is any real money to made out of the buggers.

&gt; &gt;E. Scrooge

&gt; I take it that you agree that Banks is being utterly unreasonable in
&gt; epxecting the taxpayer to pick up the total cost of the development in
&gt; Auckland, and that instead of trying to get rates down by looking for
&gt; handouts he should start thinking about how he can make the Auckland
&gt; Council responsible for its own actions, and also honouring agreements
&gt; made by the previous Council.

&gt; A single building development could well attract private investors -
&gt; but it may be better for the Council to raise the funds itself at
&gt; lower cost than private comapnies could raise it, and pay the capital
&gt; development off over time from profits from operating it.- Hide quoted text -

The profits from operating it !!!, what planet are you on, have you
seen the poor attendances to all but the occasional match.

Let me painstakingly explain it, yet again for you, the IRB is an
enormously wealthy business entity.

Professional rugby is no longer just a sport, it is an international
business enterprise.

If the IRB wants these gargantuan edifices built to enable it to rake
in the profits then let them raise the funding required.

It would be the equivalent of a giant overseas grocery chain wanting
to start up operations in New Zealand, then the idiot Labour
Government demanding of Councils that the ratepayer foot the bill for
building, maintaining, and operating the chains commercial premises.

How in Gods name did this country elect a Government of such screaming
dimwits.

Largely because of the stupid incompetent destructive greedy actions of the
previous one.
Simple eh. History repeats......now it's their turn again.
