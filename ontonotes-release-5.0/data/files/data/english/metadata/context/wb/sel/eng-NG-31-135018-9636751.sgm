For those out there that have or had the Wacom Intuos pens and pads was just
wondering how you would rate them for correcting pictures and etc. Thanks.

Cannot beat it!  When I first started, I was like, don't need
it..............  Started doing more illustrations, okay
maybe.............  Now where ever I go and will be working on the
computer I bring it.
It's an absolute must if you are really into any graphic element on
the computer.

If you are not sure, go with a cheaper model.  For what you are doing,
that would probably be fine.  As far as pad size, really factor in
what kind of working space area you have.

Wouldn't be without one. However, now besides having the expensive Intuos 3
or the cheaper Graphire 3 you have the three new Bamboo models to choose
from.

I write more than I paint, and draw more than I paint, too.

We've had them here for obvious reasons (to learn about them) but long-term
they're not taught in every schools (used, I should say), so they're
somewhat outside our realm.

People we know who use them, though -- and that number is in the dozens --
love them to death. I don't think I know anybody that's bought one and hated
it. Maybe not used it, but not hated it either :-)

Waaay better than mousing it, much finer control, much smoother lines. I
envied my buddy's Intuos for some time before finally biting the bullet and
getting my own. I rationalized the purchase but thought of it as more toy
than tool-- was I ever wrong; today I couldn't live without it.

I really wonder what they heck you guys are doing to your tablets! I
also have 3; one tiny one I carry around with my PowerBook, a big one at
my desk at the studio I work at during the day, and a huge one on my Mac

scratches! I use them a lot, and the oldest one (the one with my laptop)
has had some pretty rough treatment over the years (photo retouching on
the fly at music festivals, been dropped several times, had small
children try to carve their names with the pen into it....).

Based on the thread here, I ordered a tablet (9 x 12 Intuos) and I've
never used one, but I'm confused by those of you who are adding a glass
layer.  On their website, they talk about different levels of pressure
(I think there are 1024) and pen angle, etc.  Doesn't glass eliminate
that?

&gt;    May be you need to use the tablet more often?  Here, I am very gentle with

&gt; Wacom sells Overlay sheet and Nips replacement).

Could be! I spent many hours every day in PhotoShop and Illustrator
(although, to be honest I prefer the mouse in Illy), but I also spend
more hours working in Flash and FCP, which I use the mouse with.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    I use pen 100% and no mouse for over a decade.  The Intuos is only few
&gt; months old and I already feel one side of the nip wore out a little.
">

I couldn't work like that... for one, it wouldn't really work well with
my primary setup (19&quot; + 30&quot; + 19&quot; desktop) as they don't make tablets
anywhere near the right aspect ration for me! The pen is fantastic in PS
and Painter, but I find it slows me down in other programs.

I tend to use PS full-screen-no-menus.

I agree. My oldest is about 12-15 years old, and is still fine. I have yet to
even replace a nib on any of the stylii. I use these for PS and a ton in
Painter with a lot of pressure-sensitive movement, but still have the original
overlays and even nibs. I normally spend about 5 hours per day on one tablet,
or another, and have spent 23.5 hrs./day, at some points.

If one went with glass, I'd suggest a lightly frosted pane, but then I like a
tad of resistance with my stylus, like a Speedball on watercolor paper.

Really?  I must have gotten an unusually resilient overlay sheet because my

&gt;    The level isn't based on the pressure you press on the tablet, and the pen
&gt; doesn't need to touch the tablet for it to work.  The pressure is on the
&gt; nip, and the nip contacts some mechanical part inside the pen to give
&gt; different level of pressure.  I believe most if not all my older tablets (I
&gt; started using tablet little more than 2 decades ago) you can feel the nip
&gt; moves in when you press.

&gt;    Also, try to place your pen arounf 1/4-1/2&quot; above the tablet and move
&gt; around to see for yourself.  Also, the Overlay sheet usually clear and you
&gt; can lift it up to insert the drawing, photo whatever under the overlay sheet
&gt; so you can TRACE.

&gt;    And that's why the original PUCK has a piece of clear plastic sticking
&gt; out, and you see the cross &quot;X&quot;.  It's a long link but you can see what the
&gt; puck looks like

Unreal Tournament 2004
I use a logitech joystick
so 360's are easy&gt; modified user.ini file to make the strafe axis do turning
it has software to create macros or match any key command to the stick
I use the mouse in left hand to look up down&gt;&gt; big buttons on top to strafe
(double tap to dodge)
side buttons to jump and crouch (MS Intellimouse)

it's a weird set up I got used to when I shared a comp w hubby and he did a
lot of flying sims
so a joystick was the controller we had
I figured out how to do Half Life with just the mouse but it was frustrating
to change my setup

started with quake 1 and 2 got 3 and dropped it
had all versions of Unreal since it came out
hear I will need a new comp for the latest not out yet version

I like FPS only and mostly play team mods like Cap the Flag

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For those out there that have or had the Wacom Intuos pens and pads
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was just wondering how you would rate them for correcting pictures and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc. Thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had mine for several years now...  It's excellent for photoshop...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's also great for playing online games (Quake2 &amp; 3)...  Best of all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no batteries to worry about in the mouse if you use it...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Babs

&gt;&gt;&gt; well I am a gamer fps
&gt;&gt;&gt; and always wondered if I would be able to use the pen for a controller

&gt;&gt;&gt; did you have to modify your Player-user.ini to make it work?

&gt;&gt; No, not for the mouse other than indicating which mouse button would do
&gt;&gt; what function (shoot/jump/etc)...  As to the pen, I don't think you could
&gt;&gt; do turns and such with the pen like you can with the mouse...  Should be
&gt;&gt; able to strafe, run, and all but turning on the spot would be difficult
&gt;&gt; (I would think)...

&gt;&gt; What games do you play?

&gt;&gt; Babs

&gt; Unreal Tournament 2004
&gt; I use a logitech joystick
&gt; so 360's are easy&gt; modified user.ini file to make the strafe axis do
&gt; turning
&gt; it has software to create macros or match any key command to the stick
&gt; I use the mouse in left hand to look up down&gt;&gt; big buttons on top to
&gt; strafe (double tap to dodge)
&gt; side buttons to jump and crouch (MS Intellimouse)

&gt; it's a weird set up I got used to when I shared a comp w hubby and he did
&gt; a lot of flying sims
&gt; so a joystick was the controller we had
&gt; I figured out how to do Half Life with just the mouse but it was
&gt; frustrating to change my setup

&gt; started with quake 1 and 2 got 3 and dropped it
&gt; had all versions of Unreal since it came out
&gt; hear I will need a new comp for the latest not out yet version

&gt; I like FPS only and mostly play team mods like Cap the Flag

I've never tried UT, will have to give it a go...  I only do Q2 and 3 right
now...  I only do DM, tried CTF a few times but found that the need for
cooperation w/ a bunch of idiotic 13 year olds w/ all their senseless
cursing too irritating to bother (easier to ignore in DM)...  That was years
ago though, I should give it a try again, those 13 year olds should be in
their 20's by now and maybe mature enough to be fun to play with...
:-)

I'll never forget playing Q2 w/ RatGirl, my voodoo card decided to crap out
on me hours before the match and I had lag and PL so bad I was embarassed...
It was supposed to be the big game between the 2 girls and my butt was
creamed...

Anyway, my wacom mouse works just fine (in my left hand, right hand is for
hand controls) - glides along just fine after all these years...
