Haven't checked in for quite a while. Anybody worth conversing with still
here? Henry? Sullivan? Zem? John T? Todd? Chris J?

Has b ever reared his ugly head again? How about, er, what's-his-name, you
know, the jr. college English instructor from CA? yesdick or variations
thereof? Who's the new whipping boy? Who's the bully?

I see that the relationship between Nic and Rob is still the inspiring
embodiment of the Christian principles it's always been. And even a cursory
reading shows that Chet's bong is still in good working order.

Is Yes actually doing anything any more besides aging?

Hope everyone is doing ok.

Hi Tim. Nice to see you again.

Yes... well, it looks like there are serious discussions about a tour
next summer, but there's still a discordance between Chris Squire,
who's gung-ho for a lengthy tour and recording an album, and Jon
Anderson, who remains tentative. Meanwhile, Pete Banks wants in on the
act too and has been writing a couple of songs with Anderson (by e-
mail, it seems). That said, they're all busy with other projects:
Anderson is collaborating with everyone under the sun (including on
the new Glass Hammer album) plus he's got a solo tour of Europe in Nov/
Dec. Squire is making not one but two solo albums: an Xmas album is
due soon with his main solo project expected early next year... plus
he's appearing at the Ahmet Ertegun tribute. Howe has Asia and his new
jazz trio with son Dylan, and he's doing some shows with Yes tribute
band Fragile (one of whom is collaborating with Anderson). White has
Circa:, White and numerous guest appearances to keep him busy. Wakeman
is releasing umpteen albums and doing short tours (despite his
supposed retirement from touring).

changes his name regularly and is known by several other names. Like
all of his predecessors, he just doesn't get it. He is a Porcupine

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I wonder too. You completed a JD and were working on a PhD, isn't that
&gt; right? Lucky *bastard* ;&gt;

I completed a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics. 'Twas a steenkin' bitch,
that was. I was working full time and got delayed for a year because of work
issues. But I got the skin last May, finally.

*Now* I'm working on a JD. It's actually a joint MBA/JD program. Four years,
two degrees instead of three years for just the JD. Then I'll have 5
degrees. Sheesh. I never dreamed. The great news for me is, I don't have to
work... ever really... but for now, it's just school.

Hell, I may move to Austin and do a doctorate in astrophysics after this.
Not sure about that, though. It's a friggin 7 year program. I'd be 60 by the
time I did that. (But hey, I'd be one of the few people on the planet that
could *model* the impending collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda
galaxies on a computer and then *sue* somebody for it).

We sold the company in 2004 and I hung on until the Ph.D. was done because I
promised my old boss I would. She retired in June. My last day was October
5. She's hanging out at the beach. I tried that, but found that I need
something more. Don't get me wrong, I *love* the beach, but I get antsy
after a few days. Life is way too fucking short to waste time.

So I might actually have time for amy and other things now. Not much time,
but some.

Haven't done much musically. Somehow, some way, one of our songs got picked
up for a commercial on MTV2 *for* MTV2. I've never seen it. I don't watch
MTV2. But I get a check from ASCAP every month for it. They used 7 seconds.
Sometimes it plays once a week, sometimes it plays 50 times a week. Seems to
be ebbing away these days... and so with it, my professional music career
;).

Hang in there, Todd. Good to see you're still around.

I like what I've heard about it so far. If we're going to intrude on people,
let's at least err on the side of personal responsibility. We make people
buy insurance to drive a car. At this point, I'm in favor of any viable idea
that will take employers out of the health insurance business without
throwing it all at the government.

This approach has worked very well in Switzerland. Whether it would work
here is unknown. The demographic differences between the Americans and the
Swiss are, well, huge. But given that we're also far more productive here,
it seems like it might work even better. (Don't mean that as an insult to
the Swiss. They work hard. But they're not as *driven* as Americans in
general. And that may not be such a bad thing.)

Sounds like trouble: Hello Mr Smith, I'm a free lance medical
insurance broker. As you know, you must now buy medical insurance and
I'd like to show you some options to help take the sting out your of
being ordered by the federal government to buy something.
Or perhaps the notice in the mail: Mr Smith, We have noticed that you
have no medical insurance. You have the right to be covered. If you
cannot afford a plan one will be provided for you...

It looks like a nightmare to implement or enforce, never mind sell to
voters. If she can sell this one she deserves two terms and then
appointment to the UN after that.

At this point, I'm in favor of any viable idea

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It looks like the wedge that gets the government in the door. The cost
of care for those who can't afford it has to be worked into the
coverage of those who can. The hand the government would have in this
can only grow. Please tell me I'm wrong, I do want to see a way to
make it work.

In Canada, things are fully funded with tax money. In my experience
and with everything I have seen it works amazingly well. This totally
contradicts the far right horror stories I have heard of. However, our
health care system is an undeniable black hole with an insatiable
appetite for money. Here, health care is a political sacred cow. Any
mention of an attempt to improve it is smeared with a &quot;trying to
Americanize&quot; label. It seems that once the government is in charge of
it, there is no going back and the only acceptable change is more
money.

I suppose it comes down to accepting the cost of caring for everyone.
I got what I needed immediately when I needed it. It did help me to
see my lifetime of paying into it working well for me. In my case, it
may have helped as much as the medical care itself. :)

I still have to wonder, are we now at the point where everyone is
entitled to have all of their medical problems cared for by the
collective?

It seems America is the last place where universal heath care is
within grasp but where people are still trying to work it out without
handing it all over to the government along with everyone's wallet.

The government is already very, very deep into healthcare here: ERISA,
JCAHO, HIPAA, ANSI X.12, Medicare, Medicaid (50 of those plus DC), TRICARE
(formerly CHAMPUS), FDA, EEOC (yes, it's true), about 25 different versions
of tort reform, several hundred statutes governing MCOs, payers, 50
different state boards of insurance, federal insurance statutes, and the
list goes on and on and on. (This is all why I'm going to law school.
Ultimately, I want to design more software to deal with all this.)

Hillary's plan would curtail ERISA's influence on employers and reduce its
draconian preemption issues. It would eliminate 90% of HIPAA (but,
unfortunately, not the ANSI.X12 part of it). It *should* allow large chunks
of TRICARE and Medicare to go away. The rest would stay.

We dump a lotta shit in employer's laps around here. Healthcare is one thing
that really doesn't belong there. I can afford private insurance, but most
people can't. For my family, it's $1100 a month, and I'm really getting a
pretty good deal. In 17 months, after my COBRA (there's another one that
would go) runs out, that will go up to about $1600 a month.

I personally believe that the reason it's so expensive is because there's no
effective competition in the private health insurance market because all the
efforts are centered around employer groups. Well, fuck my employer. They
didn't administer my car insurance. I don't really want them managing my
health insurance. Many bigger companies are self-insured. In that situation
your employer *knows* about every doctor visit. No thanks.

Hillary's plan would *force* a change in the industry. One that would reduce
government's overall influence in the long run. It will create many problems
like the ones you identified. But see, Mr. Smith in your example is going to
meet the government on this issue somewhere, some time. It can either be, as
you described, in person at his home, in his mailbox, on the phone, or the
way it is now: At the ER.

This is all really just my gut reaction. I haven't read the plan. Only
newpaper accounts. I reserve the right to chupe up a lung if and when I do
actually read it.

Indeed.  I've thought this myself for quite some time.  The problem
isn't so much the cost of health insurance for the majority of Americans
who are in employer group plans; it's that anyone who doesn't fit into
that particular pigeonhole is completely screwed.  Perhaps part of the
solution (or a workaround) would be for the government to work to create
a group plan for those folks who don't fit into existing employer plans.

It occurs to me that group plans are also a big part of the reason we
don't seem to be able to get rid of Social Security.  If we could make
401k plans available to everyone, regardless of group membership, we
could give everyone back their FICA tax (or at least the portion that
goes to SS) and they'd have a *lot* more money waiting for them at
retirement than they would under SS.

I can give one good reason why health care is so expensive, at least in
certain circumstances.
I'm working in the Texas Medical Center in Houston these days. At any given
time there are several thousand patients in the TMC. Most of them are not at
any given time using the most super duper hi-tech machinery the hospitals
have at their disposal, but the costs of that machinery is worked into their
medical bills. Now if these machines were used with even marginal efficiency
they would be worth the cost, but most of the time they are just sitting
there waiting for another session.
Within 1.1 miles of my building there are around 20 MRIs, many more CAT
scanners, a few PET scanners....the list goes on....each of which gets
replaced every few years be a newer sexier model and each of which costs 10
or so millions of USDs (though they are usually leased, to be honest) all of
which gets passed on to the patients in the billing (and/or their
insurance).
Now if the several hospitals within this 1.1 mile radius were to share
resources, a couple of hundred million could be saved every 5 to 10 years.
Just in the TMC.

So in many ways, it isn't the plan that is the problem, it is what is being
paid for, the hidden costs in the billing.There is a lot more going on than
most people realize.

That's putting the cart before the horse, iddn't it? Group plans are
outrageously priced because insurance companies know that employers
can or will pay them and that individuals can't or won't.

Or we could just abolish group/employer plans completely and do health
insurance the way we do auto insurance. That would increase
competition and lower rates...and you could even mandate it as well.

Or we could just eliminate insurance completely (a racket, by
definition, if ever there was one) and let people pay per service.
Like one pays at the garage for repairs, to continue the auto
comparison.
