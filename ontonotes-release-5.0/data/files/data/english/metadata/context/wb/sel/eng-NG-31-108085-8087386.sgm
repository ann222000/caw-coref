How are the manuvers (roll, pitch, etc.) during shuttle boost phase
performed?  Are they done through the RCS, gimboling the engines, or by
moving aerodynamic surfaces?  Obviously once it's out of the atmosphere the
areo surfaces have no effect.

The SSME (Space Shuttle Main Engines) are gimbaled.  If you get the
chance, watch either the NASA channel or the Discovery channel right
before the next launch.  During the pre-launch checklist, they gimbal
the SSME to verify operation.  There are RCS on the orbiter as well
but they're mainly used while in orbit.

The SRB's also use thrust vectoring during the first stage of ascent.

The STS uses ALL of the above mentioned ways to achieve orbit except
for Reaction Control System (RCS).  The SRBs are actually throttled by
changing the nozzle geometry (the exit nozzle is lengthened).  The
Main Engines are gimbled and used also.  The Flapperons are used to
change roll and  pitch.

During the criminal manslaughter flight of STS-26 (Challenger), the
vehicle tried to compensate for the thrust created by the new exhaust
plume from the SRB gap.  The vehicle was winning the battle until the
strut broke lose and the SRB pivoted out from the base, and the drove
itself up into the External tank, breaching the LOX tanks, and causing
the explosion. If the strut had just held for another 8 seconds...
Several NASA managers had to step down in order to avoid criminal
prosecution for Man Slaughter. The Challenger Explosion was COMPLETELY
avoidable.

As for the Orbital Maneuvering Engines (OMEs), they are used to give
final course correction and orbital insertion.  Remember, it requires
at least 2 rocket burns to place an object into orbit:  The SRB and
Mains get you the altitude an required speed. The OMEs make sure you
have the desired orbital velocity.  Notice I used speed as a scalar,
then velocity as a vector. The speed just says I have enough momentum
to stay in some orbit, while velocity says I chose this orbit over
that orbit.  You can have orbital speed, but if you chose the wrong
velocity, you re-enter the atmosphere and burn to death... and we
don't want that.

Speaking of burning, the Shuttle Endeavor has a 3 inch gouge in its
belly.  Maybe a bad thing ... maybe not.  What really bothers me is
why we continue to fly a flawed design.  The STS system is a plethora
of compromises in the name of costs over safety.

First the SRBs are flawed as their segment joints trap dirt and water.
Where there is water and cold weather, there is ice.  Ice expands,
then the volume shrinks as it passes back into liquid state.  This
causes breaches in the O-Rings and well do we really need another,
&quot;Challenger you are go for throttle up... Roger throttle up...&quot;?  Next
the External Tank is flawed as it allows debris in the form of foam
and ice to rain down upon the vehicle; this first happened with STS-1
where large ice chunks struck the top of the crew cabin.  The orbiter
has no power once it re-enters the atmosphere, so if the flight
computers fail or some unpredicted miscalculation occurs, the shuttle
ends up in the ocean or dead sticking it out in some dry lake bed
somewhere;  the Russian's Buran shuttle had jet engines that extended
its range by 1500 miles... not bad thinking or such a politically and
socially backwards society.

The list goes on and on, but I don't want to keep you from you
Brittney Spears or Paris Hilton worship.  Sorry to show intelligence
and scientific understanding.  You know in revolutions, that makes
people like me the first targets... so I will just keep fade away...

the corrections would take longer to list than the original.

Among the worst - your description of orbital mechanics is hilariously

And this is why, I just don't respect you people ...

The orbiter itself was an external copy of the American Shuttle but
with a number of differences in design details. Although Soviet
engineers considered a number of exotic and innovative lifting body
configurations for the reusable spacecraft, none appeared to be
superior to the shape chosen by the Americans for their orbiter. The
Soviets did add a few changes of their own, however. Most notably,
removing the propulsion system from the orbiter allowed the vehicle to
carry a larger payload of 30 tons into orbit compared to the 25-ton
maximum of the US Shuttle. The landing weight was similarly increased
to 20 tons from the 15-ton limit for the American orbiter. The Soviets
also made provisions to add a pair of jet engines to the aft end of
their orbiter so that the final stage of landing could be performed
under power. By contrast, the US orbiter is unpowered and must glide
to its landing. The engines would have given the Buran an additional
safety factor to overcome adverse winds or waveoff and make a new
approach to the runway. However, the idea was never implemented on
Buran since it was ultimately deemed unnecessarily complicated.

Sigh ... this is why I have the attitude that I take  with most of
you.  Its not that I am all that, no its mostly that you aren't that.
All I have to do is keep one step ahead of you and I win.  I win in
life.  In income level, in comfort, good health and longevity.  As
long as you don't try, and I try just a little ... I win...

Let me educate you ... why bother as it is a fucking waste of my
tendons and mind to type this, but here goes any ways ...

The control surface on the Space Shuttle both American an Russian are
called Flaperons.  A flaperon is a type of control surface that
combines aspects of both flaps and ailerons. There are also Rudderons
that combine Rudder and Elevons.  The Russian and ESA, Clipper mini-
shuttle utilizes these.  Please follow this link to learn about the
Clipper: http://tinyurl.com/ch3hs

As for the naming of the Shuttle Control Surfaces, I will guide you to
a paper written about that very same subject by people who know a lot
more than you and I combined:  Pitch control of the space shuttle
training aircraft
Berenji, H.R.; Saraf, S.; Ping-Wei Chang; Swanson, S.R.
Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on
Volume 9, Issue 3, May 2001 Page(s):542 - 551
Digital Object Identifier   10.1109/87.918906
Summary:A set of shuttle training aircrafts (STAs) are used by NASA to
train astronaut pilots to land the space shuttle after returning from
orbit. The STA simulates the dynamics of the much larger and heavier
space shuttle with the help of some hardware and software
modifications. We present a STA controller that tracks the shuttle
pitch trajectory. Our control system includes a feedforward controller
based on zero phase error tracking control and a fuzzy proportional
derivative (PD) feedback controller. Test results on a ground hardware
simulator used at the Ellington Field of NASA Johnson Space Center
show that the new controller significantly reduces pitch following
errors between the shuttle and the STA, when compared to the existing
controller

People use laymen terms for laymen.  The Shuttle's trailing edge
surfaces act in three roles: Pitch, Roll, and airfoil dynamics, e.g.
flaps/trim.  Its not like a radio control plane or an Estes Space
Shuttle kit. No its far far more complex than that.   They are
flaperons.  If you want to call them elevons, then I can't stop you,
but they do more than just roll and pitch the shuttle.  They camber
and set trim during the glide.  They really do act as flaps...  but
hey I won't split hairs ... they are surfaces that act to control
pitch, roll, and lift.  What you call them is up to you my friend.

Oh well, what you are lacking is a Britteny update, so lets find
one... hold a sec... ah here you are:

&quot;You'll never see it my way because you are not me&quot; - Brittney
Spears

Wow she is a GENIUS!  I mean Albert Einstein was a MORON compared to
this blond bombshell!

Ok I hope that gets you over your hump :)

Lunar - And you wonder why I have such an elitist attitude towards
most of you and the rest of the world.  I rise above all of you
because I just try a little, while the rest don't even try ... think
about that as you ponder Britteny!

Luny, why waste time backing up your bullshit claim with more weasel bullshit?

THE BURAN DID NOT USE JET ENGINES TO EXTEND ITS RANGE!!!

That was your claim, and it was bullshit.  Trying to worm your way out of it by
throwing out piles and piles of bullshit saying &quot;they made provisions yada yada&quot;,
doesn't matter.  Cutting and pasting from other sources doesn't make you an
authority, either.

The ANALOG test vehicle that they used to develop their shuttle system had jet
engines on it, that's all.

You're still a clueless fucking idiot.  Just a VERBOSE, clueless fucking idiot.

For the record, your original statement:

&quot;the Russian's Buran shuttle had jet engines that extended its range by 1500 miles... &quot;

Bite it.

A quick google...

&quot;Elevons are aircraft control surfaces that combines the functions of
the elevator (used for pitch control) and the aileron (used for roll
control), hence the name. They are frequently used on tailless
aircraft such as flying wings. An elevon which not part of the main
wing, but instead is a separate tail surface, is a taileron.&quot;

Used on aircraft such as the F-117A, F4D-SkyRay, and Yes the STS.

&quot;A flaperon is a type of control surface that combines aspects of both
flaps and ailerons. In addition to controlling the roll or bank of an
airplane like conventional ailerons, both flaperons can be lowered
together to function much the same as a dedicated set of flaps would.

(Both ailerons could also be raised, which would give you
spoilerons.)&quot;

Used on aircraft such as the F-16 and the X-37

IMO,they should take this as an opportunity to practice the repair;send a
guy out to trowel some &quot;NASA bondo&quot; into the gash,and then paint that
coating over it. IMO,it would reduce the chance of a burn-thru and even
greater damage,if the shuttle survives at all(without repair).
IMO,it's better than doing nothing.

Then they can evaluate the repair effectiveness after the shuttle reenters
and survives.

Please allow me to jump in here, I have extended experience in glass
aerogel (although not as used on the shuttle).  The tiles in question are
glass aerogel overlaid with a thin layer of carbon fiber/epoxy.  They have
a very thin, but tough and somewhat brittle coating.  Under this coating,
they are very brittle and about as tough as styrofoam.  You can easily
crush aerogel, or put your finger through a block.  This is the risk in
doing the repair; you can damage the tile further or gouge other tiles.
Without doing detailed simulations (either computer or blow-torch) the
actual risk of re-entering without repair is not known.  The aluminum skin
might be just fine w/o repair.  The aerodynamics might be such that the
heat won't penetrate to the skin, or the skin might be able to dissapate
any heat that gets down to it.  I can understand that there is a great need
to be seen to be &quot;dooing something&quot; to fix the problem, but the brave folks
up there are in no immediate danger.

&gt; guy out to trowel some &quot;NASA bondo&quot; into the gash,and then paint that
&gt; coating over it. IMO,it would reduce the chance of a burn-thru and even
&gt; greater damage,if the shuttle survives at all(without repair).
&gt; IMO,it's better than doing nothing.

&gt; Then they can evaluate the repair effectiveness after the shuttle reenters
&gt; and survives.

I do not think the shuttle tiles are aerogel and I KNOW they are not coated with carbon
fiber/epoxy.

Why not look up facts first before posting them?

&gt;&gt; It irks me that they seem to be willing to allow reentry without
&gt;&gt; repairing the gash. (have they forgotten there are PEOPLE aboard??)

&gt; Please allow me to jump in here, I have extended experience in glass
&gt; aerogel (although not as used on the shuttle).  The tiles in question are
&gt; glass aerogel overlaid with a thin layer of carbon fiber/epoxy.  They have
&gt; a very thin, but tough and somewhat brittle coating.  Under this coating,
&gt; they are very brittle and about as tough as styrofoam.  You can easily
&gt; crush aerogel, or put your finger through a block.  This is the risk in
&gt; doing the repair; you can damage the tile further or gouge other tiles.
&gt; Without doing detailed simulations (either computer or blow-torch) the
&gt; actual risk of re-entering without repair is not known.  The aluminum skin
&gt; might be just fine w/o repair.  The aerodynamics might be such that the
&gt; heat won't penetrate to the skin, or the skin might be able to dissapate
&gt; any heat that gets down to it.  I can understand that there is a great need
&gt; to be seen to be &quot;dooing something&quot; to fix the problem, but the brave folks
&gt; up there are in no immediate danger.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Oh one thing, the flapperons are used during the early parts of the

&gt;&gt; They're elevons, not flapperons.

&gt; Sigh ... this is why I have the attitude that I take  with most of
&gt; you.  Its not that I am all that, no its mostly that you aren't that.
&gt; All I have to do is keep one step ahead of you and I win.  I win in
&gt; life.  In income level, in comfort, good health and longevity.  As
&gt; long as you don't try, and I try just a little ... I win...

&gt; Let me educate you ... why bother as it is a fucking waste of my
&gt; tendons and mind to type this, but here goes any ways ...

&gt; The control surface on the Space Shuttle both American an Russian are
&gt; called Flaperons.  A flaperon is a type of control surface that
&gt; combines aspects of both flaps and ailerons. There are also Rudderons
&gt; that combine Rudder and Elevons.  The Russian and ESA, Clipper mini-
&gt; shuttle utilizes these.  Please follow this link to learn about the
&gt; Clipper: http://tinyurl.com/ch3hs

&gt; As for the naming of the Shuttle Control Surfaces, I will guide you to
&gt; a paper written about that very same subject by people who know a lot
&gt; more than you and I combined:  Pitch control of the space shuttle
&gt; training aircraft
&gt; Berenji, H.R.; Saraf, S.; Ping-Wei Chang; Swanson, S.R.
&gt; Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on
&gt; Volume 9, Issue 3, May 2001 Page(s):542 - 551
&gt; Digital Object Identifier   10.1109/87.918906
&gt; Summary:A set of shuttle training aircrafts (STAs) are used by NASA to
&gt; train astronaut pilots to land the space shuttle after returning from
&gt; orbit. The STA simulates the dynamics of the much larger and heavier
&gt; space shuttle with the help of some hardware and software
&gt; modifications. We present a STA controller that tracks the shuttle
&gt; pitch trajectory. Our control system includes a feedforward controller
&gt; based on zero phase error tracking control and a fuzzy proportional
&gt; derivative (PD) feedback controller. Test results on a ground hardware
&gt; simulator used at the Ellington Field of NASA Johnson Space Center
&gt; show that the new controller significantly reduces pitch following
&gt; errors between the shuttle and the STA, when compared to the existing
&gt; controller

&gt; People use laymen terms for laymen.  The Shuttle's trailing edge
&gt; surfaces act in three roles: Pitch, Roll, and airfoil dynamics, e.g.
&gt; flaps/trim.  Its not like a radio control plane or an Estes Space
&gt; Shuttle kit. No its far far more complex than that.   They are
&gt; flaperons.  If you want to call them elevons, then I can't stop you,
&gt; but they do more than just roll and pitch the shuttle.  They camber
&gt; and set trim during the glide.  They really do act as flaps...  but
&gt; hey I won't split hairs ... they are surfaces that act to control
&gt; pitch, roll, and lift.  What you call them is up to you my friend.

&gt; Oh well, what you are lacking is a Britteny update, so lets find
&gt; one... hold a sec... ah here you are:

&gt; http://www.britneyspears.com/

&gt; &quot;You'll never see it my way because you are not me&quot; - Brittney
&gt; Spears

&gt; Wow she is a GENIUS!  I mean Albert Einstein was a MORON compared to
&gt; this blond bombshell!

&gt; Ok I hope that gets you over your hump :)

&gt; Lunar - And you wonder why I have such an elitist attitude towards
&gt; most of you and the rest of the world.  I rise above all of you
&gt; because I just try a little, while the rest don't even try ... think
&gt; about that as you ponder Britteny!

I sure am glad this guy doesn't fly in NW Nevada. People that think
they know everything usually know very little, and that makes them
dangerous. I don't like dangerous people on my range. Makes me nervous.

I like people that ask questions, gather information, seek to
improve themselves and their knowledge base. People that think they don't
need that are dangerous, to themselves, and to those around them.

Lunar, please stay off my range. I don't want you hurting anyone,
including yourself, at one of my launches.

Thank you,

J

Your assuming we would be able to put his hands together in the first
place.  Remember, he is one of those trolls that uses *one* hand to type

That being the case I recommends the quick-setting CA. A certain scene

Ah, I can see it now: &quot;CA in Space!&quot;

They could use my unofficial CA Emergency Field Repairs instruction sheet:

Step 1. Open CA tube, accidentally gushing CA all over fingers.
Step 2. Rage!
Step 3. Ball hands into fists.
Step 4. Rage!

Hmm... no more steps :-)
