Prune And Walnut Stuffed Pork Roast - Serves 8
Recipe By: Dave Leiberman
Published in: Dave's Dinners, page 163
Publish Date: 2006

Ingredients

2       pounds  pork loin
1/3     cup     olive oil
1       onion   finely diced
1/2     pounds  prunes, pitted -- roughly chopped
2               Macintosh apples -- peeled, cored, roughly chopped
1/4     pounds  walnut pieces about 1 cup -- roughly chopped
2       tablespoons     rosemary leaves -- finely chopped
juice and zest of 1/2 lemon

Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350.

Cut into the pork roast horizontally to lay it open and create a
flat, even layer of meat. Combine the remaining ingredients in a
mixing bowl and toss well.

Spread some of the mixture over the open surface of the flayed pork
loin. Fold up as tightly as possible and place in a large baking pan
or dish, opening side down. Spread the rest of the filling around and
over the roast.

Cover loosely with foil and bake 1 1/2 hours.

Served with Creamy Cheddar Cauliflower

&quot;My idea of pure heaven is to spend a day in the kitchen, peeling,
chopping, and stirring while the words of a good book fill the air
around me.&quot;
