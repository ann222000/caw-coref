Prolly they ARE a bunch of right wing lobbyists and operatives.

This doesn't make them wrong, of course.

Only being wrong would do that.

Peer review isn't a guarantee of anything but keeping the riffraff out.

Beyond the peer review threshold, IPCC must arrive at a &quot;consensus&quot;
among literally thousands of peer reviewed papers. And these peer
reviewed papers often conflict with one another. Especially within the
infant science of climatology.

There is no science to guide IPCC to its consensus.

Because IPCC isn't a scientific body, it is, rather, a scholarly body.

IPCC does not arrive at its &quot;conclusions&quot; through science.

No, it's just another UN shell game whose conclusions are
meaningless..

&gt;Right wingers sure are gullible.  You're too stupid to tell a partisan
&gt;propaganda organization who are paid by special interest groups to say what
&gt;they say.  Rightists are mentally ill.

&gt;You must relish the taste of shit, you seem to like being fed it often.

&gt;Try to find somebody with a little more credibility next time and maybe
&gt;people won't laugh at you.

me wherever I am or whatever I do. -- EPICTETUS
