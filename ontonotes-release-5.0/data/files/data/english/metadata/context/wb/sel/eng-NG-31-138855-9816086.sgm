Hi,

I met one of you (didn't get a name) a while back at Ledbetter in
November who suggested I check this group out.  I've been surfing on
and off a few times, but now I want to consistently get into it enough
to really learn.  I'm a strong ocean swimmer, but would like company
at the very least and am willing to listen to any advice I can get.  I
live over near Sands/Elwood and work by campus and am also up for any
sunrise sessions.  I've been browsing this board for a while and
encouraged by how friendly everyone is.

Hi Jeanni!
Welcome aboard!  Sounds like Campus Point would be a good place for you
- that means maybe you could joint the Thursday morning Campus Pointers
(or Tuesday or Saturday - Kathy is out there ALL THE TIME :)  And in a
little while I will start trying to hit up Campus Point/Poles in the
evenings after work.   I am laying low right now while I finish getting
over the flu.

Hey Jeanni,
I'm the one who goes to campus a lot :).  I live out in W. Goleta, too.
Come on out to CP anytime!  We're pretty mellow out there and have lots of
fun.  We usually sort of meet in the parking lot around 9:30 on Thursday
mornings.  If not in the lot, then in the water.  Hope to see you out there!

Kathy
