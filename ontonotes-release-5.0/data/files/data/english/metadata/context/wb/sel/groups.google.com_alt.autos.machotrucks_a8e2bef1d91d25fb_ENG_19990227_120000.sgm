I just bought a 1974 Chevrolet 3/4 ton 4x4 pickup truck. I'm having a bit of
trouble with it. Whenever I put the 4WD shifter in neutral, the truck won't
move in any of the gears on the column. But if I put it in 4WD it drives just
fine. Is this a transfer box problem or a tranny problem?

BTW- when the 4WD shifter is in neutral and I put the column shifter in park,
there is a terrible sound of gears screeching to a halt. The truck also won't
go into park when the 4WD shifter is in neutral.

Any help or suggestions will be greatly appreciated, thanks.

Maytag,

Sounds like your transfer is just fine. When you put the transfer in neutral
your doing just that, its in neutral just like your regulat trans would be. no
power boing through it. Reason for the grinding sounds in the automatic is that
it's running wide open when yur trying to put it in neutral, your trying to do
the same thing as if you were going down the road and decided to put the trans in
park at 50 MPH.

Hope you learn what a 4 x 4 is really like before you wreck it.

Having the transfer case in &quot;N&quot; effectively immobilizes the vehicle since it
disengages the drivetrain (engine, trans.) from the front/rear axle. This is
normal. The t-case should have a &quot;2-H&quot; gear, which is what you should use
for street applications. Running the truck in &quot;4L / 4H&quot; puts unecessary
wear on your drivetrain and reduces mileage substantially. You may have to
install a part time kit in your truck if its one of the ones that came
factory with full-time four wheel drive. This involves changing the hubs to
manual units and in some cases (depending on your transfer case) requires a
slight modification of the transfer case. This is a definate worthwhile
upgrade to do! Some of the grinding noises you are experiencing are normal
if you can belive that. Hope this helps. -Dave

"/> I know what the hell a 4x4 is like... I've owned 3 of them but never a FULL
TIME 4x4. I don't know why the hell I thought N would put it in 2wd. My dad's
old truck was like that... I think, but that was a loooong time ago!
