Welcome again to PROUT Gems.

An examination of the contradictions of religions is one of the things that
emerges from the state of various crises around the world, and more debate
on this is sure to come in the future.  But a person with a spiritual and
holistic world view will remain forever optimistic.  Society also becomes
optimistic by ensuring the minimum necessities to all through adequate
purchasing capacity, special amenities as incentives for those making
extraordinary efforts by rendering service to humanity and maximum amenities
to the common people as the wealth of society increases so that the gap
between the ordinary and the special is continually minimized.  That is the
basis of a successful economy.

Civilization in Crisis

What is happening right now is, of course, a build up of tensions in the
world for many decades - a type of polarization between the materialists'
greed and mechanical view of life as against the trend of higher evolution
of human consciousness where a spiritual worldview matters.   As Theodore
Roszak, then Professor of History at California State University, said in
his book 'Unfinished Animal' back in 1975, it is a recognition of the
'ecology of the spirit'.  This means recapturing the 'visionary core' that
gives inspiration to the human psyche. It is a struggle of common people
moving away from a materialistic, environmentally unfriendly and divisive
world by which they have been captured, towards a more subtle understanding
of existence and the lifestyle required for it.  As Roszak said back in 1975
this involves "the feeling that the human mind, under persistent pressure of
the dialectical process, grows into ever more subtle noetic experiences, and
at last into ecstatic insights that must always have been there waiting to
be discovered".

This sentiment has been prevalent in society since the 1960s and it has by
no means gone away.  Much as current media and infotainment channels may
tell us otherwise, on the ground the spiritual worldview has been strong.
While it may seem to be 'hidden' by crises caused by those who only go by
their egotistic short term ambitions and who predominate the world stage -
whether it be in politics, business or otherwise - soon it will be realised
that it has been and is the inherent optimistic tendency that leads the
world forward to an understanding of its glorious future.  Prabhat Ranjan
Sarkar envisaged the same back in the 1960s and 1970s.  He said then:

"Wise people say that in the past there had been so many crises in the human
society.  Crisis is quite natural for something moving.  Where there is
movement there is struggle - struggle against the inertia of the earth.  In
the past there had been crises in the course of movement, crises in
different branches of civilization, crises in the realm of education also.
But nowadays, the entire human society is facing the crisis of civilization
as a whole and particularly crisis in the field of existence.  Now, the
human society has to decide whether to live or to die.  If the crisis of
civilization as a whole and of existence is encouraged, humanity has no
future.  The future is dark, the future is sealed forever.

But as you know, I am not a pessimist.  I am always an optimist.  And all
should be optimists.  They should struggle against this death signal of
humanity and come out successful.  For sure they must be victorious.  It is
your duty to save humanity.  We should all hope to be able to save humanity
and we should also be optimistic.

Great or small, even if people are few in number, the few are the torch
bearers of human society.  The pioneers, the vanguard of the human society.
So it is a duty to save humanity.  Those who are unable to shoulder their
own bags and baggages, their responsibilities are to be shouldered by you.
You should know that the life of spiritual aspirants is a mission - their
entire existence is a mission.  And your mission is, what?  To save humanity
from these crises.  I hope, you will be successful.  I not only hope, I am
sure that you will be successful." PR Sarkar - Discourse in Frankfurt,
January 1979

Some say that after thousands of years, there will be no humanity.  Beings
from other planets may come and see their fossilized existence, to see that
there were creatures on this earth named human beings who were educated, who
were intelligent, who used to build palaces, buildings, cities, but who have
now become extinct due to their internal disunity and infighting.  Do you
want history to be written like this?  Then preach the gospels of humanity
everywhere - save the dying humanity. (Discourse in Caracas, Venezuela,
1979)

Human civilization now faces the final moment of a critical juncture.  The
dawn of a glorious new era is on the one side, and the worn-out skeleton of
the past on the other.  Humanity has to adopt either one or the other.  You
are the spiritual soldiers, you are the worshippers of life divine.  Hence I
call upon you to adorn this crimson dawn deluged with glorious light.
Victory is surely yours. (A'nanda Va'nii, 1 January 1967)

Anti-exploitation sentiment
From the works of P R Sarkar

Powerful popular sentiments will have to be generated immediately for the
liberation of intellect. Casting aside all their inertia and prejudices,
intellectuals will have to mix with the common people and engage themselves
in their welfare. They will have to assist the common people in their
development and extend their support to all anti-exploitation movements.
This approach will help to root out exploitation, stabilize the structure of
society and expand the intellectual standard of the common people. Human
society will move forward to a brilliant future with rapid steps.

These feelings of anti-exploitation have to be given a shape through the
medium of social organization. A healthy social outlook has to be adopted.
The parasites which live on exploitation do not want that the throes of
inactivity should disappear from the society as it is on this filth of
stagnancy that they exist and grow. They are like sores on the social body.

To experience the warmth of another's heart one will have to give up the
false sentiments of artificial human-made differences. For that we must
first wage a ceaseless fight against poverty. Poverty is a common enemy of
all.  This campaign against poverty will have to be carried on step by step.
The first step is to arouse an anti-exploitation sentiment. Each and every
person should be convinced that the entire wealth of the world is the common
patrimony of all. To utilise that wealth is the birthright of everyone and
no interference in that birthright will be permissible.

According to PROUT, there are two types of sentiments -- positive sentiments
and negative sentiments. Positive sentiments are synthetic in nature. They
unite society and elevate humanity, enhance collective interests and
encourage progressive development. Negative sentiments are narrow in scope
and divide society.

Some important positive sentiments include anti-exploitation sentiment,
revolutionary sentiment, moral sentiment, cultural sentiment, universal
sentiment and spiritual sentiment. Some negative sentiments include
communalism, patriotism, nationalism, provincialism, lingualism and racism.

Negative sentiments should never be used to divide people into castes and
communities -- to create artificial fissiparous tendencies in society.
Rather, they should always be used to bring unity amongst people. Hitler
used racism in an effort to unite the German people and he succeeded in the
short-term, but because he used negative sentiments only and had no positive
sentiments, his approach resulted in a world war and the near destruction of
Germany. The path of negativity is extremely dangerous and harmful for
society. Positive sentiments are the real weapons to build society. This
must never be forgotten under any circumstances.

If an anti-exploitation sentiment is created among the poverty-stricken
masses, not only will a strong nation or a strong group of nations be
formed, but this nation or group of nations will continue with due
solidarity for a long time. The leaders should, therefore, rectify the
errors of the past and vigorously launch a fresh anti-exploitation campaign.
There is no other alternative.

Although the anti-exploitation sentiment is the most important factor in
building a nation or a group of nations, this sentiment will not be able to
sustain a nation or a group of nations for a long time. One day exploitation
must cease. If it is not stopped completely, it can be confidently said that
in the future the intensity of exploitation will be much less than what it
is today. In the absence of exploitation the anti-exploitation sentiment
will die out, and consequently a nation or a group of nations based on the
anti-exploitation sentiment will not exist either.

What will happen then? The sentiment of universalism will keep people
united. It is true that this spiritual sentiment will not help to form a
nation inside any particular country, but it will definitely unite the
entire planetary world into a nation. Then there will be only one nation a
universal nation.

Today human beings, to whatever country they may belong, should, on the one
side, propagate an anti-exploitation sentiment (exploitation does not mean
exploitation in the economic sphere only, it includes all sorts of
exploitation), and form strong nations in their respective countries; and,
on the other side, preach the theory of one spiritual inheritance -
universalism -  that all people of all nations belong to the same family.

PROUT always stands for the cause of exploited people, irrespective of race,
nation, religion etc., and always opposes all types of exploitation. But as
poverty is the main problem in the world today, PROUT gives top priority to
opposing economic exploitation, as this affects the livelihood and existence
of the people.

To solve this problem and other pressing socio-economic problems, popular
movements based on anti-exploitation and universal sentiments should be
launched throughout the world. Such movements should oppose all forms of
economic, psychic, cultural and psycho-economic exploitation. In addition
they should undertake appropriate practical programs to enhance the
all-round welfare of the people.

Regardless of whether they are rich or poor, old or young, educated or
illiterate, if the local people are inspired by anti-exploitation and
universal sentiments, they will be able to start powerful movements for
socio-economic liberation. When people merge their individual socio-economic
interests with the collective socio-economic interest, the outflow of
economic wealth from a region will cease and exploitation will be completely
rooted out. The right of full employment for all local people will be
guaranteed, and the employment of local people will take precedence over
non-local people.

Essential elements of this campaign are:

- 100% Employment for Local People - So as to take care of the basic right
of all people to be guaranteed the minimum essentials for their existence,
including at least proper food, clothing, housing, education and medical
care. This basic right should be arranged through cent per cent guaranteed
employment, not through welfare or dole-outs.

- Maximum Industrial Development - Maximum industries should be developed in
the local area according to the availability of raw materials or local
consumption. This principle will develop the economic potential of a
socioeconomic unit by placing economic power into the hands of the local
people and divesting outsiders of their control over the economy.  The first
corallary to this point is that industries should utilise locally available
local raw materials and should not import raw materials from outside the
socioeconomic unit. A second corollary of this point is that local raw
materials should not be exported - only manufactured goods should be
exported. A third corollary is that if no potential exists to produce the
manufactured goods required by industry in the local area, only then should
the importation of such goods be allowed.

- Avoid Importing Outside Products - Where finished products can be locally
produced, then outside finished products (which can be locally produced)
should not be imported. This point implies that the local people should
support their local industries by purchasing their own finished products.

- Local Language as the Medium of Instruction - The medium of instruction
from primary to tertiary level should be in the local language. The sum
total of human expression is culture, and language is the best medium to
express human culture. However, English should be encouraged as the lingua
franca of the world.

- Local Language as the Primary Means of Communication - The local language
should be the medium of communication in governmental, and non-governmental
institutions and offices. In many countries there may be more than one local
language, and all should be encouraged.

- Local Socio-Economic Demands - Particular demands pertaining to the local
area should be implemented. The local situation should be carefully studied
and programmes should be adopted as per the requirements of the particular
locality. Examples include, the unification of divided nations, demand the
construction of bridges and roads to make raw materials more accessible as
the first step in developing new industries, increase small scale irrigation
projects where people are dependent on agriculture.  That is, consider all
the local needs necessary to expedite the socio-economic development of the
local area.

"Corporate Globalisation -- or shall we call it by its name? --
Imperialism -- needs a press that pretends to be free. It needs courts that
pretend to dispense justice. ... So this -- all this -- is "empire". This
loyal confederation, this obscene accumulation of power, this greatly
increased distance between those who make the decisions and those who have
to suffer them.  Our fight, our goal, our vision of Another World must be to
eliminate that distance." WORLD SOCIAL FORUM - "CONFRONTING EMPIRE" by
ARUNDHATI ROY

Universal in spirit, regional in approach
By P.R. Sarkar

Socio-economic units are bound to gain great popularity all over the world
within a short time. While there may be diverse cultural expressions and
socio-economic potentialities in different units, the points of difference
should not be allowed to divide humanity. If the common sentiments of human
beings are given prominence and the points of unity are made the basis of
collective development, diversity will enrich humanity rather than tear it
asunder. If a comprehensive ideology and a universal outlook inspire each
socio-economic unit, human society will move ahead with accelerating speed
towards a sublime ideal.

A sound ideological base is a prerequisite for socio-economic
groupifications. Such a foundation is provided by universal humanism, which
has the potential to unite all humanity. Universal humanism will not be
established on the hard crust of the earth overnight, but will come to
fruition gradually, stage by stage. It will include each and every person in
the world, as well as animals, plants and inanimate objects. If a single
person remains outside the influence of universalism and becomes a victim of
exploitation, then the foundation of universal humanism will be undermined.
Hence, Prout has adopted a rational method to solve socio-economic problems,
which may be characterized as universal in spirit but regional in approach.

Increasing minimum requirements and special and maximum amenities

Whatever is feasible and practical has been said in Prout. Marxism built
castles in the air and encouraged the people to dream a meaningless dream.
Prout has not done this nor will Prout do it. Prout will do that which is
feasible and practical. If the common people and the meritorious people are
treated as the same, the capable people will not be encouraged to develop
their higher potentiality. This is the reason why the brain drain is
happening in India. When talented people leave India, they leave it for
good. Providing special amenities for those with special capabilities will
stop the brain drain.

Prout's approach is to guarantee the minimum requirements for all, guarantee
maximum amenities for all and guarantee special amenities for people with
special capabilities. This approach will ensure ever-increasing acceleration
in the socio-economic sphere. The question of retardation does not arise;
even the question of maintaining speed does not arise. There must be
acceleration. Acceleration is the spirit of life, the spirit of existence,
the spirit of the existential faculty. One may not be a genius, one may
simply be a member of the ordinary public, and not properly accepted or
respected by all, but even then one will get the minimum requirements and
maximum amenities in an ever increasing manner according to the
environmental conditions concerned, according to the demands of the day.

So what is the significance of this new approach?

- Minimum requirements are to be guaranteed to all

- Special amenities are to be guaranteed to capable people. Special
amenities are for people of special calibre as per the environmental
condition of the particular age.  Special amenities are incentives for
extraordinary cases.

- Maximum amenities are to be guaranteed to all, even to those who have no
special qualities -- to the common people of common calibre. Maximum
amenities are to be guaranteed to all as per environmental conditions. These
amenities are for those of ordinary calibre -- the common people, the
so-called downtrodden humanity.  The provision of the maximum amenities
should not go against the common interest.

All three above are never ending processes, and they will go on increasing
according to the collective potentialities. This appendix to our philosophy
may be small, but it is of a progressive nature and a progressive character.
It has far-reaching implications for the future. I hope you will realize its
impact and all its potentialities.

1. Minimum necessities are for all - non-compromisable - food, clothing,
housing, medical care, education at the very least being provided - and
obtained by adequate purchasing capacity for all.

2. Special amenities are incentives for people of special calibre.  Those
with physical, metaphysical or intellectual ability may demand something
more than ordinary people. Special amenities should, therefore, be provided
so that the diversity in skill and intelligence is fully utilized, and
talent is encouraged to contribute its best towards human development. It
will, therefore, be necessary to make provision for special emoluments which
can cater for special amenities of life according to the age and time.

But at the same time, there should be a constant effort to reduce the gap
between the amount of special emoluments and the bare minimum requirements
of the average individual. The guaranteed supply of minimum requirements
must be liberalized by increasing the provision of special amenities
pertaining to the age and also, simultaneously, by bringing about a decrease
in the provision of special emoluments given to the few. This never-ending
effort of proper economic adjustment must ceaselessly continue at all times
with a view to assisting the spiritual, mental and physical evolution of
human beings, and to let humanity develop a Cosmic sentiment for a Cosmic
ideal and world fraternity. There should be a never-ending endeavour to
minimise the gap between minimum requirements and special amenities.

3. Maximum amenities are for ordinary people and means that as the wealth of
society increases the amenities become more and more available so that the
standard of living increases.  The common people should not be deprived of
maximum amenities, so there should be efforts to give them as much of the
maximum amenities as possible. There will still be a gap between the maximum
amenities of the common people and the special amenities of the meritorious,
but there should be constant efforts to reduce this gap. Thus, the common
people should also receive more and more amenities. If maximum amenities are
not provided to common people, no doubt there will be progress in society
(as they will have minimum necessities), but there will always remain the
scope for imperfection in future.

What constitutes both the minimum requirements and the maximum amenities
should be ever increasing.  If the maximum or special amenities of
meritorious people become excessively high, then the minimum requirements of
common people should be immediately increased. As the need for the minimum
requirements is fulfilled and the supply of the maximum amenities increases,
the struggle for daily subsistence will gradually decrease and people's
lives will become increasingly easy and enjoyable. For this reason PROUT
guarantees the minimum requirements and the maximum amenities to all.  These
maximum amenities must be good for the physical and psychic development of
human beings. There should be maximum amenities for one and all, with more
longing for physico-psychic objects of enjoyment. These amenities should be
increased for the entire social order. There cannot be any full stop, any
comma or any semi-colon in this progress.
