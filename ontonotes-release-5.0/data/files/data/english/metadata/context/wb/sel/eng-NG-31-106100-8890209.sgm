All:  I am in agreement with the post that Monarchs have started migration.  Here in South Jersey near Phila. I have sighted them flying in a southerly direction  --  not in great numbers yet.  There are still eggs and cats on milkweed in the area.  My daughter, vacationing in Ocean City, NJ, reports larger numbers on or near the beach flying south.  I guess it's started.

The onset of reproductive diapause, southward migratory
behavior and evening clustering behavior in the monarch
butterfly are a function of latitude.

Example: On August 5, most of the recently emerged
monarchs in extreme northern Minnesota (49 degrees North
latitude) were exhibiting southward migratory behavior
and evening clustering behavior:

But New Jersey is too far south in latitude for diapause
and clustering behavior to occur until near the end of
August or first week in September.

Of course, anyone wishing to refute this claim is welcome
to do, but I think it should be a requirement that they provide
photographic proof of evening clustering behavior (with female
monarchs visible in the clusters) before declaring the
migration has begun or arrived in their area.

I guess Ishould have been more specific...On August15th I viewed evening
clustering activities in Oakville Ontario which is at a latitude of app. 43
degrees North

Yes the reports of good numbers of fall migrant monarchs in
Ontario are really pouring in now. Substantial numbers are also
being seen far to the West in Alberta, Canada and even some
in British Columbia.

And recently I was New Mexico and Colorado and found Monarchs
were so abundant on or very close to the Continental Divide that
I could sometimes photograph TWO of them simultaneously.

Example of one location on the Continental Divide in
northwestern New Mexico (between Gallup and
Albuquerque) I visited:
http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/4af/cdnmg.jpg

Landscape view of this location on top of the Continental Divide
where I saw several monarchs on Aug. 15, 2007:

Photo of two of the several monarchs I saw at this location:
http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/4af/cdnmb.jpg

Close up view of these same two monarchs that positively identify
them as monarchs (not queen butterflies which were also
abundant on the Continental Divide)
http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/4af/cdnmc.jpg

Landscape view of another nearby spot just 1 mile to the east
where I saw three more monarchs that same day:
http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/4af/cdnmd.jpg

Close up view of the female I saw laying eggs that positively
identifies the butterfly is a monarch
http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/4af/cdnme.jpg
And also demonstrates that Monarchs breed on top of
the Continental Divide.

Close up view of the male I saw that positively identifies
the butterfly is a monarch
http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k75/4af/cdnmf.jpg

Up to now, the Monarch Scientific community has led us
to believe the Rocky Mountains and Continental
Divide are a &quot;physical barrier&quot; or &quot;milkweed free zone&quot;
that divides the Monarchs into two populations:

Paul is right. It's too early for Monarch migration in most places. In
coastal Maine (Westport Island) last weekend, females were still depositing
eggs, and here in W. Bridgewater, MA saw one mating pair. Cheryl and I will
be returning to Maine tomorrow and I will give more detailed report when I
return.

Don, I meant that New Jersey / Maryland are likely too
far south in latitude to see fall migrants in reproductive diapause
and associated gregarious nectaring and clustering behaviors
right now. But in New York and areas to the North it IS possible
to see fall migrants and clustering right now.

You can keep track of the migration and clustering areas here:
http://www.learner.org/jnorth/maps/current.html?layers=monarch_roost

I think you have to first click on the &quot; i &quot;  and then click on a
white dot on the map to read the details of each cluster sighting.

You can also register on that website and report your sightings.

Hi Paul;

Right again; I should have been more specific than just saying &quot;most
places&quot;. Just the same, interesting that on Sat I could still find egg
laying as far north as Westport, Maine.

Thanks for web-site tip for reporting. Will they accept Monarch sighting
related photos dated by camera software??
