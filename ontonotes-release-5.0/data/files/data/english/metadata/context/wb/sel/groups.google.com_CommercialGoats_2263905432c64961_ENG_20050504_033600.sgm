Okay, with being new to goats, I have a question for thought.

Does anyone out there have any experience with founder or for a nicer name laminitis? Our buck walks like he is marching, and his feet are very difficult to cut. A couple of weeks ago I had a vet look at him and he said he thought that he has been foundered, and get the this that he had eaten hay that has been fertilized with chicken litter and that was what caused the founder too much ammonia nitrate not to mention the chicken litter that has been put on our pastures. Have any of you ever heard of this?

Any advice will be appreciated. I have been told that when a goat founders it gets where it can not walk or in this case do his job. He's a very nice full blood Boer buck out of Pipeline around 5 years old probably weights around 300 ~ 350 pounds, and not a mean bone in him.

Hi Vickie,

Please don't take offense, but you need to get that goat on his feet
and send him up the road.

There are some animals that will founder on grass (cows, horses, goats)
and you never know when it will happen. It generally gets worse as time
goes on.

Our pastures for goats and cows are fertilized with chicken manure and
sometimes (horror of horrors!) with sludge from the waste treatment
plant. We try to have either application done in the fall and so far we
have not had any problems.

Good luck with your goat.

This is what the Meryck Vet Manual (
http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/90708.htm&amp;wo...
) says about founder -
Founder)
Laminitis in goats is seen worldwide, but the incidence is lower than
that in dairy cattle and horses. Predisposing causes include overeating
or sudden access to concentrates, high-grain and low-roughage diets, or
high-protein diets. Laminitis can also occur as a complication of acute
infections such as mastitis, metritis, or pneumonia, especially after
kidding.

When laminitis is severe, the affected goat is lame and reluctant to
move; there is a fever, and all four feet are hot to the touch.
Touching the coronet elicits a severe pain reaction. In less severe
cases, only the forefeet are affected. Laminitis can become chronic if
the initial phase is not diagnosed or treated successfully. The onset
is insidious, but eventually, the goat is seen walking on its knees,
with &quot;sled-runner&quot; deformities of its hooves.

In acute laminitis, the predisposing condition, if identifiable, must
be corrected promptly. The laminitis is treated with analgesics (eg,
phenylbutazone 2-4 mg/kg, flunixin meglumine 1.1 mg/kg, or aspirin
30-100 mg/kg) daily; hosing or soaking the affected feet is also
useful. Although antihistamines are frequently used, their
effectiveness in treatment of laminitis in goats remains unproven.
Similarly, the use of corticosteroids is controversial because they may
contribute to laminitis in horses. Regardless, they should not be used
in pregnant does due to risk of abortion. Chronic laminitis with
deformed hooves is treated by routine vigorous foot trimming.

If he is walking 'like a soldier' I would be more inclined to suspect
incorrect hoof trimming (or something else) - founder is very painful
and they just don't want to walk on it!

We had a buck that flipped out his feet. Fortunately he was a good natured
old boy. He stood steady as a rock while carol held his beard. I held the
foot up and Russell grunted as he took a set of farrier nips to his hooves.
They were massively overgrown and had hard, Russell called is scar material
in them. We came across pockets of dried blood. We probably took off 3 or
4 inches in the front of the hoof that day and so on around and down. He
walked much better after that. We took all we dared that day and gave him a
few weeks to get used to his new feet and went back to it and worked off
some more.

See what a trim does first.

Charles,

No offense has been taken, I ask for the advice and we truly thank you for
it. This is exactly what we have been considering ourselves. This goat has
got continually worse in his gait since December when we first noticed he
marched to a whole different tune (so to speak) from the rest of our
animals.

Thank you,
Vickie

"/> Vickie:

Early in our goating adventure, I purchased a fullblood Boer doeling
to be a show doe. I then proceeded to feed her (all wrong) and next
thing I knew I had foundered her in all 4 feet! While the disease is in
the early stages, best treatment is to stand the animal in a bucket of
icewater. This constricts the blood vessels and forces blood back up
out of the feet. This treatment is followed with anti-inflammatory meds
(such as tylenol, aspirin, or other NSAIDS)and pain medicine (Banamine)
as necessary. If caught early enough, before the claws have been
damaged, a lot of the inflammation can be reversed. There's also a
prescription drug called Palosein that is used in foundered horses. I
used this on my doe, and believe it did help her a great deal.

However, it sounds like your buck is more of a chronic case. There are
not a lot of treatments that will be effective once founder has gone
chronic. What worked on my doe was to trim her feet every two weeks. In
the beginning, I had to poultice the feet (I used a &quot;tar &amp; oakum&quot;
mixture that farriers use with horses that wear pads, and made a duct
tape &quot;boot&quot; to hold the stuff in place) for 2 - 3 days to get them soft
enough that I could trim them. However, as I began to get a more normal
shape to the claws, they required less and less softening, and became
more normal. I also used a product that I got from Paulette at TriQuest
Boer Goats called &quot;Walk-Rite&quot; This was a supplement that I mixed with
water and drenched my doe every day. However, I don't think this
product is available any more. I'm sorry for that, as I do believe it
made a big difference in my doe's quality of life. It took a while, but
over time the &quot;sled-runner&quot; feet became almost totally normal, though
they grew a great deal faster than a normal hoof.

My doe lived quite a few years after her founder, and birthed several
sets of kids. Not one kid has shown any tendency toward founder, as far
as I know. She died last year after being bitten by a snake on the nose
- and I did not find her in time to get any antihistamine into her.

If you are up to the challenge of frequent hoof trimmings, and your
buck satisfies you in other ways, I wouldn't cull him. After all, when
he breeds a doe there is not much weight on those front feet &lt;grin&gt;.
Just keep in mind that he will be a &quot;high maintenance&quot; animal as long
as you keep him.If there is no place in your herd for a high
maintenance buck, then he does need to become goatburger or someone
else's problem.

I have a suggestion, Vickie: hire the best farrier you can find and have him
work over the hooves. I had two that had been allowed to founder in the past
(still have one of them) and I have to have him in about 3 times a year to
get them cleaned up. Between those times, I keep her trimmed myself. Should
cull her, but can't bring myself to do it.

I know there are other things that must be done in addition to clipping, but
don't know what they are, I am sure someone else will.
