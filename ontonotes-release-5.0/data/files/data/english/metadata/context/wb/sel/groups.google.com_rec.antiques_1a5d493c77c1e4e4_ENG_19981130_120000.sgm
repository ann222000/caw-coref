If you're a real enthusiast for any aspect of antiques and you live
anywhere in Europe, here's an opportunity that may interest you.

At QXL, Europe's pioneering online auction, we're rolling out a new
person-to-person auction service that will allow people all across
Europe to sell things to other people in an auction format -- open 24
hours a day, seven days a week.

We're looking for a true specialist and expert in their area of
antiques, who's Internet-savvy enough to be able to help run online
auctions in the area.

You can work from home or your existing office, at the hours that suit
you. On average probably four or five hours a week, more than that
initially.

Your job? It'll be two things: to get the word out to people with the
same enthusiasm, and to help the process work more smoothly - which will
include writing news updates about the most exciting auctions you're
running. We have the tools. You just need the enthusiasm.

The rewards come in three categories.

First, free service. If you regularly sell things of your own, your
privilege as auctioneer allows you to sell at zero commission.

Second, connections and relationships: we can introduce you to people
who share your passion, and help you get friendly with them.

Third, money. Enough to make it worth your while and cover your online
time, and incentive payments as you help your channel grow.

Interested? If so, please send a quick email to recr ... @quixell.com
telling us:

A. Your exact area of enthusiasm, together with details of your
collection or buying or selling activities

B. The web sites, news groups and mailing lists you find most valuable
in the area and think you could work with

C. What clubs or hobby groups you belong to

D. The magazines or periodicals covering the subject that you read.

E. Why you want the job. Say a bit about yourself and your background.
Do you fancy yourself as a writer?

Thanks. We'll get back to you as soon as we can.
