They're putting their money where their mouths are.  I'm not a big fan of
carbon credits, myself, but I can admire the committment.

That's rather like someone who thought the War in Vietnam to be a good thing
actually going over and fighting in it.

Committment to what?! The Warm Fuzzies?

Big fat hairy deal. Someone is getting rich off their stupidity.

Here's something for you: I'll charter them all one of my Boeing BBJ's for
a cut rate, provided they ALL fly on the same plane. That will do a PHUQUE
of a lot more good than 'carbon credits'.

Like what? Being PC to 'pay for their sins'? Big fat hairy deal.

Carbon Credits reduce pollution by Zero. Ought. Naught. Nada. Nothing.
Zip. Zilch.

We've been over this before. If they're paying a Green Electric company to
generate green electricity, it still does nothing. The electric company
is genertaing the electricity anyway. Period. It goes onto the same
grid we all use. Period. THe jets they are flying still pour the same
amount of pollutants into the atmoshphere. Period.

Warm Fuzzies don't count for shit.

OK, then, there are PLENTY of companies that are chartering them. If they
ALL flew together, the total amount of pollution reduction might really
add up to something.

Unlike Hillary, who chartered a Gulfstream, got in, didn't like it, sent
it back EMPTY, got another one, flew in it, sent it back EMPTY and then
got another one, that flew up to meet her EMPTY.

Buying Carbon Credits doesn't amount to shit when you're THAT arrogant.

Yeah, that REALLY did something for the Environment...

In fact, I didn't say carbon credits accomplish much and I said that I'm not
wild about them.  I said ponying up demonstrated a committment and that is
correct.

In fact, you are wrong.  Again.  Surprise.  You should have quit while you
were... well, not ahead but before you said something stupid.

The upcharge to the electric bill in this area makes capital available
specifically for green energy projects and greens the grid faster.  The
fiancee' of a friend is actually in the green energy development business (I
only learned this yesterday) and the participation in the green energy fee
programs is bringing green projects in as fast as they can staff and start
construction.  Mostly, they do windmills.

&gt;&gt; Committment to what?! The Warm Fuzzies?

&gt;&gt; Big fat hairy deal. Someone is getting rich off their stupidity.

&gt;&gt; Here's something for you: I'll charter them all one of my Boeing BBJ's
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; a cut rate, provided they ALL fly on the same plane. That will do a
&gt;&gt; PHUQUE

When asked about it. Blame the interviewer or moderator.
And only Left Wingers really care about abortion. I don't give a rat's ass

someone wants an abortion.

LOL! Pretty much what I've been saying all along. &quot;Carbon Credits&quot; give
the Touchy-Feelies the Warm Fuzzies, and that's about it. The planes they
are flying are still emitting the *SAME* amount of pollution whether they
'pay the fine' or not.

If all of them going to the same destination at the same time chartered
ONE jet, it would do a lot more to cut pollution than the idiotic 'carbon
credit' scheme.

&quot;he campaign to stop the wind farms was started by Cape Cod merchants
and wealthy landowners. It's also opposed by almost every town
government. Sen. Ted Kennedy, who has a home overlooking the proposed
wind farm, also opposes the project. So does one of Martha's Vineyard
most famous residents, former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite.&quot;

Well, being a Conservative, I have NO problem with Wind Farms. But the two
that were proposed in my county were shot down in flames, the company has
given up any further development plans, and most of the opposition came
from the same Liberal k00k whackos that are the first ones to yell and
scream about coal and oil fired plants. COVE: Citizens Opposed to

And there was a Conservation company that did a study on wind farms and
the effects it would have on two proposed wind farms in Mass, the
mentioned Cape farm and another in Heath that said this is a wive's tale.

&gt; LOL! Pretty much what I've been saying all along. &quot;Carbon Credits&quot; give
&gt; the Touchy-Feelies the Warm Fuzzies, and that's about it. The planes they
&gt; are flying are still emitting the *SAME* amount of pollution whether they
&gt; 'pay the fine' or not.

&gt; If all of them going to the same destination at the same time chartered

Bzzt.  DH appreciates commitment.  If you believe ponying up cash is

No one - at least none of the Democrat front-runners - has said we'll have
to dramatically change the way we do business.  Scary storiies about the
social agenda of the Global Warming crowd are fantasies from Rush Limbaugh's
ass.

It's Al Gore's contention - and mine - that we can make money combatting
global warming.  We can make money, that is, if we get off our asses and
build the 21st century energy technologies FIRST.  If we wait, we'll be
renting the power sources of the future from the Chinese.

The oil companies ahve powerful lobbies, and EVERYONE bellies up to the

political clout to actually accomplish something, but talk is cheap, isn't
it?

And all the money does is go to someone who's already 'green', anyway.
Yes, it's a good reward for forward thinking, and it *may* eventually make
others think about doing something.

But the company I worked for practices Green and is slowly going down the
tubes, because the cost of being Green is more than the revenue it
generates. I don't know if he's in on the Carbon Credit scam, but if he
isn't he should be with Clinton and Edwards footing the bill...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you like a wind farm next to your house?  For me, no I would not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't mind if I could see it from my house.  The ones I know of - &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt; the other one mentioned to be in planning stages - are out in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; countryside, not smack next to anyone's home.  People can see them - up
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the hill - from their windows, but they're not *right* next door.

&gt;&gt; BTW - look at a population map of the Tug Hill plateau, if you can find
&gt;&gt; one. OTOH, nevermind a pop. map, a plain old road map would be fine.  A
&gt;&gt; wind farm up there would be seen by *very* few people.  See the empty
&gt;&gt; place in the middle here?  That's the Tug Hill plateau.

Nope.  A bit too desolate.  And though I like snow, there's a limit. ;-)
Last winter they got absolutely hammered w/snow - even more than the usual
deal - &amp; that's saying something!, incl. the more populous (it's all
relative) towns along the fringes of the Tug.

See above. ;-)  Yep, lake effect galore.  If I lived up on the Tug Hill, I
think I'd actually, truly need an AWD. With a *lot* of clearance.

Of course, you can yammer about the bible all day long.  I don't want
to hear politicians talk religion on the stump.  It takes the place of
talking about the real problems in the USA.

The republican popes-in-waiting just talk about Jesus, and the old
testament, and the new testament, and abortions, on and on.  They
can't &quot;do&quot; anything: can't fix healthcare, can't fix the Iraq war,
can't find the missing Iraqi $10 Billion, can't find the missing
American $12 Billion, can't find the 120,000+ lost Russian/Romanian
AK-47s, can't fix the roads and bridges, can't fix the tax system, etc.

I can't wait to see you shit your pants when Hillary gets sworn in as
the next President with all the Unitary Executive powers handed over

that will never allow any indictments or trials so nothing will get to

&gt; Made a lot of points with the Koreans.

&gt; Really pissed off the Japanese...

Let's see, pissing off the Japanese.  Hmmm, maybe that's not a good idea

I could do worse.  I could say 'Nie'.  And demand that he bring us a

It wasn't JUST the Korean women they used as sex slaves--lots of Caucasians
of various nationalities, too. What RIGHT do the Yapanese have to get pissed
off at having THEIR moral failings pointed out? In many, many ways the
Japanese were JUST as bad as the Nazis when it came to being inhumane
towards both civilians AND POW's. They SHOULD be highly embarrassed STILL
and should be damn grateful that their entire sorry excuse for a nation
wasn't obliterated by A-bombs. And, no, you know DAMN well that I am no
DEMONrat Joe Stalin type.

Yah, but Sharx, we need Congress and the President to address the country's
needs.  We need the tax cuts made permanent so the economy will go roaring
ahead like a locomotive like a full head of steam, not choke and gasp like
in the Carter years.  They're spending time on this realatively minor issue
when the 110th and last Congress hasn't tried to solve any of the issues
they promised the voters they would solve back just a year ago.  They've
tried to fix a couple though chicanery and Bush vetoed their BS.  Now
they're trying to change the issue to Global Warming, please notice that the
fingers never leave the hand.  All the Dims have is that they HATE BUSH.
They don't have any real positive anything.  But the Republicans didn't try
to do anything the previous 2 years, either.

I think we ought to tell the insurgents they have two choices:  1.
Surrender. or 2. Glow for 10,000 years.  That's the only thing those
ragheads know.  Being nice doesn't work with those scumbums.
