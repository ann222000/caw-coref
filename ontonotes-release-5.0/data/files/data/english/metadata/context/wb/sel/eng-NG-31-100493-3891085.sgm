see http://inlinediesel.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=121 for pictures.

my wife had just left a stop sign and was driving approximately 30mph in a
35mph zone on a city street.  a truck pulling out of a bank parking lot
somehow "didnt see" my wife in her quad cab long bed 1 ton truck and he
t-boned her.  my wife and the kids are all fine, my son who was sitting at
the door that got directly whacked never even stopped playing his video
game.

as you can see the door is crushed, the bed is crushed, and the pillar that
goes between the back of the door and the bed is also crushed.  to say im
"angry" would be an understatement.  her truck that stickered for nearly
$45,000 has just been devalued.  when it comes time to trade or sell, carfax
will show its been wrecked and you know what that does to the value of a
vehicle.

what i really dont understand is that the highway patrolman didnt write the
driver of the other truck a ticket for anything.  it was clearly his fault,
he claimed the sun was in his eyes (although my wife had headlights on due
to dusk setting in!), he impacted her truck, yet he didnt get a ticket?  the
reason this concerns me is that im afraid this will hurt our ability to
collect from his insurance company, or does this really even matter?  i
called the highway patrol who told me that they dont determine the fault of
an accident....told me that was a misconception about their role.  is there
something different about montana law or is it that way everywhere?

im also wondering what my realistic rights are here.  the pillar between the
door and the bed cannot be replaced, and i dont want to continue making a
$700 payment on a truck thats been bondo'd.

i have an appointment to see an attorney, but am wondering now what i can
expect.  i know accidents happen but were it not for [b]his[/b] negligence
our truck wouldnt be smashed now.

Point of impact usually tells the story. It does in your case. Your truck
was clearly more than half way through the intersection, no damage to front
fender or door.

No one was injured. Why do you need an attorney?
What law did he break?
Did he run a stop sign?
Did he run a red light?
Was he speeding?
If the police did not witness any broken laws or the accident, it is
unlikely that they would issue a summons.
No one likes bondo. Unless the truck is totalled or you are willing to
sell it, get used to it.
The pillar has minimal damage that can repaired. Why do you want a new
one? Unless you are willing to pay the difference, neither insurance
company is required to replace a repairable part.
The bank won't care what condition your truck is in. They will still
want their payment. I'm pretty sure there is no bondo exclusion in your
loan agreement.
The sun is usually more of a problem at dawn and dusk. It if was noon
and the sun was overhead, the sun is a non-issue.
Sorry to sound pesimistic, but accidents happen. Your insurance company
should provide you with an attorney if there is any litigation. Why do
you have one already? You paid a premium for your insurance company's
help during an accident. Ask them these questions. There's no reason to
hire an attorney of your own.

ill certainly consider a fair depreciation offer.  otherwise ill get it
through the courts.  im not looking for unjust compensation, only realistic
loss compensation.  nobody is grabbing their neck crying whiplash or asking
for one dime of "pain &amp; suffering" (this despite my wife is in moderate pain
in her back, but feels it will pass).  im only trying to prevent eating
depreciation due to the negligence of someone else.

my brother bought a new suburban last year.  less than a month later a car
ran a light and smacked them.  $4800 later the truck was repaired and when
he attempted to trade it, the truck was devalued an estimated 30% due to
having been wrecked.  had he gotten an attorney he could have recovered
depreciation compensation.....since he didnt, hes stuck with a truck he no
longer wants because he owes WAY more on it than it will sell for now thanks
to the negligence of someone else.  this is why im trying to protect my
interests now.  my insurance company said to let them see what they can
resolve before i seek outside counsel, but consultations are free.

If the attorney is free, then I see why you're going that route.
If you want to get reimbursed for depreciation, I'm guessing that a
litigation on your own will be the only way. I'm sure that insurance
policies have language to prevent them from having to litigate
depreciation because if they didn't, everyone involved in accidents
would be seeking depreciation compensation.
Good luck with this nightmare.

The truck is far from wrecked and in all honesty, how many people really use

What exactly is the officer going to give him a ticket for?  At best, he
could have given him a ticket for failure to yield right of way but in order
to do that, he would have to believe that the truck driver saw your wife and
pulled out anyway and we both know that didn't happen and the conditions at

accident, simple as that.

It is not up to the police to determine who is at fault.  That is up to the
insurance companies and if necessary, the legal system.  The duty of the
police is to report the facts involved in the accident and issue citations
for any laws that were broken which may have lead to the collision.  Despite
the no-fault garbage that some states like to tout, the fault is usually
attributed to the one who hit the other unless the one hit was cited for a
moving violation that could influence the situation such as speeding,
failure to yield right of way, careless driving....  It is obvious that your
wife is the one that was hit and since she was not cited for any moving
violations, the fault is clearly on the one who hit her and you will have no
problem collecting from his insurance.  They know that if they fight it,
that they will lose and that would cost them much more money and money is
the game with insurance.

I am surprised to hear you say this.  Unless you think that the cab was
forged out of a single piece of metal, it most certainly can be replaced and
you as a professional welder should know this.  While true that it does not
unbolt, it can be cut away and a new one welded into place, just like the
original one was.  As you can see, this is a structural component of the cab
and the amount of damage to it makes it appear to be irreparable so filler
will not be an issue except possibly where the new one is welded in.  As for
the bank or lending institution, it is not their concern what happens to the
vehicle, only that they get the money that they lent you along with the
interest that you agreed to.

I hope that your initial consultation is free or you can expect a bill.  All
he or his insurance is responsible for is the repairs to your vehicle.  When
you are on the road, you by default assume some risk and you should be
grateful that your wife and family was not injured and to look to make sure
that the truck is repaired properly.  There is little that an attorney can
do for you here other than cost you money.

Even if your wife thinks it will "pass", IMO, you would be a fool not
to, at the very least, document this pain by a visit to either a
doctor or the ER.

My wife got rear-ended while sitting at a stop light. It wasn't a
severe crash, but enough that she did suffer some neck pain. She
ignored it. Eventually her condition got worse and it was hell going
back to get the other driver's insurance company to pay. IIRC, she
ended up going through workman's comp insurance to cover medical
treatments. She was working at the time of the accident.

That was 23 years ago, she is still suffering from the damage done in
that tiny little accident and it's contiuned to worsen.

the rule of law is interesting.  philosphically, police do not
determine who is at fault at an accident scene.  police are authorized
to issue tickets for driving infractions that they did not see if they
are investigating an accident.  many states however require that those
violations be "related" to the accident, but not all.

so, in theory, the police could respond to the accident, issue several
cites for violations to driver a, but the insurance companies could
later decide that driver b was at fault.  not likely, but that can
happen and sometimes does.

realistically, it does help to have the police issue citations for
infractions that led to the accident.  it helps your cause should
there be a later dispute with the insurance companies and helps your
case years later if applying for new insurance to show that it was not
your fault.  why don't police cite?  two main reasons, one they feel
sorry for the drivers due to the injuries and/or damage already
present and two, laziness.  personally, i would want cites issued.  i
mean, how can police justify issuing you a ticket for something that
didn't cause an accident but could have, when they don't issue a
citation for the same violation that did cause an accident????

what?

the police officer only has to prove that the driver did not yield to
the other driver.  intent has nothing to do with it.  the law requires
that a driver yield to all vehicles that are close enough to be a
hazzard.  that would appear to be the case here since he hit the other
car.

traffic infractions are called malem prohibitum (my latin isn't
great).  that means they are wrong because the State says they are.
no intent required.  ignorance is no excuse.

criminal laws are malem in se (again, my latin really sucks) which
means they are wrong in themselves and some degree of intent is
required to violate those.

&gt;problem collecting from his insurance.  They know that if they fight it,
&gt;that they will lose and that would cost them much more money and money is
&gt;the game with insurance.

&gt;&gt; im also wondering what my realistic rights are here.  the pillar between
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; door and the bed cannot be replaced, and i dont want to continue making a
&gt;&gt; $700 payment on a truck thats been bondo'd.

&gt;I am surprised to hear you say this.  Unless you think that the cab was
&gt;forged out of a single piece of metal, it most certainly can be replaced and
&gt;you as a professional welder should know this.  While true that it does not
&gt;unbolt, it can be cut away and a new one welded into place, just like the
&gt;original one was.  As you can see, this is a structural component of the cab
&gt;and the amount of damage to it makes it appear to be irreparable so filler
&gt;will not be an issue except possibly where the new one is welded in.  As for
&gt;the bank or lending institution, it is not their concern what happens to the
&gt;vehicle, only that they get the money that they lent you along with the
&gt;interest that you agreed to.

&gt;&gt; i have an appointment to see an attorney, but am wondering now what i can
&gt;&gt; expect.  i know accidents happen but were it not for [b]his[/b] negligence
&gt;&gt; our truck wouldnt be smashed now.

&gt;I hope that your initial consultation is free or you can expect a bill.  All
&gt;he or his insurance is responsible for is the repairs to your vehicle.  When
&gt;you are on the road, you by default assume some risk and you should be
&gt;grateful that your wife and family was not injured and to look to make sure
&gt;that the truck is repaired properly.  There is little that an attorney can
&gt;do for you here other than cost you money.

When I got rear ended in my 3500 a few months ago, the cop didn't
write the other guy a ticket either.  The cop explained that since
there was more than $500 damage (Totaled the other guys Taurus, bent
my rear bumper to the tune of $1800), he had to write an accident
report in which he fixed the blame on the other driver which satisfied
the insurance company requirement.

He didn't write a ticket even though the other guy was following too
closely.  His reasoning was that "since the insurance company will
take care of it, the judge will dismiss the case.  In the end, it will
end up costing both of you a day off of work to sit in court for a
dismissed ticket."

I wouldn't have minded so much if the guy hadn't been whining about
the fact that it would be his second ticket in twelve days!

Nate, I'm truly glad that none of your family is injured. Scared the shit
out of them--probably, but not hurt.

The truck is metal and can be fixed. The important thing here is that thirty
years from now, are you gonna be mad that you lost a couple of thousand on
the truck or that your family didn't get hurt??

Don't want to piss ya off, but I tend to put things into perspective.

Unfortunately theres no real way to determine how much value (if any) is
lost unless you have 2 identical vehicles with the same equipment and
mileage in the same area that resell for different prices after the same
amount of time on the market. On a properly repaired vehicle, the
diminution of value is not usually very much at all. On a collectors
car, it can be great, and those vehicles usually pay extra for a
different kind of insurance coverage.
Here's a recent case concerning diminution of value. Different states
look at this differently, but recently the Indiana Supreme court says
it's not covered in Indiana;
http://www.namic.org/advocatenews/051107sa10.asp

There's also a website that looks at several states and how they stand
on diminished value claims;

I worked in the claims department for 5 years for a major insurance
company (just the property damage area, not medical). We used the police
report only to gather factual information, like drivers names, VIN data,
distance from intersections, passenger names, etc. If the police officer
witnessed the accident, we would take his statement under consideration
along with other witness statements to help us determine fault. Most
police officers will not write a summons unless they witnessed or can
prove that a law was violated. If they didn't see the accident, it's
always a "he said, she said" scenario, so they are unwilling to write a
ticket/summons unless the violation is obvious (tires with no tread, no
inspection sticker, no proof of insurance, etc). It could have been that
the other vehicle was inching out into the highway trying to see around
parked trucks when the collision occurred, the police officer won't know
that.  Fault will be determined by the insurance agents based on witness
statements and impact location and damage, plus types of roads or
driveways, etc. Most states now require the vehicles to be moved out of
the traffic lanes before the police even get there these days, unless an
injury or fatality ids involved, so the police might not even see what
the position of the vehicles was.

Your rights are to have the vehicle repaired to the condition it was in
prior to the accident. There are variations in different states about
whether or not aftermarket parts can be used, but your insurance company
will probably send you information about that once you file your claim.
The vehicle will be repaired (not replaced) unless they determine the
repairs might exceed the vehicles value (total loss). Based on the value
you mentioned for the truck, and the relatively small amount of damage
(it always seems worse to the owner) there's no doubt that the vehicle
is repairable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; i have an appointment to see an attorney, but am wondering now what i can

It never hurts to get a free consultation, but keep in mind that if the
attorney is able to get an extra payment for diminution of value, the
extra payment you get might be less than what the lawyer collects from you.
Ask your agent about diminution of value, they should be able to fill
you in. I'd recommend letting your own company handle your claim, and
through a preferred repair facility if your happy with that facility.
Preferred facilities usually offer some extra benefits like no delays
for estimates, lifetime guarantees on the repairs/paint job, and
sometimes lower deductibles if you have to pay a deductible. Many states
allow your company to waive your deductible if it's obvious the other
person is at fault and they have insurance (sometimes a police report
needs to be written). That would mean that YOUR company will take care
of you and do everything (within the limits of your coverage) to get
reimbursement from the other company. It has to be obvious that the
other person was more at fault than your wife, though. They have to
consider what the other driver did to avoid the accident, and also what
your wife could have done to avoid the accident.
If you do decide to use an attorney, your insurance company might not be
able to help you with the claim because that action could affect their
ability to collect damages on your behalf.  Make sure you read your
policy before you make that decision, it gives all the warnings and
potential exclusions in there.
You really need to contact your agent to go over your coverage and what
the rules of your particular state are, since all states differ in how
they determine negligence and payments.

Good Luck!

John

In NC (Raleigh anyway) they don't write citation's either unless there

&gt; t-boned her.  my wife and the kids are all fine, my son who was sitting at
&gt; the door that got directly whacked never even stopped playing his video
&gt; game.

&gt; as you can see the door is crushed, the bed is crushed, and the pillar
&gt; that goes between the back of the door and the bed is also crushed.  to
&gt; say im &quot;angry&quot; would be an understatement.  her truck that stickered for
&gt; nearly $45,000 has just been devalued.  when it comes time to trade or
&gt; sell, carfax will show its been wrecked and you know what that does to the
&gt; value of a vehicle.

&gt; what i really dont understand is that the highway patrolman didnt write
&gt; the driver of the other truck a ticket for anything.  it was clearly his
&gt; fault, he claimed the sun was in his eyes (although my wife had headlights
&gt; on due to dusk setting in!), he impacted her truck, yet he didnt get a
&gt; ticket?  the reason this concerns me is that im afraid this will hurt our
&gt; ability to collect from his insurance company, or does this really even
&gt; matter?  i called the highway patrol who told me that they dont determine
&gt; the fault of an accident....told me that was a misconception about their
&gt; role.  is there something different about montana law or is it that way
&gt; everywhere?

&gt; im also wondering what my realistic rights are here.  the pillar between
&gt; the door and the bed cannot be replaced, and i dont want to continue
&gt; making a $700 payment on a truck thats been bondo'd.

&gt; i have an appointment to see an attorney, but am wondering now what i can
&gt; expect.  i know accidents happen but were it not for [b]his[/b] negligence
&gt; our truck wouldnt be smashed now.

that wants to keep its money, and another party that wants to spend as

&gt; That sounds like paranoia to me and will put the insurance company on the

&gt;&gt; Rubbish. A proper body shop will repair with as little filler as
&gt;&gt; possible.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The pillar has minimal damage that can repaired. Why do you want a new
&gt;&gt; &gt; one? Unless you are willing to pay the difference, neither insurance
&gt;&gt; &gt; company is required to replace a repairable part.

&gt;&gt; More crap. One, you don't know the damage, two, it may well be that the
&gt;&gt; policy Nate bought requires replacement.

&gt; Considering the pillar is a primary component of the structural integrity
&gt; of
&gt; the cab and actually appears to have significant damage, it will probably
&gt; need to be replaced regardless of the policy he has and his policy really
&gt; doesn't matter unless he intends to make a claim against he own insurance.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The bank won't care what condition your truck is in. They will still
&gt;&gt; &gt; want their payment. I'm pretty sure there is no bondo exclusion in your
&gt;&gt; &gt; loan agreement.

&gt;&gt; That wasn't his point.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry to sound pesimistic, but accidents happen. Your insurance company
&gt;&gt; &gt; should provide you with an attorney if there is any litigation. Why do
&gt;&gt; &gt; you have one already? You paid a premium for your insurance company's
&gt;&gt; &gt; help during an accident. Ask them these questions. There's no reason to
&gt;&gt; &gt; hire an attorney of your own.

&gt;&gt; Simply put, the attorney works for the person/company paying the fee.
&gt; Thus,
&gt;&gt; Nate should have an attorney of his own, not just one that the insurance
&gt;&gt; company pays for.

&gt; While you are correct, I doubt that he will really need one or that one
&gt; would do him any good.

Actually, it is not a bad thing since they cannot say the other insurance
company is not responding.  I would wait until you find out your wife
condition (if anything) because once you get started, additions will make
the insurance company very suspicious and defensive.  As for attempting to
collect for depreciation due to the accident, good luck with that.

&gt; &gt; No one was injured. Why do you need an attorney?

&gt; depreciation compensation.  you ever try to tell/trade a vehicle thats been
&gt; wrecked?

&gt; &gt; What law did he break?

&gt; failure to yield?

&gt; &gt; Was he speeding?

&gt; speeding in what sense?  for the highway speed limit, no.  the impact
&gt; occured where the driveway meets the street, and its determined that he was
&gt; running an estimated 35 mph.  obviously he didnt stop (unless a truck with a
&gt; loaded 8-horse trailer can accelerate from 0 to 35mph in 5 feet).  i dont
&gt; drive 35 mph through bank parking lots, and dont consider it reasonable for
&gt; others to either.

&gt; &gt; No one likes bondo. Unless the truck is totalled or you are willing to
&gt; &gt; sell it, get used to it.

&gt; and this is why im seeking the advice of an attorney.  i will not pay for
&gt; bondo.  it didnt have bondo on it when i bought it, and im not going to
&gt; settle for it now due to HIS negligence.  why should i have to live with
&gt; bondo due to HIS negligence?

&gt; &gt; The pillar has minimal damage that can repaired. Why do you want a new
&gt; &gt; one? Unless you are willing to pay the difference, neither insurance
&gt; &gt; company is required to replace a repairable part.

&gt; the door and the bed can both be unbolted and replaced.  the pillar cannot
&gt; be replaced without being frankensteined.

&gt; &gt; The bank won't care what condition your truck is in. They will still
&gt; &gt; want their payment. I'm pretty sure there is no bondo exclusion in your
&gt; &gt; loan agreement.

&gt;  i never said i was going to default on my loan.  i said i wasnt going to
&gt; pay for bondo.  this is why im getting an attorney.  if bondo is &quot;no big
&gt; deal&quot; then surely they wont mind taking the truck for themselves and
&gt; reselling it.  they can take the hit, i wont.

&gt; &gt; You paid a premium for your insurance company's
&gt; &gt; help during an accident. Ask them these questions. There's no reason to
&gt; &gt; hire an attorney of your own.

&gt; ill certainly consider a fair depreciation offer.  otherwise ill get it
&gt; through the courts.  im not looking for unjust compensation, only realistic
&gt; loss compensation.  nobody is grabbing their neck crying whiplash or asking
&gt; for one dime of &quot;pain &amp; suffering&quot; (this despite my wife is in moderate pain
&gt; in her back, but feels it will pass).  im only trying to prevent eating
&gt; depreciation due to the negligence of someone else.

&gt; my brother bought a new suburban last year.  less than a month later a car
&gt; ran a light and smacked them.  $4800 later the truck was repaired and when
&gt; he attempted to trade it, the truck was devalued an estimated 30% due to
&gt; having been wrecked.  had he gotten an attorney he could have recovered
&gt; depreciation compensation.....since he didnt, hes stuck with a truck he no
&gt; longer wants because he owes WAY more on it than it will sell for now thanks
&gt; to the negligence of someone else.  this is why im trying to protect my
&gt; interests now.  my insurance company said to let them see what they can
&gt; resolve before i seek outside counsel, but consultations are free.

Where do you get the 30% devaluation from? My 2000 GMC Sierra 1500 4x4
took out a 95 Camaro, and a 97 Cavalear in Jan 03, when the kid in the
uninsured Z-28 turned in front of me and there was no place for me to
go. The Camaro's front end was taken off, and the woman in the Cavalear
had to be cut out, the car was too "tweaked" for the doors to open, I
had hit her left rear corner at about 50, and launched her over 100'
down the shoulder of the road. She wasn't hurt, the kid in the Z-28
wasn't hurt, but I was, mostly from the second impact, when the airbags
went off.

After $11,000+ of repairs, my Sierra still had issues, mostly
electrical, related to the crash, and after taking it back to the
bodyshop about a dozen times, I pretty much had had enough. I was going
to buy another Sierra, but the dealer played games and I went to Dodge,
that was what I really wanted anyway.

The trade in was the same at both dealers, $15,000, about $500 less than
a friend had received for his 2000 Sierra (They stickered about a
hundred apart, mine was more) that had never been wrecked and wasn't
"doggy smelling", like mine was. They knew about my wreck, it wasn't all
that hard to tell anyway. His truck and mine were pretty close, milage
and wear wise, in fact we had both just replaced the driver's seat,
under warranty due to it splitting. Both were midlevel trim, mine was
black his was blue.

If your claim was true, I would have only expected to get about $10K. I
expected to take some sort of hit, but the salesman shook his head, and
said it was fixed right, and they had no problem giving me 15K on it.
The list of parts replaced on mine was three pages long. The entire
drivetrain and suspension on the front drivers side, quarter panel,
driver's door, front bumper, wheel and tire, were all replaced with new
stuff. State Farm insurance was great, no complaints, but the body shop
was a joke( I picked it, not them). When I got it back, I basically had
no front brakes, and nearly went out onto a busy highway when I pulled
out of the dealer's driveway.

By the time I was done with the body shop, I wouldn't have believed me
if they told me the sun was coming up the next morning.

&gt; &gt; I am glad to hear that your family is uninjured.  Count your blessings
&gt; &gt; there.

&gt; many thanks!

&gt; &gt; The truck is far from wrecked

&gt; i gotta disagree there.  its definately wrecked.

Not by definition.  While I will agree that it does look like hell and need
some serious body work to look new again,  it appears to need no repairs at
all to be fully functional.  I bet that back door still works as well.

&gt; &gt; how many people really use
&gt; &gt; car fax anyway.

&gt; every dealership where you go to trade in your truck.  when im shopping
for
&gt; used vehicles (bought 3 in the last year alone!) i always use carfax.
when
&gt; a carfax shoes an accident, i always and without exception move on to
&gt; another vehicle, without regard to any of the details involved.

&gt; &gt; Unless you plan on dumping it in the next few years,

&gt; in 2000 i bought a new jeep wrangler.  in 2001 i bought an expedition.  in
&gt; 2002 i bought a new mustang gt.  in 2003 i bought 2 new jeep wranglers.
in
&gt; 2004 i bought a used f350, a used dodge 2500, and a new dodge ram (the one
&gt; that got wrecked).  so far in 2005 ive bought a new jeep wrangler, and an
&gt; '05 bighorn dually diesel.  as clearly demonstrated in my vehicle history,
i
&gt; buy a new vehicle more often than many people buy new shoes.  yes, this
&gt; truck in question will also be dumped soon.

I guess that money just burns a hole in your pocket, huh :-)  The problem is
that most insurance companies will not pay you for depreciation because the
resale value is not their concern.  They are only obligated to return the
vehicle to pre-accident conditions.

LOL, the problem is that I doubt that he knew the specific summons code for
hitting Nate's truck.  Like others have said, since he didn't see the
accident, he really doesn't know what happened.

&gt; but to replace it will require a frankenstein job and i know how that shit

Not if it is done correctly.  It was welded on to begin with so why should a
new one be any worse if done correctly and a good body shop is more than
capable of performing this operation.  As for the paint, since the factory
paint is for the most part shit anymore, I don't see how the body shop could
do any worse.

See, but here's the deal.  The family DIDN'T get hurt - so that's out of the

That isn't the case.  The two here aren't mutually exclusive.

I can understand exactly where he's coming from.  It's different if they
were driving home, and a wind storm blew a tree over that hit the truck.
That's when you say, "well, metal can be fixed - as long as you're all OK".
That's an accident.  It falls under the "shit happens" clause.  The damage

marks for a vehicle traveling at 35 MPH would be of a significant length so
where exactly did driver 2 apply these brakes.  Then again, perhaps the
officer was using the density of the skid marks to determine speed but that
would be influenced by the weight of the vehicle and if he estimated it

Body work and all came out fine, but she was worried about resale...
Her insurance company told her to get 2 "experts" to estimate the amount of
resale value lost due to record of it being bent...
She got one from a local dealer regarding resale, I got one from a friend that
runs a used car lot... they were both pretty close, in this case about $3,000,
and the insurance company agreed to compensate her that amount without a

&gt;what i really dont understand is that the highway patrolman didnt write the

&gt;he claimed the sun was in his eyes (although my wife had headlights on due

&gt;called the highway patrol who told me that they dont determine the fault of

&gt;im also wondering what my realistic rights are here.  the pillar between the

Once again - I'll explain it so you can understand.  Initially, the way Nate
described it, it sounded like the impact occurred at 30-35MPH.  When he
clarified, it became apparent that the speed of the vehicle was determined
to be 30-35MPH based on the skid marks, meaning that the speed at impact was
significantly slower (as evidenced by the amount of damage done).

True. And as a 21 year police veteran in Texas, the guy was at fault.
I know the accident didn't occur in Texas. But here a driver is required
to come to a complete stop when exiting a private drive (includes
parking lots). Then pull out onto the street only when safe to do so. It
sounds as if the moron never stopped. As for the ticket issue. Here in
Texas we don't issue traffic tickets either if an officer does not
witness the accident or violation. Now if there is an injury or death
then that's a different story. An officer will write tickets or make an
arrest in those cases. An officer also does not find fault in an
accident. Although there is a space on the accident report for
"officer's opinion" as to who caused the accident. In Texas an accident
is considered a civil matter and therefore your insurance companies
"work it out" between themselves. They have their own investigators to
do this. The police only are there to gather facts and to deal with the
traffic nightmares that usually occur with an accident.
On a side note the worst thing I have ever heard as an officer is
while working an accident on a major highway. The squeeling of brakes
will make you run and jump for cover and will make a certain part of
your anatomy pucker up. People just do not pay attention to what they
are doing.

I see what you're saying and can't argue with it. I'd want my truck fixed

An officer in Universal City, TX lost her legs about 2 years ago when a
car rear-ended her patrol car at a stop, and an officer trying to catch
speeders and DWI drivers in San Antonio got rear ended by a DWI driver
and lost his life last month. (His wife was the dispatcher on duty when
the call came in)

It happens too often. OK finally passed a law this year that requires
drivers to move over to another lane when passing a police car stopped
on the shoulder. Hope that helps, but unfortunately there will always be
bad drivers and drunk drivers out there.

&gt; where would you begin to estimate?  seriously....if you were in the market

&gt; history and the other without any damage history, which one are you going to
&gt; buy?

If I had a choice between 2 trucks at the same price I would definitely
take the undamaged one, no question about it. But the real question is
if there was only 1 truck available, and it was properly repaired, how
much less would I pay than if it wasn't ever in an accident? I don't
know. I might pay the same if it had the equipment I wanted and it was
at a price I considered reasonable because there isn't a second truck to
compare it to. The used truck market is too fluid to say what the value
of one particular truck is worth from one day to the next. Depends on
the market at the day of sale.

&gt; thanks,

Actually, it can be better for you. You have your policy covering your
insured interests under your "first party" coverage, and your company
will cover the loss under the other drivers "third party" coverage. That
means that any potential gaps in coverage would be covered by the other
policy. They'll be quicker to take care of your repairs, and if you
don't have rental car coverage under your policy, you'll get it
automatically under the other drivers "liability" coverage as long as
he's at fault. No protracted arguments between companies haggling over
whether they'll pay your claims or not.
Keep in mind that if they were different companies, your company would
not necessarily be fighting for "your best interests". They are only
allowed to subrogate for actual payments they made to you under the
coverage that your policy contract calls for. They can't subrogate for
extra money that they didn't pay for, and if your policy doesn't cover
loss of value (very few do) then they can't try to get that from the
other company because they won't pay you for coverage you don't have.

You keep talking about needing an attorney; you really should check to
see what coverage you get under your policies before you waste your
money on an attorney. I always felt sorry for those people that got an
attorney to get coverage for their property damage. We ended up paying
the same as the original estimate, but then they had to take a large
chunk out of that and give it to their attorney, so they ended up paying
the difference out of their own pocket.

&gt;&gt;Nate, if he T-boned your wife's truck doing 35MPH, I am _SERIOUSLY_
&gt;&gt;impressed at the level of damage.

&gt; im just going by the highway patrols statements that they base on load, skid
&gt; marks, etc.  his estimated speed was 30-35 and my wifes estimated speed was
&gt; 25-30 which my wife verified.
">

They may have been going 35 at the time they applied their brakes, but
it sure doesn't look like the damage to your vehicle was caused by a
vehicle going 35 at the time of impact!  Did they write those estimates
in their police report? That would surprise me because they don't
normally go to the expense and trouble of calculating estimated speed
unless a fatality was involved. It takes a lot more to estimate speed
than just measuring skid marks. For an actual assessment they need to
weigh the load, check the brakes on the tow vehicle and trailer, measure
the tread, take tire samples, check the air pressure in the tires, check
the air temperature, humidity, and check the friction quotient of the
asphalt or driveway surface if they want it to hold up in court. They
don't normally do that for fender-benders.
Of course nowadays they would just get a search warrant in a fatality
case and obtain the actual speed from the vehicle computer.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Like others have said, since he didn't see the
&gt; &gt; &gt; accident, he really doesn't know what happened.

&gt; &gt; Hmmm....  vehicle #1 was progressing down a street, vehicle #2 was
coming
&gt; &gt; out of a driveway.  #1 has side-impact damage, #2 has head-on damage.
#2
&gt; &gt; tried to stop, as evidenced by skid marks.  It's pretty obvious #1
didn't
&gt; &gt; slide sideways from across the street into #2.  It's also obvious #2 was
&gt; &gt; travelling at a certain rate of speed to make those skid marks - clearly
&gt; &gt; moving too quickly to safely turn 90° into traffic.

&gt; Funny how you questioned the speed in your initial post in this thread
&gt; saying with the minimal damage that vehicle 2 could not be going all that
&gt; fast and are not whining to me about vehicle 2 going to fast to make the
&gt; turn.  You really need to back off on the noise level and make up your
mind.

&gt; &gt; Those are all facts easily verifiable by looking at the scene.

&gt; Really???  Were you there?  Did you see the scene?

&gt; &gt; Now - is it
&gt; &gt; possible that #1 was travelling in the left-lane, and changed into the
&gt; &gt; right, striking #2 as he was pulling out into the right-hand lane?
&gt; Possible
&gt; &gt; (don't know if it was a multi-lane road, but say it was)....  but still,
&gt; why
&gt; &gt; the skid marks from #2, indicating (as Nate stated) an initial speed of
&gt; &gt; 30-35MPH when the brakes were applied?

&gt; Perhaps the skid marks were from another vehicle or perhaps vehicle 2's
&gt; brakes were not functioning properly and only the rear wheels applied
&gt; significant braking force.  Skid marks from the rear wheels only will
cause
&gt; much longer skid marks and you did know that, right?  And thinking of
that,
&gt; unless the driver was operating a Yugo or similarly sized vehicle, the
skid
&gt; marks for a vehicle traveling at 35 MPH would be of a significant length
so
&gt; where exactly did driver 2 apply these brakes.  Then again, perhaps the
&gt; officer was using the density of the skid marks to determine speed but
that
&gt; would be influenced by the weight of the vehicle and if he estimated it
&gt; incorrectly....  Perhaps it was just the position of the sun blinding
driver
&gt; 2 and he couldn't see her and the officer decided not to make driver 2's
day
&gt; even worse than it already was since he was not driving carelessly.  Like
I
&gt; said before, there are just too many variables.

That sounds about right, at least with a couple of weasels I have tried
to do business with. I couldn't believe a couple were even seriously
expecting me to go for them..

The amount one guy offered me trade in on two vehicles was less than I
got for one of them (86 Iroc Z28) after parking it in front of my
friend's store that's at a hugely busy intersection. I sold it the night
I parked it there. The other one, an 88 S10 Blazer was sold a short time
later to the friend above, who had it until recently when after almost
200K, two times being trashed inside when stolen, and a pretty good
wreck, he sold it for way more than a sane person would pay..

If I would have taken the deal the weasely dealer offered, I would have
lost about $7500, what I got for the Iroc.

Total rubbish. The control factor is to stop the vehicle or pull over if you
cannot see. It is well within the control of any person operating a vehicle
to make a decision regarding if they can see or not. This is one more

You're absolutely correct.  A unloaded 1/2 ton truck traveling 20 mph
will skid approximately 25 feet in a panic stop.  If this truck had a
trailer hooked to it then skid marks will tell absolutely nothing as far
as his actual speed.  Especially if he only had a few feet to skid
anyways from a parking lot entrance into the traffic lane.  Tom pointed
that out in his first post but decided to change his tune when it was
time for lets fuck with Tbone again.  With my truck I have a dead spot
on the passenger side from the side mirror and several times I have
almost pulled out in front of someone when the timing was just right.
It could be just what it is....... a accident and calling the other guy

&gt;&gt;hill.

&gt; so you would pay just as much for a truck that had been wrecked as you would
&gt; pay for a truck that hadnt been wrecked?  sorry, i dont buy it.  if youre
&gt; shopping for a truck and find two identical trucks (its really not that hard
&gt; to do) with one having been wrecked and one not, youre going to buy the one
&gt; that hasnt been wrecked even if the repairs are perfect (assuming both
&gt; trucks are in great shape otherwise).

Nate, my father was a body and fender repair man all his life.  If the
repair is done correctly it will be just as strong if not stronger than
the original.  Instead of a pillar that is spot welded you will have one
with a continuous weld and you will not be able to find the weld.  With
todays vehicles most shops don't even use bondo.  They cut and weld in
complete new panels or replace the entire section.   Bondo is for the
back yard mechanic.  Yes, if the repair is done properly I would buy a
previously wrecked vehicle if it was the truck I was looking for.

&gt;&gt; They may have been going 35 at the time they applied their brakes, but it

&gt;&gt; police report? That would surprise me because they don't normally go to
&gt;&gt; the expense and trouble of calculating estimated speed unless a fatality
&gt;&gt; was involved. It takes a lot more to estimate speed than just measuring
&gt;&gt; skid marks. For an actual assessment they need to weigh the load, check
&gt;&gt; the brakes on the tow vehicle and trailer, measure the tread, take tire
&gt;&gt; samples, check the air pressure in the tires, check the air temperature,
&gt;&gt; humidity, and check the friction quotient of the asphalt or driveway
&gt;&gt; surface if they want it to hold up in court. They don't normally do that
&gt;&gt; for fender-benders.

&gt; You're absolutely correct.  A unloaded 1/2 ton truck traveling 20 mph will
&gt; skid approximately 25 feet in a panic stop.  If this truck had a trailer
&gt; hooked to it then skid marks will tell absolutely nothing as far as his
&gt; actual speed.  Especially if he only had a few feet to skid anyways from a

I disagree, and thats why I posted. While you are correct in some of what

Yes, I did - because the way it was worded ("the accident occurred where the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but decided to change his tune when it was  time for lets fuck with Tbone

No - I changed my tune (if you want to call it that) when Nate clarified
that the HP officer stated (on a phone call - meaning he had time to do some
analysis) the initial speed was estimated at 30-35MPH based on the load of
the truck and the length of the skid marks.  My problem with T-Bone was his
statements to the effect of, "you can't place blame on the other driver,
because you weren't there, so you don't know what happened".  Unless Nate's
lying about the details of the accident location (highly unlikely), or lying
about the statements the Highway Patrol made to him (again, pretty
unlikely), it's hard to imagine a scenario where the other driver ISN'T at
fault.

As have I.  But - have you ever pulled into oncoming traffic from a parking
lot at 30+ MPH?  That's the part that categorizes the other driver as a
"moron".  Add in the part about the fully loaded horse trailer, and it's
even more puzzling why a reckless (let alone careless) driving citation
wasn't issued.  Putting myself in that situation, I can't imagine a scenario
where I don't pull to the end of the driveway, and either come to a stop, or
at least a creep, look, and then pull out.  Even if I don't see the oncoming
truck, no WAY am I pulling out onto the road fast enough to impact the side
of the truck that much.

Nate - can you take some pics of the area that this happened (if you haven't
already?)

No I haven't and common sense tells you that wouldn't be a easy thing to

If it were true.... but my experience is people with horses, assuming he
had any aboard are very cautious in how they turn and brake and even
when there are no animals aboard they seem to drive in the same manner
with their trailer.  There is to much missing from this story to make a
judgment like this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Maybe because it was not the situation as described and no I'm not
calling Nate a liar but he could have his information all turned around.
You know the Police officer could have been flat wrong. Just how long
do you think skid marks would be with the 20,000 pound total weight at
35 mph you mentioned?  I'd say a good 50-60 feet and to me that would
mean he skidded all the way across the highway into the parking lot
across the street  before making contact, unless of course the trailer
had brakes, locked up and over lapped the truck marks??.  Come on Tom,
use some logical thinking here.

Me either which leads me to think he probable never braked at all until
just before impact which would result is the damage that resulted
because of the force from the weight of his vehicle and load.  It still
places the fault with the driver of the other vehicle but a moron it
does not make without better information.  Most states believe it or not
usually have a speed limit of 10 mph in parking lots and certain
residential zones where there are children, at least the one's I've
lived in so why wasn't he issued a citation for speeding......maybe
because he wasn't going that fast?

&gt; resale value lost due to record of it being bent...
&gt; She got one from a local dealer regarding resale, I got one from a friend
&gt; that

&gt; $3,000,

&gt; hassle..
&gt; Glad that the family is ok... I know that's your main priority...

&gt; Hope this helps a little..

&gt;&gt;see http://inlinediesel.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=121 for pictures.

&gt;&gt;my wife had just left a stop sign and was driving approximately 30mph in a
&gt;&gt;35mph zone on a city street.  a truck pulling out of a bank parking lot
&gt;&gt;somehow &quot;didnt see&quot; my wife in her quad cab long bed 1 ton truck and he
&gt;&gt;t-boned her.  my wife and the kids are all fine, my son who was sitting at
&gt;&gt;the door that got directly whacked never even stopped playing his video
&gt;&gt;game.

&gt;&gt;as you can see the door is crushed, the bed is crushed, and the pillar
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;goes between the back of the door and the bed is also crushed.  to say im
&gt;&gt;&quot;angry&quot; would be an understatement.  her truck that stickered for nearly
&gt;&gt;$45,000 has just been devalued.  when it comes time to trade or sell,
&gt;&gt;carfax
&gt;&gt;will show its been wrecked and you know what that does to the value of a
&gt;&gt;vehicle.

&gt;&gt;what i really dont understand is that the highway patrolman didnt write
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;driver of the other truck a ticket for anything.  it was clearly his
&gt;&gt;fault,
&gt;&gt;he claimed the sun was in his eyes (although my wife had headlights on due
&gt;&gt;to dusk setting in!), he impacted her truck, yet he didnt get a ticket?
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;reason this concerns me is that im afraid this will hurt our ability to
&gt;&gt;collect from his insurance company, or does this really even matter?  i
&gt;&gt;called the highway patrol who told me that they dont determine the fault
&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;an accident....told me that was a misconception about their role.  is
&gt;&gt;there
&gt;&gt;something different about montana law or is it that way everywhere?

&gt;&gt;im also wondering what my realistic rights are here.  the pillar between
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;door and the bed cannot be replaced, and i dont want to continue making a
&gt;&gt;$700 payment on a truck thats been bondo'd.

&gt;&gt;i have an appointment to see an attorney, but am wondering now what i can
&gt;&gt;expect.  i know accidents happen but were it not for [b]his[/b] negligence
&gt;&gt;our truck wouldnt be smashed now.

Thought you said she (your wife) was on the street and the other driver
was coming out of a parking lot.  Doesn't he have to turn left or right?
If it was a angled collision then it could be even easier for the
truck and trailer not to see on coming traffic properly or make a
misjudgment in speed and flow, especially if he was under the impression
your wife was getting ready to enter the parking lot.   Sounds like it
was what it probable is...... a accident.

&gt;wrong just to keep a pissing match going on and that is just what you do
&gt;on a constant basics.
">

while i don't necessarily disagree with some of what you have said
jerry, for crying out loud, that is exactloy what you did here and
what you have doing lately when you decide to post.  you jump in and
post bullshit that is only going to stir things up again.  if you slow
down a bit, and relax, you'd be able to see that nate was pissed and
wanted some other people's opinion of what happened.  some gave good
advise and some went off on the holy grail route.

doesn't seem like all that big a deal really.

and for tbone and max, that does get a little old, but it just seems
to be their calling.  i try to stay out of that.  max really does like
to bait tom, and tom has the rare ability to constantly jump into
areas where he has no knowledge and tell people what to do.  tom
pretty much ends up in the shit with everyone.  he has some good
advise if he would just learn to stay in areas that he knows what he
is talking about, he would do much better.  i am pretty sure that he
is on a few other forums that i read (that is why i keep asking if he
is t_bone from arizona) because the comments are so similar and he
ends up in the shit with everpyone there too.

it is interesting though that the onlly time i see you here anymore is
when you blast in all pissed off, pitching shit on people, because
they pitched shit on people.

just saying jerry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;common sense tells you that wouldn't be a easy thing to do coming out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;a parking lot making a 90 degree turn pulling a horse trailer

&gt;&gt; not a 90 degree turn at all.  there is a one way driveway coming in, and
&gt;&gt; and a one way driveway going out, both are angled.  if it will make a
&gt;&gt; difference i can go take a picture of the driveways.

Bullshit......... the local WalMart where I live has no stop sign or a
painted stop on the pavement at their exit before the street and I exit
there all the time without stopping first.  Why should I.... there is a
clear view of traffic at least a 100 feet in both direction before even
getting to the exit and that view is 500-600 feet on both sides of the
road. So if there is no traffic for several hundred feet on the road
before the exit why should anyone stop.  I doubt there is a single

read what i said again.  i said choosing not to stop before exiting a
parking lot onto a VERY BUSY city street.  if nothing is coming there is no
reason to stop, but this street in question is very busy.  its the only
street in and out of a residential area with thousands of residents.  my
wife said there were cars directly in front of her and directly behind her.
its wasnt an issue of would he hit a car, so much as which car would he hit.
now i wasnt there to see this, but i trust fully in what my wife tells me.
this is an issue of negligence at best.

&gt; getting to the exit and that view is 500-600 feet on both sides of the
&gt; road. So if there is no traffic for several hundred feet on the road
&gt; before the exit why should anyone stop.  I doubt there is a single person
&gt; around this NG that has never done the same thing.  It doesn't really
&gt; matter Nate and like I said before I understand your frustration and right

Then we will just have to disagree Nate.  There are times when a slow

My way out is to stop yanking your chain. You are the one that locked
yourself into making sure I didn't get the last word. I told you to go ahead
and take it, or to just stop posting, but you are determined to make sure I
don't get the last word. So now, if you don't answer, you look like the fool
(at least in your mind), because I'll have beaten you at YOUR game by
getting the last word. And if you do answer, I just poke ya again, and the
game goes on.

Thats right Jerry, you are so smart, you created your very own "Catch 22",
and put yourself in the middle. Hell, I thought you were smarter than that,
but thats the way it goes.

But no one else cares if you answer or not. Not even me. I think its amusing
that you've caught yourself in this little spin. The only one that will
think you lost if you stop replying is YOU.... ok, so maybe Tbone will think
you lost..... and maybe some casual observers..... I dunno, maybe even they
will think you finally got wise.

But you cannot resist.....so you'll reply to keep me from "winning".

Whatever. Your turn.

Most states have driving codes that require any traffic entering a
public street to come to a full stop before entering. Doesn't have to
have a stop sign. Then theres the provision that you have to yield the

&gt;&gt; clear view of traffic at least a 100 feet in both direction before even
&gt;&gt; getting to the exit and that view is 500-600 feet on both sides of the
&gt;&gt; road. So if there is no traffic for several hundred feet on the road
&gt;&gt; before the exit why should anyone stop.  I doubt there is a single person
&gt;&gt; around this NG that has never done the same thing.  It doesn't really
&gt;&gt; matter Nate and like I said before I understand your frustration and
&gt;&gt; right to be mad because your truck has been wrecked but you're picking at
&gt;&gt; straws now.

&gt;&gt; Jerry
&gt; Most states have driving codes that require any traffic entering a public
&gt; street to come to a full stop before entering. Doesn't have to have a stop
&gt; sign. Then theres the provision that you have to yield the right of way to
&gt; traffic on the priority street.

LOL. DUH. No way out? You are familiar with the off button, right? See
Jerry, I don't give a damn what you think of me, nor do I figure what anyone
else on here thinks of me matters too much. Ok, maybe there are a couple,
but they already know me offline. So Jerry, the way out for me is to hit the
off button. Just like it is for you. I offer you the chance to just walk
away, and you keep replying.... all because you don't want me to get the
last word. Meanwhile, since you keep replying, you keep doing what you
accused me of doing.

Really? Why is it we could look up your record on almost any NG search and
find that you post at least monthly? And if you stopped, why is it I've been

Wow, another chapter of my life I was apparently unaware of, please tell me

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Ok, so in this one, you have the word "teacher" in bold. Well, thats
terrific. BUt you failed in two things. First, its someone else saying that
I'm a teacher, not me. Thus, your claim is based on unproven knowledge. IOW,
I didn't say it was me. But the real failure is that it doesn't say I was
fired. Further, that thread shows at least two instances where I acknowledge
being wrong, which you claim I never do. On top of that, the main argument
was one of boring a block, which any engine builder does as a matter of
course. If he doesn't the build is all but doomed to premature failure, and
certainly won't have the power it could if bored.

I didn't go on to read the entire thread, I don't particularly give a damn.
Feel free to point out anything you feel makes you correct, and I'll take a
look. See, thats me being fair, after all, I DID yank your chain enough to
get you to look it up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Wow, you highlighed the word teacher again. In the second example, I was
saying that someone else sucked as a teacher, not labelling myself. Nice
try, but no dice.

Back to the archives with you. Find that proof that I got fired as a
teacher.

Obsessed by your life...LOL... not hardly.  But a guy that can't even
hold down a teaching job and gets fired from it has a problem.  Usually
when a teacher screws up they get promoted with a pay raise. Hell even
when you tried to be a tutor the kids father fired your ass.  Then you
come on here crying about all the jobs you we're fired from, how your
Dad's will screwed you out of , what was it a coin collection and a
stack of comic books............. all you ever do is cry, complain and
argue with everyone.  You don't really want to re-read those posts where
you cried because you couldn't have the last word or was fired from
every job you attempted do you.  Besides I'm confident everyone here
remembers them anyway.  You remind me of Cliff on Cheers.......same
situation, same jerk except he actually had a visible job and not a made
up job to try and hide his failures in life as you do.  For a guy that
has already turned 40 you haven't accomplished much in life have you.  I
see you have to respond to every single thing I mention, even laundry
and I'm sure that comment actually went over your head.......... Been
doing laundry since you were 10 years old huh......  Sorry maxipad but
you didn't grow up at all. No maxipad, I didn't challenge you to
anything.  What you are doing now is what you do in every thread and I
do mean every thread.  I'm simply pulling your chain, watching you jump
and spin like the little puppy dog you are and shamefully starting to
enjoy it. Wouldn't be surprised if when there is a little slack at the
drive up window you run home to read this.....oops.... don't want to
give that one away do we. Don't worry, I'll eventually unhook that chain
and let you outside to play in another sand box.    After all it
probable isn't fair to mommy to have to get up several times each night
and tell you to stop screaming in the dark.  But for the moment seeing
you dance and do a slow burn is a little more entertaining.

Well Steve, you do bring up a good point.  The story here keeps changing
from a 35 MPH T-Bone to now what looks like a sideswipe form a merge where
the truck did not yield right of way.  The part not being talked about is
what Nates wife did or didn't do in the situation.  Did she apply her brakes
or even sound her horn to try and avoid the accident?  I would suspect that
one of the reasons why the officer did not issue a summons is that if he
did, he might have to issue one to Nates wife as well for as Max defines it,
careless driving.  If she saw what was happening, which according to Nate,
she did and did nothing to attempt to avoid it, then she did not take
complete control of her vehicle and again, by the Max definition, could be
sited for careless driving.  Without any tickets issued, it is still clearly
the fault of the other driver but if tickets were issued and the ones being
summoned choose to fight them, a whole new world of hurt could begin for
both sides and since he did not witness the accident or the events leading
up to it, he played it safe.

&gt;&gt; I've always thought that motor vehicle laws should be more
&gt;&gt; like marine right of way laws.  The over-riding rule is
&gt;&gt; that you are supposed to do everything possible to avoid a
&gt;&gt; collision.  Just because you collide with a boat that was
&gt;&gt; supposed to give way to you doesn't mean you're entirely
&gt;&gt; off the hook.  Did you slow down?  Did you radio him?  Did
&gt;&gt; you make it clear to him what you were doing?

&gt;&gt; I think there's more than a few accidents caused by people
&gt;&gt; who simply know they have the right of way and ain't going
&gt;&gt; to give it up to anyone.

&gt;Well Steve, you do bring up a good point.  The story here keeps changing
&gt;from a 35 MPH T-Bone to now what looks like a sideswipe form a merge where
&gt;the truck did not yield right of way.  The part not being talked about is
&gt;what Nates wife did or didn't do in the situation.  Did she apply her brakes
&gt;or even sound her horn to try and avoid the accident?  I would suspect that
&gt;one of the reasons why the officer did not issue a summons is that if he
&gt;did, he might have to issue one to Nates wife as well for as Max defines it,
&gt;careless driving.  If she saw what was happening, which according to Nate,
&gt;she did and did nothing to attempt to avoid it, then she did not take
&gt;complete control of her vehicle and again, by the Max definition, could be
&gt;sited for careless driving.  Without any tickets issued, it is still clearly
&gt;the fault of the other driver but if tickets were issued and the ones being
&gt;summoned choose to fight them, a whole new world of hurt could begin for
&gt;both sides and since he did not witness the accident or the events leading
&gt;up to it, he played it safe.

oh for crying out loud.  i mean holy jumpin up and down martha.  just
how fucking far can you carry this.  between you, jerry and max this
has gone fucking whacky.

maybe we need instand replay for you.  we could do it in slow motion

&gt;&gt; Nope, never was worried about the last word Jerry. That was soemthing you

&gt;&gt; I guess I remember that post, barely..... it was from '99, so I figured
&gt;&gt; it was water over the dam. I never really tried to remember them all.
&gt;&gt; BTW, for you yanking my chain, you seem to have time to go on wild goose

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nothing has changed in your life in the last 6 years has it
&gt;&gt;&gt;maxipad.....You're still the same dumb jerk of a asshole as before,

&gt;&gt; You sure are obsessed by my life.... &quot;dumb jerk of an asshole&quot; wow, that
&gt;&gt; would be profound, only its not profound. Its just kinda silly.  And I've
&gt;&gt; been doing my own laundry for..... 30 years? I dunno, obviously you've
&gt;&gt; put more thought into my laundry than I have.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Very interesting going back and reading those old post and how you argued
&gt;&gt;&gt;with Roy, Sandman, Gary, Budd, and just about..... no with everyone in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the same manner as now and you used the same stupid moronic and childish
&gt;&gt;&gt;tactics in trying to have the last word.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, when I disagreed, I did argue. Hell, Budd and I have talked on the
&gt;&gt; phone, and even exchanged philosophical/theological ideas and discussion.
&gt;&gt; Gary's been a good source of info and assistance when I got stuck on
&gt;&gt; things I neversaw before. But the real thing is, I never tried to have
&gt;&gt; the last word. This time, I'm just doing it to prick you. You brought it
&gt;&gt; up, you whined about it, and you have claimed it as a prize, so I'm
&gt;&gt; making you work for it. So I'm an asshole in your opinion. Great, I'm an

&gt;&gt;&gt;Think you'll ever grow up maxipad. Oh, don't worry about JPH's post....
&gt;&gt;&gt;you must have missed the part where he said MOST states but then that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;your style......LOL.....yank,yank.yank.

&gt;&gt; I grew up. See, I post rebuttals, not grade school name calling. Yeah, I
&gt;&gt; know he said most states, but I bet if you look, you'll find all states
&gt;&gt; require that you yield right of way or stop at an intersection. Feel free
&gt;&gt; to prove me wrong.

&gt;&gt; Feel free to try for the last word again. You might get it this time, its
&gt;&gt; getting late. But there is always tomorrow.

I am not calling you a liar Nate but first it was a T-Bone at 35 MPH and now
I don't have a clue what it was.  You did mention a stop sign somewhere near
the accident but who had to stop there.  You also mentioned 35 MPH AND that
there was no hard right which indicated that it was more of a merge
situation with your wife obviously having the right of way.

With the above information and the fact that you did say that your wife was
wondering which vehicle he was going to hit, hers or the one in front of
her, it appeard from what YOU said, that she had more than a split second
which is the whole point, there are too many possible variables for the
officer to make assumptions on.  Now if this was a merge situation gone bad,
why didn't your wife see the truck coming or how even could the truck come
out of nowhere?

Sure it would have.  A violation is a violation and if he tickets for one,
he has to ticket for all of them.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you make it clear to him what you were doing?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think there's more than a few accidents caused by people
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; who simply know they have the right of way and ain't going
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to give it up to anyone.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Well Steve, you do bring up a good point.  The story here keeps changing

&gt; &gt;&gt;that
&gt; &gt;&gt;one of the reasons why the officer did not issue a summons is that if he
&gt; &gt;&gt;did, he might have to issue one to Nates wife as well for as Max defines
&gt; &gt;&gt;it,
&gt; &gt;&gt;careless driving.  If she saw what was happening, which according to
Nate,
&gt; &gt;&gt;she did and did nothing to attempt to avoid it, then she did not take
&gt; &gt;&gt;complete control of her vehicle and again, by the Max definition, could
be

Nate, I am glad your family and no one else was hurt in the accident and
hope you get your truck fixed soon.  Only point I was making with you
was I thought you were being a little more concerned about depreciation

LOL, The part where you stooped was where you attacked Nate for having
legitimate concerns, attacked TomL for eloquently stating his point,
attacked Tbone for whatever, depending on the day, attacked Budd for being
Budd, and then decided t call me names for no apparent reason.

All of it was below the normal conduct you practice in here. IOW Jerry,

you around a bit until you realized that you had in fact, gotten off the

Yeah, I guess it wouldn't surprise you to figure I'd spent several hours via
phone and internet helping TomL with trans difficulties, since you attacked
him too. Hell, for all the arguing you seem to think I did with Nate, I'd be
glad to chat with him and help out if he had a problem. Remember Lee? He
stopped here for several nights, even camped out in a local bar for a couple
of them, drinking and having a good time. Yeah, I'm such an asshole.

&gt;&gt; You really ought to get proof of this stuff Jerry.

&gt; Don't need it..... you just proved it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't really want to re-read those posts where you cried because you
&gt;&gt;&gt;couldn't have the last word or was fired from every job you attempted do
&gt;&gt;&gt;you.

&gt;&gt; I'd read em if they existed, but I doubt they exist.

&gt; But you just said they were not a major deal...... so they must
&gt; exist....make up your mind maxi.

&gt; &gt; your turn

&gt; Naw..... i had already decided today that I was through with you maxipad.
&gt; Exposing you for what your really are has some rewards I guess but it also
&gt; has the downside that I have to stoop to your level to do it.  Very
&gt; distasteful....... kind of like having to scoop the dog litter out in the
&gt; yard.  So come on back with your moronic last word that seems to be
&gt; driving you over the edge and then maybe you can get a good nights sleep.
&gt; I'm sure mommy will enjoy no more screams in the night.  I guess you
&gt; realize by now that all anyone just has to do a google search of news
&gt; groups with the name Max340 and all your old bullshit pissing matches pop
&gt; right up.  You can run but you can't hide maxipad.  Oh BTW, I did find it
&gt; very interesting the two names you chose to identify as very close friends
&gt; on this ng.  Very interesting indeed.  How is that saying.... Birds of a
&gt; feather......Good night Cliff....

&gt; Nate, I am glad your family and no one else was hurt in the accident and
&gt; hope you get your truck fixed soon.  Only point I was making with you was
&gt; I thought you were being a little more concerned about depreciation value
&gt; than need be.  I guess to each his own.  Sorry your thread turned into a
&gt; shitty pissing match but I'm sure you have seen it before.

Ok, fair enough.  Since I have no idea what the intersection looks like,
I'll keep my opinion and theory's to myself (hard to believe, huh :-)
Either way, I'm still glad that none of your family was hurt and I hope that
your wife's tests came out ok.  I am curious as to what the insurance
company is going to do about the depreciation issue so if you don't mind,
let us know what they did (in general).

As far as determining liability, the insurance reps actually do look at
that. If driver A was on the main road, and driver B was on a side
street and ran into driver A, driver B's agent will try to determine if
the driver A did everything they could to avoid the accident, even
though the driver B failed to yield the right of way. If driver A could
have swerved to avoid the accident, braked, beeped the horn, but didn't,
then the settlement might be reduced by a certain percentage in some
states. Actually no one "has" the right of way, the question is who is
required to "yield" the right of way.

Well, one good reason to stop before entering the traffic from a driveway,
alley or parking lot entrance gate  is

BECAUSE THE LAW SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STOP IN MOST STATES.

But check your state's current driver's licensing manual to be sure.

you go to jail.

No - he's saying that a driver that can't drive responsibly, they lose their
license.  The penalty for driving without a license would be jail time.  I
don't think he's advocating loss of license for a speeding ticket - rather a
pattern of infractions that indicates the operator can't be responsible.

It must not cost too much, or take too long, or Pennsylvania wouldn't be

That would be ridiculous, not because of cost or time, but because there is

They retest after a "point" accumulation, if you fail, or if you acquire
more points beyond the limit before a retest, they suspend the license.

Someone decides to get drunk, knowing full well he's got to drive home
afterward. On the way home he hits and kills someone.

What punishment for that, Roy?

&lt;LOL&gt; Tom, there are thousands of ads everyday giving the dangers of
operating a vehicle under the influence . . now just how many people
OVER 12 do you think have never seen or heard about those dangers?

Since the knowledge is well brodcast, ignorance is no excuse. If the
DUI / DWI knows he's going out to get drunk then he knows he could kill
someone by driving in that condition. If you know it's a crime and you
know you could kill and decide to get wiped out anyway, then as far as
I'm concerned, it's a concious decision and you have decided the value
of the life of another person (or persons) is of no importance. And
that says you though about it and decided to do it.

Now all this thought was done while sober and before the fact. . . . .

&gt;&gt;the eye test. like i said before. A JOKE!

&gt; Yep...  same here in NJ.  Heck, I'm sure glad they made sure I could
&gt; parallel park without dinging another vehicle's bumper or scuffing the curb,
&gt; before handing me a document that qualified me to operate a 26,000lb vehicle
&gt; in heavy traffic at 65MPH (well, 55MPH back then) at night.
">

The scariest part of my first driving test in PA was the three-point
turn. I didn't even know what it was and had never done it, but
successful completion of the three-point turn was to be the deciding
factor on whether or not I could take my car on the highway solo.
I passed!
The only other times I had to take a test was on my motorcycle in Omaha,
where the officer stood in the parking lot and watched me ride the bike
2 blocks away and return without falling off, and then the CDL in TX,
which was actually pretty thorough.

The state trooper made me do my three-point turn twice. He didn't like the
way I did it the first time. I was driving my mom's VW Rabbit during my
test. Those things can turn in a very tight circle, so I didn't bother
stoping and backing up. I just made a u-turn in the stall. He told me I had
to at least stop and back up a little bit.

Sorry to burst your bubble Tom, but a defense lawyer gets paid to lead the
jury away from solid conclusions. Thus he is a liberal. A Prosecutor is paid
to uphold the letter of the law, thus a Conservative.

What they do outside the courtroom/practice may be something entirely
different, thus why lawyers are so universally hated as being hypocrits or
two faced.

But the fact remains... a defense attorney looks to open the range of
possibility, a prosecutor seeks to nail one possibility, almost a perfect
definition of liberal and conservative.

Actually, it is. If you drive drunk, you break the law. Period. If you kill
knowing you're doing it , you break the law. If you refuse to pay your

&gt; &gt;&gt; How about making the punishments fit the crime? If you demonstrate you
&gt; &gt;&gt; can't
&gt; &gt;&gt; drive responsibly, then you don't get to drive legally. Drive
illegally,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; you go to jail.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And no plea bargans.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Drive illegally and you go to jail? Kinda steep for speeding don't ya
&gt; &gt;&gt;think?
&gt; &gt;&gt;Hate to be involved in a accident in your world, what would  the penalty
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;be?
&gt; &gt;&gt;Death, if more than 50% at fault?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Roy

&gt; &gt; What's wrong with punishments that fit the crime?

&gt; &gt; Someone decides to get drunk, knowing full well he's got to drive home
&gt; &gt; afterward. On the way home he hits and kills someone.

No. I will not water down my opinion to suit you.

jail?

Different scenario, not what I was talking about. If, and judging from the
statistics, not that often, he gets pulled over, kick him into the drunk
tank, then try his butt with no plea bargaining.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; What punishment for that, Roy?

&gt; &gt; I say it's a form of 1st degree murder with a random victim and the
&gt; &gt; state's punishment foir 1st degree murder should apply

&gt; 1st degree murder? WTF are you smoking out there?

What are you drinking you don't want to be caught with or blamed for killing
someone if you do it while driving?

No, it is not, Roy. You're spinning things as bad as anyone in this group.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;. . .and yes,
&gt; &gt; I've been a drunk in my past.

&gt; So you are advocating a set schedule of punishment? Drive oui ya get 5
&gt; years, involved in a accident 55% at fault, yer down for 1 year. You can't
&gt; be serious.
">

Just because I disagree with you, I can't be serious?

YOU can't be serious to think the current punishments fit the crimes.

How about drug dealers getting the punishments for attempted murder and 1st
degree murder if a customer OD's? How about child rapist/muderers? I say tie
a rope to his genitals 1300 feet long, tell him his crime, and shove him
over the rail of the Royal Gorge Bridge (1400 feet above the river).

No, Roy, I will not bend on my opinions of current punishments.

Like I said, it is all based on motivation both in and out of the court.
Some are motivated by the idea of giving someone another chance even if they
are nothing more than a lowlife scumbag (liberal) while others do it for the
big money and could care less about the actual guilt (conservative).

IOW, the liberal is open minded which indicates intelligence while the a
conservative is closed minded which tends to be an idiot.  At least that is

TBone, you misunderstood.  Max didn't try to say one was good and the
other bad or ones right and the other wrong.  The defense tries to
create multiple possibilities which in turn creates reasonable doubt in
the juries minds.  The prosecution tries to lead the jury towards just
one line of thought. Lawyers are liars from either side but they are
still as Max stated, liberal defense and conservative prosecution.

No Tom, thats what you desperately want to believe. Simply being open minded
doesn't indicate intelligence, as it can also indicate indecisiveness, or
stupidity. But I didn't say the liberal was open minded, I said he sought to
find a range of possibility, which could be seen as being deceptive and
misleading, a liar. Simply looking for one possibility doesn't indicate
idiocy, as it can indicate logical evaluation of facts, and a drive for the
truth.

But depends on which side you are on. Sadly, in your world, there are only
two sides, your side, where everyone agrees with your every word, and the
other side, where anyone else is. Interestingly, this is a closed minded
approach, meaning (in your definitions) you are what you hate so much, a
conservative.

&gt;&gt; &gt; LOL, sorry to burst your bubble Max but quite a few defense lawyers are
&gt;&gt; &gt; conservatives, like just about all of the high priced ones.  The only
&gt;&gt; &gt; difference between a liberal defense lawyer and a conservative one is
&gt;&gt; &gt; their
&gt;&gt; &gt; motivation.

&gt;&gt; Sorry to burst your bubble Tom, but a defense lawyer gets paid to lead
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; jury away from solid conclusions. Thus he is a liberal. A Prosecutor is
&gt; paid
&gt;&gt; to uphold the letter of the law, thus a Conservative.

&gt; Hahahahaha, you are kidding, right?!?!?!  If this was a purly moral world
&gt; full of completely honest people I might agree but if you believe that to
&gt; be
&gt; true...  Hell, a few months ago a man was released from prison after
&gt; serving
&gt; 7 years for a rape he didn't commit (cleared by DNA evidence) and it was
&gt; found that the prosecutor had such evidence that could have cleared him
&gt; and
&gt; suppressed it.  It looks like your prosecutor led the jury away from the
&gt; actual conclusion here so are you also saying in your typecast BS that
&gt; conservatives are also liars.

&gt;&gt; What they do outside the courtroom/practice may be something entirely
&gt;&gt; different, thus why lawyers are so universally hated as being hypocrits
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; two faced.

&gt; Like I said, it is all based on motivation both in and out of the court.
&gt; Some are motivated by the idea of giving someone another chance even if
&gt; they
&gt; are nothing more than a lowlife scumbag (liberal) while others do it for
&gt; the
&gt; big money and could care less about the actual guilt (conservative).

&gt;&gt; But the fact remains... a defense attorney looks to open the range of
&gt;&gt; possibility, a prosecutor seeks to nail one possibility, almost a perfect
&gt;&gt; definition of liberal and conservative.

&gt; IOW, the liberal is open minded which indicates intelligence while the a
&gt; conservative is closed minded which tends to be an idiot.  At least that
&gt; is
&gt; what you said above.

No, actually a car can be far deadlier than a gun but unlike the gun, that
is not what it was designed to do.

More irrelevant BS from you miles.  A car is an automobile and is defined as
a means of transportation.  A gun is a deadly weapon any way that you try
and spin it and its purpose is to hurt or kill, nothing more, nothing less.
A car CAN BE USED as a deadly weapon as can be just about anything if you
know how but is not defined as one.  Firing a gun into the air on public
streets is a crime in itself and doing it while drunk is yet another crime
on top of that so again, apples to rocks.

Budd...  I gotta ask you here...  what about someone who's talking on a
cellphone, and accidentally hits and kills someone?  1st degree murder
there, too?  I mean - we all know the dangers of using a cellphone while
driving.  Most states now prohibit it, and can fine a driver caught doing
so.  There are many studies that claim using a cellphone causes just as much
impairment to driving ability as a .08% BAC.  Do we execute these people?

How about the people who drive while exhausted?  Ever been driving and
fighting to stay awake?  We all know about the dangers of driving and
falling asleep... heck, in my state, it's even illegal to do so (don't ask
me how this is enforced - it's a relatively new experiment in
socialization).  So - work a double shift, doze off at the wheel, cause an
accident, somebody dies...  get thrown in the gas chamber?

How are the above scenarios different than driving with an elevated BAC?

You seem to be advocating a capital sentence (1st deg. murder) for pretty
much anyone who takes the life of another while in the act of something they
know is prohibited - regardless of intent.  Let's take another example -
straight from my local newspaper the other day:

A worker was doing some work in a company parking lot overnight.  He dug a
good-sized hole, about 5 feet deep.  He failed to mark it off.  An employee
arrived to work early the next morning, and while walking across the parking
lot, fell into the hole.  Now, she was injured - but for the sake of
argument, let's say she was killed.  The worker knew that a hole like that
was a danger to others, right?  Is he now guilty of 1st degree murder?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Ever been driving and fighting to stay awake?

&gt; Yep, and I even fell asleep at the wheel, but I didn't hit anyone and
&gt; it was also before my change in attitude about some vehicular laws.

So, with how you feel now, had you hit someone back then, you should have
been executed as a murderer?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Too damn many...  but that's a whole 'nother discussion  :)

I think that's part of the point...  you change the way one particular
scenario is treated - others have to follow.  You're making the argument
that a person who causes the death of another, while engaged in an activity
that is illegal, should be guilty of murder in the 1st degree.  If you're
saying that only drunk driving falls under this, well, that begs the
questions put forth here (ie.  why isn't doing &lt;xxx&gt; just as bad as DUI?)

I'm not one of them.  I find your views on this particular subject a little
extreme, perhaps - but that doesn't make you a nut.  I suspect there's
something more significant that's caused you to view this as you do, but if
you're not going to talk about it, I'm not going to ask.

The law was not meant to be enforceable as in stopping it from happening.

&gt; &gt; &gt; think that they can drive as well or better drunk, others that
&gt; &gt; accidentally
&gt; &gt; &gt; have 1 too many and don't really feel drunk and neither of these types
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;know&quot; that they could kill somebody because as far as they are
&gt; concerned,
&gt; &gt; &gt; they can drive just fine and then it is not a conscious choice that
they
&gt; &gt; &gt; devaluated human life.

&gt; &gt; Tom, I did not say, &quot;accidentally&quot;, I said, &quot;knowing they would be
getting
&gt; &gt; drunk&quot; . . .big difference. What I wrote was a statement of a
deliberate,
&gt; &gt; thought out act. Are trying out the part of a liberal defense lawyer
now?
&gt; &gt; Keep your spins out.

&gt; There is no spin here Budd.

&gt; Yes, you are ignoring what I say and substituting your words.

Really, where?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; How can you prove that the person knew that
&gt; they would get drunk.

&gt; I used to drink and I knew before I took each first drink I was going
&gt; to drink, either just before or many hours before. BTDT, Tom.

But you were a heavy drinker at the time (according to you) and a serious
drinker does know what they are going to do but an occasional social drinker
does not go out with the intention of getting ripped but sometimes it
happens.

&gt; &gt; Alcohol affects different people differently just

&gt; your
&gt; judgment, they both go to jail for life or are executed for the crime.

&gt; this really make much sense to you?

&gt; Yep, but your liberalism won't let it make sense to you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; They were wrong and stupid, but were not going out

&gt; &gt; Actually, anyone that drinks to the point of 0.08 BAC or more is
impaired,
&gt; &gt; the military (Navy) told my son that if he had more than 3 beers in a
week
&gt; &gt; he was to seek counseling. Does that give you an idea of how serious it
&gt; is?
&gt; &gt; Tom, do you drink?

&gt; My heavy drinking days are behind me now and I don't drive while
&gt; drinking
&gt; although in my younger days that was not always the case.

&gt; Same here except I no longer drink. No desire to and I'm on medications

I guess that would help remove the desire.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  A .08 BAC does
&gt; not effect everyone in a fully detrimental way as at one time it was .1

&gt; before they realized that there was a significant portion of the

&gt; Tom, you know less than you think about alcohol. One beer or one shot
&gt; is enough to make measurable differences in 99% of the human
&gt; population.

Sure it does but measurable does not always mean incapacitated or even
severly impared.  Some people can drink a few beers or have a few shots and
feel nothing at all.  They may in fact be impared but don't know it and in
this case, how can you say murder 1.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  Either way,
&gt; by trying to make this a murder 1 thing, you are discounting the

&gt; HUH??? If I'm trying to count a crime as a more severe crime, I'M
&gt; discounting the seriousness??? Spin and doublespeak from you, Tom.

Read more slowly Budd, you are discounting the crime of murder 1 by
attaching it to accidental deaths.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How many states have laws against cell phone usage while driving?
&gt;NY and NJ, for starters...
">

IOW, not enough states . . yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 1st degree murder there, too?
&gt; Why not if you know it's against the law to talk on the cell while
&gt; driving?
&gt;You seem to be advocating a capital sentence (1st deg. murder) for pretty
&gt;much anyone who takes the life of another while in the act of something they
&gt;know is prohibited - regardless of intent.  Let's take another example -
&gt;straight from my local newspaper the other day:
">

I'd rather not. . .

A worker was doing some work in a company parking lot overnight.  He
dug a
good-sized hole, about 5 feet deep.  He failed to mark it off.  An
employee
arrived to work early the next morning, and while walking across the
parking
lot, fell into the hole.  Now, she was injured - but for the sake of
argument, let's say she was killed.  The worker knew that a hole like
that
was a danger to others, right?  Is he now guilty of 1st degree murder?

No idea, as this is not thescenario I was talking about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Ever been driving and fighting to stay awake?
&gt; Yep, and I even fell asleep at the wheel, but I didn't hit anyone and
&gt; it was also before my change in attitude about some vehicular laws.
&gt;So, with how you feel now, had you hit someone back then, you should have
&gt;been executed as a murderer?
">

That happened back when I was a bleeding heart liberal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Me neither, but how many un-enforcible laws are there now?
&gt;Too damn many...  but that's a whole 'nother discussion  :)
">

Is it? With everyone asking my opinion on other situations, I was
thinking it was part and parcel of the discussion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So - work a double shift, doze off at the wheel, cause an
&gt;&gt;accident, somebody dies...  get thrown in the gas chamber?
&gt; &lt;LOL&gt; All you guys keep switching the conditions . . . .all I was
&gt; talking about was deliberately getting drunk and then driving. Can't
&gt; anyone stay on the subject besides me?
&gt;I think that's part of the point...  you change the way one particular
&gt;scenario is treated - others have to follow.
">

Why? I don't consider all crimes to be the same level of evil. To say I
do with the evidence given is pure conjecture at best, defamation at
worst.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You're making the argument
&gt;that a person who causes the death of another, while engaged in an activity
&gt;that is illegal, should be guilty of murder in the 1st degree.
">

No, I said anyone that deliberately gets drunk and kills someone should
be counted guilty, that includes murder by knife, gun, baseball bat,
wet noodle. . . .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you're
&gt;saying that only drunk driving falls under this, well, that begs the
&gt;questions put forth here (ie.  why isn't doing &lt;xxx&gt; just as bad as DUI?)
">

No, it doesn't, except in a liberal world.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;How are the above scenarios different than driving with an elevated BAC?
&gt; A lot, but no one sees it but me.

I'm trying to understand.  I'm not trying to bust your balls, Budd...

Sorry, Tom, but that's not how it's coming across.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm

just discussing it, with an admittedly different viewpoint than yours.
Heck - if we all have the same views about everything, it would be
pretty
boring  :)

Agreed, but when you start changing the original topic into something
unrelated, then you aren't discussing . . you're ball busting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm done discussing it. Many of you alreadty consider me to be over the
&gt; edge, so it's nothing new.
">

I'm not one of them.  I find your views on this particular subject a
little
extreme, perhaps - but that doesn't make you a nut.  I suspect there's
something more significant that's caused you to view this as you do,
but if
you're not going to talk about it, I'm not going to ask.

Tom, I will give the reason: too often a drunk gets away vehicular
homicide because of his intoxication "impairment". Too often drug
dealers get too light of sentences because they plea bargain out of
what they deserve. Too many times drive-by shooters are rationalized
out of a death sentence because of "psychological problems". The list
is endless and the criminals just go to prison and learn how to be
better criminals.

It's time to take a stand.

&gt; &gt;Budd...  I gotta ask you here...  what about someone who's talking on a
&gt; &gt;cellphone, and accidentally hits and kills someone?

&gt; How many states have laws against cell phone usage while driving?

GA for one. the only way to use a cell in a moving vehicle (for the driver)
is to use a hands free device (i dont see much improvment here but that's
their rule) or speaker phone.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; 1st degree murder
&gt; there, too?

&gt; Why not if you know it's against the law to talk on the cell while
&gt; driving? I and my brother both pull over to answer the cellphone
&gt; because we neither want to take the risk.

&gt; &gt; I mean - we all know the dangers of using a cellphone while
&gt; &gt;driving.  Most states now prohibit it, and can fine a driver caught doing
&gt; &gt;so.  There are many studies that claim using a cellphone causes just as
much
&gt; &gt;impairment to driving ability as a .08% BAC.  Do we execute these people?

&gt; Do we????? Just the other day while riding with my brother, a cell user
&gt; pulled out in front of us, blowing a stop sign, yelling at someone on
&gt; the phone. Now look how much this topic has been in the media and tell
&gt; me they had no chance to have ever heard the warnings. . . .

&gt; &gt; How about the people who drive while exhausted?

&gt; Have you ever looked at the laws directed at semi-truck drivers caught
&gt; driving while exhausted?  I had a CDL for a while and CO was strict . .
&gt; .on paper. However, the law was often un-enforcible.

&gt; &gt; Ever been driving and
&gt; &gt;fighting to stay awake?

&gt; Yep, and I even fell asleep at the wheel, but I didn't hit anyone and
&gt; it was also before my change in attitude about some vehicular laws.

&gt; &gt;We all know about the dangers of driving and
&gt; &gt;falling asleep... heck, in my state, it's even illegal to do so (don't
ask
&gt; &gt;me how this is enforced - it's a relatively new experiment in
&gt; &gt;socialization).

&gt; Me neither, but how many un-enforcible laws are there now?

&gt; &gt; So - work a double shift, doze off at the wheel, cause an

Almost all states do indirectly.  Most states have a law against driving
under any impairment or distraction which would include but not be
limited to cell phone usage.  Unfortunatly its not enforced often.

I can't really disagree with that.  I'm just not sure I'm ready to start
executing people for unintentional consequences.  Punish?  Absolutely.
Kill?

Well, we'll disagree on that.  Otherwise, we're going to keep going around

Most of them are not meant to be enforced that way but are then used to
increase punishments or to even allow for punishments for some actions just
like the sleeping behind the wheel law in NJ.
