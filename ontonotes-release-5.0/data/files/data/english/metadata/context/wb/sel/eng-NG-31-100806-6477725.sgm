The only thing the Republicans and Democrats in Washington
can agree on is their pay raises.

Try to avoid people who are really nice to you.
Sooner or later, you know
they are going to ask you for a favor.

Medicine is sky high. Â I got one prescription that says,
"Take one capsule as often as you can afford it."

It's true you can't take it with you, but then,
that's not where it comes in handy.

Oneliners

Freedom means choosing your burden.

The best way to argue with another is to say nothing.

Streakers beware: Your end is in sight!

A husband: is one who expects his wife to be perfect and to understand
why he isn't.

Suggested Wisconsin motto: "Come to Wisconsin and smell our dairy
air."

To a worm, digging in the hard ground is more relaxing than going
fishing.

It's simple. What the government does is legal. What you do isn't.

The height of embarassment is when two eyes meet at the same keyhole.

It's not whether you win or lose; it's how you place the blame

Don't be afraid of opposition. A kite rises against, not with, the
wind.

Nothing cures insomnia like the realization that it's time to get up.

It's too bad for the middle income person. They earn
too much to avoid paying taxes
and make too little to afford paying them.

In eighteenth century English gambling dens,
there was an employee whose only job
was to swallow the dice if there was a police raid.

BEING CREATIVE WITH TROUBLESOME KIN

You are working on your family genealogy and for sake of example,
let's say that your great-great uncle, Remus Starr, a fellow lacking
in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in
Montana in 1889.

A cousin has supplied you with the only known photograph of Remus,
showing him standing on the gallows. On the back of the picture are the
words:

"Remus Starr: Horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison, 1885.
Escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by
Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged, 1889."

Pretty grim situation, right? But let's revise things a bit. We
simply crop the picture, scan in an enlarged image and edit it with
image processing software so that all that is seen is a head shot.

Next, we rewrite the text:

"Remus Starr was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory. His
business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian
assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad.

Beginning in 1885, he devoted several years of his life to service
at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume his
dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital
investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In
1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in
his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed."

Does anybody else find it ironic that many couples split up
because they haven't spent enough time together?

A politician is the one who shakes your hand before elections
and your confidence after.

If you want to know what G-d thinks of money,
just look at the people he gave it to.

Housework serves no purpose. It isn't what you do in a house that
shows, it's what you don't do that everyone notices.

Issue of the Times;
Stranger Than Satire: Past Year 'Predicts' New One by Radley Balko

It is something of a clichd tradition for a columnist to write a year-end
or New Year column that makes exaggerated, sometimes humorous predictions
for the next 12 months.

I wrote such a column at about this time last year, with "predictions"
that
reflected the continuing, creeping influence of government in our lives.
Unfortunately, the state of civil liberties and both economic and personal
freedom haven't improved much over the past year. So I figure it's time
for
another round of unlikely predictions as to what we might expect from our
government in 2007.

--In yet another case of government bureaucracy gone mad, some local
health
agency will insist that the churches and private homes where volunteers
prepare food for homeless people pass rigorous, restaurant-standard health
inspections or shut down operations.

The silly policy will be justified in the name of protecting the homeless
when, in reality, it will really only lead to fewer homeless people
getting
fed.

--In a scenario straight out of George Orwell's "1984," several local
governments will begin to encourage children to turn in their parents when
the parents fail to abide by building and property code violations, such
as
mowing the grass, properly sorting recyclables, and similar mundanities.

--In an aptly striking display of the drug war's misplaced priorities,
federal narcotics police will sit idly by while a government informant
takes
part in several drug-related murders. The reason for their inaction? It
was
more important to get information from the informant on drug dealing than
preventing the killings.

--In other drug war news, when asked to explain how today's drug
prohibition
differs from the nation's failed attempt at alcohol prohibition in the
1920s, the nation's top drug cop will actually make the argument that
alcohol prohibition was a success.

--A radio host in the nation's capital will play a hoax on his listeners,
jokingly suggesting that all Muslims in America be identified with an
armband or a tattoo. He will then express shock when a solid majority of
callers to his show will express their agreement with the proposition.

--In Britain, where the Nanny State is even more aggressive than it is
here
in the U.S, a government health agency will insist that the company that
makes the whimsically-named "Dragon Sausage" change the product's name, or
pull it from the market.

The reason? Customers might be fooled into thinking the product contains
actual dragon meat.

--Now that the federal government has made online gambling a crime, some
state government will take things even further, and make writing about
online gambling a crime.

--Some state that spends millions of dollars promoting its lottery will
protect its monopoly on gambling by executing a man for the crime of
wagering with his friends on football games.

--Having run out of things to tax, some state legislator will attempt to
pass a law stating that any money left over on retail "gift cards" be
forfeited to the state government.

--Taking the overuse of SWAT teams to new, un-parody-able levels, a
federal
SWAT team will raid a group of Tibetan monks touring the United States on
a
world peace mission.

--Some silly conservative will write a book blaming rap music and South
Park
for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

--A major U.S. magazine will riff on the obesity hysteria, and run a hoax
article about the possibility of taxing fat people for their extra weight.
The magazine will then get a significant amount of mail from people who
support the idea.

--In a strategy pulled straight from the movie "Minority Report," police
in
some towns will start "pre-arresting" people for drunken driving.

--Not content with mere gun control, some local governments will begin to
ban swords, too.

--After successfully pushing questionable science on the effects of
secondhand smoke for decades, the public health movement will move on to
their next hysteria: Secondhand drinking.

--Not content with micromanaging parents when it comes to bicycle helmets,
car seats and any number of laws and regulations, some state legislator
will
get the idea that we should make kids who play soccer wear helmets.

--In the never-ending race to see which state can be toughest on sex
offenders, one state will propose a public registry of people merely
accused
of sex crimes. They needn't be actually convicted, or even charged.

--In Great Britain, a country whose system of socialized medicine is
commonly cited as something the U.S. should strive for, hospitals that
defy
the system and actually treat patients with some degree of haste and
efficacy will be fined by the government for "overperforming."

--Two "public health" professionals will argue that what developing
countries really need - places where people are starving and women still
routinely die in childbirth - are policies like motorcycle helmet and
seatbelt laws.

As you might have guessed if you clicked on the links, or if you read last
year's column, all of the above are not really predictions for 2007, but
actual events that took place in 2006.

Truth, once again, is stranger (or more depressing, depending on your
perspective) than fiction.

What will 2007 bring? My guess is that by December, I'll have another
column
of government excesses too strange to be satirized.

Quote of the Times;
I keep wondering why everybody goes on calling them "detainees." Being
"detained" is something you experience for a few minutes, maybe hours at
most. Not five long years of isolation, waterboarding, force-feeding and
even more unthinkable totalitarian abuse. These people are prisoners of
war,
albeit an illegal one. They're POWs even if the vast majority of them were
never soldiers, and even if the Busheviks deny them both the protections
of
the Geneva convention and the Bill of Rights.
