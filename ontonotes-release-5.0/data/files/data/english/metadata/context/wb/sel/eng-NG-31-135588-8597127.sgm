Another funny idea for a comic: if the alien princess kisses the frog, the
frog will be transformed to an alien prince and they lived happily ever

Concerning frogs, I find this fable relevant:

Aesop: The Frog and the Ox

&quot;Oh Father,&quot; said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of
a pool, &quot;I have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a
mountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofs
divided in two.&quot;

&quot;Tush, child, tush,&quot; said the old Frog, &quot;that was only Farmer White's
Ox. It isn't so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, but
I could easily make myself quite as broad; just you see.&quot; So he blew
himself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out. &quot;Was he as
big as that?&quot; asked he.

&quot;Oh, much bigger than that,&quot; said the young Frog.

Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Ox
was as big as that.

&quot;Bigger, father, bigger,&quot; was the reply.

So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and
swelled and swelled and swelled. And then he said: &quot;I'm sure the Ox is
not as big as ...&quot; But at this moment he burst.

Self-conceit may lead to self-destruction.

Two guys were in a car stopped at a red light. The light finally

After a moment, the driver responded, &quot;A frog?&quot;

A computer programmer happens across a frog in the road. The frog
pipes up, &quot;I'm really a beautiful princess and if you kiss me, I'll
hang out with you for a week&quot;. The programmer shrugs his shoulders and
puts the frog in his pocket.
A few minutes later, the frog says &quot;OK, OK, if you kiss me, I'll be
your girlfriend for a week&quot;. The programmer nods and puts the frog
back in his pocket.

A few minutes later, &quot;Turn me back into a princess and I'll be your
girlfriend for a whole year!&quot;. The programmer smiles and walks on.

Finally, the frog says, &quot;What's wrong with you? I've promised lots of
fun with a beautiful princess for a whole year and you won't even kiss
a frog?&quot;

&quot;I'm a programmer,&quot; he replies. &quot;I don't have time for girls.... But a
talking frog is pretty neat.&quot;

The Frog and the Princess
Once upon a time, a beautiful, independent, self assured princess
happened upon a frog in a pond.
The frog said to the princess, &quot;I was once a handsome prince until an
evil witch put a spell on me. One kiss from you and I will turn back
into a prince and then we can marry, move into the castle with my mom
and you can prepare my meals, clean my clothes, bear my children and
forever feel happy doing so.&quot;

That night, while the princess dined on frog legs, she kept laughing
and saying, &quot;I don't think so.&quot;
;;;
Two frogs sat on Robinson Crusoe's back.
One said to the other,&quot;I have to go now.

A scientist was interested in studying how far bullfrogs can jump. He
brought a bullfrog into his laboratory, set it down, and commanded,
&quot;Jump, frog, jump!&quot;
The frog jumped across the room.
The scientist measured the distance, then noted in his journal, &quot;Frog
with four legs - jumped eight feet.&quot;
Then he cut the frog's front legs off. Again he ordered, &quot;Jump, frog,
jump!&quot;
The frog struggled a moment, then jumped a few feet.
After measuring the distance, the scientist noted in his journal,
&quot;Frog with two legs - jumped three feet.&quot;
Next, the scientist cut off the frog's back legs. Once more, he
shouted, &quot;Jump, frog, jump!&quot;
The frog just lay there.
&quot;Jump, frog, jump!&quot; the scientist repeated.
Nothing.
The scientist noted in his journal, &quot;Frog with no legs - lost its
hearing.&quot;

Two frogs were crossing the street:
First frog: &quot;Hey, Look out!!! CAR!&quot; ***squash!!***

One frog says to another:

And the other answers:
-No!!! Why are you always asking me that?
The first frog says:
-You always look so green!!...

FELIX THE FLYING FROG: A PARABLE ABOUT SCHEDULES, CYCLE TIMES, AND
SHAPING NEW BEHAVIORS.
Once upon a time, there lived a man named Clarence who had a pet frog
named Felix. Clarence lived a modestly comfortable existence on what
he earned working at the Wal-Mart, but he always dreamed of being
rich.

&quot;Felix!&quot; he exclaimed one day, &quot;We're going to be rich! I'm going to
teach you how to fly!&quot;

Felix, of course, was terrified at the prospect: &quot;I can't fly, you
idiot......
I'm a frog, not a canary!&quot;

Clarence, disappointed at the initial reaction, told Felix: &quot;That
negative attitude of yours could be a real problem. I'm sending you to
class.&quot;

So Felix went to a three day class and learned about problem solving,
time management, and effective communication.... but nothing about
flying.

On the first day of &quot;flying lessons&quot;, Clarence could barely control
his excitement (and Felix could barely control his bladder). Clarence
explained that their apartment had 15 floors, and each day Felix would
jump out of a window starting with the first floor eventually getting
to the top floor.

After each jump, Felix would analyze how well he flew, isolate on the
most effective flying techniques, and implement the improved process
for the next flight. By the time they reached the top floor, Felix
would surely be able to fly.

Felix pleaded for his life, but it fell on deaf ears. &quot;He just doesn't
understand how important this is...&quot; thought Clarence, &quot;but I won't
let nay-sayers get in my way.&quot;

So, with that, Clarence opened the window and threw Felix out (who
landed with a thud).

Next day (poised for his second flying lesson) Felix again begged not
to be thrown out of the window. With that, Clarence opened his pocket
guide to Managing More Effectively and showed Felix the part about how
one must always expect resistance when implementing new programs.

And with that, he threw Felix out the window.(THUD)

On the third day (at the third floor) Felix tried a different ploy:
stalling, he asked for a delay in the &quot;project&quot; until better weather
would make flying conditions more favorable.

But Clarence was ready for him: he produced a timeline and pointed to
the third milestone and asked, &quot;You don't want to slip the schedule do
you?&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From his training, Felix knew that not jumping today would mean that
">

he would have to jump TWICE tomorrow.... so he just said: &quot;OK. Let's
go.&quot; And out the window he went.

Now this is not to say that Felix wasn't trying his best. On the fifth
day he flapped his feet madly in a vain attempt to fly. On the sixth
day he tied a small red cape around his neck and tried to think
&quot;Superman&quot; thoughts.

But try as he might, he couldn't fly.

By the seventh day, Felix (accepting his fate) no longer begged for
mercy.... he simply looked at Clarence and said: &quot;You know you're
killing me, don't you?&quot;

Clarence pointed out that Felix's performance so far had been less
than exemplary, failing to meet any of the milestone goals he had set
for him.

With that, Felix said quietly: &quot;Shut up and open the window,&quot; and he
leaped out, taking careful aim on the large jagged rock by the corner
of the building.

And Felix went to that great lily pad in the sky.

Clarence was extremely upset, as his project had failed to meet a
single goal that he set out to accomplish. Felix had not only failed
to fly, he didn't even learn how to steer his flight as he fell like a
sack of cement.... nor did he improve his productivity when Clarence
had told him to &quot;Fall smarter, not harder.&quot;

The only thing left for Clarence to do was to analyze the process and
try to determine where it had gone wrong.

After much thought, Clarence smiled and said:

&quot;Next time...... I'm getting a smarter frog!&quot;
