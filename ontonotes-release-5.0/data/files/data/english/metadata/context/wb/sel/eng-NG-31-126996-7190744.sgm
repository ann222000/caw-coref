Is there anything in the works to either a) allow for the creation of
sub-categories of starred items, or b) just carry over the folders/
categories that each post is already in?

I ask this because I have a ton of starred items, and having them in
one huge list is hard to deal with. A way to sort & compartmentalize
them would be fantastic.
Thanks.
