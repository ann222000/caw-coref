I think this is the link you meant, and it's a hoax.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFx62_Iadjg&amp;NR

Windows '98 "blue screened" during its public announcement, but I
don't think Vista did.

Anyway, *my* Vista computer is running along just fine now.  I haven't
had a blue screen on this one.

In fact, I'm growing rather fond of it.

I have a $aturn and a Toyota truck. I paid about $3000 each for them, to
private parties, who may have sent their $$$ to Detroit. I would rather pay
a few more $$ to a local mechanic who works hard to keep my vehicles
running. If I were to purchase a new vehicle from the manufacturer, it
would need to be one that was well designed, with state of the art fuel
efficiency, rather than an overpowered, bloated chunk of steel with lots of
glam and glitter but designed to fall apart and need replacement after a
dozen years or so.

I do not mind paying Micro$oft a reasonable fee for reliable software that
is efficient and bug-free. I do mind paying for a bloated OS that will
probably require upgrading or replacing my present computer, just so they
can tightly control the content of DVDs, games, and other multimedia crap

A computer is an entertainment center.  An entertainment
center is a computer.  My Tivo runs Linux, G-d only knows
what's in my iPod, and so on.  But even if my DVD player
runs a proprietary, purpose-built operating system, it's
still running software, it's still got one or more
processors, it's still got memory, and it's still doing
computation.

How does it feel to be staring extinction square in the

I like old cars and trucks, too.  Especially those really powerful,

There is no such thing as bug-free software, Paul.

And Microsoft software has always worked well for *me.*  And certainly
as well as any Apple product I've ever owned.

As far as it being "efficient" is concerned?  If I can use it day in
and day out, relatively problem free, I consider it to be efficient
enough.

I couldn't care less how "bloated" it is, as long as it meets my
needs.

The MS OS costs folks maybe a couple hundred bucks.  Is that too much
to pay for a product that the average person will get 4-6 years (maybe
more) of use from?  Out of all the things I own, I can't think of many
things that give me more bang (and enjoyment) for the buck than my MS
products.

The above means squat to me.

Because I'm able to run anything that *I* need to run.

The marketplace (and the law) will eventually decide whether Microsoft
can control the content of DVDs, etc.

Not me.  Not you.

Microsoft isn't the bad guy.  They provide a decent product for a
decent price.  And most people have a choice.  They can buy MS, or
they can buy Apple, Linux, etc. No one is forcing them to buy MS.

And MS is currently being hotly pursued by companies like Google,
Yahoo, Apple, the phone, cable and satellite companies, etc.

It's anyone's guess at this point who will eventually prevail.

The marketplace will decide that.

You sound a lot like the folks who pillory Wal-Mart.

&lt;sigh&gt;

It just doesn't make any sense to me.

All of these things can be done very efficiently on a simple computer. I
don't need flashy multimedia ads and web page decorations that waste
bandwidth and use all sorts of resources. Of course, the purveyors of
hardware and software want you to become accustomed to the flash and
glitter to keep selling more of their products. Similarly, the energy
companies want you to buy gas guzzlers and drive them aggressively to
compensate for your feelings of frustration or inadequacy.

Usenet is still largely based on plain text, which is efficient and totally
sufficient for its purpose of promoting free communications. Many people
embellish their emails and websites with fancy stationary, colorful fonts,
cute graphics, audio, video, and other frills, yet their words have little
original content.

I write computer software and design and build electronic equipment, so I
know about computers and the array of digital tools and toys that have
become necessary to our way of life. I admire the computer that allows my
Saturn to get 35-45 MPG. I designed a computer into a flashlight to provide
functionality. Yet I also enjoy a simple lifestyle, cutting firewood, and
enjoying nature.

I take seriously my obligation to conserve limited resources and live in a
responsible way that will not degrade our environment and leave a legacy of
hardship for future generations. Conspicuous consumption is selfish and
wasteful. Our gluttony for excessive energy use is financing the terrorist
war against our way of life, and much of the world remains impoverished
while we ride out our wave of excess as it inevitably begins to crest and
crash down on us.

You probably are too self-absorbed to notice that my original comment was
meant to be humorous. Lighten up, Jack!

&gt;while we ride out our wave of excess as it inevitably begins to crest and

People (i.e., fruitcakes) have been saying that since man invented the

If that's an example of your "humor," it's no wonder that you live
alone, hermit-like.

You're a very scary-sounding fruitcake, Paul.

And it's time that you admitted it.

Perhaps it's time for you to seek another kind of professional help?

Hey, Paul - those ads underwrite the costs of the services
you consume.  They pay for content so you don't have to.
Many of those content-providing sites have an ad-free
option, but you've got to pay for it.  Apparently you'd
rather get the free version and put up with the ads, which
is precisely what advertisers and content providers are
betting.

&gt;Usenet is still largely based on plain text, which is efficient and totally

None of it is "free."  All of it costs bandwidth, disk
space, and administrator time.

I think you've done a fine job of demonstrating your
understanding of economics in your discussion of how you
feed your dog.  This is all consistent with that.

NICE JOB MAKING YOURSELF THE CENTER OF ATTENTION AGAIN.
Freak.
