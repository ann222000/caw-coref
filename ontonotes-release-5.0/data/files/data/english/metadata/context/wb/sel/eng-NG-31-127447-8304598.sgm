A few weeks ago, Jonathon Barbera was making a lot of &quot;bullbait&quot; type posts.
He was diatribing about world bankers.  I was willing to listen to this
stuff, because I've seen enough documentation on it to make my
short-and-curlies stand up, but I drew the line when he thought we should
SUPPORT BUSH'S WAR EFFORT.  That made me turn him off.  But it didn't stop
me from investigating a bit more of what he was on about.

The quotes below are all taken from slides in www.zeitgeistmovie.com , which
is hardly an unbiased report!  But they are pretty fucking spooky to me.  I
don't know where to discuss these issues with people who are as diverse and
bright as those on this board.  If none of your are interested, then I'll
kill the topic.  If you are interested, but you have another place you think
that the conversation belongs, I'd be happy to take it there.

Hubbard was on about this stuff, back in the early 60's.  He may have been
crazy as a bedbug, and he might have been operating on some really nutty
ideas (that these bankers work for an off-world intelligence controlled by
&quot;Xenu&quot;), and I don't believe that the Scientology religion posed any threat
to this sort of an interest group!

Then again, how did the Church get the IRS to comply with their insistence
on charitable religious status?  Were they threatening to simply not pay
taxes, and to encourage class action amongst scientologists to not pay
income tax?  How did they compel this arm of the Executive Branch to
compliance?  Was it strictly blackmail on the chief executives of the IRS,
or do you think there might have been something significantly deeper?

Have I gone bonkers?  (DON'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION).

&quot;I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous than standing
armies... if the American people ever allow private banks to control the
issue of currency... the banks and corporations that will grow up around
them will deprive the people of their property until their children wake up
homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.&quot;  -  Thomas Jefferson

own slavery, let them continue to create money and control the nation's
credit&quot; - Sir Josiah Stamp

&quot;[our] great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.  Our
system of credit is privately concentrated.  The growth of the nation,
therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men... who
necessarily, by very reason of their own limitations, chill and check and
destroy genuine economic freedom.  We have come to be one of the worst
ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in
the civilized world - no government by free opinion, no longer a government
by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion
and the duress of small groups of dominant men.&quot;  - Woodrow Wilson

&quot;A world banking system was being set up here... a superstate controlled by
international bankers... acting together to enslave the world for their own
pleasure.  The Fed has usurped the government.&quot;  -  Louis McFadden

present panic is the first scientifically created one, worked out as we

bring about a condition of despair, so that they might emerge the rulers of
us all.&quot;  - Louis McFadden.

Dear Kevin,

This is a very complicated subject ... but LRH had noticed how it fits to
our society.

These are my references:-

http://www.illuminati-news.com/2007-08.htm when you look into the August
2007 or July 2007, there are many articles about the &quot;The new World
Order&quot;, &quot;World banking&quot;, &quot;World religion&quot;, &quot;World Government&quot;, Masons,
Illuminati, Zionism and the differences from Judism without Zionism,

I spent weeks of thinking before I could define &quot;World Religion&quot; - my
interpretation is simply atheism - if with war mongering, one murders
every apponent, destroy their families, then nobody believes any more in
religion, there could be atheism. But this agument doesn't hold true when
you look at how old some religions are, (This dispite everything that has
survived from the Bush family and dictators that have been.)

http://www.informantnews.com/book/index.html The Elohim Project compares
the Bible that one learns from a church, to scientific arguments, ---
there are three books, they are very long but all the references to the
canonised (official) bible are there -

LRH's OT3 story about the origin of the spirit of man seems a little tame,
like the little people that live at the bottom of the garden.

Why did so many of the people from the old testament live to be 700 -900
years old?
Why did Jesus always think, or meditate on the top of a mountain, and once
took two of his disciples with him in the top of the mountain?
Was Jehova the name of the father from Jesus, God, or a the name of the
mother spaceship?
How does genetic engineering fit into this time and the bible?
When the Israelites returned through a opened up Nile to their homeland,
from Egypt, where did the giants come from and how did the Israelites
fight them?
Why are there so many different races here on the earth?

I don't pass this information onto COS$ scientologists, with their
weakened understanding of LRH Scientology ---- they wouldn't understand!
no imagination, or only fixed ideas from making money and driving
everybody into a state od atheism.

Kevin,

Some of these quotes seem to be taken out of context and applied to
support a conspiracy hypothesis.  There's a whole lot of speculatin'
goin' on.

My humble opinion is that this plays like Robert Anton Wilson's
Illuminatus trilogy. The whole point is to demonstrate that you can
choose *anything* and make it appear significant in a grand
conspiracy, because you are trying to notice it. It's kind of like the
whole quantum thing about when you observe something, the act of your
observation changes its behavior.

There's a whole lot of speculation about the IRS 1993 decision for
Scn, Inc's charitable &lt;cough&gt; status, too.  Some suggest that there
were dirty tricks against individuals in IRS offices.  I know they
sued annually for about 40 years, and that was just from Clearwater.
Imagine all the resources tied up just to disagree with Scn Inc - much
less to enforce the laws they were breaking.  Perhaps it became
&quot;easier&quot; to change the law than to change Scn, inc's corporate
behavior.
After all, it was soooo important to Scn Inc, to rationalize itself,
while to the IRS it was just a bunch of lawsuits that finally went
away.

Still, as in the case with Miss Bloodybutt and Gabe Cazares and
Paulette Cooper and so many others, precedent is set that where there
is calculated wierdness, there's Scientology.  I remember being here
when Miss Bloodybutt went down and only being able to think how wierd
is this.  It wasn't until many years later, when someone who was
inside at the time blew, that the whole story came out.

Eventually you notice a link between a kind of translucency of events
and an attempt to mask or misdirect, where there is no reason to not
have total transparency -- other than to mask or misdirect.  It's
about all that is consistent with Scn, Inc - from tax evasion to ad
hominem attacks on critics to Lisa McPherson to the heirarchic way
that &lt;cough&gt; eccelsiastic information is presented with disregard to
informed consent.

Also, I think a lot of people want to believe in stuff like
conspiracies because it's easier than taking responsibility.  If there
are evil bankers conspiring to control everything, then hey, that
makes my overdraft last month not so much my fault.  Plus, and this is
key, it's easier to pretend to know stuff that nobody really can know.

It has been shown that folks who adhere to theories about ancient
spaceships may do so without even realizing it's predicated on racist
disbelief that brown people could be intelligent enough to develop
civilizations without help from outer space.

hth,
-maggie, human being

It doesn't seem tame to me, it just sounds like it's not my item.  It sounds
like a wrong explanation for the concentration of power and money.  The
concentration that he saw I think does exist, I just don't believe it has
anything to do with aliens or immortal spiritual games of conquest.

Ockham.  That's way too complicated, and there are much simpler
explanations.  The explanations, actually, end up being a game that
distracts from solutions.  The solution, IMO, is for secrecy to be
abolished, confidentiality to be abolished, representative democracy to be
amended such that each individual votes FOR THEMSELVES on an issue, rather
than deputizing someone to vote for them in blocks, which allows them to do
things you wouldn't do.  E-voting, but taken to an extreme, where you vote
directly on bills, can write bills yourself, and have them ranked by
people's interest (like the google system of weighting pages: pagerank),
rather than letting other people propose bills that you never get to see,
and you vote for representatives who lie to you about their agenda, etc.
Transparency, accountability, responsibility.

Well, you're barking up the wrong tree if you are expecting me to be in
agreement with religious thinking.

Religion poisons everything.

www.zeitgeistmovie.com

I appreciate your willingness to communicate your ideas, and your sources,
and I'm sorry if my tone seems mocking, but we are coming from very
different &quot;realities&quot;.  I'm a secular humanist.  Spirituality is loaded,
religion is for social control, and you can't split the difference between
them, because they're both archaic attempts to understand something that
requires an instrument of much greater power than either:  scientific
method, accompanied by critical analysis.

Religion is hereby cancelled.

Not at all. Scientology by its nature is closer to rabbit holes than most
such groups, and it's easy to fall into one whilst following a scientology
story as you have done.

A rabbit hole:

&gt; &gt; &quot;[our] great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.  Our
&gt; &gt; system of credit is privately concentrated.  The growth of the nation,
&gt; &gt; therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men... who
&gt; &gt; necessarily, by very reason of their own limitations, chill and check and
&gt; &gt; destroy genuine economic freedom.  We have come to be one of the worst
&gt; &gt; ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in
&gt; &gt; the civilized world - no government by free opinion, no longer a government
&gt; &gt; by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion
&gt; &gt; and the duress of small groups of dominant men.&quot;  - Woodrow Wilson

&gt; &gt; sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment.&quot;  - U.S. District
&gt; &gt; Court Judge, James C. Fox, 2003

&gt; Kevin,

&gt; Some of these quotes seem to be taken out of context and applied to
&gt; support a conspiracy hypothesis.  There's a whole lot of speculatin'
&gt; goin' on.

&gt; My humble opinion is that this plays like Robert Anton Wilson's
&gt; Illuminatus trilogy. The whole point is to demonstrate that you can
&gt; choose *anything* and make it appear significant in a grand
&gt; conspiracy, because you are trying to notice it. It's kind of like the
&gt; whole quantum thing about when you observe something, the act of your
&gt; observation changes its behavior.

&gt; There's a whole lot of speculation about the IRS 1993 decision for
&gt; Scn, Inc's charitable &lt;cough&gt; status, too.  Some suggest that there
&gt; were dirty tricks against individuals in IRS offices.  I know they
&gt; sued annually for about 40 years, and that was just from Clearwater.
&gt; Imagine all the resources tied up just to disagree with Scn Inc - much
&gt; less to enforce the laws they were breaking.  Perhaps it became
&gt; &quot;easier&quot; to change the law than to change Scn, inc's corporate
&gt; behavior.
&gt; After all, it was soooo important to Scn Inc, to rationalize itself,
&gt; while to the IRS it was just a bunch of lawsuits that finally went
&gt; away.

&gt; Still, as in the case with Miss Bloodybutt and Gabe Cazares and
&gt; Paulette Cooper and so many others, precedent is set that where there
&gt; is calculated wierdness, there's Scientology.  I remember being here
&gt; when Miss Bloodybutt went down and only being able to think how wierd
&gt; is this.  It wasn't until many years later, when someone who was
&gt; inside at the time blew, that the whole story came out.

&gt; Eventually you notice a link between a kind of translucency of events
&gt; and an attempt to mask or misdirect, where there is no reason to not
&gt; have total transparency -- other than to mask or misdirect.  It's
&gt; about all that is consistent with Scn, Inc - from tax evasion to ad
&gt; hominem attacks on critics to Lisa McPherson to the heirarchic way
&gt; that &lt;cough&gt; eccelsiastic information is presented with disregard to
&gt; informed consent.

&gt; Also, I think a lot of people want to believe in stuff like
&gt; conspiracies because it's easier than taking responsibility.  If there
&gt; are evil bankers conspiring to control everything, then hey, that
&gt; makes my overdraft last month not so much my fault.  Plus, and this is
&gt; key, it's easier to pretend to know stuff that nobody really can know.

&gt; It has been shown that folks who adhere to theories about ancient
&gt; spaceships may do so without even realizing it's predicated on racist
&gt; disbelief that brown people could be intelligent enough to develop
&gt; civilizations without help from outer space.

I believe you have hit several nails squarely on the head.  In
particular about ancient people.  As an engineer I have an interest in
ancient technology and the facts totally reject the idea that there
was any need for outside assistance. When an engineer says,&quot;we don't
know how they built the pyramids&quot;, they mean they don't know which of
several possible methods were used, not that there is some mystery
about how it was possible.
There is a very good book on the subject called &quot;The Ancient
Engineers&quot; by a mentor of mine, Mr. L. Sprague De Camp.  Mr. De Camp
also co-authored some science fiction with, (what was that fellas

&gt;&gt;&gt; U.S. District Court Judge, James C. Fox, 2003

&gt;&gt; Dear Kevin,

&gt;&gt; This is a very complicated subject ... but LRH had noticed how it fits
&gt;&gt; to our society.

&gt; He also noticed how making it a mystery made money fit into his pocket.

&gt;&gt; These are my references:-

&gt;&gt; http://www.illuminati-news.com/2007-08.htm when you look into the
&gt;&gt; August 2007 or July 2007, there are many articles about the &quot;The new
&gt;&gt; World Order&quot;, &quot;World banking&quot;, &quot;World religion&quot;, &quot;World Government&quot;,
&gt;&gt; Masons, Illuminati, Zionism and the differences from Judism without
&gt;&gt; Zionism,

&gt;&gt; I spent weeks of thinking before I could define &quot;World Religion&quot; - my
&gt;&gt; interpretation is simply atheism - if with war mongering, one murders
&gt;&gt; every apponent, destroy their families, then nobody believes any more
&gt;&gt; in religion, there could be atheism. But this agument doesn't hold true
&gt;&gt; when you look at how old some religions are, (This dispite everything
&gt;&gt; that has survived from the Bush family and dictators that have been.)

&gt; Well, it's a slippery slope between fear of what's really happening, and
&gt; &quot;dub-in&quot; of paranoid delusion.  I'm much more interested in how to
&gt; uncover that which is being kept secret than I am in asserting pasts, or
&gt; concerning myself with spiritual warfare.

&gt;&gt; http://www.informantnews.com/book/index.html The Elohim Project
&gt;&gt; compares the Bible that one learns from a church, to scientific
&gt;&gt; arguments, --- there are three books, they are very long but all the
&gt;&gt; references to the canonised (official) bible are there -

&gt;&gt; LRH's OT3 story about the origin of the spirit of man seems a little
&gt;&gt; tame, like the little people that live at the bottom of the garden.

&gt; It doesn't seem tame to me, it just sounds like it's not my item.  It
&gt; sounds like a wrong explanation for the concentration of power and
&gt; money.  The concentration that he saw I think does exist, I just don't
&gt; believe it has anything to do with aliens or immortal spiritual games of
&gt; conquest.

&gt; Ockham.  That's way too complicated, and there are much simpler
&gt; explanations.  The explanations, actually, end up being a game that
&gt; distracts from solutions.  The solution, IMO, is for secrecy to be
&gt; abolished, confidentiality to be abolished, representative democracy to
&gt; be amended such that each individual votes FOR THEMSELVES on an issue,
&gt; rather than deputizing someone to vote for them in blocks, which allows
&gt; them to do things you wouldn't do.  E-voting, but taken to an extreme,
&gt; where you vote directly on bills, can write bills yourself, and have
&gt; them ranked by people's interest (like the google system of weighting
&gt; pages: pagerank), rather than letting other people propose bills that
&gt; you never get to see, and you vote for representatives who lie to you
&gt; about their agenda, etc. Transparency, accountability, responsibility.

&gt;&gt; Why did so many of the people from the old testament live to be 700
&gt;&gt; -900 years old?

&gt; Who says they did?  The bible?  Please.

&gt;&gt; Why did Jesus always think, or meditate on the top of a mountain, and
&gt;&gt; once took two of his disciples with him in the top of the mountain?

&gt; Again, who says that he did.  The Bible is a fiction.

&gt;&gt; Was Jehova the name of the father from Jesus, God, or a the name of the
&gt;&gt; mother spaceship?

&gt; None of the above:  it's the name given to a fiction by people who had
&gt; trouble explaining things, and so came up with a system of
&gt; ancestor-worship.

&gt;&gt; How does genetic engineering fit into this time and the bible?

&gt; It doesn't.

&gt;&gt; When the Israelites returned through a opened up Nile to their
&gt;&gt; homeland, from Egypt, where did the giants come from and how did the
&gt;&gt; Israelites fight them?

&gt; There weren't any giants.

&gt;&gt; Why are there so many different races here on the earth?

&gt; There aren't.  There are a number of different pigmentations and bone
&gt; densities within one race.

&gt;&gt; I don't pass this information onto COS$ scientologists, with their
&gt;&gt; weakened understanding of LRH Scientology ---- they wouldn't
&gt;&gt; understand! no imagination, or only fixed ideas from making money and
&gt;&gt; driving everybody into a state od atheism.

&gt;&gt; Socrates

&gt; Well, you're barking up the wrong tree if you are expecting me to be in
&gt; agreement with religious thinking.

&gt; Religion poisons everything.

&gt; www.zeitgeistmovie.com

&gt; I appreciate your willingness to communicate your ideas, and your
&gt; sources, and I'm sorry if my tone seems mocking, but we are coming from
&gt; very different &quot;realities&quot;.  I'm a secular humanist.  Spirituality is
&gt; loaded, religion is for social control, and you can't split the
&gt; difference between them, because they're both archaic attempts to
&gt; understand something that requires an instrument of much greater power
&gt; than either:  scientific method, accompanied by critical analysis.

&gt; Religion is hereby cancelled.

&gt; :)

Agreed.  So:  why did the IRS allow it to be sealed?

Anyway, I'm not worried about WHICH conspiracy is in action, only that one
could be, and we'd never know or be able to prove it, because of &quot;sekrits&quot;.

That is correct.  I didn't mean to give the impression Mr. De Camp in
any way liked or admired the man.  Many years ago Sprague wrote a
brief piece about Hubbard for inclusion in an article about Hubbard's
work by a number of writers.  Since it was about the mans work Sprague
limited his comments to that.  Overall the piece was somewhat critical
but generally positive and many people may have thought they were
friends.  Hubbard seemed to think so.
Don't forget that Gore Vidal hated the man but he signed a letter to
the European Union defending scientology in Germany.

Yes, an excellent if dated work.

Popular pseudoscience books often generate books debunking them. My
favorite is one on the Bermuda Triangle, written by a High School teacher
who originally set his pupils to investigate the subject as an exercise in
critical thinking.

Of course such books soon vanish whilst the books they disprove stay in
print. As Laserclam would say, &quot;Can you think of religions like this?&quot;.

&gt; &gt; to this sort of an interest group!

&gt; &gt; Then again, how did the Church get the IRS to comply with their insistence
&gt; &gt; on charitable religious status?  Were they threatening to simply not pay
&gt; &gt; taxes, and to encourage class action amongst scientologists to not pay
&gt; &gt; income tax?  How did they compel this arm of the Executive Branch to
&gt; &gt; compliance?  Was it strictly blackmail on the chief executives of the IRS,

&gt; &gt; &quot;I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous than standing

&gt; &gt; own slavery, let them continue to create money and control the nation's
&gt; &gt; credit&quot; - Sir Josiah Stamp

&gt; &gt; &quot;[our] great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.  Our
&gt; &gt; system of credit is privately concentrated.  The growth of the nation,
&gt; &gt; therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men... who
&gt; &gt; necessarily, by very reason of their own limitations, chill and check and
&gt; &gt; destroy genuine economic freedom.  We have come to be one of the worst

&gt; &gt; the civilized world - no government by free opinion, no longer a government
&gt; &gt; by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion
&gt; &gt; and the duress of small groups of dominant men.&quot;  - Woodrow Wilson

&gt; &gt; &quot;A world banking system was being set up here... a superstate controlled by

&gt; Kevin,

&gt; Some of these quotes seem to be taken out of context and applied to
&gt; support a conspiracy hypothesis.  There's a whole lot of speculatin'
&gt; goin' on.

&gt; My humble opinion is that this plays like Robert Anton Wilson's
&gt; Illuminatus trilogy. The whole point is to demonstrate that you can
&gt; choose *anything* and make it appear significant in a grand
&gt; conspiracy, because you are trying to notice it. It's kind of like the
&gt; whole quantum thing about when you observe something, the act of your
&gt; observation changes its behavior.

&gt; There's a whole lot of speculation about the IRS 1993 decision for
&gt; Scn, Inc's charitable &lt;cough&gt; status, too.  Some suggest that there
&gt; were dirty tricks against individuals in IRS offices.  I know they
&gt; sued annually for about 40 years, and that was just from Clearwater.
&gt; Imagine all the resources tied up just to disagree with Scn Inc - much
&gt; less to enforce the laws they were breaking.  Perhaps it became
&gt; &quot;easier&quot; to change the law than to change Scn, inc's corporate
&gt; behavior.
&gt; After all, it was soooo important to Scn Inc, to rationalize itself,
&gt; while to the IRS it was just a bunch of lawsuits that finally went
&gt; away.

&gt; Still, as in the case with Miss Bloodybutt and Gabe Cazares and
&gt; Paulette Cooper and so many others, precedent is set that where there
&gt; is calculated wierdness, there's Scientology.  I remember being here
&gt; when Miss Bloodybutt went down and only being able to think how wierd
&gt; is this.  It wasn't until many years later, when someone who was
&gt; inside at the time blew, that the whole story came out.

&gt; Eventually you notice a link between a kind of translucency of events
&gt; and an attempt to mask or misdirect, where there is no reason to not
&gt; have total transparency -- other than to mask or misdirect.  It's
&gt; about all that is consistent with Scn, Inc - from tax evasion to ad
&gt; hominem attacks on critics to Lisa McPherson to the heirarchic way
&gt; that &lt;cough&gt; eccelsiastic information is presented with disregard to

&gt; Also, I think a lot of people want to believe in stuff like

Oh:  yes, btw, I agree that it's straight out of Robert Anton Wilson

BTW, have you read his &quot;Everything Is Under Control&quot; book?  That was

&gt; Not at all. Scientology by its nature is closer to rabbit holes than most

I am certainly willing to look into variant &quot;reality tunnels&quot;, as Dr.
Leary described them, or &quot;universes&quot; as Hubbard put it.  This
particular one (the Council on Foreign Relations having undue
influence towards a &quot;New World Order&quot; where &quot;the people&quot; serve
megacorporations), however, I think has a lot of merits.  Even if it
isn't &quot;TRUE&quot;, it's possibility should be prevented.

Thanks, I'll check these out later, after I've handled my restless cock

&gt;He was diatribing about world bankers.  I was willing to listen to this
&gt;stuff, because I've seen enough documentation on it to make my
&gt;short-and-curlies stand up, but I drew the line when he thought we should
&gt;SUPPORT BUSH'S WAR EFFORT.  That made me turn him off.  But it didn't stop
&gt;me from investigating a bit more of what he was on about.
">

If Bush tells me to &quot;Seig Heil!&quot;, I will ask him, &quot;How Heil?&quot; My
ethics are out on the third dynamic. I am readily falling into line
within any Naziesque regime. (Remember, I am ex-Sea Org.)

I will salute the New World Order with a smile on my face. Then Darth
Vader will land his spaceship and announce that we are now part of the
Galactic Empire. (Weren't we always?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The quotes below are all taken from slides in www.zeitgeistmovie.com , which
&gt;is hardly an unbiased report!  But they are pretty fucking spooky to me.  I
&gt;don't know where to discuss these issues with people who are as diverse and
&gt;bright as those on this board.  If none of your are interested, then I'll
&gt;kill the topic.  If you are interested, but you have another place you think
&gt;that the conversation belongs, I'd be happy to take it there.
">

I watched the Zeitgeist movie that you recommended. The second two
parts contain the same data as the videos I recommended in my other
post.

The first part was all about r6, of course. I enjoyed it. I laughed
when they showed the crosses with the circle representing the Sun
because of our Scientology cross being a Christian cross X'd out. (The
Christians are going to Hell.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Hubbard was on about this stuff, back in the early 60's.  He may have been
&gt;crazy as a bedbug, and he might have been operating on some really nutty
&gt;ideas (that these bankers work for an off-world intelligence controlled by
&gt;&quot;Xenu&quot;), and I don't believe that the Scientology religion posed any threat
&gt;to this sort of an interest group!
">

Or Hubbard ordered an eval on world affairs and turned up the data
about the international bankers as mentioned in RJ-67. Captain Bill
Robertson later continued the eval and turned up data on the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Bank of
International Settlements.

The rich are making the poor even poorer, but the poor are too PTS to
get out of their slump. They will force a crude form of Communism on
us to make it &quot;fair&quot;. Five dollars (ameros) a day for everyone! (But
Church auditing is fifty ameros per hour! Oy vey!)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Then again, how did the Church get the IRS to comply with their insistence
&gt;on charitable religious status?  Were they threatening to simply not pay
&gt;taxes, and to encourage class action amongst scientologists to not pay
&gt;income tax?  How did they compel this arm of the Executive Branch to
&gt;compliance?  Was it strictly blackmail on the chief executives of the IRS,
&gt;or do you think there might have been something significantly deeper?
">

The Church was running full page USA Today ads revealing the truth
about the IRS. Everybody loved Lucy ... except the IRS! John Wayne,
American hero but enemy of the IRS!

Then the Church told the IRS that they weren't even interested in the
money. To prove it, they willingly signed it over to a former IRS
official. (Good for them. I validate their effort.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Have I gone bonkers?  (DON'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION).

Your ethics are out, but you are otherwise fine. (Don't tell me what
to do.)

&gt;&quot;Under the Federal Reserve Act, panics are scientifically created.  The
&gt;present panic is the first scientifically created one, worked out as we
&gt;figure a mathematical equation.&quot;  - Charles Lindbergh
">

Excerpt from Wikipedia article on the Great Depression: &quot;Austrian
theorists who wrote about the Depression include Hayek and Murray
Rothbard, who wrote 'America's Great Depression' in 1963. In their
view, the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the money
supply in the 1920s that lead to an unsustainable credit driven boom.
In their view, the Federal Reserve, which was created in 1913,
shoulders much of the blame.&quot;

The Fed is currently inflating. The dollar will have to fall out the
bottom before we start over with ameros.
