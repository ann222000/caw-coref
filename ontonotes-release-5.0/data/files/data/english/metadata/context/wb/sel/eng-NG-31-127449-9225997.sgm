Arrests drain bathtub cheese sellers

SACRAMENTO
October 24, 2007 5:19pm

A Southern California couple is facing criminal charges after allegedly
being caught with 375 pounds of “bathtub” cheese at an open-air market in
San Bernardino County, the California Department of Food and Agriculture
says.

The illegal soft cheese products are known to cause serious illness such
as listeria, salmonella or E. coli.

Floribel Hernandez Cuenca, 29, and Manuel Martin Sanchez Garrido, 44, of
Montclair, were arrested for selling a variety of unlicensed cheeses to
the public. Ms. Cuenca was also arrested on felony cheese making charges.

The 375 pounds of seized illegal cheese included panela, queso fresco and
queso oxaca varieties, the CDFA says. It was a significant find, the
department says.

“Illegally produced is cheese is serious threat to public health,” says
CDFA Secretary A.G. Kawamura.

Unlicensed products may carry a bigger price tag than consumers expect:
the risk of severe illness, the state says.

Infants, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are the most
susceptible. Expectant mothers should be especially guarded, as the
listeria organism can cause miscarriages.

Maybe you wouldn't know it had been made in a bathtub by amateurs.  I buy
stuff all the time at a farmers' market that I assume has been made to some
acceptable level of standards, but don't expect to do a Spanish Inquisition
before I buy some rye bread, applesauce, cider, jam, or cheese from a
Wisconsin farmer.

No, but a lot of bathtub cheese is sold door-to-door, out of car
trunks and at public markets. The batches are typically made with raw
milk (as opposed to pasteurized milk). The most common concerns are
Salmonella and Listeria. In the US, the FDA requires cheesemakers to
either use pasteurized milk or ripen the cheese for at least sixty
days. Some consumers believe that using pasteurized milk changes the
flavor of the resultant cheese, and prefer to assume the risk.

I just threw up a little in my mouth...

Ha, just kidding. But I am an avid admirer of the domestic (Cheeep!!)
ports available at my local grocery store, vintage 2007. So I can say
with at least a small amount of authority that your humorous
suggestion of serving American Cheese with port does indeed fall
within the ranks of a misdemeanor, if not a full fledged felony.
Blasphemy comes to mind. But then again, domestic ports of 2007
vintage aren't exactly quality either, so I suppose they might balance
one another in terms of strength and character..

Speaking of cheese, wine woot is selling a 3-lb wheel of artisanal blue
cheese for $30. http://wine.woot.com/default.aspx I don't think I need
3 lbs of blue cheese, but if you do, it's probably a decent deal.

It gets a good review.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/200...

But 3 lbs? Still, it might be worth it even if a good part of it gets
given away. '

Amazon has it for $16.99/lb

A good blue is expensive.  a REALLY good blue is outrageously so (last
night's, an more obscure French one, eaten with seckel pears, was
$20/lb at Whole Foods).

The Hub works with a crazy Frenchman...this may work out.
