*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
Bad credit can affect many of the opportunities you have in your life, from your ability to purchase a home right down to your ability to rent movies. Today, Americans are finding themselves more in debt than ever, and many do not know how to go about fixing their financial reputations.

Most of the financial woes of Americans and bad credit can be attributed to credit card bills. Many American consumers and their families are being dragged into (or deeper into) financial holes because of their uncontrolled spending on their major credit cards. When it comes time for the credit card debt settlement, they find that they overextended their means and are not able to settle credit card debt. The research on this subject is astounding:

Studies have suggested that on average, an American household will have monthly due balance around $8,000, including both credit cards and student loans. The problem with this accumulated debt is the interest. As the debt sits whiteout getting paid off, the interest accrues and the per month payments go up. Soon enough, many consumers find themselves paying more to the interest on their debts than on any other household expense. Many suggest that the only escape from this financial purgatory is to look into options such as credit card and debt consolidation.

One way that people try to consolidate their debt is by applying for another credit card and then transferring the balance over to the new one, taking advantage of the often low beginner APR rates. This way is really not very effective, as all that ends up happening is a larger sum of money on a new card, resulting in even higher interest payments.

Another way is through consumer debt counseling, or debt consolidation. Those who choose debt consolidation need to realize that it will not make your debt disappear. It is only a tool that can be used to get an individual out of debt, and therefore its success will lie with the person who wields that tool.

There is no doubt that being in a financial hole leads to an incredible stress on the individual. Consolidating the debt will help to alleviate some of this stress, as the individual debtor will realize that a plan is in place to improve his or her life. Debt consolidation will mean that the monthly payments on an individual debt is lowered, and that in most cases interest rates are as well. As payments are made, the collection agencies will begin to call less, which will also help to reduce the stress.

It is very important to remember that although a plan is in place, it is up to the individual to follow through with it and control spending so that the debt is paid off. Debt consolidation programs can help by managing your debt in a way that does not seem impossible for you, and will also help with self-control issues by pointing out ways in which an individual can better manage his or her finances. The plan that is put in place is one that suits the needs of the individual. All creditors are paid out according to priority after all unsecured debt is consolidated, including medical bills, credit card debt, and personal loans. All of these loans are now paid out of one place. Many of these plans are sponsored by creditors themselves, as they feel that although they could make more money with the higher interest rates, there is the risk that they will receive nothing at all. For this reason, they would prefer to recoup the money over the long term than lose everything due to a money-grab.
