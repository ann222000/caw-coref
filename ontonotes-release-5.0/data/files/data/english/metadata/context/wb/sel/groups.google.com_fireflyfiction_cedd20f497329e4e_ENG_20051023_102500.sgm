Wash glanced back at the infirmary.

&quot;Simon and one of the boys are just finishing with him now. Simon looks happy
enough with it.&quot;

She raised her brow.

&quot;He looks happy?&quot;

He gave a soft breathy laugh in the dark.

&quot;Well, he doesn't look upset with it.&quot; His eyes caught her about to speak
again. &quot;Alex is still under, but they've finished working on her now. I don't
know how she is.&quot;

Good enough. She groaned a little with the movement of her shoulder in the
sling Book had made for her and rested her head back.

&quot;Just a little bit longer, Simon wants to take a look at you before we move you
to our bunk.&quot; Wash placed a kiss on her brow and Zoe breathed in the smell of
him. &quot;You scared me, Zo.&quot;

She thought about the trek into the hospital back on Orpheus.

&quot;Just paying you back, husband.&quot;

***

Jayne watched the boy's veins strain in his arm.

&quot;Okay, that's enough, little man.&quot;

He reached out to take the barbell. He'd have to be blind and stupid not to see
the fire that passed in the kid's eyes, or the way his chest puffed up.

&quot;My name is Sebastian.&quot;

Jayne chuckled.

&quot;Yeah, and I'm Jayne Cobb the third, bleedin' esquire.&quot; He handed the boy a
towel. &quot;These are my weights and I say you've had enough. Little. Man.&quot;

&quot;I can do it...&quot;

&quot;Sebastian.&quot; They both looked over to see Jonah standing just inside the door
way. &quot;I think Bethany's looking for you.&quot;

Sebastian raised his brows, but didn't say anything as he stood up and gave a
slight nod of the head to Jonah before leaving. Jayne grinned as he sat down.

&quot;Bethany, huh? That's the red headed one?&quot; Jonah nodded with a blank
expression. &quot;The very same girl I've been led to believe can read all our minds
an' probably knows the very words we're sayin' right now? She's just drivin'
herself crazy searching this ship for that boy? Is she?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Jonah admitted unapologetically.

&quot;Damn fool's wasting her talents then.&quot; He gestured for Jonah to sit down. &quot;You
want something in particular?&quot;

Jonah picked up a small weight bar and hefted it experimentally, curling his
arm up and feeling the strain of his under used muscles.

&quot;Not particularly, no.&quot;

Jayne eyed him, the too obviously distracted drifting look of him and his eyes
sparked.

&quot;Thought you'd be all hovering together, you an' River.&quot;

&quot;She's...&quot; Jonah's eyes lifted up and over the ceiling. &quot;She's busy.&quot;

A small, knowing chuckle escaped Jayne's lips. Bulls eye. A man who makes a
living as a tracker, hunter and fighter doesn't miss when he aims for a target.
Not if he wants to make any kind of a living.

&quot;They make a mighty fine pair, don't they? 'Course none of us really seen it
coming.&quot; He paused &quot;Always figured Kaylee as a man's woman, you get my
drift.&quot;

As if Jonah could escape from it.

&quot;Like to drive a man crazy, those two together.&quot; Jayne could still feel soft,
warm breath in his ear and the pictures it painted. &quot;Sometimes it just ain't
fair.&quot;

Beside him, Jonah answered with a mixture of a sigh, a shrug and a sad little
laugh.

&quot;No, no it's not.&quot; He looked at the man next to him. &quot;At least you only have
what River told you.&quot;

Jayne perked up and looked all manner of interested.

&quot;You get visuals with that head of yours, do ya?&quot;

***

Simon pushed his exhaustion back even further, breathing in sharp and sudden to
flood his system with oxygen. His eyes blinked open and closed and he let his
shoulders roll. They were nearly done.

Words like trabeculae and endosteum drifted through his brain as he eyed the
carefully restructured bone before him, meticulous eyes picking over the thin
shining strands that he had fervently prayed to be intact. Only the saphenous
nerve had seemed to take any real damage and even then it hadn't been that
drastic. He'd have to wait and see if any permanent damage had been sustained.

All things considered, Mal had come out of this luckier than Simon had first
hoped. It would take a while, and Mal would most likely have to learn a great
deal of patience when it came to recovery times, but the captain would most
likely come out of this with nothing more than a slight limp. Not to mention
the many new scars Mal seemed to attract like a magnet any time they had a job.

He looked up to see Sebastian and Bethany sitting in the common room, talking
quietly.

&quot;They seem close.&quot;

&quot;They do, don't they?&quot; Daniel didn't even look up as he held the edges of skin
aside for Simon to finish inside the wound. &quot;It's going to be interesting when
it develops into something else.&quot;

&quot;When? Not if?&quot;

Daniel shrugged.

&quot;We take a lot of guesswork out of life.&quot; There was an undercurrent there that
he didn't bother to hide, something that hinted at pride and possessiveness and
a readiness to strike back at anything that struck first. &quot;They're good for
each other, we can all feel it.&quot;

Simon put the laser tool down and reached for the dermal weaver, he spared a
glance up at Daniel and a thought sprung into his mind.

&quot;You can feel... everything?&quot; He looked down again, unsure if he really wanted
to know.

&quot;Everything.&quot; Daniel confirmed. &quot;But you learn to sift through most of it,
ignore what you don't need. You look the other way and allow them to have their
moments. Accept that the others are doing the same thing for you. Otherwise
you'd be too embarrassed to do a single thing.&quot;

&quot;You let them drift in and out without pausing to examine or care, showers,
bathroom visits, sexual thoughts, moments of anger, of grief, pain and
humiliation, they're all parts of life. We just share them.&quot;

Simon watched the edges of Mal's skin knit together as he heard the words, but
he was thinking about River, about the way she moved through the ship and
always seemed to know when to avoid the bridge, how she would often curl her
lip and smile at Jayne when he hadn't said a word, or the way she'd never seem
to burst into his room at the wrong moment, but often minutes after when he'd
had time to collect himself.

***

&quot;No ruttin' way!&quot;

&quot;Jayne.&quot; Kaylee wheedled with a smile. &quot;It's just for now, there ain't no room
on Serenity for everyone.&quot;

&quot;There's plenty of room, you just ain't looked hard enough.&quot;

She sighed.

&quot;Bethany and Minmei are gonna sleep in River's room, River's gonna bunk with
me.&quot; She couldn't help the smile that crept over her. &quot;Jonah and Daniel in
Simon's room, Sebastian and Binh in Mal's room, which just leaves...&quot;

&quot;I ain't bunkin' with the doc, Kaylee.&quot;

River's eyes glowed.

&quot;He'll keep his hands to himself.&quot;

&quot;He better!&quot; Jayne exploded. &quot;Gettin' to be so a man can't even sleep by
hisself.&quot;

&quot;See?&quot; River turned to Kaylee. &quot;Told you he'd agree.&quot;

Jayne glared.

&quot;I didn't agree to nothin'!&quot;

&quot;Jayne?&quot; Kaylee asked, suddenly curious. &quot;Jayne, why won't you look me in the
eye?&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; he searched for a believable response, searched hard, &quot;nothin'.&quot;

Yup, he thought, that oughtta do it.

&quot;River?&quot; Kaylee turned a disbelieving glare onto the girl next to her. &quot;He's
blushing. What did you tell him?&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; she searched for a believable response, searched hard, &quot;nothin'.&quot;

River and Jayne giggled. Kaylee sighed.

&quot;I don't believe you two!&quot;

***

He let a little groan pass through his throat, the final admission to complete
exhaustion as he stepped out of the infirmary. Both Alex and Mal were resting,
Simon probably had two or three hours before Mal would make his way out of the
anesthetic.

The colors of the common room, even muted in the dark, were a welcome contrast
to the starkness of the room he'd just spent hours in. It was quite and Simon
tried to remember when they'd all drifted away, slowly, into their own spaces.

The room had seemed always full of someone, at first it had been everyone,
watching eagle eyed, then slowly they had trickled away and come back and left
again. Different permutations of the same faces staring through the window.
Different bodies inside the infirmary, some helping him and some giving blood
where it was needed. Eventually they'd all stayed away. At some point, he'd
told Daniel to go and rest as well. Only Book remained in the infirmary now,
with strict instructions to call him if anything changed.

There hadn't been much to do and he supposed he could have finished long before
this, but he'd always been thorough, always had to stay with his patients for
longer than necessary, just to wait and watch and hover.

Zoe was sleeping when he made his way to the far sofa and he nodded at Wash,
sleepy eyed and sitting there with his wife's head resting on his legs, running
a hand through her hair.

&quot;How is she?&quot;

He spoke softly and his hands were gentle as they lifted the bandage to check
the wound. It wasn't perfect, but it was better than he'd expected. Book had
done well.

&quot;She's groggy, but I think she's good.&quot; Wash replied. &quot;What's the official
word?&quot;

Simon saw the worry behind the blue eyes.

&quot;I think you're right.&quot; He felt Zoe stir as he put the bandage back in place.
&quot;Make sure she has some fluid, okay? She lost a fair bit of blood. I'll help
you get her to your bunk if you like.&quot;

&quot;I can walk.&quot; Came Zoe's voice, weaker than Simon could remember ever hearing
it. &quot;Just give me a minute.&quot;

His head was heavy as he left them to it, eyes all but falling out of his
skull. There was one thing he was itching to do before he went to sleep,
though, something that made him walk over to the table.

The boxes sat there, smeared with blood, Simon wasn't even sure whose.
Excitement scratched at the edges of his nerves, nobody had said anything, but
he knew, he knew what it was, had known the minute Jayne had shoved them into
his hands.

He reached out to open the first one.

&quot;No, Simon.&quot;

Simon jumped and turned.

&quot;River!&quot;

She was standing just outside the common room, in the cargo bay, arms stretched
out and holding onto the edge of the doorway. Her hair fell down in a straight
line as she leaned back. He saw the way her dress moved, rippling in a gust of
air that he supposed must be from the cooling vent.

&quot;You need sleep, Simon.&quot; She admonished him with a stern face. He was about to
protest when she let go of the frame and stepped into the common room towards
him. &quot;Three years in a room, trapped. Rapunzel can wait to let down her
hair.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Go to bed, big brother.&quot; She set her face stubbornly. &quot;Before you drop. I
won't carry you.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; He didn't have the energy to argue with her. &quot;I'm going, I'm going.&quot;

She allowed herself a sleepy yawn and Simon arched his brows.

&quot;Shouldn't you be going to bed, too?&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot; She replied and went to stand by the vent again. &quot;When I'm ready.&quot;

***

Kaylee heard the hatch creak open and listened to the barely there footfalls of
River climbing down. She felt exhausted and was ready to fall asleep and never
wake up. She was lying in her bed, her very own, non medical bed, that had
never felt this comfortable that she could remember.

&quot;C'm here you.&quot; She lifted the blanket up and reached out to take River's hand
in hers. &quot;Geez River!&quot;

River practically hummed as Kaylee pulled her deep into the bed, covered her
with hands and legs and arms and everything that would keep her in one place
and not let her splinter into a million different thoughts and dreams and fears
and memories.

&quot;How do you get so cold?&quot;

***

&quot;Ching-wah tsoa duh liou mahng!&quot;

He heard the words before anything else filtered into his brain. Not that it
took long for the pounding to start, the throbbing of his head and the soft
burn of bullets taken out of his body. He opened his eyes, blinking at the
sudden onrush of light and twisted his head as far as it would go.

&quot;You sure took up swearin' quick, doc.&quot;

Simon turned away from the screen to look at him. The display glowed an eerie
aura around the doctor in the muted light of the darkened infirmary.

&quot;Captain, how do you feel?&quot;

&quot;Just peachy, top three.&quot; Mal coughed and groaned through the pain it caused.
&quot;How do you think I feel?&quot;

&quot;You need to lie back down.&quot; Simon walked over. &quot;Don't even think about
destroying all the work I just put into patching you up.&quot;

Mal let him press his head back down to the hard bed at the side of the
infirmary. Simon's hands began a dance around him, feeling his forehead,
checking various machines. Out of the corner of his eye Mal saw a small body
lying face down on the gurney, a mask helping her breathe.

&quot;What happened?&quot; He looked up at Simon. &quot;Everyone get out? Zoe? Kaylee? I
remember Kaylee.&quot;

&quot;We got out. Everyone.&quot; Simon looked at the bed in the middle of the room.
&quot;Alex, the youngest one, she was shot pretty badly. I'm still not sure if she's
going to pull through. Zoe and Kaylee are fine.&quot;

&quot;And me?&quot;

&quot;I was under the impression nothing stopped you for very long, Captain.&quot; That
was when Mal knew he was going to be okay. &quot;Your left arm has a new bullet scar
and your right hip needs time to knit properly, but you're going to be fine.
You lost a bit of blood.&quot;

&quot;Wash?&quot; Mal asked and Simon nodded. &quot;I've got more of his than my own at this
point.&quot;

&quot;There are a few other odds and ends, some minor scratches that come with the
territory.&quot; Simon couldn't help but recite the rest of it, giving the report as
he figured Mal would want it. &quot;River has a few burns from the explosion,
Kaylee's a bit bruised in places and her leg was stunned, Book was stunned all
over.&quot;

Mal blinked and gestured back to the screen.

&quot;So why are you swearing?&quot;

&quot;That...&quot; Simon stopped and breathed in deeply, his eyes flashed. &quot;They're data
disks. From the Academy.&quot;

Mal didn't say anything, he wasn't sure what he should say. He was fairly sure
what would be on them.

&quot;This one looks to be a log, some basic information kept by one of the doctors.
The things he's written.&quot; Simon turned back to the screen and scrolled down.
&quot;He refers to them as subjects, just subjects. Extreme heat tolerance
simulation, exposure to toxins, they were guinea pigs. Termination of
subjects...&quot;

Simon's voice trailed off to a whisper, unbelieving and full of cold anger. The
kind of soft awe that Mal had heard when people described the horror of
battlefields back in the war.

&quot;Everything is listed so coldly.&quot; Simon's breath hitched in his throat.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I'm in here.&quot; Simon couldn't take his eyes off the screen. &quot;They knew I was
searching for her.&quot;

He couldn't say it, couldn't verbalize the horror at seeing River's name added
as an afterthought to the destruction that was so casually described, the way
his whole chest clenched when he read his own father's name.

And those words, at the very start, the most damning of them all.

***

It was empty in the shuttle, the walls were stark and there were boxes stored
at random. It was in complete contrast to Inara's shuttle that they knew was
lush with silks and satins, trappings of grace and luxury. There was no
furniture to speak of, so they sat on the ground. In a circle of five with a
hole where the sixth should be.

They didn't speak, didn't make any sound, really.

They just sat.

Separate.

***

Kaylee heard the commotion from the kitchen. A sudden onrush of movement and
the clatter of feet rushing through the ship underneath her. She looked across
the table at Jayne, their eyes met and they stood up at the same time.

She knew what she would find when she went down the stairs. Simon standing over
Alex, his face red with effort, machines sounding alarms, River and Jonah
waiting by the infirmary windows, their faces blank.

***

*He looks at the numbers in front of him, knows exactly what they're going to
do with them, knows exactly how to change one digit here or there so that the
whole thing backfires in their faces.*

*He doesn't.*

*It's still fresh in his mind, the arc of his back as they pumped the fluid
into his veins and traced it on their screens, the way their ears seemed closed
to the moans he couldn't bite back, or tears that came from his eyes even as he
tried to hold them back, tried not to give them the satisfaction of knowing how
it got to him.*

*One of them likes the pain they cause, the others don't care either way as
long as they get their numbers, but Dr. Williams takes great pleasure in making
everything worse than it needs to be.*

*So Jonah gives them the correct data and curses himself for it, but knows that
as long as he plays by their rules, they'll at least pretend to play by his.
The rest of the children have been operated on, but he knows that they weren't
put through any pain because of it.*

*None of them have really felt pain in months, but Jonah knows how easily that
can be taken away from them, how easily he can be back in that chair with the
electrodes taped to his skull with them monitoring the spikes of his brainwaves
as they make him listen to one of the others scream. They get the best results
when it's River and they're not shy of abusing that knowledge.*

*He knows they have the perfect threat, because Jonah can take anything they
want to do to him, take it and stare them in the eye as he does, but he can't
take anything if it happens to the others. And they know it.*

*It's no longer about how much blood they take from him, it's become how much
they want from the others.*

***

&quot;She's stable.&quot; Simon eventually spoke to the people outside the infirmary
doorway, even if he didn't look up to meet their eyes. &quot;But I've done all I can
do here, she needs more, I don't have the proper medical facilities...&quot;

&quot;Hey, wait a minute.&quot; Jayne broke in. &quot;Proper medical means core, means
Alliance, means the people who shot at us in the first place. You don't
think...&quot;

&quot;What do you want to do, Jayne?&quot; Kaylee turned on him. &quot;Sit back and watch her
die?&quot;

&quot;I ain't sayin' that.&quot; He glared. &quot;It's just...&quot;

&quot;He's right.&quot; Wash answered. &quot;We can't just waltz up to the Alliance all
'here's a twelve year old girl that doesn't officially exist with gun shot
wounds from a fight that didn't officially happen in one of your facilities
that we're not officially supposed to know exists, oh but don't worry, you
should see all of the other guys that we shot down dead while we were there'.
We'd all be humped faster than you can say...&quot;

&quot;She knew.&quot; Daniel spoke calmly. &quot;She knew the risks, we all did, and she
agreed to them. I'm not handing her back when we're so close.&quot;

&quot;She's a twelve year old girl!&quot; Inara exclaimed. &quot;She couldn't possibly
understand...&quot;

&quot;Death?&quot; Sebastian challenged her. &quot;I think that concept was drilled into her
clearly enough.&quot;

&quot;I'm not comfortable going to the Alliance.&quot; Zoe offered and the room quieted.
&quot;But I don't think it's our decision to make.&quot;

She looked pointedly at the two figures standing at the window, looking in at
the girl in question. As everybody watched, Jonah nodded to River and only half
the people in the room understood the meaning behind it. She nodded back and,
one by one, the other children nodded in return.

Jonah looked up.

&quot;Call the preacher.&quot;

***

&quot;Hey Cap'n.&quot;

He opened his eyes to see Kaylee standing next to him.

&quot;Mei mei.&quot; Mal eyed the swirl of color over her cheek. &quot;Oh. Look at you.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; She clucked. &quot;You're the one got shot.&quot;

He felt the rapid click of her fingers over his brow, smoothing the sheet over
his chest, saw the way her eyes didn't quite reach his and the jerky little
tremble of her chin.

&quot;Don't you worry 'bout me, Doc says I'm gonna be fine.&quot; He looked over to the
empty bed in the middle of the room. &quot;They take her out already?&quot;

&quot;You've been asleep a while, Cap'n.&quot; She looked out to the common room. &quot;Book's
taken her in the shuttle.&quot;

&quot;How'd they take it?&quot;

She rolled her eyes at him.

&quot;How do you think they took it? Ain't one of them happy, but I don't think they
had a choice.&quot; A pause. &quot;It's not like they were gonna let her die, is it?&quot;

He looked at her in surprise.

&quot;Ain't no one was gonna be left to die, you hear me?&quot;

Kaylee smiled.

&quot;I know that, you fool.&quot; Her eyes shone just a little. &quot;I never doubted you'd
all come for me. I learned something else though.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Mal couldn't help the smile that came at her obvious pride. She was
probably the only fool he knew that could take being kidnapped, threatened with
Buddha knows what, put through a gun fight and still come out of it with a
positive life lesson. &quot;What's that then?&quot;

&quot;I may not know how to shoot a gun or be handy with my fists like the rest of
you all are, but I can still take care of myself when I need it.&quot;

&quot;Well, that ain't nothing we didn't know before.&quot;

Kaylee poked her tongue out at him and he laughed until the pain made him
groan.

***

&quot;Hey you.&quot; Inara picked up his hand and held it in hers. &quot;You had me worried.&quot;

Mal looked her in the eye.

&quot;What?&quot; A smile broke out, he couldn't help it. &quot;You think if I died they
wouldn't honor the free rent I promised?&quot;

She squeezed his hand just a little tighter than necessary and he frowned.

&quot;Hey! Ow.&quot; He complained. &quot;I'm a sick, wounded man here.&quot;

&quot;I won't argue with the sick part.&quot;

***

Simon walked over the gangway towards the kitchen and found himself stepping
over several bodies.

&quot;River?&quot; She rolled over to look up at him with a smile. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

River shrugged her shoulders and gave him wide, innocent eyes. Bethany and
Minmei appeared to be suspiciously holding back giggles as well.

&quot;Fine.&quot; He said. &quot;There's a meeting in the infirmary when you're finished here.
I'm just going to tell Wash and Zoe.&quot;

He gave them a warning glare and left them to it. As he stepped into the
kitchen he heard the distinct rumble of a growl sound far below.

&quot;Quit watchin' me, gorramit!&quot;

***

Mal was not sure what had been going through the heads of the Firefly creators
when they made Serenity back in ought three, he had often thought about the
ingenuity of the design, but he was fairly sure that no one had thought to
build an infirmary to hold fourteen people.

Even if one of them was propped up on the gurney, that being himself, and four
others were sitting perched on the outer benches, that being River, Kaylee,
Bethany and Minmei, and several others, namely Sebastian, Jonah, Jayne and
Daniel were crowded in the doorway, it still left Zoe, Wash, Inara, Simon and
Binh to crowd the rest of the space. Mal could barely keep track of them all.

&quot;Guess we have to make a decision.&quot; He opened the discussion. &quot;Now, y'all are
welcome on Serenity...&quot;

&quot;We're leaving.&quot; Jonah announced. &quot;As soon as Book lets us know, one way or the
other, what's happening with Alex, we'll find somewhere.&quot;

&quot;Don't be hasty.&quot; Mal added. &quot;You don't know...&quot;

&quot;We can't go back to our homes.&quot; Jonah continued as spokesperson for the group.
&quot;Our families either think we're dead, are incapable of housing us, or
knowingly made deals with the people who did this. Even if they were to take us
in, we'd only be placing them in danger by being there.&quot;

&quot;But surely...?&quot; Kaylee began, but stopped when River put a hand on her
shoulder.

&quot;It's better if we remain dead to them and they to us.&quot; He looked at River. &quot;We
can't stay here, either. This ship wasn't built for so many people and we've
already put you in more danger than you deserve to be.&quot;

&quot;I'm staying.&quot; A tear ran down River's cheek and Kaylee leant her head onto
River's shoulder. &quot;Splintered again, like a china doll broken.&quot;

Jonah looked like he wanted to go to her, but he didn't.

&quot;Book says he knows a place, a quiet little planet.&quot; There was still an edge to
the way he said the man's name. &quot;We'll set up there for now. As long as we stay
together, we should make it through this.&quot;

&quot;You'll have to come visit us.&quot; Bethany broke in.

&quot;Damn straight.&quot; Kaylee told her. &quot;Try and keep us away.&quot;

***

*He stands tall and stares them in the eye, he can almost ignore the sweat that
trickles down his face and between his shoulder blades, the tremble of his arm
as he holds it out straight.*

*It hurts, doesn't it? They ask him, with something he recognizes as pleasure.
We can stop anytime you say so.*

*He shakes his head and thinks of River.*

*It's entirely familiar to him, the thick sound of blood as each drop falls.
His blood. He wonders when he became immune to such things, when slicing open
the veins in his arm and risking his own life to save another's became
something he did on a regular basis.*

*We hope River Tam realizes just what you're going through. Their voices drift
into the haze that has begun to fall. You've passed every one of our tests so
far.*

*He should know by now just how much the human body can take before it passes
into unconsciousness, he should but he can't seem to recall it just now.*

*A white hot pain slides into the arm and he knows they're finished for now,
can't help but wonder how much more he can take. He keeps his mind focused on
River and knows he'll take anything else they want to dish out.*

*Your loyalty is surprising, Dr. Tam. Marcus' voice says in his ear. We'll have
your sister to you within the week.*

***

Simon looked at the second box sitting open on the dining table.

*But he said, Simon,* He could hear Kaylee's voice over the com so many days
ago. *Dr. Williams said they have a drug that can repair broken pathways in the
brain.*

*Experimentation with Expallion42...* read the reports on the data disks,
*promising results in subject Daniel H... initial results have raised hope for
the recovery...*

He turned to River.

&quot;Are you ready, mei mei?&quot;

***

Haven was a small white planet in the Burnham Quadrant. Far enough away from
any Core planets to ensure minimal Alliance interference. The surface is dry
and dusty, not much vegetation to speak of, most of the planets' living is
garnered through mining the deep core for the mineral rich substances that are
sold easily on nearby planets.

Far enough away from the eyes of the Alliance for seven people to create their
own haven without attracting much notice. For a Firefly class transport ship to
make regular visits without drawing unwanted attention.

Hidden well enough for sixteen people to stand in a clearing, grouped around
eleven different rocks that were specially placed. Eleven different names
etched into them. Half the group said their goodbyes, while the other half paid
respects to people they never knew.

***

River looked up and squinted at the sun. She breathed in deep, taking in the
smell of the earth she lay on, the feel of the heavy dust in her nostrils and
the lush, damp green smell of it.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Came the warm voice next to her. &quot;What're you smiling at?&quot;

She turned to look at Kaylee, lying next to her, and let her eyes drink in the
rounded cheeks and the sheen of heat that covered the woman's face. Kaylee
glowed, she still glowed, and River couldn't get enough.

&quot;Shh.&quot; She whispered. &quot;Can't make a sound.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don't you worry.&quot; Kaylee grinned as she reached out and traced light
fingers over the skin of River's belly. &quot;I'm gonna be quiet as a mouse.&quot;

River trembled with her giggles. She slapped Kaylee's hands away and rolled
over to lay a kiss on warm lips. Kaylee tasted as green as the earth they lay
on and River thrilled to it.

&quot;Now let me concentrate.&quot;

River shifted away from Kaylee so that she lay on her stomach, belly and knees
pressing into the dirt, careless of the clothes she wore. She took hold of the
rifle and looked into the view finder to find Mal leaning on his cane, Jayne
with his scowl and the group they were bargaining with. A warm hand rested on
the small of her back. As she watched, Mal tipped his head towards a man
sitting high on a horse.

&quot;If I make this shot, Jayne has to learn demi-pointe plies tonight.&quot;

THE END.

People have asked and so I researched this when writing this last chapter, the
results were pure coincidence and not planned at all, but I think they're
rather fitting.

For those interested:

*Jonah*: Hebrew origin, meaning a dove, a bringer or sign of peace. *Daniel*:
Hebrew origin, 'my judge is the lord', one who serves a higher law than man.
*Sebastian*: Latin origin, revered one. *Bethany*: Hebrew origin, 'house', one
who offers security and comfort. Also means 'life'. *Minmei*: Chinese origin,
little plum. *Binh*: Chinese origin, peaceful. *Alexandria*: Greek origin,
defender of mankind.

I have to (well, okay, I don't have to, but I'm going to, so there) thank many
people: firstly, Miss McKay, for not holding back and pointing out what didn't
work and what needed to be changed and also for putting up with my live
parodies of 'Adam's Spleen' in chat. Thanks bunches and it's still all your
fault, even if I don't know what 'it' is.

Secondly, to thatweirdgirl for naming Minmei and Binh, they desperately wanted
names of their own.

Thirdly, thanks goes to many devoted feedbackers because my fragile ego likes
to be stroked (including, but not limited to): SB, reallykaylee, thatweirdgirl,
Ambodell, Nutluck, Adrienne, Rich, moshpogfahfeng, Artships, Rob, Diz, Rinny,
Rinney, Missjasadin, RubyMoss, Kizziecstars, Inalasahl, Patrick, Rachel, Leah,
Sheri, Angela and everyone else who commented or emailed. And, gosh darn it,
doesn't my spell check love you all?

And, lastly, to anyone who's read &quot;Adam's Rib&quot;.

Thanks again.
