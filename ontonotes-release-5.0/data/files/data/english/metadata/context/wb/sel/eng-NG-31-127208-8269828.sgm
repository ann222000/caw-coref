Interesting read for the real Eagle fans and fans of various teams in the
NFC East...

Eagles' planning could pay off

10:04 PM CDT on Monday, August 6, 2007

BETHLEHEM, Pa. - Andy Reid runs the Philadelphia Eagles like an elite
college football program. He's willing to redshirt a good player in an
effort to make him a great one.

That's one of the reasons the Eagles figure to be better in 2007 than the
team that won a division title and reached the semifinal round of the NFC
playoffs in 2006. Actually, two of the reasons - Jeremy Bloom and Chris
Gocong.

The Eagles used a third-round draft pick on Gocong in 2006 because they
thought his pass-rush skills would be a great fit in Jim Johnson's
blitz-happy defensive scheme.

The Eagles used a fifth-round pick on Bloom in 2006 because they envisioned
him as a potential big-play kick returner - an element that has been missing
from their special teams since 2003 when Brian Westbrook was fielding kicks.

But in a salary-cap, win-now era of football that doesn't tolerate any
patience, the Eagles showed patience.

The Eagles knew Gocong wasn't ready to make the step from Cal Poly and
Division I-AA football to the NFL as a rookie. And they knew Bloom wasn't
ready after having missed two football seasons at Colorado while pursing an
Olympic dream as a skier.

So the Eagles eagerly redshirted them in 2006 when injuries shortened their
rookie training camps. Gocong went on injured reserve with a neck stinger
and Bloom with an ailing hamstring. The Eagles gave them a simple edict -
get ready for 2007.

Gocong had been through it before, having redshirted as a sophomore at Cal
Poly. But that didn't make last season any easier.

&quot;I'd watch the games thinking I could have made a tackle here, I could have
done this, I could have done that,&quot; Gocong said. &quot;It was difficult. But I
knew I had to take a step back and take it as a mental year. There's so much
to learn in Jim's defense.&quot;

Sitting was even tougher for Bloom because he had never endured a redshirt
season at Colorado. This was new to him.

&quot;I've competed my whole life in two sports,&quot; Bloom said. &quot;All of a sudden I
had to go a whole year without competing in any sports. That was tough. But
I realized what an incredible opportunity this was.

&quot;It turned out to be a huge advantage. It gave me an idea of things I needed
to do to get better - and there were lot of them. I was starting from ground
zero.&quot;

Bloom reported to the NFL combine a week after returning from the 2006
Winter Olympics and having not played any football since 2003. On the field,
speed was his strength. But that speed disappeared while he was on the
slopes. He ran in the 4.5s at the combine - not nearly fast enough for a
kick returner so diminutive in stature (5-9, 180).

Bloom averaged 13.5 yards per career punt return with two touchdowns and
25.1 yards per career kickoff return with one score at Colorado. He had
receptions of 94 and 81 yards, a kickoff return of 88 yards, and a punt
return of 80 yards in his two-year college career.

That's what attracted the Eagles to Bloom - big plays. Now that his body is
in football shape after a three-year layoff and his 4.4 speed is back, Reid
is looking for Bloom to make an impact in 2007 that he couldn't possibly
have made in 2006.

Philadelphia has not scored a touchdown in a combined 315 kick and punt
returns over the last three seasons. The Eagles are hoping Bloom can change
that.

Gocong was an elite pass rusher in college, having won the Buchanan Award in
2005 as the top defensive player in Division I-AA with his NCAA record 231/2
sacks. His 42 career sacks set another NCAA record.

But the Eagles wanted him to move from end to linebacker, and a redshirt
would give him time to learn the position. Johnson liked his size for the
strongside linebacker spot (6-2, 263) and the fact he'd be another weapon in
the pass rush. The player Gocong is replacing, Dhani Jones, managed only two
sacks in three seasons as a starter.

&quot;This is a great opportunity,&quot; Gocong said. &quot;I've got a lot of pressure on
me - but that's what makes great players.&quot;

The Eagles didn't rush linebacker Jeremiah Trotter onto the field in his
rookie year, nor did they rush cornerback Lito Sheppard. Neither started a
game in their NFL debut seasons - but both developed quickly into Pro
Bowlers. Reid is hoping he has two more in that same queue in Gocong and
Bloom.

The Cowboys have stopped by the playoffs for a cup of coffee what, twice in
10 years? Your team has been just short of a disaster for most of that time.
Parcells followed his normal post Giants pattern of up and down seasons
while he was there, never delivering anything near what you guys expected.
Meanwhile, we seem to maintain our position as serious contenders while you
hope Bums kid can get you over the hump and actually win ONE postseason game
since 1996.

&quot;Serious contenders&quot;????

Sorry, I spilled my coffee there while I was laughing.

Face it, the eagles could go 16-0 in the regular season, and win the two
playoff games 40-0, and they would still be underdogs for the Super Bowl.
After all, they're like the Mn Vikings.  &quot;Can't win the big one&quot;.

I love the way you guys cherry pick a time period. &quot;The last 10 years!&quot;.
You do realize the Cowboys won THREE SUPER BOWLS in the last 15 years, don't
you?  Of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't pick the last 10 as a time
period.

And now that the eagles time of being anywhere close to decent is up, they
will probably go another 30 years without a championship. You might as well
become an AZ Cardinal fan, they have a better shot than the eagles.

We're not, go back 5 years. 1 playoff appearence for you (a loss) vs 4

What areas would those be?   You mean like not throwing down the
field in the wildcard playoff game when your receivers are beating the
Seattle defense down the field?  Or would it be forcing Julius Jones
to run in holes that were never open?  Those are just a couple.
However, that was Parcells mo.  I love him for the discipline he
instilled.  I tuned in to more of his press conferences in his first year
than I have to any of Wade's.   Parcells is a character and a good
coach that I will miss.  But heck, even Belichick goes down the
field with his tight ends.

&gt; &gt; The Cowboys have stopped by the playoffs for a cup of coffee what, twice

that
&gt; &gt; time. Parcells followed his normal post Giants pattern of up and down

&gt; &gt; expected. Meanwhile, we seem to maintain our position as serious

actually
&gt; &gt; win ONE postseason game since 1996.

It's not spin. If the Patriots, despite their 3 SBs in 4 years, were to go
into a Dallas sized, decade long, funk most of the fans I know and interact
with would've been capable of compartmentalizing the past and complaining
about the team as the current failure it is. Only Dallas fans have that
amazing propensity for dredging up what's long since done to hide themselves
from what's obvious now.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You do realize the Cowboys won THREE SUPER BOWLS in the last 15 years,
&gt;&gt; &gt; don't you?  Of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't pick the last 10

&gt;&gt; We're not, go back 5 years. 1 playoff appearence for you (a loss) vs 4
&gt;&gt; appearences including 2 trips to the NFCCG and a Super Bowl loss to the
&gt;&gt; dynasty of the decade. Go back 1 year, a sweep. You guys love talking

&gt;&gt; rolled off 3 straight SB victories I gaurantee you that if it was trailed

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cowboys have won as many playoff games since 1997 as the Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Texans. In fact, the Arizona freakin' Cardinals have put them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shame.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dennis

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Picking out stats like that is like watching a mosquito try to suck
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blood out of a mummy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WTF are you blabbering about? He didn't post a single stat. He pointed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out your decade of postseaon futility.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vs. the eagle's 40 years of championship futility?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cowboys have stopped by the playoffs for a cup of coffee what, twice
&gt;&gt;&gt; in 10 years? Your team has been just short of a disaster for most of
&gt;&gt;&gt; that time. Parcells followed his normal post Giants pattern of up and
&gt;&gt;&gt; down seasons while he was there, never delivering anything near what you
&gt;&gt;&gt; guys expected. Meanwhile, we seem to maintain our position as serious
&gt;&gt;&gt; contenders while you hope Bums kid can get you over the hump and
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually win ONE postseason game since 1996.

&gt;&gt; Spin it anyway you want.  I would rather be absent from the playoffs for
&gt;&gt; 10 years vs. absent from a championship for 40 years.

&gt; It's not spin. If the Patriots, despite their 3 SBs in 4 years, were to go
&gt; into a Dallas sized, decade long, funk most of the fans I know and
&gt; interact with would've been capable of compartmentalizing the past and
&gt; complaining about the team as the current failure it is. Only Dallas fans
&gt; have that amazing propensity for dredging up what's long since done to
&gt; hide themselves from what's obvious now.
">

Not at all.  When there is a recent drought of appearing in the postseason
by teams
with a championship winning history,   fans of  said teams understand it
from a
cyclical standpoint. Fans of teams that have had a drought of wining a
championship
have more angst, venom, and malaise.  Take those same New England fans and
their
other team the Red Sox. In 2004 the proverbial blue balls of Red Sox nation
took
relief in Boston Harbor. Beating the Yankees was not their sole mission.
However, it would've been all for naught if they failed to win the World
Series.
Red Sox nation didn't talk about the years they won a wild card or were
runners up
in the division but still made the playoffs.  They saw those years as
failures because
they did not win a championship.

Thank you for giving me the fuel with which to burn you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well, I'm sure the Eagles fans are waiting for something to payoff,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they're in the same category with Super Bowl wins as the Saints,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cardnials, Jags, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there plans suit me fine so far.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mk

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dude, over a decade since you've tasted postseason success. Thats 10.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Take your time and consider your current legacy before relying on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; old stuff.
&gt;&gt; I know it's terrible, I can only imagine why you haven't jumped ship from
&gt;&gt; your team considering SB wins.

&gt;&gt; mk

&gt; So why aren't you a Giants fan? They won a couple a bunch of years ago.
&gt; Dosen't mean as much to them now of course, but they are realistic, they
&gt; aren't Cowboys fans.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Serious contenders&quot;????

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry, I spilled my coffee there while I was laughing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Face it, the eagles could go 16-0 in the regular season, and win the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; two
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; playoff games 40-0, and they would still be underdogs for the Super
&gt;&gt; Bowl.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; After all, they're like the Mn Vikings.  &quot;Can't win the big one&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which shows just how little you know about football.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I love the way you guys cherry pick a time period. &quot;The last 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; years!&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; You do realize the Cowboys won THREE SUPER BOWLS in the last 15 years,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; don't you?  Of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't pick the last 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; as
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; time period.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We're not, go back 5 years. 1 playoff appearence for you (a loss) vs 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; appearences including 2 trips to the NFCCG and a Super Bowl loss to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; dynasty of the decade. Go back 1 year, a sweep. You guys love talking
&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt; the old stuff because the new stuff is ugly. We get that. If the Eagles
&gt;&gt;&gt; rolled off 3 straight SB victories I gaurantee you that if it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; trailed
&gt;&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt; the 10 years of futility that has followed the Cowboys, we'd be bitching
&gt;&gt;&gt; instead of talking about how good we once were.

&gt;&gt; You're ALREADY talking about how good you once were, and you haven't even
&gt;&gt; WON anything yet!!

&gt; We are your defending division Champion, so kneel before us.

Ah yes!!  The highly sought after division championship.
I'll bet a lot of players do interviews displaying those

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rolled off 3 straight SB victories I gaurantee you that if it was
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; trailed
&gt; &gt;&gt; by
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the 10 years of futility that has followed the Cowboys, we'd be
bitching
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; instead of talking about how good we once were.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You're ALREADY talking about how good you once were, and you haven't
even
&gt; &gt;&gt; WON anything yet!!

&gt; &gt; We are your defending division Champion, so kneel before us.

&gt; Ah yes!!  The highly sought after division championship.
&gt; I'll bet a lot of players do interviews displaying those

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cowboys have won as many playoff games since 1997 as the
Houston
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Texans. In fact, the Arizona freakin' Cardinals have put them to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shame.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dennis

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Picking out stats like that is like watching a mosquito try to suck
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blood out of a mummy.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WTF are you blabbering about? He didn't post a single stat. He
pointed
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out your decade of postseaon futility.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vs. the eagle's 40 years of championship futility?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The Cowboys have stopped by the playoffs for a cup of coffee what,
twice
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in 10 years? Your team has been just short of a disaster for most of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that time. Parcells followed his normal post Giants pattern of up and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; down seasons while he was there, never delivering anything near what
you
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; guys expected. Meanwhile, we seem to maintain our position as serious
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; contenders while you hope Bums kid can get you over the hump and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; actually win ONE postseason game since 1996.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Spin it anyway you want.  I would rather be absent from the playoffs
for
&gt; &gt;&gt; 10 years vs. absent from a championship for 40 years.

&gt; &gt; It's not spin. If the Patriots, despite their 3 SBs in 4 years, were to
go
&gt; &gt; into a Dallas sized, decade long, funk most of the fans I know and
&gt; &gt; interact with would've been capable of compartmentalizing the past and
&gt; &gt; complaining about the team as the current failure it is. Only Dallas
fans
&gt; &gt; have that amazing propensity for dredging up what's long since done to
&gt; &gt; hide themselves from what's obvious now.

&gt; Not at all.  When there is a recent drought of appearing in the postseason
&gt; by teams
&gt; with a championship winning history,   fans of  said teams understand it
&gt; from a
&gt; cyclical standpoint. Fans of teams that have had a drought of wining a
&gt; championship
&gt; have more angst, venom, and malaise.  Take those same New England fans and
&gt; their
&gt; other team the Red Sox. In 2004 the proverbial blue balls of Red Sox
nation
&gt; took
&gt; relief in Boston Harbor. Beating the Yankees was not their sole mission.
&gt; However, it would've been all for naught if they failed to win the World
&gt; Series.
&gt; Red Sox nation didn't talk about the years they won a wild card or were
&gt; runners up
&gt; in the division but still made the playoffs.  They saw those years as
&gt; failures because
&gt; they did not win a championship.

&gt; Thank you for giving me the fuel with which to burn you.
">

Still a class one idiot. Somethings never change. Every teams ultimate goal
is a championship, but there is only one in any given year. That doesn't
mean that 31 other teams were &quot;failures&quot;, it just means they didn't reach
the ultimate goal. For example, if you set a goal as earning 100 million
dollars by age 40, are you an abject failure if you *only* earn 90 million?
By any measure you were a success, even if you fell short of the ultimate
goal. Within that context, the Eagles were a 75 to 90 million success with
the current coach, QB, RB, OL, Defense, etc. The Cowboys are looking in the
cushions for coffee change. Hitting the 100 million mark a couple times
means nothing when the last 10 years has whittled the account to 0.

You get a hat and a t-shirt for being division champions, not a ring. And

Ya, we kinda figured the Vikings and Bills were the heroes of the eagles.

I can see the cheers now &quot;We're not #1! We're not #1&quot;!

I suggest you talk to a player of two. You'll find that the biggest thing
isn't just being there, it's winning it.

Of course, don't talk to an eagle player.......

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The Cowboys have stopped by the playoffs for a cup of coffee what,
&gt; twice
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in 10 years? Your team has been just short of a disaster for most of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that time. Parcells followed his normal post Giants pattern of up and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; down seasons while he was there, never delivering anything near what
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; guys expected. Meanwhile, we seem to maintain our position as serious
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; contenders while you hope Bums kid can get you over the hump and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; actually win ONE postseason game since 1996.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Spin it anyway you want.  I would rather be absent from the playoffs
&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 10 years vs. absent from a championship for 40 years.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It's not spin. If the Patriots, despite their 3 SBs in 4 years, were to
&gt; go
&gt;&gt; &gt; into a Dallas sized, decade long, funk most of the fans I know and
&gt;&gt; &gt; interact with would've been capable of compartmentalizing the past and
&gt;&gt; &gt; complaining about the team as the current failure it is. Only Dallas
&gt; fans
&gt;&gt; &gt; have that amazing propensity for dredging up what's long since done to
&gt;&gt; &gt; hide themselves from what's obvious now.

&gt;&gt; Not at all.  When there is a recent drought of appearing in the
&gt;&gt; postseason
&gt;&gt; by teams
&gt;&gt; with a championship winning history,   fans of  said teams understand it
&gt;&gt; from a
&gt;&gt; cyclical standpoint. Fans of teams that have had a drought of wining a
&gt;&gt; championship
&gt;&gt; have more angst, venom, and malaise.  Take those same New England fans
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt; other team the Red Sox. In 2004 the proverbial blue balls of Red Sox
&gt; nation
&gt;&gt; took
&gt;&gt; relief in Boston Harbor. Beating the Yankees was not their sole mission.
&gt;&gt; However, it would've been all for naught if they failed to win the World
&gt;&gt; Series.
&gt;&gt; Red Sox nation didn't talk about the years they won a wild card or were
&gt;&gt; runners up
&gt;&gt; in the division but still made the playoffs.  They saw those years as
&gt;&gt; failures because
&gt;&gt; they did not win a championship.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for giving me the fuel with which to burn you.

&gt; Still a class one idiot. Somethings never change.

Okay, if that is your point of logic......

The Cowboys set out to get beyond 5-10 seasons and reach the playoffs.
They managed to do that.  Going even further and applying your logic
the Cowboys success in REACHING the playoffs is more positive than
a team that has the necessary players to win a championship like the
Eagles.  So the onus upon the Eagles franchise is not to merely be a
&quot;winning&quot; team but a league &quot;championship&quot; winning team.  To come
short of winning a league championship for the Eagles is in fact failure.
This philosophy works in the world of accounting.  Keeping your asset
value higher than your liability value. You don't have to be the richest,
just solvent.  This actually fits the Eagles to a &quot;t&quot; because they are run
by one of the best bean counters in the world.  Funny thing is that the
New England Patriots are run by the same philosophy and somehow
they've managed to win a league championship.  Maybe the Eagles
are doing something wrong?   Maybe its just plain karma.  Who knows?

So enjoy your  &quot;not failing&quot; by having playoff wins but not enough
to win a SuperBowl.   Have fun running around the house chanting
&quot; We're number 1...or 2...or 3...or 4...or 5...! &quot;   I'll keep watching
the Cowboys regular season with hopes of returning to the glory of

No, the onus was on the Cowboys to compete within their own division while
the Eagles rebuilt around a &quot;nobody&quot; coach and some kid from Syracuse.
They've been through 3 coaches and a whole lot of QBs since without any
level of success. The Eagles haven't fallen apart by any means. Again...look

Again, if you don't make the playoffs, or lose the very first game, your
chances of winning a Championship fall to what? Being good enough to go and
perform is all any team wants. If you don't have that, you don't have a

a yard short of winning but it didn't happen, did the team suck? Was the

No it isn't!!  I am having a discussion with you to let you know you
can't ram your Eagle fan bullshit down my throat.  The only reason
I believe that you are so entrenched is because your team has yet
to strinke while the iron is hot and the Cowboys did.  No matter if
it was 10 years, 10 months, 10 days, or 10 minutes ago.

The point of the article is  saying how the Eagles have remained
competitive and it may pay off in a SuperBowl.  It didn't say the Eagles
were greater than the Cowboys because they have reached the playoffs.
Consequently, it did not say the Cowboys were better than the Eagles
because they struck gold with thier playoff caliber teams of the 90's.
In my opinion Gosselin had to the dirty work and say something positive
about a division rival because the other Cowboys or Dallas based reporters
were writing about the Cowboys.

Yeah Bud. Everyone wants a chance.  But you know what, just like you don't
stay 21 forever, your team will go through ups and downs.  I plan to be
around
for a while.  You and I will have this conversation again.  I'll lay dollars
to donuts
that the Eaglse will have gone through or will be going through a
&quot;rebuilding&quot;
phase.

I see your point more clearly.  However, &quot;I&quot; did not relegate the Eagles

to be SuperBowl champions while the Eagles cannot.  This year, this decade
