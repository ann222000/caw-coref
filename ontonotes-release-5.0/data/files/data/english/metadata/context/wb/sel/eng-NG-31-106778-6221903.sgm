“PLO chairman Mahmoud Abbas was reported to have told US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice last week that his group would recognize Israel. In Arabic,
however, Abbas broadcast a different message.” “Abbas: ‘Hamas is not
required, Hamas is not required to recognize Israel... It is not required of
Hamas, nor of Fatah, nor of the Popular Front to recognize Israel. Okay?’”

George Bush is quite literally an evil man.  Quickly building himself to the
scale of another evil man known as,  'Adolph Hitler'.  Bush is not just some
dolt that is typical of American partisan politicians, but he has been an
evil, anti-Semitic, even anti-American man.  George Bush, the president of
the United States of America, supports terrorists.  He met the demands,
almost to the letter, of the 9-11 terrorists and brought American force
against Israel and against Jews. In fact, the 9-11 terrorists, in writing,
only demanded that America stop assisting Israel.  But instead, America not
only stopped supporting Israel in any way, but America brought her power
against Israel.  For example, Bush had several young, Israeli Jews arrested
here in America right after 9-11.  I mean, as America did for the arabs by
arresting and holding ‘the Jew’, Jonathan Pollard, in American prison all
his life for the arabs, in his effort to re-make the Western World into his
twisted, moronic 'new world order' of things, Bush had several young,
Israeli Jews who were visiting America, arrested and held for several
months!  The reason he gave for doing this?  Because of the islamic, arab
attack of 9.11!  George Bush's American media of course, refused to report
their arrests, and their being held in American prisons.

And now we have this horrible, evil man George Bush, sending his
Condisleezah Rice to help the islamic enemy of American peace and freedom,
Muhammad Abbas.  Abbas is the terrorist leader that changed his name from
Abu Mazen to cover himself up in order to help people like Bush support arab
terrorists.  He has been, for more then thirty years, a terrorist that has
murdered, or helped murder, hundreds of civilian Jews and Americans.  He is
also part of the attack of 9-11 on America, as one of his people we call
‘palestinians’, was sent to join the 9-11 terrorists in the attack that
murdered thousands of American civilians.

The Bush supported terrorist, Abbas, never changed anything at all in his
life, except his name to make himself more acceptable to the 'people he
considers easy, whorish women'.  The Americans.  Bush knows this.  He
doesn't care.  George Bush, the President of the United States of America,
has quite literally engaged in very, very evil things.  And he has brought
the United States of America, the supposedly christian nation, against the
bible some of them even ‘talk about’.  Bush has quite literally brought
America against Israel, and more importantly, he has brought the USA against
the G-d of Israel.  And the American people allow him to do it “in Jesus’
name”?  It is no wonder that christianity has become one of the fastest
shrinking religions in the entire world today.  No wonder at all.

1. Synagogue Planned For Temple Mount, Hashemites to Add Minaret

By Ezra HaLevi

MK Uri Ariel (National Union) is drawing up plans to construct a synagogue
on the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site. Jordan's King Hussein plans to
build a fifth minaret on the site as well.

The synagogue would be build upon the Temple Mount, but in an area that is
indisputably not within the areas that require immersion and other
preparations, according to Jewish law.

Ariel says that the synagogue would not change the Muslim status quo on the
mount, which is home to the Al-Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock.

“This is not a new idea,” Ariel stressed, “it has been brought up and
considered countless times since the [1967] Six Day War [during which the
Temple Mount was liberated from Jordanian occupation –ed.].”

The plan will be submitted to the Jerusalem municipality and the Committee
for Design and Construction for approval. Ariel says that every aspect of
the plan will be submitted to leading Torah scholars for approval.

The National Union MK, who visited the Temple Mount himself Monday, said
that such a plan was an opportunity for the Muslim world to prove it is
capable of rising above the violence and intolerance that have surfaced in
the past year as a result of papal remarks and political cartoon portraying
Islam’s founder Muhammad. Referring to Ariel's visit to the holy site, MK
Talab el-Sana (Ta’al) said the “provocation” would bring nothing but “war
and bloodshed.”

MK Ariel points out that every ruling by Israel’s Supreme Court regarding
the matter of the Temple Mount has recognized the right of every Jew to pray
on the Temple Mount. “This is rectification of a historic injustice, much
more than the transport to Israel of [Theodore] Herzl’s children’s bones [as
was done recently, in accordance with his wishes ed.].

"Since the destruction of the Holy Temple, the loss of our independence and
the start of our exile and oppression during the destruction of the Second
Temple, the Jewish presence at the site of our temple has always been an
unmistakable symbol. The Romans, Byzantines and Crusaders expelled us and
prevented Jews from entering Jerusalem, because they couldn’t stand to allow
the Jewish nation to serve its G-d at this holy site. This synagogue will
not interfere with believing Moslems who wish to pray at the Al-Aksa Mosque.
On the contrary, this is an opportunity for the Moslem world to demonstrate
and prove that it is tolerant enough."

Meanwhile, Jordan's King Abdullah II has donated a huge carpet to the
Al-Aqsa Mosque and has announced a contest to design a fifth minaret for the
mosque. The existing minarets have been affixed with green neon lights in
recent years, dominating the Jerusalem skyline. The planned minaret would be
constructed along the eastern wall of the Temple Mount and would be clearly
visible towering above the Western Wall.

The project requires approval by the Israeli government before it can begin.

2. Video Catches Abbas Contradicting Commitment to Rice

By Ezra HaLevi

PLO chairman Mahmoud Abbas was reported to have told US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice last week that his group would recognize Israel. In Arabic,
however, Abbas broadcast a different message.

On the eve of his meeting with Rice, Abbas told Al-Arabiya satellite TV that
although a Palestinian Authority government would have to accept the
existence of the Israeli government for purposes of receiving funds and
other logistical coordination, neither Hamas nor his own Fatah group were
required to recognize the legitimacy or right to existence of the Jewish
State.

The video clip, with subtitles, has been released by Palestinian Media
Watch, an Israeli group that monitors the Arabic-language media. It can be
viewed by clicking

5CCA7CC5A36F3EAB7A.htm&gt;  here.

The following is the text of the clip from Al-Arabiya [Dubai] and
Palestinian TV, aired October 3, 2006:

Host: "But maybe Hamas is right that it does not want to recognize Israel."

Abbas: "Hamas is not required, Hamas is not required to recognize Israel...
It is not required of Hamas, nor of Fatah, nor of the Popular Front to
recognize Israel. Okay?"

"The PLO, in 1993, recognized Israel as Israel recognized the PLO. Every
person has the right to say 'I do not recognize.' Okay? It's your right. It
is the right of every organization. But the government which will be formed,
and which will function opposite the Israelis on a daily basis... [every
hour and perhaps every second, there will be contact between Palestinian
ministers and Israeli ministers. And I ask] how can this government, or
these ministers, not recognize their counterparts, and then solve people's
problems?" [Abbas then gives an example of 500 million dollars in taxes
intended for the Palestinians, but put on hold by Israelis]. "The
Palestinian finance minister has to come to an agreement with the Israeli
finance minister about the transfer of the money. So how can he make an
agreement with him if he does not recognize him?

"So I do not demand of Hamas nor any other to recognize Israel. But from the
government that works with Israelis in day to day life, yes."

Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al Thani, left Gaza
Tuesday after failing to bridge gaps between Fatah and Hamas, according to
Israel Radio. Thani said that the central unresolved issue was recognition
of Israel.

IDF Hands Over S. Lebanon Maps, Remains in Ghajar

By Ezra HaLevi

Israel handed over detailed military maps of southern Lebanon to United
Nations forces Monday, including the locations of landmines laid in the
region, as part of the UN ceasefire resolution.

Hizbullah has been demanding the maps ever since Israel’s withdrawal from
Lebanon in 2000, under then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak. UN Security Council
resolution 1701, accepted by the Olmert government to end this summer's war
between Israel and Hizbullah, requires Israel to hand over the maps.

The maps were handed over, according to a UNIFIL statement, at a meeting
between IDF, UNIFIL and Lebanese army officials in the Lebanese village of
Nakoura,

UNIFIL has already handed copies of the maps over to the Lebanese army.

Israel laid the mines from 1982 through 2000. Maps have been provided in the
past marking where minefields are located – but not disclosing the exact
location of each mine.

IDF Remains on Both Sides of Ghajar

One of the outstanding issues between Israel and the UN is the continued IDF
presence in Ghajar, an Arab village that straddles the border between Israel
and Lebanon. When the village was liberated during the 1967 Six Day War, its
residents were granted Israeli citizenship and it was annexed to Israel
together with the rest of the Golan Heights.

In 2000, when the Barak government withdrew the IDF from Lebanon and
requested UN approval of the new border, 60 percent of the village was
transferred to Lebanese control. There is no divider within the village,
however, and residents can move freely across the border. Up until the war
this summer, residents of Ghajar could enter both Israel and Lebanon freely.
The IDF has now erected a fence around the village and remains in the entire
town until a solution is reached that will prevent it from being used as a
Hizbullah intelligence base and drug-smuggling route, as it has been since
the 2000 withdrawal. UNIFIL had hoped to replace the Israeli forces as of
the end of last week.

Nuclear Threat Cause for Increased Concerns in Jerusalem

By Yechiel Spira

Intelligence and security officials are monitoring Syrian activities closely
as Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad continues to release mixed messages.

Assad during recent days and weeks has broadcast contradictory messages,
calling for peace talks with Israel and issueing threats of launching a
military strike to “liberate” the Golan Heights from Israel.

The threats are apparantly aimed at reasserting Syria's demand for all of
the Golan Heights. Syria remains a staunch Hizbullah supporter, providing a
weapons transfer route to terrorists in southern Lebanon.

Syria’s tenacious pro-Hizbullah position may result in Assad’s regime
working towards arming Hizbullah with a nuclear device, Vice Premier Shimon
Peres told Israel Radio Tuesday. He said that if Iran achieves nuclear
independence, other nations in the region will be armed with nuclear
technology as well.

Iranian Nuclear Concerns Mounting in Jerusalem

Further complicating concerns in Jerusalem regarding Iranian efforts to
achieve nuclear capabilities was the recent announcement by North Korea that
it successfully tested a nuclear weapon. Israeli officials fear the
technology will make its way to Tehran, further speeding up Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s schedule vis-a-vis his country building a
nuclear weapon. Ahmadinejad has repeatedly rejected demands by the
international community and the UN to halt the nuclear program, insisting
his country plans to use nuclear technology for medical and humanitarian
purposes only.

Israeli concerns regarding Tehran are mounting as the international
community is taking a passive approach to Iran’s defiance of the
international community’s call to halt the nuclear program.

The White House has signed a law permitting sanctions against Iran but the
European Union (EU) and other nations favor diplomatic talks, leaving
America and Israel alone in their quest for more significant action. EU
Foreign Minister Javier Solana is an outspoken proponent of dialogue with
Iran, firmly opposing sanctions of any kind.

Did North Korea Test a Nuclear Device?

North Korea recently test-fired seven missiles, including the firing of a
long-range ballistic missile in July. American experts are cautiously
analyzing the North Korean declaration that a nuclear device was
successfully fired; with scientists explaining they are unconvinced that
Pyongyang has the technology to produce a nuclear weapon small enough for
the missile delivery system. That said, the Americans are unwilling to
discard the North Korean declaration, and efforts to study the data are
ongoing, in the hope of reaching a definitive conclusion regarding North
Korea’s nuclear status.

UN Security Council Condemns N. Korea, But No Sanctions

United States United Nations Ambassador John Bolton took a firm approach in
the urgent Security Council session on the matter, with America calling for
a total embargo on materials that could be used for N. Korea’s nuclear
program, as well as inspections of ingoing and ongoing cargo.

When asked if his country would back sanctions, China’s UN Ambassador Wang
Guangya stated “the door remains open for a diplomatic solution.”

The Security Council voted unanimously to condemn North Korea, with US
President George W. Bush calling the missile test a “provocative act,”
warning North Korea against efforts to export nuclear technology. America
has already warned any attack against Japan will be viewed as an attack on
the United States.

In Israel, the announcement by North Korea has brought nuclear concerns to
the forefront of the international community.

Vice Premier Peres: Economic Sanctions Would be Futile

Speaking to Army Radio on Tuesday morning, Vice Premier explained that like
North Korea, Iran is a very poor country – explaining that economic
sanctions will have little or no impact on the economy since there is
widespread hunger in any event.

Peres further explained that nuclear technology may make its way from
Southeast Asia to Iran, as well as to terrorists who may strike against
Israel. “There is a worldwide problem par excellence,” stated Peres,
emphasizing the current realities are far more comprehensive and troublesome
than just being an Israeli or regional problem.

“Even China and Russia must contemplate how they will rule over a world like
this,” added Peres, expressing concerns that nuclear technology falling in
the hands of terror organizations would destabilize the global scene,
something that cannot be permitted to occur.

Referring to Israel’s nuclear reactor in Dimona, Peres confirmed it was
constructed decades ago for “just this type of situation,” stating, “yes, it
was built as an option,” but “we do not have to wave it in the face of the
international community.”

“We must do what is necessary, but what is necessary is not more taking,”
stated Peres, who stressed while Israel does have a nuclear reactor, Israel
does not carry out nuclear weapons testing.

Jerusalem Seeking a Firm Response to Iranian Defiance

Concerns in Jerusalem are mounting, with officials looking towards the White
House for action, realizing North Korea will attempt to transfer its nuclear
technology to Iran, with officials demanding the international community
make the decision and act with increased decisiveness against Iran before it
is too late. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert with also be turning to Russian
President Vladimir Putin as well as to the European community, seeking to
impress upon them the urgency of the hour.

As a result of the recent statements released by Assad, the IDF is remaining
increasingly alert along Israel’s northern border, in line with intelligence
community warnings that the “next war” may not be too far in the future,
possibly a number of weeks or months away.
