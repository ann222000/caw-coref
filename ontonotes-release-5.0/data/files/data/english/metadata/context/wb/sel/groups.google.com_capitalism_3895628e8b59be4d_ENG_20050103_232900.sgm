In future, will everything be free? The cost of equipment keeps
falling. Doesn't it already now costs more to administrate the billing
of telephone calls than what it costs to route those calls over the
network? Doesn't it make sense to let people call for free? Doesn't
this same logic apply elsewhere?

I'd love to hear where Libertaria exactly differs from the New Economy,
as this became popular in the late 1990s. Wasn't the conclusion that
websites offering free services weren't viable?

Well, just have a look at how Google has single-handedly changed free
email by making 1G available for free, complete with forwarding, search
abilities, etc. And look at these groups! There's plenty of viability
in free services.

i dont think you get it, some things will fall in value while other
things increase, and gmail it appears free but is it, NO, you look at
adds, thus google makes a fortune off of it and just becuase you dont
pay for something doesnt make it free, it is attitudes like that which
cause the free markets to be burden by laws and regulations, it is that
attitude that leads to public abuses, it is all becuase people assume
there is a such thing as free, free only lies as an abstract term, but
for everything there is a cost, those free aol cds, cost aol money
which in turn raises the price for the service, and leads to a rise in
prices for cds becuase of the scarcity it causes.

Are you saying that if AOL supplies CDs for free, that will lead to
higher prices for CDs? That doesn't make sense. What is your problem?
