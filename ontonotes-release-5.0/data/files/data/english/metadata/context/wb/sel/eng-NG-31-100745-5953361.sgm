No, not boiling an egg dry --- the latest technology!

http://www.guardian.co.uk/food/Story/0,,1892504,00.html

Mr Rhymes, 23, dreamt up the Bulbed Egg Maker (BEM) while studying
project design at Bournemouth University. "I thought that boiling
an egg was rather labour intensive for the rewards you get," he
said.  ...

The egg is lowered into the 30cm (12in) high glass and metal
machine, which has four halogen bulbs. In six minutes it produces
an egg with a yolk runny enough for toast soldiers. The time can be
altered for a softer or harder result.

Once the egg is done the top is cut off at a circumference of 40mm
(1.5in), which Mr Rhymes, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, has
calculated is wide enough for soldiers.

He has patented the idea and is in talks with
manufacturers. "Hopefully the machine will become a common
household item like a toaster," he said.

It might be an ok device if it costs less than boiling water.  But,
the article indicates the device is less "labor" intensive.  Cripes,
how labor intensive can boiling an egg be?  You put an egg in water
and turn on the stove.  "Whew! ...I'm exhausted."  Anyway, the key
question is, how energy intensive is this device?  Halogen bulbs
aren't exactly low wattage.  In fact, most are real power suckers and
this uses 4 of them.  Also, the device is 30cm high.  That's one foot.
A one foot high machine to cook an egg?  Hopefully, you won't need to
cook more than one at a time or you'll have to build an addition to your
kitchen to house all those BEMs.

What was infinitely more interesting to me than a foot high light bulb
egg cooker was the mention of "toast soldiers".  WTF!?  Google to the
rescue.  Evidently, those crafty Brits, instead of cutting up toast in
a bowl and dumping a softboiled egg on it like I have ever since my
childhood, cut right to the chase and just pop off the top of a soft
boiled egg and dip their toast right into the egg while it's still in
the shell.  But, since a piece of toast is bigger than a soft boiled
egg, they have to cut the toast into strips that will fit into the
egg.  That strip of toast is a toast soldier.  Cute, eh?  It also
appears this is another excercise of herculian proportions and between
the boiling of the egg and the lifting of the cap on the egg, the poor
limeys are pretty near spent and have barely enough energy left to
even chew, let alone cut a piece of toast into strips.  So, to the
rescue comes the Toast Soldier Cutting Machine.  Ta-da!:

http://makeashorterlink.com/?I2F2222FD

So, there you have it.  A ninety-gazillion watt foot high egg cooker
and a toast soldier machine to help get you out the door with enough
residual energy to make it through the day doing what Brits everywhere
do, like hefting pints and sticking wickets and all that kind of
stuff.  British technology saves the day.  Here's to ya', guv'ner. ;)

Yup.

Plan A:
Saucepan:           £10
Durability:         years &amp; years
Water:              not much
Electricity or gas: not much

Plan B:
Gadget:             £100
Durability:         unknown
Halogen lamps:      £10/month
Electricity:        unknown, probably a bit more than in (2)

Being first in your town to have dry-boiled eggs?  Either "priceless"
or "who gives a fsck".  YMMV; I'll stick with a Plan A.

Well, that all depends on your definition of herculean. To my mind, using

BTW - the way to really save labour if you so wish is just to drop the egg

And just dipping the corner of a diagonally sliced piece of toast is
even easier than cutting it up.  I never understood why anyone would
bother to do that, when diagonally sliced toast can easily be dipped
into an egg sitting in an egg cup.  Or just tearing off a piece of
toast as you go.  Is it that important to have neat little strips?

Actually, it seems like a pretty good idea and soft boiled eggs are a
favorite of mine.  But, it does beg the question of how one gets all
that egg out.  The soft boiled egg with the lovely runny yolk in the
bowl can be eaten to the very last drop, the toast pieces pushed
around to sop up every little bit bit of egg and yolk.  But, how about
the egg in a shell?  No problem for the first half of the egg.  How
does that work when trying to get the remainder of the egg?  You got
some sort of small eggshell spoon/squeegie thingie or do you just
break open the egg and spoon out the rest or do you just leave it and
toss the rest un-eaten?

I've had no trouble since I was 4 or 5 years old.

Using a knife or a spoon, decapitate the egg.  Rap it firmly, far enough
down the egg that you can get your teaspoon into the egg at that point.

Take off the top.

Use your spoon to get the goodies out of the top of the egg you removed.

Dip your toast into the egg yolk, if that's your custom.

Use the spoon to scoop put the rest of the egg.  I've never had trouble
getting the spoon to scrape between the shell and the white.

It's not rocket science... do we need to post a video on utube on "how
to eat a soft boiled egg"?

&gt;&gt;&gt; childhood,

&gt;&gt;That's what we do for our very small children before they are old enough
&gt;&gt;( 1
&gt;&gt;or so) to dip their toast soldiers into the egg.

&gt;&gt;&gt;cut right to the chase and just pop off the top of a soft
&gt;&gt;&gt; boiled egg and dip their toast right into the egg while it's still in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the shell.

&gt;&gt;The egg is a perfect container, see.....why bother with messing a plate up
&gt;&gt;with egg debris ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; But, since a piece of toast is bigger than a soft boiled
&gt;&gt;&gt; egg, they have to cut the toast into strips that will fit into the
&gt;&gt;&gt; egg.  That strip of toast is a toast soldier.  Cute, eh?  It also
&gt;&gt;&gt; appears this is another excercise of herculian proportions

&gt;&gt;Well, that all depends on your definition of herculean. To my mind, using
&gt;&gt;the same knife you've just buttered your toast with to slice it into a few
&gt;&gt;strips take all of about three seconds. Of course, cutting your toast up
&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;putting it into your baby bowl, then washing that up afterwards takes a
&gt;&gt;bit
&gt;&gt;more effort.

&gt; And just dipping the corner of a diagonally sliced piece of toast is
&gt; even easier than cutting it up.  I never understood why anyone would
&gt; bother to do that, when diagonally sliced toast can easily be dipped
&gt; into an egg sitting in an egg cup.  Or just tearing off a piece of
&gt; toast as you go.  Is it that important to have neat little strips?
">

It is for kids - which is basically who toast soldiers are for. You get to
do all the actions and soldier songs as you get your kids into eating eggs.
It's all good.

Adults, on the other hand tend to just do as you say - bit it as you go so
you always have a spear point that will fit into the egg.

&gt; Actually, it seems like a pretty good idea and soft boiled eggs are a
&gt; favorite of mine.  But, it does beg the question of how one gets all
&gt; that egg out.  The soft boiled egg with the lovely runny yolk in the
&gt; bowl can be eaten to the very last drop, the toast pieces pushed
&gt; around to sop up every little bit bit of egg and yolk.  But, how about
&gt; the egg in a shell?  No problem for the first half of the egg.  How
&gt; does that work when trying to get the remainder of the egg?  You got
&gt; some sort of small eggshell spoon/squeegie thingie or do you just
&gt; break open the egg and spoon out the rest or do you just leave it and
&gt; toss the rest un-eaten?

Just use a teaspoon. Adults will dig entire parts of the egg out - white and
yolk, while kids will normally just eat the yolk.

I am from the UK.

I own chickens.

My family and I eat fresh eggs daily.

Are they normally refrigerated inside american chickens ? Should I be
refrigerating my chickens? I don't think it would work.

I'd say that a few hundred thousand years of eating fresh eggs has pretty
much proven them as a reliable food source for humans and animals. I'm
sorry, but I can't vouch for the integrity of your supply chain. Mine goes:
hen--&gt;table. Yours probably has three or four stops at least through
farmers, distribution centres, retailers etc...

What's your point ?

Guess what?  I also feed my children fresh vegetables from our fields, plus
meat  (mainly organic) from chickens, pigs and cattle grown by our family or
close friends.

What's your point ?

Describe to me the details and origin of the entire supply chain of the food
you put on your family's table and exactly how it is better than mine or
shut the fuck up.

One other comment that I couldn't resist on the somewhat dumb post above.

We do have refrigerators in the UK(and the rest of Europe). We also have
electricity, jet aircraft, telephones (both fixed and mobile), genetic
engineering and quantum physics.

Here's a link to history of the fridge for you just so you can figure it out
for yourself. Of course, we also have some rather cold weather and the
preserving properties of low temperatures have been known for a while.

You've got that right. Although I like some fresh coarse ground black pepper
with that too. And my favourite Sel de Guerande salt (of which I have sung
the praises here before)

Right now it's autumn here so this year's tomatoes are done - we're working
out way through (literally) tons of apples, pears, quinces (look it up),
plums and other tree fruits right now. Once it gets to be winter, we trim
the trees and get next year's smoking wood :-) Next year, I want to get a
fruit press so I can make some good cider. This year, it's apple pie, apple
crumble, apple sauce, quince jelly, etc...

By the way - just finished three superb ribeyes from beef (organic) raised
by our friends about a mile away. Hung until black, then grilled over oak
logs. A little S&amp;P, EVOO and some TLC... (I also have a 14lb brisket in the
freezer that will get smoke over oak and apple in the WSM next week.)

Home made fries and fresh salad.

Can't beat it.

Especially as I'm just finishing off the last of an '87 Martinez Bujanda
Grande Riserva Rioja that went particularly well.....

I hope you're having as much fun as I am.

&gt; the article indicates the device is less &quot;labor&quot; intensive.  Cripes,
&gt; how labor intensive can boiling an egg be?  You put an egg in water
&gt; and turn on the stove.  &quot;Whew! ...I'm exhausted.&quot;  Anyway, the key
&gt; question is, how energy intensive is this device?  Halogen bulbs
&gt; aren't exactly low wattage.  In fact, most are real power suckers and
&gt; this uses 4 of them.
">

Halogen bulbs are also relatively costly and don't have a very long
life... I have two desk lamps, each contains a halogen bulb, each bulb
costs like $12 and has a useful life of maybe 300 hours.  I rarely use
these lamps and when I do I try to remember to turn them off as soon as
I'm done with them... they're very good for a spot of intensely bright
light, excellent for close fine work, like removing a splinter.  If
you're not frugal with their use the 300 hours use can accumulate
rather quickly... it hurts to shell out that kind of cash for such a
puny bulb that I can really live without.  So like I said, I use those
exclusively for close fine work, good for threading a needle and fine
sewing, excellent for cleaning out pupik lint from your mouse.

I haven't actually seen one but from the description this egg cooker
thingie sure sounds like a contraption that nobody needs.

&gt; Also, the device is 30cm high.  That's one foot.
&gt; A one foot high machine to cook an egg?  Hopefully, you won't need to
&gt; cook more than one at a time or you'll have to build an addition to your
&gt; kitchen to house all those BEMs.

&gt; What was infinitely more interesting to me than a foot high light bulb
&gt; egg cooker was the mention of &quot;toast soldiers&quot;.  WTF!?  Google to the
&gt; rescue.  Evidently, those crafty Brits, instead of cutting up toast in
&gt; a bowl and dumping a softboiled egg on it like I have ever since my
&gt; childhood, cut right to the chase and just pop off the top of a soft
&gt; boiled egg and dip their toast right into the egg while it's still in
&gt; the shell.  But, since a piece of toast is bigger than a soft boiled
&gt; egg, they have to cut the toast into strips that will fit into the
&gt; egg.  That strip of toast is a toast soldier.  Cute, eh?  It also
&gt; appears this is another excercise of herculian proportions and between
&gt; the boiling of the egg and the lifting of the cap on the egg, the poor
&gt; limeys are pretty near spent and have barely enough energy left to
&gt; even chew, let alone cut a piece of toast into strips.  So, to the
&gt; rescue comes the Toast Soldier Cutting Machine.  Ta-da!:

&gt; http://makeashorterlink.com/?I2F2222FD

&gt; So, there you have it.  A ninety-gazillion watt foot high egg cooker
&gt; and a toast soldier machine to help get you out the door with enough
&gt; residual energy to make it through the day doing what Brits everywhere
&gt; do, like hefting pints and sticking wickets and all that kind of
&gt; stuff.  British technology saves the day.  Here's to ya', guv'ner. ;)

Offense is like poison, it only does harm if taken.  You are too ready
to take offense.  And as a result, you over react when no offense was
intended.

And then you add fuel to the fire with offensive language.

Now then, since you've asked nicely, I'll explain my comment about the
unrefrigerated eggs.  And I hope you will learn to ask questions before
spewing obscenities next time.

A year or two ago we were swapping some recipes in another usenet
forum.  One less prone to flame wars and casual rudeness.  And I
mentioned an episode of the detective television show "Nero Wolfe" where
he and his assistant Archie were hiding in one of Archie's lady friends
homes.  In return for hiding them, Nero (a gourmand) offered to cook the
lady scrambled eggs for breakfast, opining that she did not know the
proper way to cook them.  He asked her for 40 minutes notice before
breakfast.  She was incredulous.  He cackled something to the effect of,
"I KNEW you didn't know the proper way to cook scrambled eggs!"

I did some research and found a recipe like the one he was using and
shared it with the group.  The eggs are cooked slowly in a double
boiler.  It takes about 20 minutes and delivers a richer, eggier taste
than frying them.  The other 20 minutes?  Letting the eggs come to room
temperature.

The prompted a question from one of the polite residents of the British
Isles as to why the eggs weren't already at room temperature.  It took
about a week to sort out that in the USA eggs are ALWAYS refrigerated,
from egg to consumer and in the consumer's home... up to the minute they
are cooked.  And that in the U.K, refrigerated eggs are all but unheard
of.  "Eggs at the store are stamped with the date they are laid, so I
know how fresh they are, and refrigerating eggs absolutely ruins them"
explained one of the British regulars in the newsgroup.  Americans
were... dumbfounded.  They couldn't believe it, because Americans have
been told that eggs are dangerous, full of dangerous microorganisms that
will breed and ruin the eggs if the eggs aren't refrigerated.  The idea
of unrefrigerated eggs was greeted with the same level of acceptance as
the idea of drinking raw sewage as a health drink.  This is perhaps in
part because the supply chain from hen to kitchen is best measured in
months in most of the USA.  Egg production is largely centralized,
leading to delays through various levels of transportation and wholesalers.

I've tried since to get some friends who raise chickens to let me have
some raw eggs... and they just couldn't bring themselves to do it.  In
their eyes, it was WRONG.

I was trying to tweak some of the Americans in the forum.  I had no idea
that a rude Brit with a hair trigger would explode.

Years before that, in another forum.... an American woman was relating a
story about when she was living on the eastern seaboard of the USA.  Her
husband was in the merchant marines.  Her neighbor was an Australian
whose husband was also in the merchant marines.  As a result, they spent
months at a time without their husbands.  So, they became friends.  And
then they became best of friends, all but inseparable.  And they
decided, since they were both into food, to prepare for each other
typical meals of their homeland.  The American woman went first.  She
started with a nice salad and a harvest vegetable soup.  For the next
course, she brought out a Smithfield ham.  She brought the next course
out, and the Australian woman took one look at it and left.  She
wouldn't even talk to her American friend.

The American lady was distraught.  We all lose friends, but she had NO
IDEA what had happened.  They were good enough friends almost anything
should be forgivable.  The Australian totally snubbed the American.
Finally, the American burst into the Australian's house in tears and
said, "I know I must have hurt you terribly, but I don't know what I
did.  Losing you as a friend is one of the worst things that has ever
happened - but now knowing WHY is just intolerable.  If you'll at least
tell me what I did, maybe I can come to terms with it.  Please, if you
never speak another word to me, at least tell me what I did."

The Australian woman all but spat the words, "YOU SERVED ME *ANIMAL FOOD*!"

The American woman just couldn't believe it.  "I didn't.  All I brought
out was the ham and freshly steamed corn on the cob.'

"ANIMAL FOOD!"

It seems that in Australia corn is animal fodder.  And to serve animal
fodder to a person is a grievous insult.  However, in the USA, fresh
corn on the cob (a different variety than is fed to animals) is
considered a great delicacy.  The poor man's asparagus if you will.

It took some talking to pour oil on the waters.  And I don't know if the
Aussie every actually tried the corn.  Her loss if not.

But the point of the stories is.... ask questions before becoming rude.
There's always time for rudeness later if you think rudeness ever solved
anything... a thesis I can not agree with.

Fair enough, Mike - although your original post came across to me as a quick
jibe about Brits, rather than a tweak to Americans. I apologise if I didn't
take it in the spirit it was intended and resorted to rudeness in error. I
lived in the US for a year when I was younger, and one time I went to a
friend's family's house for dinner. His sister asked me if I would like some
more milk to which I replied that I would. She asked me to get it from the
fridge, and told me in all seriousness "That's the big white thing in the
corner of the room. It's for keeping food cold." She really thought us Brits
didnt have domestic appliances and pretty much all lived in thatched
cottages with no electricity or running water.

In any case, your points below are valid - and in my opinion, eggs shouldn't
be refrigerated as it does impact the taste. As posted, I get mine from my
garden, but store bought eggs are individually date stamped and are not
chilled either.

My recipe for scrambled egg takes about 20 mins too. I don't use a double
boiler, just a good heavy cast iron saucepan, but the secret to perfect
scrambled eggs in my opinion is to cook them absolutely as slowly as
possible. Have the heat on as low as it will possibly go and stir
continuously, then take them off the heat a few minutes before they are
properly done as they will continue to cook. Fresh eggs, fresh full fat
milk, good salted butter, S&amp;P....

As for the corn, good grilled corn is one of my favourites and always gets
cooked alongside ribs or ham in our house. However the French also consider
it animal food. Just goes to show - different things offend different people
for different reasons.

Hmmm... it's been a while since I saw that episode.  I thought she was
one of Archie's lady friends.

Perhaps he ejaculated with the joy of having been proven right.

As to gourmet/gourmand, with him it would be hard to draw the line.  His
corpulence suggests that there were certainly gourmand recipes.  Many,
if not most, gourmets are happy with small amounts, tastes.  Nero Wolfe
went well beyond that, and certainly did in the television portrayal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You feed a one-year-old child raw egg yolk?

&gt; I own chickens.

&gt; My family and I eat fresh eggs daily.

&gt; Are they normally refrigerated inside american chickens ? Should I be

&gt; I'd say that a few hundred thousand years of eating fresh eggs has

&gt; at least through farmers, distribution centres, retailers etc...

&gt; What's your point ?

&gt; Guess what?  I also feed my children fresh vegetables from our fields,
&gt; plus meat  (mainly organic) from chickens, pigs and cattle grown by our
&gt; family or close friends.

&gt; What's your point ?

No need to get so defensive. If you know your eggs are safe, then
