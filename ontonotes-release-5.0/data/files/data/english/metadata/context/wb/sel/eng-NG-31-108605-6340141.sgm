Sincere apologies for polluting this newsgroup with an actual naval
question, naval questions seem to be meeting with silence more
regularly these days than they get replied to, but here goes.

Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound, First Sea lord, etc.etc. etc.
wore a single ribbon on his right breast.  Only person I can call to
mind doing so in the RN.  Anyone have an idea what that ribbon was -
and why he wore it where he did?

There seems to be little on Pound on the web - and even in whatever
literature I have.

You don't wear any of those on the right breast.  Anyway the ribbon
doesn't fit any of those.

Some pictures show what seems to be a single

Medal, which used to be worn on the right.  It's
now worn on the left as usual.

Civilian orders and decorations,  and some foreign medals are worn on that
side.

Did he get a Polar Medal?

That was sometimes worn (with permission) on that side by naval officers of
the period as it's not usually considered a 'military' decoration and he was
around at the time of the big polar expeditions at the turn of the century.

It could be a Soviet one,  although I think those decorations weren't handed
out until after his death.

Certainly three gentleman I knew didn't get theirs until about 1986...

I wish I could get a decent photograph showing it well - most of the

photos of Roger Keyes - who also has a ribbon on his right breast.

I have to disagree; - the black &amp; white photo's I've seen on 'Google
Images', that show him 'full-face' , do indicate a medal-ribbon style
decoration on his right breast. At maximum magnifcation on my pc, this
ribbon 'seems' to have  a _horizontal _ darker line against a lighter
monochrome background. [ Normally medal ribbons have 'vertical' lines].
I've tried squinting at the ribbons on his left breast and trying the 'OK,
that muddy grey is pink; so that muddy grey must be pinl/blue/green .... to
no avail.  BTW; yer'd think 'Time ' magazinecould've stretched to CYMK when
they were using those inks for the titles :(

I note that Sir  Dudley Pounds bio' notes refer to ???? in the Spanish
Civil War - I've not found anything specific - ; _if_, and it's a big _if_,
the ribbon does denote a 'Foreign' award - could it be 'Spanish'?

Going through my "what every boy should know about medals" booklet
(courtesy Spink &amp; Co.) the closest British ribbon that seems to make
sense is the Naval Long Service Medal.  But I would assume that should
be worn in a fairly standard way and not on the right breast.

Found another shot of Pound - taken at the Casablanca conference.
Unfortunately the sun is making _all_ his medal ribbons look white....

&gt;&gt; Going through my &quot;what every boy should know about medals&quot; booklet

But why the right breast?

Given the legendary orientation of a prominent Chinese feature,
"thwartships" instead of "fore and aft", perhaps decorations for China
service should be right-breasted.

My departed Pa's lavish Chinese (KMT) decoration came with a ribbon, but the
medal itself, coffee saucerish in size, came with a fancy "around the neck"
hanging affair.  I'd like to find pictorial representation of Nationalist
Chinese decorations of the 1945 era to evaluate how far up the ladder his
came.  Any advice, sites, etc. would be appreciated...

I long ago gave up on redeeming his heavy sheaf of "Chinese Customs Gold
Units", but the crudely engraved aluminum highball glasses made from C-46
and C-47 cowlings are quaint.

His only two tales of the war deserve a forum here, the first being called
upon to provide a stiffening tot for a C-47 aircrew after they landed to
discover that when ordered to "lighten ship" after problems crossing the
Hump, the KMT Lieutenant in the cabin had marched a squad of his troops out
the freight hatch (at high altitude, sans chutes) and saved the freight.

The other occurred during Japan's 1945 offensive to capture USAAF bomber
bases.  After spending long hours surgically repairing a number of Chinese
and Japanese wounded after an engagement, the small field hospital (Chinese
Army) he commanded was forced to retreat along with the division it served,
leaving tents, wounded, etc., behind.

Three days later, the Chinese reoccupied the site, not unexpectedly to find
that the dastardly Nips had bayoneted the Chinese wounded.  Dad understood
that sort of transgression of the customs and mores of civilized tribes by
the Japanese, but was shocked to find that they had bayoneted their own
wounded before retreating.

For the rest of his life, he was not an ardent purchases of Japanese
products, nor would he travel to or through Japan.  I'm sorry he's not here
to see the latest Japanese "thing", once again denying that their troops had
drafted Korean women and others into military brothels.  Dad used to claim
that the Japanese did less of it in China, since most of the conscriptable
young women ended up dead, mutilated or permanently disabled after the
passage of the first wave of Japanese troops, so that the rear echelon had
few available brothel staff to recruit.

Anyone have access to this publication? The review calls it an
autobiography, probably it isn't. The review makes the book sound
technical enough to have either a list of Pound's medals or a picture
of him wearing them.

CHURCHILL'S ANCHOR: ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET SIR DUDLEY POUND, OM, GCG,
GCVO. by Robin. Churchill) (Pound) Brodhurst (Hardcover - 2000)

This is the first autobiography of Admiral of the Fleet, Sir Dudley
Pound, First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy between July 1939 and August
1943. If you don't know the fate of the British ships ABOUKIR, HOGUE,
and CRECY in August 1914, this book may not be for you. If you don't
know what the difference between a battlecruiser and a battleship,
skip it.

However, if you are reasonably well read about the history of the
Royal Navy in the first half of the 20th century, I very much
recommend this book. It provides a sound treatment of Admiral Pound
entire career, an excellent commentary on high level decision making
at the Admiralty during the critical defensive and first offensive
phases of WWII, and good look at wartime political issues involving
and dividing the Admiralty and the British government. It also
provides insights into British Naval policy during WWI and during the
inter-war years.

Most of the well known WWII controversies involving the Royal Navy are
covered; From the botched Norwegian campaign, to the attack on the
French fleet at Oran, the anti-U-boat war, the firings of Admirals
North, Godfrey and Forbes, Force Z, the almost criminal withholding of
British shore-based aircraft support to the navy, the channel dash by
SCHARNHORST and GNEISENAU, and the scattering of convoy PQ17. The
author's interpretations are based on research into Admiral Pound's
papers in various archives, interviews with the Pound family members,
review and analysis of accounts by witnesses to wartime decision
making processes at the Admiralty, and thorough study of the politics
of the Royal Navy.

The author of the book, Robin Broadhurst, comes across as a Pound
admirer, although he certainly is not one sided in his praise. The
Broadhurst emphasizes Pound's absolute professional dedication to the
Navy, and shows that he was very aggressive in training squadrons and
fleets between the wars, stressing the importance of taking calculated
risks even in peacetime training. These risks included training for
night actions and the use of aircraft of shadow enemy formations. They
helped to establish the aggressive character of the Royal Navy during
WWII. Broadhurst gives Pound credit for being aware of the potential
usefulness of airplanes to support the fleet as early as 1914, for
being a strong advocate of expansion of the Fleet Air Arm while
serving at the Admiralty in 1928, and emphasizes that he was fully
aware of the Royal Navy's poor performance at anti-aircraft fire in
1939.

Broadhurst has reasonable responses to the many criticisms of Pound as
First Sea Lord put forth during and after WWII. He blames Churchill
more than Pound for the confusion of the Norwegian campaign, arguing
that while orders from the Admiralty to ships at sea cutting across
existing lines of authority may have been signed by Pound, they
usually implemented Churchill's ideas.

The author emphasizes that the attack of the French fleet, although
supported by Pound, was a political decision made by the War Cabinet
which may well have been politically correct at the time, even if it
was opposed then and later by many officers of the British Navy. He
also points out that Force Z was itself a political decision - in this
case a bluff, strongly opposed by Pound. As for the channel dash,
Broadhurst lays the principal blame for the German escape on the RAF,
and approves of Pound's refusal to risk a British capital ship in the
channel to block the escape.

On the other hand, Broadhurst blames Pound's failure to properly use
the intelligence information provided him for his disastrous decision
regarding PQ17. In fact, according to the author, Pounds principal
operational shortcomings were a failure to make proper use of Naval
Intelligence and a failure to make proper use of his staff. Broadhurst
argues convincingly that Pound did not delegate enough until late in
his term of office, and that under the burden of overwork, sometimes
simply made the wrong decisions. The author also argues that the
frequency of interference in Naval operations at sea by orders from
the Admiralty - whether right or wrong - created problems for many
Royal Naval officers, to the point of causing some to refuse commands
at sea.

Broadhurst gives very high credit to Pound as someone who was able to
manage Churchill, while still successfully fighting the Royal Navy's
side when the big decisions had to be made. The title "Churchill's
Anchor" reflects the authors view that Pound managed to constrain many
of Churchill's wilder ideas by intelligent procrastination, while
still managing to get things done.

Churchill was not Pound's only burden. Pound also had to fight off
interference from several prominent figures from the World War I Royal
Navy, including Admirals Keys and Dreyer, and from the upstart
Churchill favorite Mountbatten. If that wasn't enough, at various time
he also had to fight Admiral King of the United States Navy, Portal at
the Air Ministry, Sir Arthur Harris of Bomber Command, and during much
of 1942, even the hostile lobbying of the Russian Ambassador.

For fun, the author occasionally lashes out at Roskill's official
history of the British Navy in World War II, especially his claim that
Pound was physically unfit in 1939. Broadhurst feels that Roskill had
some perceived wrongs to right which biased the official history.
Along the way, he also takes a few swipes at Churchill's "Second World
War" and Barnett's "Engage the Enemy More Closely". Altogether,
"Churchill's Anchor" is an enjoyable and informative book for anyone
with the right background.

&gt;portrait of the Admiral of the Fleet. Frustratingly; he doesn't favour us
&gt;with the right breast ribbon!].

Frustratingly I cannot identify a single ribbon on that picture with
certainty.  The top three should be Order of the Bath (Crimson ribbon
- looks too red to me), Order of Merit (Blue and Red) and Royal
Victorian Order (thin red- white-red either side with a large chunk of
blue in the middle ).

Yes.  Somewhere in simplistic slogans, have to work out
reasonable middle ground around "forgive and forget".

The initial plan, implemented at the direction of President Roosevelt as a
promise to China and called Operation Matterhorn, was to use B-29s to attack
Japan from four forward bases in southern China, with five main bases in
India, and to attack other targets in the region from China and India as
needed. The Chengdu region was eventually chosen over the Guilin region to
avoid having to raise, equip, and train fifty Chinese divisions to protect
the advanced bases from Japanese ground attack. The XX Bomber Command,
initially intended to be two combat wings of four groups each, was reduced
to a single wing of four groups because of the lack of availability of
aircraft, automatically limiting the effectiveness of any attacks from
China.

This was an extremely costly scheme, as there was no overland connection
available between India and China, and all the supplies had to be flown over
the Himalayas. B-29s started to arrive in India in early April 1944. The
first B-29 flight to airfields in China (over the Himalayas, or "The Hump")
took place on 24 April 1944. The first B-29 combat mission was flown on 5
June 1944, with 77 out of 98 planes launched from India bombing the railroad
shops in Bangkok (Five B-29s were lost to non-combat causes).

On 15 June 1944, 47 B-29s launched from Chengdu in China bombed the Imperial
Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, Japan. This was the first attack on Japanese
islands since the Doolittle raid in April 1942. The first B-29 combat loss
occurred during this raid, with one B-29 destroyed on the ground by Japanese
fighters after an emergency landing. Because of the extreme cost of
operations, the raids against Japan from Chinese airfields continued at
relatively low intensity. Japan was bombed on: 7 July 1944 (14 B-29s), 29
July (70+), 10 August (24), 20 August (61), 8 September (90), 26 September
(83), 25 October (59), 12 November (29), 21 November (61), 19 December (36)
and for the last time on 6 January 1945 (49). B-29s were withdrawn from
airfields in China by the end of January 1945. Throughout this period B-29
raids were also launched from China and India against many other targets
throughout Southeast Asia. However, the entire B-29 effort was gradually
shifted to the new bases in the Marianas, with the last B-29 combat mission
from India flown on 29 March 1945.

The need to use inconvenient bases in China for attacks against Japan ceased
after the capture of the Marianas islands in 1944.

and

On the afternoon of 15 June, seventy-five Superfortresses at the Chinese
fields around Chengtu made ready to take off for Japan. Following a fiery
crash and ten more aborts on or after takeoff, sixty-four planes headed for
Japan. At their head was the "Postville Express," piloted by Major Humphrey
and carrying Brig. Gen. Laverne G. Saunders, the strike commander. Aboard
the planes were eleven American war correspondents and photographers, making
this among the most heavily covered missions of the war.

In the black night over the target, speared by searchlight beams, fewer than
fifty of the B-29s found their target. No significant damage to the steel
works, known as "the Pittsburgh of Japan," resulted. Seven B-29s were lost;
among the casualties was Newsweek's correspondent. Although little physical
damage resulted, the Yawata raid made clear to Japan the growing danger from
America's strategic bombers.

And that danger would grow exponentially. One reason Arnold gave for the
importance of a 15 June raid was that it would help distract Japan's leaders
from another threat. That same day Saipan, the first target of American
amphibious forces in the Marianas, was invaded. B-29 operations from India
and China would soon be phased out in lieu of operations from the Marianas.
