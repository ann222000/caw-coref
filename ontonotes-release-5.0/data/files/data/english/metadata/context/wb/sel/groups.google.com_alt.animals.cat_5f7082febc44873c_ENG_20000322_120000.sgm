I have read that this can be done and would be a dream come true. If
anyone has any stories on their own results that would be great. TIA

I spent my first few weeks with my new kitten taking it outside and
scratching at the ground like a cat would...He caught on straight away and
did his business and then covered it nicely...So if you don't mind looking
like a spaz infront of your neighbours....Well, it worked for me anyhow.
