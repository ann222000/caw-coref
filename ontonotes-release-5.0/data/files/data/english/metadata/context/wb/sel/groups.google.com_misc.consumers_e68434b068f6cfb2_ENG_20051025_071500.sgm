Well here is an interesting one. Apparently there is an issue with Rubio's
Fresh Mexican Grill serving fake lobster in their so called lobster
burritos. The restaurant chain seems to have used langostinos instead of
real lobster. If you check out
https://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/fake_lobster_classaction  they
have information this as well as a free case evaluation provided for those
who may want to put in a complaint. I found this of interest and thought you
might as well.

peoples food&quot; 'cause the rich people ate beef. The lobster meat is so
delicate, and so light of taste, that only freshly-drawn butter was used,
and it was eaten without anything else.

Later I became a cook, and learned that crustaceans are related, so that
the shrimp etoufee I prepared could also be prepared with lobster, crawfish,

But a burrito? It's spicy. It's beef, pork, or chicken. But I've never
ordered (and never would) a lobster burrito anymore than I would an oyster
burrito. Just doesn't fit.

So what's the beef? a crustacean is a crustacean. I defy anyone to taste

They should have used the fake crab. It tastes just as good, has more bulk,
is sterilized, and no one can taste the difference anyway - in fact I prefer
it - but not in a burrito. Serve recycled Goodyear tires in a burrito.

In fact I question the taste buds of anyone who would order any burrito
expecting a culinary delight. Their taste buds were probably shot off in
the last Mexican war.

Not too long ago, a reader inquired as to the differences between
shrimps, crayfish, langoustines and lobsters. I responded that it was
tempting to say that she had &quot;opened a bag of worms&quot; but the truth was
that she had indeed opened quite a bag of decapods (crustaceans with
ten legs) for the problem is that by whatever name, crayfish (or
crawfish as they are often called in the United States), shrimps,
prawns, langoustes and the langoustines, all of which are edible
decapods, are names that are used too loosely by most chefs, critics
and cooks. Following is a bit of clarification and a few recipes.

Crayfish are fresh water decapods. Even though they resemble spiny
lobsters they are smaller. Close cousins perhaps, but no more.
Crayfish in French are ecrivesses. Be there no question but that the
best crayfish dishes in the world are served in the state of
Louisiana.

Langoustines are closely related to the crayfish but are salt water
decapods. Even though the word langoustine is French, it is used in
English as well because true langoustines do not exist in North
America. One happy bit of news is that recipes calling for crayfish or
langoustines can be used interchangeably. The meat of both are
delicious, but you will find that crayfish are somewhat lighter and
more puffy on the palate and it is that trait that makes them so
highly prized throughout france.

To add a bit of confusion, prawns, which are very closely related to
shrimps but are not (as is commonly thought) merely &quot;large shrimps&quot;
are also called langoustines in French. That is not so much an error
(especially on menus) as it is an attempt to give prawns a somewhat
higher &quot;status&quot;.

Shrimps, which are salt water creatures are called crevettes in
French. Some fresh water shrimps also exist but these are not highly
prized in the culinary world.

As to lobsters themselves - these salt water creatures come in two
general varieties - the spiny lobster (common in France) and the
smooth shelled lobster (North America, South Africa, etc). Although
smooth shelled lobsters are always called homard in French, the spiny
lobster can be referred to as either langouste or homard).

"/> And actually I should have been clearer. I also can taste the difference if
the seafood is &quot;au naturale,&quot; without any other flavors inteferring. But a
burrito would (presumably, I don't know the exact ingredients) have cheese,
onions, refried beans, chile sauce, whatever. The seafood would have the
least impact on the taste. I've also served oyster sandwiches (a la New
Orleans style) so there one gets to taste the oysters, and I 'm unsure about
what would be in an oyster burrito.

"/> A supposedly respected food critic recommended a local chain of Mexican seafood
restaurants -- high quality, reasonable prices, fabulous service, etc.
Unfortunately, nothing on the menu indicated that the scallops were the little
imitation ones that are instantly recognizable because they're rolled up flat
stuff rather than little solid chunks, and they were lukewarm by the time they
got to us. They taste OK, but are way cheaper than real scallops.

Only explanation is that the critic was paid off. Fish come in four flavors:
scallop, shrimp, non-fishy (halibut) and fishy (everything else that lives
underwater). Unfortunately most of them seem to be fishy.

"/> Bill's Fajitas

Put a pound or so of skirt steak, stuck with a fork a hundred times, into a
ziplock with 2 cups of red wine, garlic (may use powder for this) oregano,
lime juice, coriander, pepper. (Experiment with paprika, etc.) Marinate
overnight.

Fry in a hot grill pan, in olive oil, until well charred on the outside,
but, when pierced with a fork still has red juices running. Take out and
put aside for 20 minutes.

In another pan, saute, in butter and olive oil, a yellow onion, at low heat,
for an hour until caramelized. Add a green pepper, raise heat, and saute
until wilted.

In the grill pan deglaze with sherry. If a sauce is wanted, add olive oil
and flour to make a roux, add beef stock and boil then simmer to thicken.

Cut the steak into strips, place in the grill pan, turn up the heat, add the
onions and peppers, stir together.

Place on hotpad on the table, served with heated flour tortillas.

Henry's Salsa

In a Cuisenart place a Jalapeno pepper (sliced to check for worms) a bunch
of fresh cilantro, a red onion, some six or five garlic cloves, coriander
seed, whatever, and the juice from a large can of diced tomatoes. Chop
until fine. Add the chopped tomatoes and just stir in. Serve with flour
tortillas that have been cut into four parts and toasted with olive oil.

I use no salt but you can add Kosher (no iodine) salt. If you want to cheat
like some restaurants do, you can use Adolph's Meat Tenderizer in the
marinade (watch the time) and Bisto for the sauce. You can also get a can
of refried beans to fix a pothole in the driveway.

&gt;&gt; Poor baby, you obviously live a long way from Mexico. The fake crab is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact I question the taste buds of anyone who would order any burrito
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expecting a culinary delight. Their taste buds were probably shot off in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the last Mexican war.

&gt;&gt; Again, poor baby...

&gt;&gt;&gt; Apparently you've never had a really good pastrami burrito..now
&gt;&gt;&gt; *there's* a gastronomic treat..just stay diownwind of your friends for
&gt;&gt;&gt; a day or so..but gods theyare good.

&gt;&gt; The essential burrito: meat (optional), refried beans, green chiles,
&gt;&gt; cheese, onions, salsa, black olives and sour cream, all wrapped in a warm
&gt;&gt; flour tortilla. Rice and lettuce are abominations and should be
&gt;&gt; considered adulterants.

&gt;&gt; If you make them yourself, avoid the temptation to lay a lot of everything
&gt;&gt; on the tortilla -- when you roll it up you'll need a waterproof baggie to
&gt;&gt; keep the guts from dribbling out the far end.

&gt; Bill's Fajitas

&gt; Put a pound or so of skirt steak, stuck with a fork a hundred times, into a
&gt; ziplock with 2 cups of red wine, garlic (may use powder for this) oregano,
&gt; lime juice, coriander, pepper. (Experiment with paprika, etc.) Marinate
&gt; overnight.

&gt; Fry in a hot grill pan, in olive oil, until well charred on the outside,
&gt; but, when pierced with a fork still has red juices running. Take out and
&gt; put aside for 20 minutes.

&gt; In another pan, saute, in butter and olive oil, a yellow onion, at low heat,
&gt; for an hour until caramelized. Add a green pepper, raise heat, and saute
&gt; until wilted.

&gt; In the grill pan deglaze with sherry. If a sauce is wanted, add olive oil
&gt; and flour to make a roux, add beef stock and boil then simmer to thicken.

&gt; Cut the steak into strips, place in the grill pan, turn up the heat, add the
&gt; onions and peppers, stir together.

&gt; Place on hotpad on the table, served with heated flour tortillas.

Because of taste differences I don't put cayenne in my Tex-Mex, but put
bottles of Original Tabasco, Tabasco Chipolte, Sriracha, Tony Chacheri's
&quot;More Spice&quot; and I think Chalupa Sauce (from Mexico, with the wood
top -don't have any now) Tapatio, and even Crystal for creole and cajun
dishes.

Anyway, we got far away from the subject of lobster burritos, and my
contention that I don't know how anyone could taste lobster in a burrito
with all of the other stuff (refried beans, green chiles, cheese, onions,
salsa, black olives and sour cream) anyway. But what the heck. It's a free
country. Anyway, if one gets a &quot;lobster&quot; burrito with fake crab, you are
more likely to taste that than real lobster. But as someone said, it's the
price difference. I think if I saw a lobster burrito that cost less than
$12.00 or so, I would be suspicious, but I would still never order one.

But, hey, that's just me!

Husband cooks raw pinto beans as a diet staple, and they're absolutely
tasteless unless you add something that has some taste to them. I don't see
why they need to be fried twice -- just running them through the blender with
a reasonable amount of water ought to do the trick. Rosarita has fat-free
refried beans, but the 'spicy' ones are lots better and don't really have all
that much fat anyway.

What a bargain, and you even get JEWELRY with it!

Tabasco and Tapatio are good, jalapeno tabasco is better. Have you ever tried
the Asian sweet-hot chile sauce? Two varieties, for chicken and for spring
rolls. Many brands. The chicken stuff is better. It's extremely sweet and
thick, and very good. Got Asian stores where you are? An incredible variety
of hot sauces is available.
