&gt; Hire car at centre of battle to establish scientific evidence
&gt; Steve Bird in Praia da Luz
&gt; London Times

&gt; The silver Renault Mégane used by the McCanns has become pivotal to the
&gt; investigation into Madeleine's disappearance.

&gt; Mr and Mrs McCann have travelled in the the seven-seat rental car to press
&gt; conferences, Portimao police station and their villa. A month earlier, it
&gt; was seized and searched by police in an underground car park.

&gt; Traces of hair and bodily fluid discovered 25 days after Madeleine's
&gt; disappearance led police to believe that the McCanns had transported her
&gt; corpse to a new hiding place. But forensic science experts claim that
&gt; pro-cedural errors may have compromised the search for evidence.

&gt; Friends and family had used the car, including Mr McCann's sister, Trish
&gt; Cameron, and her husband, Sandy.

&gt; During this time it could have come into contact with a large quantity of
&gt; material that could be linked to Madeleine. The car contained toys she had
&gt; played with and a piece of clothing used to dab a cut caused as she
&gt; climbed the stairs to board the plane to Portugal. Cross-contamination
&gt; from hair
&gt; and skin, among other things, appears to be inevitable.

&gt; The vehicle would have picked up genetic material from holidaymakers using
&gt; it before the McCanns rented it and some have wondered whether it was
&gt; previously used by her abductor.

&gt; According to Portuguese newspapers police only recently obtained a list
&gt; from the rental company, Budget, showing who had used the car before the
&gt; McCanns.

&gt; Police have been criticised for handing the car back to the couple, and
&gt; for isolating an underground car park rather than taking it to a specially
&gt; designed garage for scientific inspection, indicating limited experience
&gt; of preserving a crime scene.

&gt; Mr and Mrs McCann have chosen to keep the car and hire their own forensic
&gt; science team to inspect it, spending some £5,000 on its rental.

The McCanns hired the Renault from Budget 24 days after Maddie vanished on
May 3.

Portuguese police have become suspicious about the number of miles on the
car's mileometer.

In the seven days between May 27 - when the Renault Scenic was first rented
in Portimao - and June 3 when the McCanns' first contract lapsed, the car
travelled 450 miles.

The couple pointed out to investigators that the car did many runs to Faro
airport, 55 miles away. They emphasised that they flew to Rome to meet the
Pope on May 29, returning the next day, and that they then departed for
Madrid on May 31.

They also told police that friends and family had access to the car while
they were away - and that it was used to ferry relatives to and from Faro.

But despite what the McCanns have presented as an innocent explanation
behind the distances, Portuguese police have asked Budget to provide all
details of the vehicle's mileage.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that those records show that between June 3
and July 3, the car travelled a further 1,256 miles.

Further trips to airports in Lisbon and Faro to pick up relatives and
deposit the McCanns for a trip to Germany have been presented as a
justification for the high mileage.

How the hell does the car's mileage evidence murder?

That's ridiculous.  65 miles a day is not much.
