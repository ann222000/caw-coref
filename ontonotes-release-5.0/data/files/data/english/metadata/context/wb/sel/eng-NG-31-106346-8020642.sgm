Child safety seats in unsupported vehicles?

We are getting ready to take a vacation out in Washington and British
Columbia.  Child seats are an issue, because we have two toddlers.
Originally we thought of trying to take our child seats along on the plane,
because sometimes it takes quite a bit of time and effort to figure out a
new child seat.  We assumed we would be using a rental car.  We are using
those $40 round trip airplane tickets for the trip. ($40 includes all taxes
and fees)

However, then I discovered Craigslist, and the fact that Seattle and
Vancouver have thousands of used cars available.  We are also at the point
where we would like a larger vehicle for our growing family - either a van
or station wagon.  The cars out on the West coast usually don't have rust
like they do here, so we are thinking about flying out and getting a used
car that would meet our needs better, then drive back across Canada.

Anyway, this whole thing has made me think about seat belts and child
seats a lot more.

I know that on an older car that doesn't even HAVE seat belts, the law
can't require you to wear them. (since they are, in fact, nonexistent on the
vehicle)

That got me to thinking about other vehicles we have looked at:

1) 1970's camper van - with no seat belts whatsoever other than the front
two seats

2) Cargo van - with no seats at all, except for front two

3) Older vehicle without seat belts, or any way to fasten child safety seat

How does the law apply to these?  My grandpa has one of those 1970's
camper vans, for example.  There is just no way to secure a child safety
seat, but there are plenty of cushioned seats for people to sit on.  Can
they issue a ticket if they see kids without child safety seats, or adults
without seat belts on?

What about a cargo van?  It's obviously safer than riding in the back of a
pickup truck, but again, no sealt belts other than the front two seats, and
no way that I can think of for securing the child safety seats. (maybe there
is a simple way I'm missing?)

I don't know about you but I wouldn't be inclined to buy a car of
unknown reliability and then drive thousands of miles with small
children. All the issues of buying a used car compounded by the
fact that you're out of your own territory and have limited time.

Do you care what happens to your family in an accident? If you answer
YES then you will run away from older cars in general and ones without
safety equipment especially.

Yes, you could strap your children to the hood like deer and let them
be the first to notify you of an accident by spreading their blood
over your windshield.

Now, I can't say for certain that this is a troll but it's got all the
right elements. A provocative and insane question right up there with
&quot;How do I cook these beans that came from a bulging can?&quot;

No, no, no. It's &quot;How do I cook these beans IN the bulging can they came
in?&quot;

Remember? This is the same guy who a few weeks ago wanted to know about
insuring a $600 car he planned to buy at his destination. Bizarre as it
sounded, it didn't sound like a troll, just like somebody with a combination
of stinginess, immature lack of concern for his family's safety, and no
common sense.

Of course, people my age and older survived childhood before the advent of
child car seats and even safety belts. But why anyone would choose
transportation that doesn't accommodate the best that's currently available
for the safety of toddlers and small children is simply beyond me.

Then again, people bludgeon their kids to death all the time, so what do I
know?

Of course, silly, which was why I got on here asking this question.
That's also why I drive slow, very little at night, and I never drink
alcohol.  I also minimize my driving by combining trips, so that I don't
have to do much local driving at all.

However, I don't support the concept of a &quot;nanny state&quot; telling all of us
what to do, any more than I do big brother.  When it comes to this sort of
thing, I'm a libertarian.  I feel that each family should be able to decide
what level of risk they are comfortable with.

I don't think the government should be in the business of telling people
if they can drink, smoke, take drugs, skydive, have sex, what speed they can
drive, etc.  Nor should it be able to tell people they have to wear a
seatbelt if they want to take the risk of not wearing one.  Next thing you
know, they'll be telling the Amish they can't ride horses any more.

The main thing I was mentioning was that some vehicles simply don't have
an easy way at all to add something like a child safety seat.  As such, is
it illegal to drive your kids in it (something like the camper I mentioned)
or simply a bit more dangerous?

I'd agree except for two things:

1. You're choosing to put your kids at risk, not just yourself.
2. Us taxpayers have a way of getting stuck with the bill when non-belted
parents die and leave the state to care for the orphans or get turned into
vegetables in an accident they could have walked away from.

If you can guaranteee that you or your insurer will pay for all the medical
costs incurred as a result of your not belting up or that you'll voluntarily
forgo the care and die quietly if you can't pay for it, then I guess I could
get behind that mentality all the way. Of course, you may have trouble
finding an insurer that will underwrite you.

If not, the existing seatbelt laws strikes me as a valid tradeoff between
intruding on your ability to make choices and protecting the rest of us from
the financial fallout of your choices.

Rear seatbelts became standard equipment in 1968.

Anyone who would actually consider buying a 35+ year-old vehicle, from a
stranger on a web site, while on vacation, has much bigger problems than
where to strap in the safety seats.

A cargo van in not a passenger vehicle; if you were stopped with your
toddlers rolling around in the back, I would hope that you would be
arrested for child endangerment.

You seem to be more concerned with the cost of a moving violation than
the actual physical well-being of your children.  That's sick, and
perhaps you should be spending your vacation locally, getting some
counseling.
