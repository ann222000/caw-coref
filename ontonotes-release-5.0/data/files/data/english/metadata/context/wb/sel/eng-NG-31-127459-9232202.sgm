*            THE WEEKLY ALIYOT [*]            *
* A short summary of the weekly Torah portion *
*      read in the Synagogue on Shabbat.      *
***********************************************

Parshat Chayei Sarah

In the previous parsha -- Torah portion, Parshat Vayeira, we
read about the birth of Yitzchok Avinu -- our forefather, in his
parents old age, and the story of the binding of Yitzchok, the
akaida.

*

In the first aliyah [2] of this week's Torah portion, Parshat
Chayei Sarah, we find out that Sarah Imanu -- our foremother --
Yitzchok's mother, has passed away. Rashi comments on the words
used by the Torah to describe her age: that at one hundred, she was
without sin as a twenty year-old, and at twenty, she was as
beautiful as a girl of seven.

This aliyah then gives a detailed account of Avrohom purchasing
the cave of Machpella for 400 shekels of silver. It is interesting
to note that the following sites, all mentioned in the Torah -- the
Cave of Machpella (in Chevron), the site of the Bais Hamikdash (The
Holy Temple, in Jerusalem), bought by King David, and the city of
Shechem, conquered by our forefather Yaakov and later used to bury
Yosef -- were paid for, or conquered, at the time, yet all are
under contestion today.

*

After the story of the akaida at the end of the last parsha,
Avrohom realized that Yitzchok, who was 37 years old, should be
getting married. At the very end of that parsha, in the maftir
reading, some genealogy information was given including the birth
of Rivkah, which was to be Yitzchok's future wife. So in this
week's second aliyah, the Torah begins the story of Avrohom sending
his servant Eliezer back to the land of Avrohom's birth to find a
wife for Yitzchok.

*

In the third aliyah Eliezer arrives at Avrohom's homeland and
waits outside the city by the well of water. Here he prays to G-d
that his mission of finding a wife for Yitzchok should be quickly
successful. He prays that he will ask a young lady for a drink of
water, and when she answers, she will say &quot;of course, and I'll also
give your camels water to drink.&quot;

Before he finishes speaking, a young lady approaches and he asks
for a drink, and she says &quot;of course&quot; and offers also to feed his
camels. And naturally, she turns out to be from the correct family,
too.

*

In the fourth aliyah, after Eliezer found Rivkah so quickly, he
says &quot;Boruch Hashem!&quot; -- Blessed is G-d. Rivkah then runs to tell
her family about this man by the well, and her brother, Lavan, goes
out and greets Eliezer and invites him to spend the night. Eliezer
accepts and goes and meets Avrohom's future in-laws and tells them
all that has transpired, and they agree to the match.

*

In the fifth aliyah Eliezer and Rivkah's family celebrate, and
in the morning Eliezer asks that he be allowed to return
immediately to his master with Rivkah. But her family wants to hold
her for a year. In the end they ask Rivkah, which, Rashi says,
teaches us that a woman can't get married against her will.

Eliezer and Rivkah return and find Yitzchok praying in a field
as it was getting to be evening. Actually, our sages say that this
was the invention of the Mincha -- afternoon -- prayer.

The wedding takes place and Yitzchok takes Rivkah to his mother
Sarah's tent, when Sarah lived. This tent had three constant
blessings: the candles burned from Shabbat to Shabbat, the dough
was blessed, and the cloud of the Shechinah -- Divine Presence --
rested over the tent. When Rivkah entered the tent, these three
blessings returned.

Incidentally, these three blessings correspond to the three
special mitzvot of Jewish woman: Lighting Shabbat candles, the
taking of challah which is associated with a kosher home, and
Taharat Hamishpocha -- the observance of the laws of family purity
-- a G-d given gift to the Jewish people for the spiritual and
physical health of the family.

*

In the sixth aliyah Avrohom remarries, and Rashi says his wife
was the original Hagar that he was married to before. Also in this
aliyah, Avrohom Avinu passes away at the age of 175, and Yitzchok
and Yishmael bury their father in the cave of Machpella where
Sarah, his wife, and Adam and Chava, are also buried.

*

Because, as we saw in the previous aliyah, that Yishmael had
done teshuvah -- repentance -- and participated in Avrohom Avinu's
burial, the Midrash says that he was rewarded by having his
genealogy described in this, the seventh aliyah.

* CHOF CHESHVAN *
*****************

On the 20th of Cheshvan (Thursday, Nov. 1), we will be
commemorating the birthday of Rabbi Sholom DovBer
(5621/1860-5680/1920), the fifth Chabad-Lubavitch Rebbe, known as
the Rebbe Rashab.

It is said that on a person's birthday, the &quot;spiritual source of
the soul shines powerfully.&quot; Therefore, it is important to
understand what the central point of the Rebbe Rashab's leadership
was, and how it differed from the other Chabad Rebbes.

The Rebbe explains how each of the Rebbes was characterized by a
particular dimension that reflected his individual nature.

Chabad Chasidus is characterized by the ability to make the
esoteric teachings of the Torah, which remained hidden from the
majority of the Jewish community, accessible to every single Jew.
The Rebbe Rashab was able to bring the teachings of Chabad Chasidus
to an even more comprehensible level than his predecessors.

The Rebbe Rashab's teachings put a great emphasis on summarizing
subject matter so that it could be more easily implemented into
daily life. For this he is referred to by many as the &quot;Rambam
(Maimonides) of Chasidus,&quot; because he summarized Chasidus in the
same way the Rambam summarized the Oral Law, making it
comprehensible and giving it clear directions for every aspect of
our conduct.

The lessons of the Rebbe Rashab are easily understood and are
concluded with directions for the practical application of those
lessons.

In 5657/1897 the Rebbe Rashab established a yeshivah, Tomchei
Tmimim, and he was personally involved in every aspect of it,
designing the curriculum, and asking for a detailed progress report
on each student. He strove to raise both their standard of learning
and their standard of behavior. It was a great honor to be accepted
into the yeshivah, and its students were highly respected by the
community.

The Rebbe Rashab published many of his teachings, which deal
with improving one's character, how to prepare for prayer and the
importance of prayer, and of studying Chasidus.

May we all benefit from his teachings.

* * *

There is a beautiful story concerning the Rebbe Rashab,
illustrating the high esteem in which he held every Jew.

One of the Rebbe Rashab's followers, Reb Monye Monissohn, was a
wealthy gem dealer. Once, when they were sitting together, the
Rebbe spoke very highly about some simple, unlearned Jews.

&quot;Why do you make such a fuss about them?&quot; Reb Monye asked the
Rebbe.

&quot;Each one of them has many special and noble qualities,&quot;
explained the Rebbe.

&quot;I can't see any of these qualities,&quot; said Reb Monye.

The Rebbe remained silent. A while later, he asked Reb Monye if
he had brought his package of diamonds with him. Indeed, Reb Monye
had brought the diamonds, but asked the Rebbe if he could display
them later, when they could be seen to their best advantage.

Later, Reb Monye took the Rebbe into a different room and
arranged the diamonds for him to see. Reb Monye pointed to one gem
in particular, extolling its beautiful color and quality.

&quot;I can't see anything special in it,&quot; the Rebbe said.

&quot;That is because you have to be a maven to know how to look at
diamonds!&quot; explained Reb Monye.

&quot;Every Jew, too, is something beautiful and extra-ordinary,&quot; the
Rebbe said. &quot;But you have to be a maven to know how to look at
him.&quot;

* * *

The Rebbe Rashab was a great tzadik and a person of tremendous
insight. This can be illustrated by the following incident.

The Rebbe Rashab founded, in 5657/1897, the Tomchei Tmimim
Yeshivah in the city of Lubavitch. The Rebbe Rashab was an honorary
member of the council which was formed to help establish the new
government's policy toward the Jews after the deposition of the
Czar. In 5678/1918 he traveled to Petersburg to participate in a
council meeting. At one of the stops on the journey, he sent his
attendant to buy a newspaper. Returning with the newspaper, the
attendant read to the Rebbe Rashab: &quot;The Communists have taken
over, and the council has been abolished.&quot;

The Rebbe Rashab responded, &quot;We must now establish yeshivot in
every city. I do not see their [the Communists'] end, but
ultimately, their end too, will come...&quot;

In the (former) Soviet Union, as the Communist arm stretched
forth with ever increasing strength, the yeshivot went underground.
Today, thank G-d, there are still hundreds of people living all
over the world who were educated in those underground yeshivot. In
the last few years, yeshivot have been started in 11 cities
including Tbilisi, Moscow, Minsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kishinev, and
Kharkov.

Dozens of Tomchei Tmimim Yeshivot continue to educate young Jews
in many countries around the world, including Canada, Australia,
Israel, Venezuela, and throughout the United States.

How visionary were the Rebbe Rashab's words concerning the
ultimate demise of Communism.

*******************
* ONE LITTLE GIRL *
*******************

The following true story is adapted from a talk given by the
Rebbe during the fall of 1976.

The little Israeli girl was only five years old. One day, in
school, a visitor from Chabad told her class about lighting Shabbat
candles. Although she and her classmates were far below the age of
bat mitzvah, declared the young woman, they could nonetheless
participate in this mitzvah.

When the little girl came home that Friday, and excitedly told
her mother about her new discovery, her mother replied that she
knew nothing about this whole business (she had received no Jewish
education whatsoever). &quot;Did you ever hear of such a thing!&quot;
exclaimed the mother angrily. &quot;A little girl should want to do
things that her own mother doesn't do, and bring new ideas into the
house!&quot;

But we all know what young children are like. The little girl
started to cry and she pleaded with her mother. &quot;I'm not asking you
to do anything. All I'm asking is that you should let me do it. I
have a candle-holder; they gave me one in school. I know the
blessing; they also gave me a paper with the instructions on when
and how to light the candle. Please let me light it!&quot;

Mother gave in. &quot;All right, do whatever you want. But stop
crying, and leave me in peace.&quot;

Our little girl was overjoyed. She put the candle on the dining
room table, lit it herself, made the blessing, and was in seventh
heaven! She went around from one member of the family to the other,
warning each one of them in her childish but serious way, that no
one should touch her candle or blow it out.

When mother and father saw that it wasn't so terrible after all,
they let her light the candle the next Friday without any fuss. The
little girl again lit it with the same delight and enthusiasm as
the first week, and her infectious joy spread to the rest of the
family.

A few weeks went by. One Friday the father said that &quot;it just
somehow didn't seem right&quot; to have the television on with the
little one walking around the house singing Shabbat songs, and with
the candle burning on the table. While the candle was lit, he could
not bring himself to turn on the television. Some time later the
telephone rang and mother did not answer it, because the candle was
still lit.

Weeks later mother surveyed the Friday night scene and decided
that something was wrong. How strange it looked to see just the
single candle burning on the table, to see her little daughter full
of joy and telling everyone that it was a holy day, etc., while
she, the mother, was busy as if it were just an ordinary day. &quot;It
just doesn't seem right! I'm going to start lighting candles, too!&quot;
Once she started lighting candles, she could not bring herself to
turn on the oven. &quot;After all, I have just declared in the blessing
that it is the Holy Shabbat; how can I now go ahead with making
supper -- and turn the oven on or off in violation of the Sabbath?&quot;

No one likes cold food; so mother started to make &quot;cholent&quot; (the
traditional Shabbat stew allowed to cook from Friday afternoon
until Shabbat afternoon) for the midday meal. Naturally, the whole
&quot;cholent&quot; procedure affected the way they did things and the meals
they ate the next day, too.

Later, mother decided that since she was now lighting candles,
she would dress up in honor of the Friday night atmosphere.

And so it went on. From one thing to another. From one aspect of
Shabbat to another. From one small candle lit by one little girl
following a scene and tears; to refraining from doing work while
the candle was still burning; to the mother's beginning to light
Shabbat candles; from there to the wearing of nicer clothes in
honor of Shabbat; and on to refraining from all types of work
prohibited on Shabbat.

Eventually the entire family and household became transformed.
This family has now returned completely to their tradition and
heritage. All, because of the light of one Shabbat candle!

LIGHT IS BORN . . . DARKNESS RECEDES

Peace descends on the Jewish home every Shabbat.

The news of the day may tell of murder and mayhem, politics and
pollution, disease and disaster -- indeed the global catalogue of
human misery. For ours is a threatening world. One in which the
Jewish spirit is under constant assault by hypocrisy, injustice and
rampant immorality.

But there is a divine spark in each of us. And so, there is
hope. For light is a compelling force that will always triumph over
darkness.

Fire touches wick. Flame reaches upward. Another home is bathed
in peace and holiness, in warmth and unity.

A Jewish woman has invited the Shabbat Queen into her home. The
darkness of the day's headlines recedes, exiled by the peaceful
glow of candles.

It is truly a gift from on high.

All that is good, all that is holy is symbolized -- indeed
realized -- in the flickering light of the Shabbat candles:

* Domestic harmony.

* Dedication to G-d, Torah and Mitzvot.

* Triumph of good.

* Unending hope and faith in ultimate good.

*  *  *

Tradition recounts the miracle of our Matriarch Sarah, whose
Shabbat candles burned from Friday eve to Friday eve.

Our sages tell of our Matriarch Rivkah, who lit Shabbat candles
from the tender age of three.

Two millennia ago, the Holy Zohar declared that a woman kindling
her Shabbat candles with joy in her heart brings peace on earth,
long life to her loved ones, and is blessed with children who
illuminate our world with Torah.

And in our generation, the Rebbe said: &quot;Let every woman -- young
girls included -- add her holy light to illuminate the world
shrouded in darkness and confusion.&quot;

*  *  *

Lighting Shabbat candles is the historic responsibility of
every Jewish wife and mother. But in our times their light is not
enough . . .

Today we also need the holy flame of every Jewish girl in order
to keep the forces of darkness at bay.

These are times when children look beyond home and hearth, in
quest of their own identity and the desire to create a meaningful
life for themselves.

Let them hold a candle all their own . . . Let them kindle a
flame of their own . . . Let them bring their aspirations in sync
with the divine warmth of the Shabbat light.

JEWISH GIRLS! Your mothers need you. Your people need you. Your
future as Jewish women cries out for you to enter its service now.

JEWISH MOTHERS! As soon as your daughter is old enough to recite
the blessing, teach her to kindle her own Shabbat candle. Because
darkness is all around us, and only you have the power to drive it
away.

Women's Candle Lighting Campaign.

*******************************
* GUIDELINES AND INSTRUCTIONS *
*******************************

* A married woman customarily lights two candles and may add an
additional one for each of her children. Single women light one
candle.

* As soon as a young girl can grasp the idea of Shabbat and can
recite the blessing (approximately 3 years old) her mother should
provide her with a candlestick and teach her to kindle the Shabbat
lights.

* The child should light before her mother in case she needs
assistance.

* It is customary to put a few coins in a 'pushka' (charity box)
before lighting candles.

*  The correct time to light the Shabbat candles is *18 MINUTES
BEFORE SUNSET EVERY FRIDAY.* Young girls should light just prior to
this time.

***********************************
* LAWS OF SHABBAT CANDLE LIGHTING *
*           FOR THE BLIND         *
***********************************

Edited by Rabbi Y. K. Marlow O.B.M. [4]

*  A blind woman who lives alone should light her Shabbat
candle(s) with a blessing.

*  If she is married to a non-visually impaired person, HER
HUSBAND SHOULD LIGHT THE SHABBAT CANDLES WITH THE BLESSING.

*  If she is eating and lighting in the company of others who
are non-visually impaired, and they lit the Shabbat candles,
she should light her own Shabbat candle(s), BUT WITHOUT SAYING THE
BLESSING.

*  (If at all possible, she should not be the last one to light
the Shabbat candle(s), so that she can be absolved by the latter's
blessing.)

********************
* FESTIVAL CANDLES *
********************

Just as candles are lit in honor of Shabbat, so are they lit in
honor of the festivals.

Various blessings are recited on the different festivals. (See
our &quot;Festival/Holiday Guides&quot; published before every
Festival/Holiday, for the proper blessings).

NOTE:

When lighting after the onset of a festival, a preexisting flame
must be used to light the candles, as it is prohibited to create a
new fire by striking a match or lighter, etc. However, it is
permissible to use, or transfer live, from a flame burning
continuously since the onset of the festival - such as a pilot
light, gas or candle flame.

************************************
* SHABBAT CANDLE LIGHTING BLESSING *
************************************

* First light the candles. Then spread your hands out around the
candles, drawing your hands inward in a circular motion three times
to indicate the acceptance of the sanctity of Shabbat. You then
cover your eyes and recite the following blessing:

BO-RUCH A-TOH ADO-NOI E-LO-HEI-NU ME-LECH HO-OLOM

Translation:

Blessed are You, L-rd our G-d, King of the universe,
who has sanctified us with His commandments, and
commanded us to kindle the light of the holy Shabbat.

* Uncover your eyes and behold the Shabbat lights.

* The time of lighting is considered especially propitious for
praying to G-d for health and happiness. The prayer is readily
acceptable because it is offered during the performance of this
great mitzvah of lighting Shabbat candles.

CAUTION:
The candles must be lit 18 minutes *BEFORE* sunset. IT IS
PROHIBITED AND IS A DESECRATION OF THE SHABBAT TO LIGHT THE
CANDLES *AFTER* SUNSET.

Eight plus ten plus five is 23. Add to that 40, 6, 300, 100 and
1 and you have the number 470. But 470 isn't just the sum of a
random set of numbers. In Hebrew, each letter has a numerical
value. And the numbers listed above are the numerical values of the
Hebrew letters that spell the name of Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka, the
Rebbe's wife.

One of the very first activities initiated in memory of the
Rebbetzin was &quot;Project 470,&quot; a division of the Lubavitch Women's
Organization Candle Lighting Campaign. Esther Sternberg,
coordinator of the campaign since its inception at the Rebbe's
behest in 1974, tells about the background of Project 470. &quot;We had
scheduled our annual fund-raising event for the 26th of Shevat that
year (5748/1988). We sent the invitation to the Rebbe and received
the Rebbe's blessing. When the Rebbetzin passed away just days
before the event, which meant that it would take place during the
shivah (the week of mourning), we thought to postpone it. But, as
we had already received the Rebbe's blessing we decided to go
ahead.

&quot;At the evening itself,&quot; remembers Mrs. Sternberg, &quot;we announced
that we were establishing a special fund in the Rebbetzin's memory
that would be devoted exclusively to publicizing, through newspaper
and radio ads, the special mitzvah of Shabbat candles.&quot;

At that point, the project did not yet have a name. It was
through a comment made by the Rebbe that this far-reaching project
received its name. Explains Mrs. Sternberg, &quot;Right after the Rebbe
got up from shivah, we were told that the Rebbe wanted to see my
father (Rabbi Shneur Zalman Gurary, O.B.M.) and me. My father and I
were both with the Rebbetzin in her last moments, and we thought
that maybe the Rebbe wanted to ask us some questions. When we
arrived in the Rebbe's office he was holding the invitation to our
evening. Someone had informed the Rebbe about the fund. The Rebbe
wanted to give $470 'al shem hanifteres' -- in the name of the
departed -- and another dollar that the project should be a
success.&quot;

Animatedly, Mrs. Sternberg describes the rest of the audience
with the Rebbe: &quot;The Rebbe gave many, many blessings for the Candle
Lighting Campaign and said that anyone who inspires others to light
Shabbat candles, as well as those who begin to light Shabbat
candles, 'yair mazalon' -- their fortune will shine. The Rebbe
showered blessings on anyone who would be involved.&quot;

The main undertaking of Project 470 has been a classified ad on
the front page of the New York Times every Friday, reminding Jewish
women and girls to light Shabbat candles. The ad includes the
correct time for candle lighting that week in New York City as well
as the computerized telephone system that gives the candle lighting
time for any location in the United States, including Alaska,
Hawaii and Puerto Rico. This classified ad has run consecutively
for 16 years.

Mrs. Sternberg notes that she constantly receives calls for
candle lighting times around the world, which is not surprising, as
the front page of the New York Times is duplicated in all foreign
editions as well. A system to allow callers to receive computerized
information for the entire world is currently being created for
Project 470.

Although there are hundreds of stories connected to the Candle
Lighting Campaign in general, Mrs. Sternberg retells one unique
incident: &quot;Exactly 28 years ago, I was going to Israel. I saw many
Jewish college students who were also on their way to Israel in the
El Al area at the airport. Always eager to encourage more Jewish
girls and women to light Shabbat candles, I approached the young
women and asked them if they light Shabbat candles. They all
answered affirmatively. They were very proud and excitedly told me
about their interaction with Chabad on their college campuses
around the country. I was elated by their positive responses.&quot;

Continues Mrs. Sternberg: &quot;In those days the El Al security
system included booths that were electronically monitored. As I was
planning on going to a few European countries after Israel to talk
about the Candle Lighting Campaign, I had an entire suitcase full
of candlesticks with me. I was afraid the metal detectors would be
set off by the candlesticks, so when I was about to enter the
cubicle, I told the security guard in Hebrew, 'I'm afraid to go
in.' He told me not to be afraid. He saw I was in a very good mood
and commented on it. 'You can't imagine how happy I am,' I told the
officer, truly exuberant over my conversations with the college
students and my trip to Israel.

&quot;'So, Madam, maybe you have neshek?' the officer asked me with a
twinkle in his eyes. I was sure that he had seen me talking with
the students and had seen me pull out some candlesticks from my
suitcase.&quot; In Israel, the Candle Lighting Campaign is well known as
Mivtza Neshek. Neshek, which literally means 'weapons' is an
acronym for Neirot Shabbat Kodesh -- Holy Shabbat Candles. &quot;We
consider 'Neshek' as one of the 'weapons' in the Rebbe's war
against assimilation and apathy.

&quot;I said proudly, 'Of course I have Neshek, a whole suitcase
full!' Instantly an alarm was sounded and within seconds five
police came running to the little cubicle to arrest me.&quot;

With a chuckle, Mrs. Sternberg remembers, &quot;I opened the suitcase
and showed them what was inside. 'I am talking about a different
kind of Neshek altogether,' I told them innocently.&quot;

**************************************
* TIME FOR UNITY; TIME FOR STRENGTH! *
**************************************

The most important principle in the Torah is the protection of
Jewish life.

It's more important than Shabbat, more important than holidays,
even fasting on Yom Kippur.

Right now, in Israel, and everywhere, Jews must stand together
in unity and do whatever possible to protect Jewish life.

The Rebbe teaches that there are TEN important MITZVOT we can do
to protect life. See what you can do:

1) AHAVAT YISROEL: Behave with love towards another Jew.

2) LEARN TORAH: Join a Torah class.

3) Make sure that Jewish children get a TORAH TRUE EDUCATION.

4) Affix kosher MEZUZOT on all doorways of the house.

5) For men and boys over 13: Put on TEFILLIN every weekday.

6) Give CHARITY.

7) Buy JEWISH HOLY BOOKS and learn them.

8) LIGHT SHABBAT &amp; YOM TOV candles. A Mitzvah for women and
girls.

9) Eat and drink only KOSHER FOOD.

10) Observe the laws of JEWISH FAMILY PURITY.

In addition the Rebbe urges that:

Every Jewish man, woman and child should have a letter written
for them in a SEFER TORAH.*

Every person should study either the Rambam's Yad Hachazakah --
Code of Jewish Law -- or the Sefer HaMitzvos.

Concerning Moshiach, the Rebbe stated, &quot;The time for our
redemption has arrived!&quot; Everyone should prepare themselves for
Moshiach's coming by doing random acts of goodness and kindness,
and by studying about what the future redemption will be like. May
we merit to see the fulfillment of the Rebbe's prophecy now!

********************
* A CALL TO ACTION *
********************

The Rebbe's slogan is: &quot;The main thing is the deed.&quot; We
therefore present from the Rebbe's talks, suggestions of what we
can do to complete his work of bringing the Redemption.

ENCOURAGE THE KIDS!

Do the doorposts of your children's rooms have mezuzahs on them?
If they do, point them out to the children and encourage them to
kiss or touch the mezuzah cover as they go in and out of the room.
If not, purchase a hand-written mezuzah scroll from a reliable
Judaica store or your local Chabad-Lubavitch Center. You can even
let the child choose his or her own mezuzah cover.

The Rebbe explained, &quot;We see that children have a unique
attraction to a mezuzah, and kiss it eagerly several times a day.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the mezuzah, one goes from one's house to the world at large
">

as the Rambam writes, 'Whenever one enters or departs, one will
confront the unity of G-d's name.'&quot;
