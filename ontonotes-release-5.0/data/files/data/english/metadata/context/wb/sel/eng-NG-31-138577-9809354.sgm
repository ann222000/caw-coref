*NEWS RELEASE*

*NEW TIP GAELIC COURSES WITH ADDED FUN***

CNSA, The Gaelic Pre-school Council would very much like to hear from
individuals and family groups who wish to become conversationally fluent in
Gaelic in the shortest time possible.

The plan is to run a 5 year programme of *very effective, very enjoyable,
very popular* TIP centred language acquisition courses. And as is customary
with all such courses there will be absolutely no reading, writing, grammar
or translation for students to undertake, at least, not until the desired
fluency has been reached. Accordingly the learning process will be
surprisingly painless and thus, pleasantly stress free.

The course will run for 8 hours each day, 5 days a week in 6 week blocks.

We have also enhanced the course by adding in social, community and cultural
activities, held each evening after the days course work. The social,
cultural etc. activities will also be ongoing on Saturdays throughout the
day and evening.

These new and exciting elements have two main purposes. Firstly, to create
places where students can use and converse in Gaelic with others; no point
in gaining a hard won fluency and then having nowhere to use it and no one
to share it with.

The second though equally important element is to produce a fully rounded
language fluency that will serve a newly fluent speaker in a wide variety of
situations. Again, there is no point in having a narrow language command,
that will only allow one to converse in Gaelic in rarefied areas and among

a very select few.

Ideally, what we seek is to provide both groups with practical and
functional language that will allow them to feel confident and a sense of
pride in being able to express themselves in Gaelic wherever they are.

If this course is of interest and I cannot believe there aren't many out
there eager   to have a go. All one has to do is contact me, Finlay on
01463-225469 or 01542-836322, also email *de ... @cnsa.org.uk&lt;fin ... @cnsa.org.uk&gt;
* .

Moreover, if anyone has a talent or expertise in a social, cultural etc.
activity, please come along and share your skills with a group of Gaelic
learners.
