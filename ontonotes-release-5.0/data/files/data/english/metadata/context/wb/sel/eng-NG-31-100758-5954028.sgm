Wanted to share a new recipe.  We just came up with the best 15 minute
recipe for cheese enchiladas.  The sauce makes all the difference.

1 doz corn tortillas cut into 1/8 triangles
4 tbl spoon olive oil
1/2 onion chopped
2 garlic cloves minced
1 cup cheese
new mexico enchilada sauce

add the first 4 items to a large fry pan. coat tortillas but you don't
want to make tortilla chips.  cook maybe 8 minutes med heat.
add  1/2 bottle enchilada sauce--coyote trail is the best.  use spatula
and turn carefully--don't want to make mush.
add shredded cheddar

top w/ remaining sauce
optional--sliced olives, chopped tomatoes, cilantro
put the lid on and turn fire LOW--eat within 15 minutes so they don't
dry out

Great Veggie meal--yum

FYI, those are not enchiladas, at most and with some imagination you
may call them chilaquiles. And do not use cheddar, try using Chihuahua
or Oaxaca cheese. Try adding some sour cream and some onions

Have fun!. (and a Peptobismol, just in case :o)  )

Consider the implications of the subject line, "School Nite
Enchiladas".

It implies that enchiladas are some kind of special treat, and that
whipping up enchiladas in 15 minutes on a school nite is a big deal.

The first enchiladas I ever made only took about 30 minutes, the oven
was already warmed up.

An Air Force mess sergeant taught me to cook them. He wasn't a Mexican,
and he was nobody's grandmother.

I just fried the frozen tortillas in hot oil until they floated, dipped
them in canned enchilada sauce, laid them in a casserole with more
sauce in the bottom,
filled them will fried ground beef, added more canned enchilada sauce,
rolled them up in a row, sprinkled a lot of shredded cheese on top,
added more canned enchilada sauce, and then baked them for 20 minutes,
until the cheese melted.

I made hundreds of enchiladas and was 100% successful the first time I
tried.

No big deal. Enchiladas are just a snack, yannow, it doesn't require a
special event or fiesta to make them.

If you had to make the enchilada sauce from scratch, that's no big deal
either, just soak dried chiles overnight, or take fresh chiles and
de-seed and de-vein them, scorch them in a frying pan with some oil,
then stick them in a blender and puree them. Then you can fry the puree
some more in a greased frying pan, adding garlic and whatever else you
like and add some water and boil the resulting mole for 20 minutes.

Add enough water to thin it out and the mole becomes enchilada sauce.
No big deal.

An illiterate peasant could do it. Just not so fast as somebody with a
blender and a gas stove.

Another thing, real enchiladas are not baked, chesse should remain
fresh and crumby:
1 If tortillas are too hard you can pre-fry them.
2 dip tortillas in the salsa.
3 finish frying the tortillas until they are soft.
4 take them out from the oil, put them on flat surface, add cheese,
chicken or beef.
5 roll them.
6 in the same salsa-stained oil you can fry potatos and carrots cut in
small cubes. you can add some whole jalapeños or serranos
7 serve the enchiladas on a dish, potatos and carrots on side or on
top, some lettuce to.
8 sprinkle more cheese on top.
9 eat them while they're hot.

Most of time involved in making enchiladas usually is from making the
salsa and preheating the oil, once done you can make a lot of
enchiladas in no time.

Yeah, the real people from New Mexico who labor over enchiladas would
rather die than try this recipe--and FYI they top theirs with a fried
egg, which is an awesome treat.  The problem is always time--good food
in 20 minutes is always something I'm interested in. I like your cheese
selection. I'll try it next time-Thx.

Thanks to the Enchilada Nazi ;-) for the "heads up", I was served an
enchilada like that  once and wondered what the heck it was supposed to
be. I never ate there again.

Enchiladas in SoCal are *always* placed in the oven for long enough to

Enchiladas aren't "gringo" food, they do come to SoCal from Mexico, so
I was talking about enchiladas as somebody in California would expect
to be served such a dish.

Maybe your version of the cheese enchilada, which is never placed in
the oven to melt the cheese, is more regional than you think?

It's unclear to whom your typical sarcasm is addressed, but I will take
it as indicating that
Guadalajara-style enchiladas may be prepared in an unsatifactory
manner.

It's not likely that I would ever be slumming in Guadalajara and
looking for peasant food though.

I like the flavor of a mild cheddar, colby or cheddar blend in cheese
enchiladas over the Mexican varieties you mention since the cheese is
the main ingredient. I prefer the Mexican cheeses for bean dishes and
garnish.

You don't know what "elitist" means, and your hyperbole is absurd.

I have never travelled in Mexico for the purpose of meeting the

Nope. You still haven't taken the time to find out what an elitist is.

The basic difference between enchilada sauce and mole is how wet it is.
If it's really thin and you can easily pour it, or dip tortillas in it
before rolling them into enchilada shapes, you can call it enchilada
sauce. If it's so thick you have to spoon it out of a jar, it's mole.

And, moles don't necessarily have to be cooked.

Two arguably male cooks on TV yesterday mentioned that the mole most
Americans would be familiar with was guacamole, a mole which is
prepared from raw ingredients.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Oh, yes, I mentioned that there were eight basic moles about a year
ago, but nobody wanted to argue at the time.

The eight basic moles are named according to their colors, and they get
their coloration from whatever vegetable to cook chooses to achieve it.

The mistake that amateur cooks make about mole is their assumption that
any given mole has a certain meat in it, but that's untrue. The mole is
a thick sauce. The meat could be smothered with the mole, or it might
be just a thin coating on the meat.
