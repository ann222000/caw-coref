I have one Supernova2 and five jaw sets. Rather than empty my pockets
for "Companion" chucks, I'd like to get a couple knockoffs for the Cole
jaws, and perhaps the 1" jaws... then I can keep the Bowl Jaws on the
nova all the time!

To the best of my knowledge, the Original Oneway Chuck and the Oneway
Talon are the only chucks on which the jaws will interchange with the
NOVA Chucks. Considering the price of the Oneway chucks, you might as
well purchase a second NOVA. A less expensive NOVA chuck would be the
original NOVA with the two tommy bars or the new NOVA G3 chuck, which
is less expensive than the SuperNova2.

NOVA Chucks have been designed so that the jaws are interchangeable on
all of the chucks, except the Titon with the three screw holes in the
jaws. It will, however, use all of the other NOVA Chuck jaws.

Up here in Canada, King markets a chuck that has an "O" or a "T" in
the model number. "O" for Oneway and "T" foe Technaool. I believe King
and Grizzly are the one and same. They cost around $150Can and I know
the "O" model takes all my Oneway Talon jaws

I just dug through the King web site and the only chucks I found were
the three or four jaw chucks more suited to metal work (I do have one,
they are, interesting to use)

Others have answered the "do they", so here is the cheapest place I
know of to buy Nova chucks

I can't find those "O" or "T" chucks, but I did find another source for
my HF lathe. Except for the paint job, the CH-900C is a duplicate of my
HF lathe:
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=34706

I DID find a single scroll chuck that might work for the OP at:
http://www.kingcanada.com/Accessories.htm?ID=404

What I am mystified at is where to find their prices. NONE of their
prices seem to be posted ... not even on the PDF file for the "Parts
Pricing List" for the CH-900C. I can understand if they refused to sell
to people who use Firefox ... lots of folks do that ... but the prices
aren't even in the PDF file labeled "Parts Pricing List".

I have one of those, only from Grizzly (certainly from the same
source), It is of limited use in woodturning

King Canada Inc
Dorval Quebec Canada

It is identical to a Oneway with the 2 levers. Comes with 2 sets of
jaws and a screw
Check out Buzybee Tools
Original price at my local tool shop was $140Can
Reduced to $115.95

My Talon and Oneway jaws will fit this chuck and vice-versa

Yeah, that's the guy I bought most of my stuff from. Best prices I've
found on the good stuff.

Went to Woodcraft today to see what the Pinnacles looked like. No joy.
The holes in the Pinnacle jaws are about 2mm farther apart, and the
mating surfaces are the opposite configuration (chuck male, jaw
female).
So unless I was willing to mod one hole in each jaw and mill the
registration surface off the chuck... blah, blah, blah. Hell, I ain't
gonna mess with that -- come on guys, there must be one cheapie chuck
out there configured like a nova...

Some of the Vicmarc jaws can be used on the Super Nova with only
slight modifications.  I am using Vicmarc's 14 inch bowl jaws on a
Super Nova chuck.  All I had to do was file off a little numb on the
backside and use longer screws because the Vicmarc jaws were a bit
thicker.  KMS Tool in Canada tipped me off to this.  There staff is
very helpful and their prices are great.  Even with shipping
included.  Give them a call.  Maybe the reverse is also true.
