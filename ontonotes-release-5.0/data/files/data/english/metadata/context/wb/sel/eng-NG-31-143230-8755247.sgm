Part 5: The problem with science education
On textbooks
Teaching methods
Education and belief in pseudoscience
How the brain works

In this final part we will explore some of the positive things we can do about the evolution - creation controversy in particular, but more in general about public understanding of science. The latter is really of paramount importance in a society that is increasingly dependent on science and technology, and marked improvements in the general degree of comprehension of what science is -- and is not -- will automatically improve (although by all means not &quot;solve&quot;) the evolution - creation problem.
In the field problem in Part 1 we have examined the arguments of Jonathan Wells who, in his I Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrong cons of Â claims that there is a fundamental problem with the ideological biases of biology textbooks. This is therefore a good starting point for our analysis: how do we improve science textbooks?
On textbooks
It seems to me that the real problem reflected in current textbooks is that educators, especially in the nonphysical sciences, such as biology, geology, and psychology, are obsessed with the idea of &quot;covering&quot; the material and end up with no time to teach students how science is actually done. This is a terrible mistake, because it does two things that we should avoid at all costs: First, it conveys the message that science is as boring as reading the yellow pages (which it is, if one simply enumerates all the factoids that are contained in the typical textbook); second, it reinforces the idea that science is about results that somehow -- more or less magically -- come out of people who are dressed in white coats and are involved in mysterious activities.
Consider a simple fact: Although the typical introductory textbook in biology or psychology for college students is more than a thousand pages long, usually only about ten or so of these are devoted to the explanation of how all those facts were gathered and those conclusions reached. A typical trend in the wrong direction is exemplified by the way some new textbooks in genetics are written and, consequently, how the discipline is taught. At one time these books followed a historical sequence, starting with Mendel and his experiments on heredity, progressing through their rediscovery at the beginning of the twentieth century, to the demonstration of the chromosomal theory of inheritance, up to the first evidence that DNA is the carrier of genetic information, and then on to the identification of the structure of DNA and the elucidation of the genetic code. Molecular genetics and recombinant DNA techniques were placed toward the end because they were the latest
developments of a logical, if nonlinear, sequence of discoveries.
However, molecular biology has literally exploded during the past few decades, and teachers feel compelled to give &quot;up-to-date&quot; information about this rapidly expanding field, often skipping the historical sequence entirely, starting instead with the complexities of bacterial genetics. The result is that students are often confronted with a bewildering array of complex facts that they cannot link to each other conceptually, having no idea where they came from. For example, although every teacher of molecular biology knows what restriction enzymes are (because they are so useful in a variety of techniques), I doubt that most of them realize how they were discovered or what their natural function is.
Teaching methods
The point of teaching science in its historical context is not just that history is an important aspect of what we do and that we need to appreciate it (which is true), but that, most importantly, it is the best way to explain how and why scientific discoveries are made, to turn science from a barrage of meaningless and boring facts into a vibrant enterprise of discovery and human realization. Fortunately, some (few) universities and high school teachers around the country are coming to realize this and are changing their lesson plans accordingly, but the overwhelming majority are turning students off from science by the hundreds of thousands every year. Is it any wonder that religious-pseudoscience-creationists find such fertile ground in high schools and even on university campuses?
Perhaps even more unfortunately, the major response so far to the sorts of concerns I am discussing here has been a shift in emphasis from traditional classroom lectures to simplistic &quot;hands-on&quot; activities in which students manipulate objects and perform experiments. Moving away from lectures and getting students to do things is an excellent idea, but the way the hands-on approach is implemented in most classrooms I have seen actually produces worse results than the traditional approach. The problem with many hands-on classroom experiences is that the brain stays turned off. Kids just wonder about and giggle at whatever happens to be under the microscope without understanding what they are doing or why. The reason is that their teachers are often in no position to provide them with the conceptual background to derive the greatest benefit from the activities themselves.
The reality, of course, is that human talents are varied and multifaceted, and they are not necessarily coupled in the way we would like them to be. One can be an excellent teacher and an excellent researcher, but that is the least likely outcome because the two things require quite different skills, which seldom develop in one individual. The fact that a researcher can think up cunning experiments at the frontier of molecular biology doesn't necessarily mean that he can explain meiosis to a class of college freshmen. Similarly, being capable of writing a good book for the general public does not mean you will produce superb grant proposals that will be regularly funded, and so on.
If we broaden the horizon from academia to our culture at large, the view does not improve very much. Richard Dawkins, in his Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder, complained about the fashion of making science &quot;fun, fun, fun,&quot; as if it were a comedy show. Indeed, educators are often expected to be stand-up comedians to make their subject matter entertaining. As social commentator Neil Postman put it in the title of one of his books, we live in a society in which the major objective is to &quot;amuse ourselves to death.&quot;
The particular case of science teaching is just one example of a cultural trend that will take a great deal of effort to slow down, let alone to turn around. The point, of course, is not that science has to be boring, but that there is a difference between something being interesting and simply entertaining. Human beings need entertainment, even of the mindless kind, but we are reduced to little more than brutes if everything in our lives is packaged in terms of light and funny sound bites, as we have been conditioned to expect by the TV programs we watch.
Education and belief in pseudoscience
Creationism is not an isolated phenomenon, although it has its own peculiarities that deserve special attention. The general problem is really the widespread lack of critical thinking in the population at large and the fact that mostly we don't teach critical thinking in schools and universities. As a result, not only do 58 percent of Americans believe that &quot;God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so,&quot; but large numbers believe in absurd entities like UFOs, alien abductions, astrology, haunted houses, the physical existence of the devil, telepathy, the ability to predict the future, and a host of other phenomena one would have thought ended up in the dustbin of history at the end of the religious Middle Ages.
Is more science education the retort to all these superstitions? The answer that I lean toward, as unsatisfying as it may sound, is,&quot;Yes and no.&quot; I don't think that more science education of the standard variety will make any difference. In fact, it may positively do harm. Let me explain. Scientists and science educators have always assumed that the reason so many people believe in pseudoscience is that they simply don't know enough science. However, although the latter is an accurate empirical observation (most people don't know much about science), it doesn't follow that scientific illiteracy is the cause of widespread belief in all sorts of paranormal phenomena; therefore, more science education will not necessarily solve, or even ameliorate, the problem.
In fact, the connection between education (science education in particular) and belief in paranormal phenomena or explanations is an empirical matter, and it has been investigated as such. The results are not very supportive of the standard view of the problem, at least not entirely. A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that belief in heaven as a real place did diminish according to increasing levels of education from 92 percent among people with less than a high school education to 73 percent among people with a postgraduate education. But three out of four people with a college-level education still believe in the physical existence of heaven! The same trend applies to other measures of belief: Hell is considered an actual place by 80 percent of the respondents in the first category and by 56 percent in the second. If one is less educated, one is 20 to 30 percent more likely to believe in angels, but the most astounding fact is that 22
percent of college-educated people in the United States think that &quot;people on this earth are sometimes possessed by the devil&quot;! That equals one in every four or five of the best-educated people in the most prosperous country in the world -- one that is proud of possessing many of the best universities on the planet.
There is more. Although an inverse relationship does obviously exist between the level of education and the beliefs mentioned here (a finding mitigated by the fact that even many of the most educated people still hold on to such beliefs), notice that the Pew survey addressed beliefs with a strong religious component. What about beliefs in paranormal phenomena that are not based on a religious mythology? Anecdotal evidence suggests that religious fundamentalists tend actually not to believe in paranormal phenomena that are not directly mentioned in their sacred texts, such as alien abductions or astrology. But this lack of belief in the paranormal is hardly a result of their critical thinking.
Quantitative evidence is available: A Gallup poll found that the highest level of belief in UFOs visiting Earth is found among people with a college education (51 percent), a figure that is only slightly less for respondents who had not graduated from high school (48 percent). Similarly, a study by the Princeton Survey Research Association that asked about belief in the paranormal and supernatural found that high school dropouts responded more positively by only a very slim margin over their more educated colleagues (43 versus 39 percent). Several other polls have produced similar results, which amount to an inconsistent pattern of alleged correlation between education and some kinds of paranormal beliefs ; and there are proofs that these absurd beliefs are delibrately spread on the name of religions !.
This and other published research on different sorts of nonscientific beliefs seem to point to two important conclusions that anybody seriously interested in science education should keep in mind. First, there is a difference between religious-based and non-religious-based beliefs: The former are inversely related to the degree of education; the latter are not. This means factors other than just the general degree of education are at play. Second, even when education makes a difference, it leaves a staggering number of people believing all sorts of nonsense. Why? Before delving into this question from the perspective of what we know about how the brain works, let me report and briefly discuss one more set of results, which I obtained while surveying one of my own classes at the University of Tennessee.
I teach a course on science and pseudoscience, which was offered for the first time to honors students, most definitely not a random subset of the student population at the university. These are among the best and brightest students on campus. They also come from disparate backgrounds, with fewer than half of those I interviewed pursuing a science major. I asked them to respond to questions aimed at evaluating their general knowledge of science as it is assessed in aspiring high school teachers. These are questions about matters of fact, not principles of science or critical thinking. Not surprisingly, science students knew (slightly) more science than nonscience students did. I then asked them to rate their belief in a series of paranormal phenomena, from voodoo to astrology, from water dowsing to haunted houses, and so on. The astounding result (see figure) was that, contrary to expectations, the science majors held more strongly to paranormal beliefs than the
non-science students! At the same time there was absolutely no difference between genders (so much for the stereotype that depicts men as more &quot;rational&quot; than women).

I do not wish to claim too much on the basis of this one survey of a small sample at a particular university, but it was interesting to follow up with a few questions to the students in order to generate causal hypotheses to be tested with additional surveys. The most revealing thing was that most of the nonscience students were philosophy or psychology majors, who actually take courses on the scientific method and on critical thinking. In contrast, science majors are never exposed to that sort of course and spend most of their initial scientific education in large classrooms where somebody who calls himself a professor, and whom they can barely see from a distance, inundates them with a flood of disconnected facts that they are supposed to remember in order to pass the test. Could it be that it is not just education (scientific or not) that matters, but the kind of education we give to our students? If so, what must we do to improve the currently abysmal situation?
How the brain works
When one is interested in understanding what went wrong with education, it may be useful to learn a bit more about the way the brain works, and in particular what neurobiology has found out over the last few years about how we learn (or fail to). This is obviously a huge topic, which by necessity I will have to treat very superficially. However, some of the basics are extremely illuminating. The main point is that the brain is a crucial piece of our biological machinery, and yet we care little about learning how it works or how to improve its functionality. This is like having an expensive car and caring about replacing the tires, polishing the chrome, and making sure all the fluids are there, but completely ignoring the engine -- not a good recipe for a long and happy ownership.
This lack of application of our knowledge about the brain to everyday life is especially astounding in the world of education (with a few exceptions of teachers or schools that are taking the first tentative steps toward making practical use of neurobiological research). It would seem that teachers and college professors should be mandated to take a course in how to help their students make the best of this wonderfully delicate organ that has been so crucial to human evolution and to our very identity as a species of primates.
Perhaps the most astounding piece of evidence on how the brain works and learns (or refuses to) comes from experiments on split-brain patients (i.e., individuals with no connection between the two hemispheres of their brain) conducted by Michael Gazzaniga and other neurobiologists. Neurobiological research on individuals with split brains has shown quite clearly that what we perceive as a unified self is really made of at least two distinct and largely independent components -- one overseen by the right hemisphere, the other by the left hemisphere of the brain. The two hemispheres are normally connected by the corpus callosum, which contains millions of neuronal bridges between the two sides. When the corpus callosum is surgically severed, the two hemispheres behave independently of each other, to the point that they can cause completely contradictory behaviors in an individual.
Experiments on split-brain patients show that the left hemisphere is dominant, meaning that it is in charge of unifying the different inputs from both hemispheres into one coherent narrative. The interesting thing is that we can show experimentally that this narrative is woven a posteriori (i.e., after the fact), as an explanation for what the individual has perceived or done. In a now classic example, a patient with a severed corpus callosum was shown a picture and then asked to pick a complementary picture from a given series (see figure). The experimenter then directed a stimulant-question separately to each of the two hemispheres (which is possible because the left one controls the right side of the body and its visual field, while the right one controls the left side of the body and its visual field; the experiment requires a computer that tracks the movement of the eyes and keeps the image in only one half of the field). The patient gave answers by hand gestures
(because the right hemisphere does not have access to voice control). The right hemisphere was asked to pick out a picture that would go with that of a house covered with snow; the patient picked a shovel. The left hemisphere was asked to pick out a picture that would go with a chicken leg; the patient picked a chicken head.

Here is the interesting bit: When the left hemisphere (which is in charge of language) was verbally asked why the subject picked a chicken head and a shovel (notice that it was unaware of the house with the snow, because of the disconnection between the two hemispheres), the patient answered that he needed a shovel to clean up the excrement from the chicken! In other words, lacking complete information about the shovel (available only to the right hemisphere), the left hemisphere -- our much-vaunted rational self -- made up a story after the fact, the only characteristic of which was that it fit the available information, however awkwardly.
I think this sort of finding has profound implications for the evolution - creation debate and for teaching in general. Our brain is constructed in such a way that it comes up with an explanation (a story) for the world around it. How good an explanation the left hemisphere will create depends on how good the input is from the surrounding world: The better the information provided, the better the model the brain will create. Think of the brain as a virtual-reality device that literally creates not only your perception, but your understanding of the world. If the input is faulty, the device will construct something nonetheless, but as the data become more and more faulty, what is produced will bear less and less resemblance to the real thing.
Neurobiologist V. S. Ramachandran has suggested (in his delightful Phantoms in the Brain : Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind) that one's views on the world or on a particular topic depend on a balance between the respective inputs of the two hemispheres. The right one plays the part of the devil's advocate, always feeding information that may at times be in dissonance with the currently held view. The left hemisphere filters this information in one of three ways: (1) It uses the information to reinforce the currently held view; (2) if the information does not quite fit the prevailing view, it can alter it slightly to accommodate it; or (3) it can temporarily just ignore any information that does not fit.
Ramachandran suggests that when we change our mind about something, the reason is that the amount of information that doesn't fit has exceeded a certain threshold (which is probably variable within the human population) and has caused the left hemisphere to change its story in a radical fashion. Whether you are very gullible, reasonably open-minded, or a die-hard skeptic may depend on the exact constitution of your corpus callosum and the way your left hemisphere handles cognitive dissonance!

Research on critical thinking has found yet another reason why that particular skill is so difficult to teach: The brain is apparently designed to jump to conclusions on the basis of little evidence. The figure shows how we would ideally like our own and our students' brains to work on a problem: We would start with a preliminary study of the topic and form a provisional understanding of the problems involved; we would then defer judgment and move to collect new evidence, after which we would construct an informed belief.
Unfortunately, the human brain has an innate tendency to skip that all-important &quot;defer judgment&quot; phase, going instead from a preliminary understanding to the formulation of a belief. Once the belief is formed, it is very difficult to dislodge because of the innate conservativeness of the left hemisphere. It takes a great deal of cognitive dissonance over a long period of time for a belief to finally be replaced by another one. It is even possible, though this is highly speculative, that this &quot;from understanding to quick judgment&quot; mechanism was favored by natural selection during the ancestral history of humanity, when humans couldn't afford to wait too long before deciding if the spot at the horizon was a gazelle (worth hunting) or a lion (from which they were better off running in the opposite direction). All of this, of course, explains much of the difficulty encountered by the educators and scientists involved in the evolution - creation controversy. Ironically, it
may even be that the major obstacle to understanding evolution in modern society has been put in place by natural selection during crucial phases of primate history!
Interestingly, the findings discussed here have some bearing on the controversy raging within the educational community concerning the wisdom of having scientists debate creationists. In the context of the current discussion, one has to realize that the point of a debate is not to convince people on the spot and carry the day. Expecting that to work would be naive in the highest degree. Rather, because of what we know about how the brain works, the goal should be to plant seeds of doubt, to expose the often unethical tactics of creationists, and to give pointers to interested members of the audience about where to go next. Let the right and left hemispheres of the attendees' brains battle it out over the following months and years and see what they come up with!
I have debated several creationists on many occasions, in front of crowds coming to places as varied as fundamentalist Christian churches and university auditoriums. The results are always positive. I receive plenty of e-mail and other correspondence, sometimes long after the actual debate, from people asking me for more information or sources. They often preface their letters with something like, &quot;I still don't believe what you said, but . . . ,&quot; and it is that &quot;but&quot; that shows that the seed has been planted and is possibly about to germinate. People are unfailingly impressed by the spectacle of a scientist who is actually courteous and makes some sense, especially when they expect a blabbering, egg-headed intellectual or a devil incarnate, complete with horns and tail. Given that these are people who pay the taxes and tuition on which university professors live and conduct their research, it seems only ethically decent to spend a few evenings once in a while trying to
explain to them why we are doing what we are doing.
Finally, I have talked to many people who, because of their upbringing, were hostile to evolutionary ideas and eventually overcame their belief systems. It is important to find out how they did it because that insight provides us with crucial clues as to what works and what doesn't. One thing that doesn't work is the &quot;I'll explain it to you once, and you should be convinced&quot; sort of attitude that underlies the behavior of so many scientists in public. Repetition, and especially repetition by different sources in different formats, is the key.
For some people I know, the road to skepticism started after they read a book by Carl Sagan (or one of his articles in Parade magazine), watched a TV special, attended a debate or a lecture, or simply talked to friends or family. The process of change takes years, and the people who are responsible for this change rarely get feedback from those they have affected. Education may sometimes seem like a thankless, at times wasted, effort, but it isn't. It's just that the physiology of our brains is such that few educators will be around long enough to see the final outcome. Education is a work in progress that lasts a lifetime.
