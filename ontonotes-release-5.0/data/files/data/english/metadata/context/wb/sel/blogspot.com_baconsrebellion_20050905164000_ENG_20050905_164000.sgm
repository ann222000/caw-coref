With a Homeland Security department of 180,000 employees and a $40
billion budget, the five day delay in the federal response to Katrina,
during which Americans died for lack of a 90-cent bottle of water , was,
is, and remains near-criminal.

what happened, what didn't happen, why, how and who.

Barnie, if you want to jump back into this topic, I would suggest
that you broaden your inquiry beyond the federal government. We should
talk also about the criminal culpability of the New Orleans authorities
for mucking things up so badly before the Feds arrived, and the
Louisiana state authorities for botching relief so badly as well. Let's
talk about the 200 New Orleans city school buses sitting unused, in two
feet of water, rather than being used to evacuate citizens. Let's talk
about allowing tens of thousands of residents to accumulate in the super
dome, rather than getting them out of the city. Let's talk about
emptying the city jails of criminals instead of removing them to secure
facilities. Let's talk about the failur to post guards at Wal-Marts and
other outlets where looters could acquire guns and ammo. Let's talk
about a police department with such terrible morale that policement
began deserting their posts. If you want to assigning blame, you cannot
overlook the contribution to this fiasco of one of the most corrupt city
administrations since Tammany Hall.

So, with the Federal govrnment finally ramped up and aid pouring in
at incredible rates, dramatic rescues, functioning shelters, etc. etc.,
we're going back to the blame game. What good is this post? It doesn't
offer any recommendations for now or in the future. What should we do?
Fire the fema guy? Replace him with who? Will his scalp help anybody?
I'd rather have him working his butt off for a few more months before he
gets canned. I sure as hell don't know why nobody could get any water to
the Superdome and that's a terrible, terrible shortcoming of this relief
effort, but dwelling on it now doesn't quench the thirst of one refugee.
I saw this on instapundit--Other federal and state officials pointed to
Louisiana's failure to measure up to national disaster response
standards, noting that the federal plan advises state and local
emergency managers not to expect federal aid for 72 to 96 hours, and
base their own preparedness efforts on the need to be self-sufficient
for at least that period. "Fundamentally the first breakdown occurred at
the local level," said one state official who works with FEMA. 'Did the
city have the situational awareness of what was going on within its
borders? The answer was no." Maybe 72-96 hours is a bad response time,
but it was in the plan.

Of course you are right, Jim, and Anon, too, for that matter. The
failure was top to bottom--no question. But, come on, the real failure
was federal--just as 9/11 was. You don't hold the Port Authority or the
NYPD responsible for that do you? The state of New York? No, I don't
think so. I continue to be surprised by the unwillingness here to hold
people and goverment to account. Accountability is not un-American. At
least to my mind it isn't.

A lot of the blame does rest in FEMA. The Loudon Times newspaper has
a story about a rescue squad that had to be called back because of a
FEMA paperwork foul-up. What about the empty, but completely stocked
Navy hospital ship that followed Katrina in and then sat there for days
because FEMA couldn't figure out what to do with it? I'm sure there were
local screwups as well, but FEMA is tasked with the job of handling huge
disasters. And W hired a guy to head it who had a proven negative track
record and no experience. True, a bunch of cops walked off the job --
but the great majority, from what I read, busted their tails. I think
W's defenders here would be singing a different tune if this happened in
northern VA. Sometimes, guys, you have to admit you voted for the wrong
person. I admitted it after Carter -- I voted for Reagan twice. I wonder
how soon W will get to Nixon's last job performance ratings.

Barnie, I absolutely believe in holding government accountable. I
also believe in ascertaining the facts before holding someone
accountable. It sounds to me that you've already tried and convicted
FEMA, the FEMA director, and George W.

I agree that the buck stops with Dunya, that if FEMA screwed up,
Dubya must take the rap for it. I also have numerous questions about
FEMA's performance. There was a story in the newspaper this morning
about a two-trailer, mobile surgical lab stationed in Chapel Hill, N.C.
-- funded under some Homeland Security program, no less -- that zoomed
down to the disaster zone and then sat around and waited... and
waited... for FEMA to send victims for the surgeons to work on.
Anonymous 7:08 mentions the Navy hospital ship in a similar predicament.
Maybe there was incompetence involved. Maybe there was an excessive
devotion to rules and regulations. Maybe there was no plan.

Or, maybe, with telephone lines down, cell phones down, electricity
down, cable out, state, local and federal emergency organizations using
incompatible communications systems, hospitals being evacuated, hundreds
of thousands of people displaced and a state of chaos reigning... maybe
the situation was so fluid that no one at FEMA or anywhere else had
enough information immediately upon arriving on the scene to (a) locate
and identify the sick people, (b) triage them and decide who should be
sent where, (c) transport them to the appropriate mobile surgical
facilities and hospital ships that materialized.

I just don't know enough to know whether criticism is warranted.
Evidence may surface to suggest that FEMA totally screwed the pooch --
but I haven't seen it yet, and you haven't presented any.

Former President Clinton said there should be hearings and
accountability but now wasn't the time. I think I'll cast my lot with
him right now, not Barnie. Clinton has seen a lot of suffering and
disaster recently and I think he's probably got a good idea of
priorities right now.

That is what ‘m talking about. Thank you Jim. We do not have enough
information to judge .

We can have theories, true. However, who is to blame will take
months, maybe a year or so to decide. However, if Barnie is bond and
determine to fashion a noose, I will say I heard Louisiana Senator
Johnson, a Democrat, on the Today Show this morning say things started
to get better once President Bush showed up on the scene. Thank God the
President did jump in!

If you demand an early call to judgment, I would have to start with
the Jim’s questions about local officials. Barnie, if you already did
not know, the federal government ONLY gets involved AFTER a state
request. Notice that Democrat Senator Johnson said that thinks did not
really happen until after Bush was involved. Why was the federal
response so mess-up in the beginning? My early call is because
information from state officials were so screwed up that the feds did
not know how to react. The department of Homeland Security and FEMA do
not run state disaster agencies.

I predict, when the smoke is cleared, the buck will eventually stop
at the Governor of Louisiana’s deck. On the federal level, I would not
be a bit surprise if FEMA’s head, Michael Brown, were shown the door in
the months to come.

There's been a lot of disinformation after the fact by people
scrambling to protect their careers (if only aid responses were as
coordinated as media responses! The federal deployment of anonymous
sources, talking heads, and coordination of message was awe-inspiring!),
but you just can't avoid the reality here.

We lived through 9/11: a disaster in many ways smaller in its scope
but far more traumatic to American pride and security. We were told over
and over that our leaders were the ones to trust on national security.
That they were rethinking everything, that in the face of a major
threat, we would be organized and streamlined and proactive. But it
really doesn't matter whether NOLA was hit by a hurricane or a terrorist
bomb. The results and failures and just plain tactical ignorance of the
situation went far far beyond "disasters are bound to be chaotic"
excuses. Top to bottom, federal to local, what we saw just was not
acceptable in the least. I feel like we spent the last 4 years
completely wasting our time: if anything, things seemed MORE coordinated
after 9/11. The state and local levels were indeed a mess. But like it
or not, our federal leadership is where this points at: their job is to
make things happen even when the locals fail or are overwhelmed, and
they are the ones we look to in events that rise far beyond state
borders and affect us on a national level.

Michael Brown should never have been put in charge of FEMA. Political
cronies and nepotism are part and parcel of democracy, but that's just
pathetic. And no one from Bush on down should be excused for speaking
falsehoods like "no one thought the levees would fail" to the American
people. I understand the partisan drive to excuse our leaders. But let's
remember that they will only improve if they have to face real
criticism, as opposed to constant, loving stroking and protection.

Like I said, let the governments do the homework. Then assign blame
and take action.

Great piece in Atlantic this year, don't remember the month on 9-11
describing how city officials in NYC starting getting things moving way
beyond their legal authority top contract (ex post facto contracts are
illegal) telling certain providers of energy, lights, machinery where to
go and what to start to do. Fascinating. Didn't happen in New Orleans.

Finding the truth isn't defending Bush. The Founding Fathers expected
our government was only fit for an eduacated and fair populace. Let's be
both. Then demand accountability as the chips fall.

"Across the government there were failures of imagination, policies,
capabilities, and management. The most important failure was one of
imagination." The 637-page 9/11 report.

I don't mean to rush things here--first things first--and all
that--but FOUR YEARS after the fact, will someone please tell me who has
been held accountable for these failures? Who was fired? Who was
demoted? Who was disciplined?

Sure, we will get another commission, another report, on this one.
What I'd rather have is some track record of accountability. There is
none. I guess it is a market thing--no demand for it.

Finding the truth doesn't involve participating in a media blitz to
obscure and lie about the truth either. But that's precisely what's
going on: there's already a war to assign and deflect blame. We have
vast tax-payer funded media resources being deployed to reporters
starving for soundbytes already. I'd rather have the people do the
homework rather than the politicians or lazy reporters that never bother
to check whether what their sources tell them is actually true.

Barnie, No argument on accountability at the right time. I am all for
heads on stakes (Black Beard in Hampton) and drawing and quartering with
parts sent to each end of the realm (William Wallace in England) to, as
the French say "pour encourager les autres", have an object lesson.

I think the 9-11 commission is not a good example. Flawed membership
and agenda.

Were the commissions that demoted Kimmel and Short after Pearl Harbor
off base? Dunno.

For whatever reason, “with telephone lines down, cell phones down,
electricity down, cable out, state, local and federal emergency
organizations using incompatible communications systems, hospitals being
evacuated, hundreds of thousands of people displaced and a state of
chaos reigning” , the situation up to this point lacks a true leader.
That certain someone the public always turns to and places his or her
faith in to get the job done has not yet come to the front.

9/11 had Rudy and the President; the English had Churchill and the
first Gulf War had Schwarzkopf. In time, someone will rise above the
rest and lead us out of this disaster.

To think we will be able to BLAME someone or something for what
happened or didn’t happen is foolish.

However, we can and should be angry at people in positions of
leadership who ultimately fail to lead. This includes everyone, local,
state, and federal.

Being anonymous, trying to claim a track record or extensive
knowledge is futile. However, it's Mr. Day making the claim " come on,
the real failure was federal ", so it's his burden, not mine.

Prior to Katrina, how rapidly does FEMA arrive at disasters?

FEMA made its first transition from nuclear-bomb protection to
disaster relief. The 'relief' consisted of the same 'relief' that State
Farm or Allstate offers: money for damages. One is federal money; the
others are private.

Under Witt, the agency made an astounding transformation from surly,
obstructionist money dispensers to glib, congenial money dispensers.
Response (time and actions) remained the same, but facial expressions
changed.

Now FEMA's (supposedly) making the transition from money dispensers;
to money dispensers plus primary federal first responder. Note that
their title hasn’t been changed to ‘Response’ or ‘Rescue’, it’s
‘Management’.

Nevertheless, to keep it constructive we’re owed two things:

The metric on which FEMA’s to be judged by. Not “people died”
rhetoric. Concrete data: how many responders with what equipment in how
many hours.

The cost of the system that does what Mr. Day wants done.

I can’t recall if he quit the GA before or after financial impact
requirement on bills, but it’s an important consideration. A few aspects
of costs-v-response are posted here .

In the disappearing thread I asked more than once whether anyone had
a strong, reasoned view that the response would have been qualitatively
or quantitatively different if Katrina had hit the same area in 1999 (or
1964, or 1949). I'm still waiting to hear about this. If no one can tell
me "you betcha, NoVA, things would have been a helluva lot better in any
of those years because [fill in the blank], then I'm inclined to do on
thinking that the shortcomings here had nothing to do with partisan
politics and had a lot to do with a huge storm that resulted in massive
flooding that stymied all rational contingency planning. In this
country, natural disaster response is layered from the local level to
state to federal levels. Whatever the concerns about how we are meeting
the needs of our fellow citizens, I think very little has to do with
whether a Republican or a Democrat is in the White House (or the
individual identity of that particular Republican or Democrat). The
issue is how much power we want to give the feds to take the whip hand
in these emergencies from the get-go. How ready are we to tell the
localities and the states to buzz off. If we really are at a point where
we decide as a polity to federalize these events from the beginning,
let's do it and place full blame on the federal government when things
aren' up to snuff. If we want to have local governments as the first
responders, then they have to be willing to accept responsibility for
failure also. I have no doubt that lessons will be learned from this for
all levels of government, but I am a bit put off by political sping of
an enormous natural disaster that tries to hang things around the neck
of the current Administration. To be fair, I suspect that the Clinton
folks would have done no better (although their spin effort might have
been a bit more elaborate). Even though I had little use for those
folks, I would have siad the same thing I'm saying now - this was just
one humongous storm in a very vulnerable region that is neither worse
nor better because of political considerations.

Missing from most of this discussion is the elephant in the corner of
the room: FEMA is not the first responder. The state and local
governments are the first responders. FEMA comes in later.

This comes from a column by Craig Martelle, retired U.S. Marine major
who received FEMA training: "The key to emergency management starts at
the local level and expands to the state level. ... Addressing all
foreseeable contingencies is the absolute requirement of the local
government -- and then they share that plan with the state emergency
managers..." FEMA is not actively engaged in the process.

Before Hurricane Katrina, the city of New Orleans claimed primacy in
planning and coordinating emergency response: "We coordinate all city
departments and allied state and federal agencies which respond to
citywide disasters and emergencies through the development and constant
updating of an integrated multi-hazard plan. All requests for federal
disaster assistance and federal funding subsequent to disaster
declarations are also made through this office."

As it turns out, the New Orleans plan was woefully inadequate, and
the Louisiana state officials weren't much help. As Martelle concludes,
"The failure in the first 48 hours to provide direction for survivors is
theirs to live with. When FEMA was able to take over, it started behind
and had to develop its plan on the fly. Now the federal government has
established priorities -- rescue the stranded, evacuate the city, flow
in resources and fix the levee. It appears there is a plan and it is
being systematically executed.

Is Martelle's description a fair and unbiased representation of the
truth? I don't know. But it is a different version than the one being
peddled by the Blame-Bush-First crowd. At the very least it reaises
critical questions: Is FEMA the first responder, or is state/local
government? Does FEMA develop the emergency response plan, or does
state/local government?

If state/local government catastrophically failed in Louisiana, that
failure would not have been immediately apparent. It would have taken a
day or two for the federal government to recognize that the situation
was out of control and then seize control of the situation. That
explains the delay in the federal response. If this interpretation is
correct -- and I'm honest enough to say that I don't have enough
reliable information at this point to assert that it is -- what we're
hearing from critics like Barnie is an after-the-fact raising of FEMA's
standard of performance. Barnie and allies are saying that FEMA, even
before knowing that Louisiana state/local government had totally botched
the emergency response, should have overridden all state-federal
protocols and taken control anyway.... an act for which Barnie & Co.
then would have promptly crucified Bush as politicizing the disaster or
power grabbing or some other such nonsense.

From a Sept. 5 CNN: New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin told CNN

Kathleen Blanco met to discuss the situation.

NAGIN: The president ... called me in the office after that. And he

Maybe we need the system, ahem, that Fidel has in place. When Ivan
hit Cuba (a glancing blow but still a very powerful storm) no one died,
according to an MSNBC story: “The Cuban way could easily be applied to
other countries with similar economic conditions, and even in countries
with greater resources that do not manage to protect their population as
well as Cuba does,” Salvano Briceno, director of the U.N. International
Strategy for Disaster Reduction, said in Geneva.

In 1998, only four people died during Hurricane Georges, while 600
died elsewhere. This year, Hurricane Charley killed four people in Cuba,
but 27 in Florida."

Apparently the secret is that the entire government is mobilized
before the storm. "What is Cuban President Fidel Castro's secret?
According to Dr. Nelson

>Valdes, a sociology professor at the University of New Mexico, and

>specialist in Latin America, "the whole civil defense is embedded in
the community to begin with. People know ahead of time where they are to
go."

The secret in Cuba is those poor slobs got nothing to lose and like
most folks who live in the tropics they know where not to build (unlike
rich, dumb Americans who expect the government and the insurance
industry to save them.) The City of New Orleans is below sea level! This
was INEVITABLE. People build major mansions and put FLOATING casinos in
the path of a future storm surge? This was INEVITABLE. The only thing
truly infinite in this universe is stupidity. Why blame FEMA for
carrying on the human condition?

This thread is just as disappointing and worthless an exercise as it
was last week, and meaningless since the political fall out, if any, is
more than a year away (2006 Mid Terms).

Lots of time for assessment and finger pointing. I suspect that a big
part of the problem is that the usual effort is just getting swallowed
in the immensity of this area involved -- everybody plans for the last
war -- and too damn many people are asking the government for permission
rather than just doing it. We're going to take lessons from Fidel
Castro? Sure, and Benito M. had the trains running on time.

Wait until the Big One hits in California. This was a hiccup in

Well, we sure as hell didn't do a very good job of planning and
preparing for the current one, which I think has another generation or
two to run. It really shouldn't have been hard to extrapolate from the
Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank to the long American
occupation of an equally hostile but far, far, far larger and more
porous landscape. There was a reason Bush 41 and General Powell stopped
the armored columns where they did in 1991, and more than a decade later
we were no more ready for what they decided not to do. Perhaps the plans
were done in the interim and perhaps not executed. But I remember your
(or somebody's) earlier quotes from Eisenhower about the value of the
process and do not dispute his proven insights.

It is interesting how this discussion has been diverted from the
devastation of Hurrican Katrina to the war in Iraq. It seems that the
Bush haters, when they do not have facts to back up their hatred, revert
to other emotional issues to change the subject. Come on guys, get over
it. You lost. Bush won. Now get on with it.

Jim Bacon is right; let's wait until all the facts are in before we
start fixing blame, if we really need to do that. But I will make one
comment about one of the earlier comments: 'speaking falsehoods like "no
one thought the levees would fail". Let me tell you, no one did think
the levees would fail. Obviously, given the current reality, that was
wrong. But, it was the way everyone down there thought. Being a native,
I speak from some knwledge of the people there. Remember, those levees
held for generations and noone thought they would fail this time.

WTAE-TV CH 4 (ABC) Pittsburgh

09/04/2005 11:00 PM - 11:35 PM [CC] 00:05:40 Senator Rick santorum is
criticizing the government's emergency response to hurricane victims
hurricane katrina victims. But he's also criticizing the ones who chose
to ride out the storm. "I mean, you have people who don't heed those
warnings and then put people at risk as a result of not heeding those
warnings. There may be a need to look at tougher penalties on those who
decide to ride it out and understand that there are consequences to not
leaving."

Doesn't it make you Republicans proud that he's in your party?

"Stupid" is bipartisan, believe me. Why, some of my best friends are
stupid.

Barnie is absolutely right on this. Stupid is as stupid does.

There are some interesting points about the response on this
commentary aired on NPR...for what is worth...

Trust me, I am rarely up at this hour. But the fresh cool
pre-autumnal air and a good book delayed my nocturnal soujourn. I had
Letterman on with the on-screen captions. The appearance of Cokie
(Boggs) Roberts captured my attention. Another "breath of fresh air." I
don't suppose a transcript of her conversation with Dave would be
available. I wish it were. While deeply grievous of her family's
situation, she, I sensed, was somehow not bitter or angry but trying to
come to grips with the enormity of what faces her home region and
looking forward to the relief and rebuilding efforts. Oh that
insta-pundits, insta-critics and insta-bloggers had the same good
judgment.

"There may be a need to look at tougher penalties on those who decide
to ride it out and understand that there are consequences to not
leaving."

I agree. in the 1970's and 1980's there was an insane rush to cross
the Atlantic in the least likely vessel possible.

After the Coast Guard sent a few people bills for the search and
rescue effort some crazy efforts came to a halt.

I'm a Bush disliker, but I agree with your comments. What happened to

I am shutting down this thread and any other thread connected to
Hurricane Katrina -- unless there is a clear and compelling Virginia
angle to it. If you want to assert George Bush's culpability in the
disaster, then fine another blog. If you want to defend George Bush,
find another blog.

If you want to discuss what Katrina means for Virginia, I recommend
any number of posts that already appear on Bacon's Rebellion. Our
contributors have raised any number of serious issues already.
Development of vulnerable coastlines. Erosion of the wetlands that
buffer hurricane storm surges. Evacuation routes out of Hampton Roads.
Reshaping government entities with appropriate size and authority to
respond to emergencies. Empowering communities to respond to
emergencies. Virginia's response to the Katrina catastrophe. The
Governor's response to Katrina.

There are any number of other useful questions that could be
addressed here. What are the major threats that face Virginia? Where are
the gaps? Who has first-responder responsibility, and how long would
they have to operate alone before FEMA could arrive on the scene? What
is the condition of Virginia's emergency communications infrastucture --
how interoperable are state, local and federal communications sytems?

I welcome discussion on any of these topics. However, I will delete
any post that veers back into partisan blame mongering/defending of
President Bush, FEMA or anyone else for their role in Katrina.

This decision is not targeted at any individual or their comments No
one person's actions or comments have inspired this decision. (Salt
Lick, take note: This is not about your use of a particular word.) I
don't blame people for having strong emotions. I just refuse to allow
Bacon's Rebellion to become a forum for bitterness and divisiveness. <
