Veggie and Sausage Supreme Pizza

For the crust
1 seven gram package instant yeast
2 3/4 cups all-purpose or bread flour
1 cup water at 105 F
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
3 tablespoons olive oil

For the filling
1/2 pound mild Italian sausage
about 1 1/2 cups pizza or spaghetti sauce
1 teaspoon dry crushed oregano (optional)
1 tablespoon dry crushed basil leaves (optional)
2 cups shredded mozzarella
about 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
about 1/4 cup diced onion
1/2 bell pepper diced
1/2 cup olives, sliced
1 cup shredded mozzarella, fontina, or gorgonzola cheese
1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese

For the crust
Prepare a 15-inch pizza pan or a 8 1/2 x 13-inch baking pan by greasing
generously with olive oil and sprinkling with corn meal or semolina flour.
Place half the flour and yeast in the bowl of your stand-type mixer. Add
the warm water and beat with a dough hook until it is partially mixed, about
30 seconds. The purpose of this mixing is to hydrate the yeast.
Add the rest of the flour to the bowl. Add the salt, sugar, and olive
oil. Knead with the dough hook at medium speed for four minutes adding
more flour to reach a soft but not sticky dough. Press the dough into the pizza
pan or the baking pan and cover and let stand in a warm place for about 30
minutes or until it is puffy. Complete with the filling as directed.

For the filling
Preheat the oven to 400 F.
Cook the Italian sausage, drain the grease from the cooked sausage, and
pat it free of grease. Set it aside.

Spread the pizza sauce on the pizza dough. Sprinkle it with the optional
oregano and basil and then the 2 cups mozzarella. Spread the cooked
sausage over the cheese. Spread the mushrooms, onions, bell peppers and
olives over the mozzarella. Sprinkle the 1/2 teaspoon of oregano and 1
teaspoon basil over the vegetables. Spread the remaining cheese over the
vegetables. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the crust is brown and the
cheeses are bubbly. Serve hot.
Makes one 15 inch pizza.
