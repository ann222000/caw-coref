LEARNING BHAGAVAD-GITA - LESSON 7.4

*DIFFERENT SCRIPTURE - DIFFERENT  GODS? - 4*

*SCRIPTURES FOR KALI YUGA:*

* *

In the Vedic tradition there are also scriptures for each age.  These
scriptures are meant for specific periods in eternal cosmic cycle.  They are
designed for the people living in those times taking into account their
frailties and virtues.   There are 108 Upanisads.  Among them there is one
Upanishad written for the age known as Kali Yuga (the age in which we
presently live).

This scripture is known as *Kali Santaran Upanishad*.  As the name suggests
it is &quot;the Upanishad to help one cross over the ocean of Kali Yuga&quot;.  The
Hare Krishna Mahamantra - Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare
Hare / Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare -  is mentioned in this
Upanishad.  By chanting these sixteen names of God in form of the Maha
mantra it is said that one can achieve the Goal of life - love of God.

The Bhagavad-gita is spoken by Lord Krishna, at the conclusion of Dvapara
Yuga not only for Arjuna but also the people of the ensuing Kali Yuga.  The
Srimad Bhagavatam was also spoken by Sukhadev Goswami (and repeated by Suta
Goswami), essentially for the people of Kali Yuga.

Thus those who are wise in Kali Yuga would study the *Kali Santaran
Upanishad, Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam.*  By studying these
scriptures, we who are living in Kali Yuga can find relief from the miseries
of this age and attain the goal of life - love of God.

God is available to us through two transcendental media - His Book and His
Devotee.  His Book is full of instruction and information about Him.  His
Devotee, because he lives his life in perfect harmony with His Book, is a
walking scripture.   We should seek out a pure devotee of God.  In his heart
are enshrined the essence of all religious principles.  We should surrender
to him.  Submissively we should inquire about the principle of devotional
life from him.  We should then follow the Scripture that he suggests.

All that is given in the scripture may not often be believable or
acceptable.  Yet when you chant and taste the spiritual nectar of Hare
Krishna Maha mantra you will realize that in due course of time, the enigmas
in the scripture will resolve in a blaze of enlightenment.  This is the
final proof of Scripture within us, by realization.   Hare Krishna !
