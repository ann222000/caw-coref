No word yet on whether Presidente Boosh will order Attorney General
Alberto Gonzalez-Torquemada to prosecute the off-duty civilian-clothed
Border Patrol agent couple and their infant for upsetting the 11-time
arrested Mexican illegal alien by &quot;breathing while American,&quot; aka
criminally engaging in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

As I've pointed out over and over recently (and I sure hope someone is
listening and appropriate action is going to be taken and SOON) what
Americans are increasingly confronted with today are NOT &quot;your
grandfather's illegal aliens&quot; but, rather, SUPER VIOLENT CRIMINALS WHO --
FEELING EMPOWERED BY TREASONOUS U.S. POLITICIANS -- THINK NOTHING OF
ENGAGING IN THE WORST KINDS OF OVER-THE-TOP VIOLENCE AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS,
INCLUDING KNOWN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THEIR INFANT BABIES!

Unarmed ordinary Americans stand NO CHANCE against such foreign thugs in
their midst.

Off-duty Border Patrol agents assaulted

BY JAMES GILBERT
SUN STAFF WRITER
July 5, 2007

Two off-duty U.S. Customs and Border Protection Border Patrol agents from
Yuma were assaulted Monday after stopping at a convenience store by a man
who had been arrested by the agency several times in the past.

[GWA: &quot;Several&quot;? *11* times = merely &quot;several&quot;?]

The agents, who are married and were dressed in plain clothes, stopped at
the store and the husband went inside to make a purchase while she remained
in the car with their infant child.

Border Patrol spokesman Andy Patterson did not have any information on the
location of the convenience store.

According to Patterson, a patron inside the store was staring at the agent
while he made a purchase. The patron then followed the agent out of the
store and got into a sport utility vehicle.

After following the agents, the suspect suddenly rammed the agents' vehicle
with his SUV, causing moderate damage, before fleeing the scene. Neither
the agents nor their child was injured.

&quot;The scary part is there was no justification for it. It could have
happened to anyone,&quot; Patterson said.

Patterson said the agents were able to get the vehicle's license plate
number and report the incident. The Yuma County Sheriff’s Office was also
notified and began searching for the vehicle.

The vehicle was located Tuesday in the driveway of a Somerton residence by
agents who were in the area doing unrelated surveillance, Patterson said.

Patterson said assistance from the Yuma County Sheriff’s Office was
requested and an inspection of the vehicle confirmed it was the same one
involved in the hit-and-run accident.

After questioning the owner of the residence, agents received permission to
search the home and found a male matching the description of the suspect
who rammed the agents hiding in a bedroom.

The suspect was determined to be a Mexican national who was illegally in
the country and arrested. A records check in the Integrated Automated
Fingerprint Identification System revealed he had 11 prior Border Patrol
apprehensions in Yuma.

The suspect admitted to being the driver, but claimed he did not ram the
off-duty agents on purpose and said he fled because he got scared.

He was cited for misdemeanor hit-and-run by the YCSO and is being
prosecuted for illegal entry.

[GWA: from Dictionary.com:

&quot;misdemeanor - an instance of misbehavior; misdeed; a minor crime,
punishable by a fine or a light jail term&quot;

A MISDEMEANOR for ramming a car containing three American human beings,
one of them an INFANT? So now, in 2007, when an illegal alien tries to do
serious bodily harm to/kill Americans with a 2-ton SUV it's merely a
MISDEMEANOR while, at the same time, should a heroic U.S. Border Patrol
agent shoot that same illegal alien in the butt as he sneaks a truckload of
drugs destined for our children into the U.S., the penalty is TWELVE YEARS
IN FEDERAL PRISON?]

“How Eisenhower solved illegal border crossings from Mexico”
By John Dillin
http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0706/p09s01-coop.html

Excerpt:

“General Eisenhower ... quoted a report in The New York Times,
highlighting one paragraph that said: ‘The rise in illegal border-crossing
by Mexican 'wetbacks' to a current rate of more than
1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation
in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters
of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal
Government ...&quot;

“Herbert Brownell Jr., Eisenhower's first attorney general, said the
president had a sense of urgency about illegal immigration when he took
office.

“America ‘was faced with a breakdown in law enforcement on a very large
scale,’ Mr. Brownell said. ‘When I say large scale, I mean hundreds of
thousands were coming in from Mexico [every year] without restraint.’&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, the majority of illegal aliens who are here are engaged in
criminal activity. Identity theft, use of fraudulent Social Security
numbers and green cards, tax evasion, driving without licenses represent
some of the crimes that are engaged in by the majority of illegal aliens on
a daily basis merely to maintain and hide their illegal status. In
addition, violent crime and drug distribution and possession is also
prevalent among illegal aliens. Over 25% of today's federal prison
population are illegal aliens. In some areas of the country, 12% of
felonies, 25% of burglaries and 34% of thefts are committed by illegal
aliens.&quot;

-- Testimony of District Attorney John M. Morganelli before the House
Subcommittee on Immigration, Border, Security and Claims [Note: 99% of
warrants for murder in Los Angeles, California -- the USA's 2nd
most-populous city -- are for illegal aliens]

&quot;It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate,
tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of
men.&quot;
-- Samuel Adams

&quot;“All great truths begin as heresies.”

-- Former Democrat Governor of Colorado Richard Lamm, official of
Defend Colorado Now, a movement opposed to illegal immigration
and public services for illegal aliens
