You can't. In conspiracies like these the truth is irrelevant. It
is the conspiracy that matters. Anything to sustain their
conspiracy is automatically accepted as the absolute truth.
Anything that does not maintain their belief is automatically
dismissed outright.

The psychology behind conspiracy theorists is fascinating. A lot
of it has to do with feeling disenfranchised and powerless.
Knowing something bad, real or not, gives them the feeling of power.

Exactly.  It starts from being a worthless sissy, and from there it's
all power from lies and hate.  Muslims know how to lie, and stooges
fall for it every time.  The conspiracy itself is an agenda to turn
Americans against America, and to deflect attention from the rag-head
killers.

The truly amazing thing is that in the face of the overwhelming evidence
against the use of explosives,
there are still idiots that can't seem to let it go.

Good post David V.  Some of these conspiracy theories are so absurd
you wonder how anybody can could even consider such a thing.
