Someone here posted a story about some cherry juice going alcoholic, and
there was brief talk about fermenting fruit juice. I just wanted to clarify
this, as it's an interesting idea.

So, could you get a plastic bottle of, say, guava juice or something, put in
some sort of yeast, and end up with alcoholised juice? I must be missing
something, it must be harder than that?

The only part you really missed was about putting it in a plastic soda
bottle so the juice bottle won't explode.  I am brewing tomarrow, some
of the yeast will go toward this project.

In a PET bottle, yep, got that.   So, let me get this straight: you'd
sanitize everything as per beer, get some nice juice... would you warm it at
all? Or get a cooler yeast, like for lager?
Then put the yeast in the juice, and put it all in a PET bottle... (or put
juice in PET first, and add yeast to that?).
Any kind of juice to avoid eg orange? Too acidic?

The main thing is to make sure the juice doesn't contain any
preservatives.  If it does, I'm not sure how to cure this as I've only
fermented cider straight from the orchard, someone else may be able to
help with that.
I have left &quot;fresh&quot; cider in the fridge for a few months and ended up
with something a little more &quot;tangy&quot; with pressure in the bottle.
If you find something to use, ferment at ale temps, at least that is
what I have done.
As for orange juice, I've only used fresh squeezed for mead starters.
Cheers,

I am no expert but I would avoid anything that you haven't seen
fermented to under 20% alcohol before.  Orange juice, strawberries,
etc.  Odds are things like that won't work too good.

This is the basic procedure for wine/cider production. You take some
fruit juice, add yeast and wait.
I would use a glass gallon jug and an airlock myself, but whatever
makes you happy. You might

They don't call that &quot;wine&quot; around here?

I had made 5 gallons of wine from guava nectar by getting the appropriate
volume of Del Valle guava nectar, and then adding enough sugar to bring its
original gravity to about 90 points.  It finished dry and needed a little
extra sugar to dull the bite.

I did something similar with a gallon of Ocean Spray cranberry juice.  I
think they add coloring to it because the resulting wine was more like a
blush, but it was very tasty.

As others have said, beware preservatives.  Not all of them are bad, but
you shouldn't get a ton of something that has sorbates, for example; do a
test batch first with a small amount.

I have some and they are OZ-Tops.  They may be great,
but you can buy bungs (with air-lock holes) that fit
into two liter bottles to accomplish the very same
thing.  Bungs for gallon bottles also fit into 3 liter
boottles.

Go to the store and purchase concentrate or juice.  But
read the label carefully to make `certain' that no
preservatives have been added.  Read the following URL
winemaking.jackkeller.net/request181.asp

Jack Keller is a high priest of winemaking.  He used
sugar.  I used honey.  A glass of this stuff before
going to bed appears to be a cure for my chronic
insomnia.

I also have done this with apple juice once with honey
and once with sugar.  IMO honey makes a better brew.
I found my recipe for Chateau Trailer Park which
explains how to do it with Kool-Aid and will post it.

2 litres?! What's the use of that? It'd want to be very good indeed.

The cap must be a one way pressure valve, like those plastic bags you use to
get rid of the air and pack in more luggage.

Nice idea. I have a giant glass container I used to use for aging port, it
has a push-on plastic lid. Perfect. It's huge.

Er, so, any special yeast to use? So far I've only made beer, and with lager
yeasts. I figure this fruit thing uses ale-y type warmer yeasts?   Any
recommendations?

My mother farms 900 apple trees, I guess it's time i did the logical and
made the juice alcoholic (we sell the apples, which are tree-ripened (and
minimum sprayed, we use biological controls), at a very good price to all
the people who come to the farm to buy them).  Some of our customers are
from the old yugoslavia, and love to trade stuff, to barter, rather than use
money. So we get amazing salamis, bread, hams, grape cuttings no one's ever
heard of, and &quot;apple cider&quot;. This stuff could ignite nuclear bombs, it ain't
cider. Dunno if they distill it, or just brew it, but it's nostril-burning
stuff.

As for the kool-aid, we call it Cordial here, and I do not believe you could
alcoholise it! nice if you could though. I guess there's sugar there.

Winemaking is actually easier than beer if you use juice kits.  If you

I suspect they don't have those here in Oz. I've not seen them. I've had
some awsome home-made wines from friends in the US, but bugger-all here in
Oz, and there's nothing in my brewshop for plonk although the owner reckons
he has clients who make wine.  he flogs them yeasts and stuff for what they
do. He gets upset when they are after sodium metabisulphate for sanitising
(and rightly too). awful stuff.

I had the most amazing home-made apricot plonk from a mate in utah, who was
from Pocitello in Idaho, who was a kicked-out mormon. This stuff was lovely,
with a fine almost champagne-like bead/effervescence. I'd have not known it
was from apricots if he'd not told me. Very professional stuff.  He used to
drive tanks, so there you go.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_metabisulfite

At the local brew club meeting this came up the other day when 20 or
so people spent over an hour talking about the best ways to make
pumpkin ale.  One person suggested that in oder to stop the yeast
before they eat up all the pumpkin flavor[0] was to kill them all off
with sodium metabisulphate.

What other sanitiser would you recomend if this was path that someone
wanted to go for retaining pumpkin flavor in there beer?

[0] try the blue moon pumpkin ale for an example of a pumpkinless
pumpkin ale

That sounds kind of neat for someone who is curious about starting the hobby
but is not certain how.  Except for those pressure release caps, doesn't
sound like much for the experienced brewer.

But, yes, just might help someone who wants to start.  However, that short
wait, 2 weeks, sounds nice for &quot;in a pinch&quot;...

If you're chronically &quot;time challenged&quot;.

You're saying that you just hold the plastic wrap on with the rubber
band, no cap?  Doesn't sound like it would hold much pressure at all,

Remember to watch it for overpressure. The juice you had before was probably
only slightly fermented. Fermenting the juice to completion will likely result
in over-pressurization, with multiple possibilities of problems. Lightly
fermented apple cider is a delicious sweet drink in my experience. Any other
juice would likely be similar. I would taste it periodically during fermentation
just to learn where it can go along the way.  Just disturb the bottle enough
after tasting to make it foam enough to push out any air, if you are worried
about oxygenation, although I've had no such problems with cider.

Right, I was thinking still. If you want fizzy just prime it when you
bottle
like any bottle conditioned beer.

Nah... it's easier than beer... no boiling necessary, etc.  Find a
homebrew store and buy a kit and try it...  You can use your beer

They probably add sugar and/or honey to it to kick up the alcohol
content a good bit.  You don't have to do that.  It's also probably
&quot;young.&quot;

If you just ferment the juice only, it is very good.  It helps to let it
age a while.  The first batch I made was best after about 1 or 2 years.
It had a little honey in it and tasted very much like a Chardonnay.

So.... start a couple batches up this year and another batch or two
every year to get your pipeline started!

You can make it sparkling like beer or still like wine - your choice,
it's good both ways.  I bottle it in beer bottles.

Hmmm... I have a batch that is just now a year old... time to break a
bottle out and see!

holy crap.

Well, I'll get a water vent thing and make a hole in the plastic lid of my

OK, big question, what kind of yeast to use, and how much?  I've only made
the standard 23 litres of beer.  What's the proportion of yeast to fruit
juice to use?

This might be fun.

I'm pretty sure my homebrew store hasn't got anything for wine, or weird

they have some kits for ginger beer and apple cider, but that's about it.

No pressure necessary for &quot;wine&quot; ... which is normally &quot;still.&quot;  You

No need to &quot;fine&quot; it, especially if you allow it to sit for a long time.
You can just rack off the sediment several times until you have perfectly
clear wine.  (For the cider I've made, it may take a year or more to
become perfectly clear by gravity settling.)

Making alcoholic apple cider is absolutely dead simple.  Put juice in a
clean container, add yeast, wait, drink!  ((If the juice isn't pasturized,
then I understand the natural yeast from the apples will make good cider
naturally, with some slight risk of bacterial spoilage  - but I think
I'd still add some yeast.))  For yeast, I've used the normal dry ale
yeasts, Nottingham, Coopers, etc.  Then just rack occasionally until
it is clear enough for you.  Bottle.  (OR... bottle earlier and let it
sit and clear in the bottles.)  Add some sugar at bottling if you want
it carbonated/sparkling.

For my first batch, I added a quart or so of honey, diluted to a gallon,
in 4 gallons of juice.  That produced a very Chardonnay tasting drink
in a year or two.  Here are my notes:
http://geocities.com/derric1961/history/brew022.html
(&quot;SO&quot; is the brand of juice/honey I used).  Technically, honey in cider
makes a &quot;cyser.&quot;

There are complications in wine-making regarding acid levels and other
stuff...  for kits, that's already handled for you.  For cider I don't
think it is a problem.  All-in-all it is simpler than beer.

Jack Keller has all kinds of &quot;fruit&quot; wine recipes here:
http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/
At the bottom, he has &quot;introduction to&quot; and &quot;getting started&quot; pages and
recipes.  I made one of his peach recipes and it is excellent - and is
still aging in a carboy at 1+ years old.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

In general, yes.  I think that most &quot;straight&quot; apple juice will ferment
to something in the 8-10% range.  If you want a more wine-like 14% or so,
you can add sugar/honey/etc.  Ie., you control the alcohol level with
how much sugar you add.  Adding sugar to fruit wines is &quot;normal&quot; ...
sometimes LOTS of sugar (in some recipes).

In my admittedly limited experience, using standard
US apple cider you'll get something like a 4-5% abv
beverage.
That said, I chatted a bit with a commercial cider
and mead maker in Cornwall this past spring, and he
said the cider-specific varieties of apples they use
yield higher abv... my memory is hazy but I think he
was talking 8% or so.

OK, I poked around the supermarket today, getting ideas. (pity orange juice
is out, they all seem to have mostly this).

Now, yeast comes in sachets. When I do my beer, it comes in a sachet.  The
sachet does 23 litres of beer! I won't have 23 litres of juice (since you
can't do orange juice), it'll be quite a bit less.

So how do you throw in the right amount of yeast? It must be about a pinch,
for your average bottle of juice. And you can't sticky-tape up the sachet
for future use, after taking a pinch, can you?

And why can't we use baker's yeast for this stuff?! I make a lot of pizza
dough, so I have a container of yeast for that in the fridge. It'd sure make
things a lot easier.

You can as long as you keep it refrigerated.
What I do is
- buy a 2 liter bottle of Juicy Juice or two cans of frozen

dissolve two pounds into it;
- Add all of it to a 4 liter jug an fill with water leaving
adequate head room, and shake the hell out of it;
- add a teaspoon of pectic enzxme, put a bung and an
airlock on it, and let it sit for a day or two;

- it helps a lot if you pump qxygen into it for 60 seconds

- about three hours later, add 1/4 tsp of yeast nutrient;
- let it sit in a dark place for 10 days.
