Dissolution of the Yorkshire District Bank.

On Wednesday week, a special general meeting of the shareholders of this establishment took place in Leeds; Sir J. Simpson, of York, in the chair.  It appears that in February last a committee was appointed, consisting of Mr. Murgatroyd and three other gentlemen, to inquire into the affairs of the company, and to report.  The meeting on the 5th was specially convened to receive the report of this committee, and also to take such steps as might be deemed most advisable.  The report stated that the losses would amount to four-fifths of the annual capital (£800,000); and as the trust deed required a dissolution when the loss amounted to one-fourth of the capital, the report recommended an immediate dissolution; and also the establishment of a new company, as the Yorkshire Banking company, with a capital of £500,000, in 25,000 shares of £25 each.  After a long and noisy discussion, a resolution framed in consonance with these views was carried almost unanimously.  The meeting lasted upwards of four hours.  Nearly one-fourth of the proposed new capital was subscribed at the meeting, and the new company having been provisionally formed, a meeting, was forthwith held of the new proprietors, and preparations made for commencing business on the following morning (Thursday).
The notes of the District Bank were refused payment on Thursday.
