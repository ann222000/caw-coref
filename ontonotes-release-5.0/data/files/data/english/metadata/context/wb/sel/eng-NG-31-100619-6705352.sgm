First off, I just bought a Nokia BH-900 headset. According to the
manual, you should only use either an AC-3, AC-4 or DC-4 charger with
the BH-900. However the charger that came with the headset was a Nokia
ACP-12C.

Secondly, and more importantly, I plugged in the headset as stated in
the manual for it to charge. It says it takes about 2 hours to charge
fully. Also it states that the LED should be continuously red during
charging, and that the LED should turn to green once the headset is
fully charged.

Now for my problems...

The LED was red when I first plugged it in, then went out after about
10 minutes. No red, no green, no light at all. The headset was not
moved at all, and was not bumped. Also, after the light goes out, if I
unplug it, then plug it back it, the light stays red, then goes out
after 10 seconds.

Secondly this is my second BH 900 to do this!!! From 2 different
sellers! I find it hard to believe that I have received 2 faulty
headsets in a row, but I guess it's possible.

I'm thinking that because I'm using the ACP-12C, it might have burnt
out the headset, but that's the charger that came with it, from both
sellers.
Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks
