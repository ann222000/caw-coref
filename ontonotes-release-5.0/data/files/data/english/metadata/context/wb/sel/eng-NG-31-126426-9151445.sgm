Hi!
I've received a weird email from &quot;Gmail&quot; saying I need to verify my
account within 2 wks or risk loosing it.

Even odder they ask for my id, password and dob, country.  So I'm sure
this isn't legit.

Its coming from email: Gmail Customer Care
&lt;customercareverifydat ... @gmail.com&gt;

uses the gmail logo as well.

I use this email constantly so I know theres no question of activity
here.

Also, I've been looking for a contact with gmail to froward this for
review, and can't find anywhere to send it.

please advise!

Just ignore it.  This is a scam that tries to get your account information.
Fill out the form here
https://services.google.com/inquiry/gmail_security4and just delete the
message.  If you have already entered any information,
change ALL your passwords right away.  Also, any real Google email address
would be emplo ... @google.com, not gmail.com

Tex,

Kellcia didn't have your address (until you replied).  They posted to
the GMail Users' Google Group, which you did too by replying.  You
signed up for this user group and elected to receive e-mails
(apparently), so that's why you're seeing them in your inbox.  If this
is not your intention, there are links at the bottom of each post
where you can visit the site on the web, and modify your subscription,
choosing different types of delivery options, or unsubscribing
completely.

Could Kellcia report the email as phishing?  Thats what it is.  Other than
that, as others have said, ignore it.  If you don't know who it is asking
for that type of personal information, than you're an idiot if you gave it,
but in this case you didn't :-)

Kellcia,
I would find a phone number for G-Mail, or call Google and raise hell
to verify or is it a scam.

This is a scam.  There is no point trying to call Google. IF you do get to a
person, they will just tell you it's a scam.  Anytime any &quot;company&quot; sends
you an email saying you have to verify your account information or your
account will be terminated, you are getting scammed.

Geesh!  I was simply trying to notify gmail or other users of this
potential scam,
of course I'm not an idiot to give out my information!

Thanks Nick, I will do as suggested to report it, I just thought gmail
should know what scams are going on in their name

Another option, to get what you THOUGHT you signed up for.  Is to do
no-e-mail as J Rudick says he does, and if you are on the web and make
a new post, or are particularly interested in a thread you see, you
can select options on the web post, and select &quot;Email updates to me&quot;.
This seems to give the result you were looking for Tex.

Kellcia,

Chill out...no big deal.  Didn't call you an idiot, you did the right
thing.  Just stating, that if someone DID do that, then THEY would be the
idiot.  Just report it, Google wont talk to you in human form, they are &quot;too
busy&quot;.  And you did the right thing, you alerted other people to this scam,
and the best way to do that was this group email list.
