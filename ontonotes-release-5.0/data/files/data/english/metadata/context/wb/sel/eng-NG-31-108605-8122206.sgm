Lest everyone think Jack Murtha's desire to see the troops come home
from Iraq makes him a goody-two-shoes, know that he indulges in the
Congressional sport of earmarking. He is champ at the game, in fact.
Ted Stevens can't even remember to pay his fake bookkeeper and still
gets his multi-peso bridges in the budget. But Teddy is not on the
House Appropriations defense panel, where the real money is.

Murtha's $150B in earmarks is, of course, the known total. As Rumsfeld
used to say there known knowns and there are unknown unknowns.

Even though the panel disclosed the project name, the requesting
member, and the budget line in which the project was requested, the
bill and its earmarks are not a model of transparency. The panel did
not disclose either the amount requested or the companies that would
benefit. Taxpayers for Common Sense (TCS).paired the disclosed
requests in the committee report with the dollar amounts for the
projects published in the bill.

requested $5 million for a littoral sensor grid.

Murtha nabs $150M pork
By Roxana Tiron

Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriations defense
panel, has secured the most earmarked dollars in the 2008 military
spending bill, followed closely by the panel's ranking member Rep.
Bill Young (R-Fla.).

Even though Young secured 52 earmarks, worth $117.2 million - and co-
sponsored at least $27 million worth of others -  Murtha's 48 earmarks
amount to a total of $150.5 million, according to a database compiled
by the watchdog organization Taxpayers for Common Sense (TCS).

The House is expected to take up the $459.6 billion defense
appropriations bill Friday. It contains 1,337 earmarks, costing $3.07
billion, which is less than half the number and value of earmarks in
last year's bill.

Keith Ashdown of TCS said, however, that the sum is derived from only
the earmarks that the panel disclosed at the back of the bill's
report. He expects to find undisclosed projects as well.

&quot;It appears that they are in keeping with the House commitment to
reduce earmarks by 50 percent,&quot; Ashdown said. &quot;There are less
[earmarks], but it is early and we have not looked at everything.&quot;

The 2008 bill for &quot;the first time gives us a snapshot [of] how the
committee allocates taxpayers' resources,&quot; Ashdown added.

Even though the panel disclosed the project name, the requesting
member, and the budget line in which the project was requested, the
bill and its earmarks are not a model of transparency. The panel did
not disclose either the amount requested or the companies that would
benefit. TCS paired the disclosed requests in the committee report
with the dollar amounts for the projects published in the bill.

This year is the first in which earmarks were disclosed under new
House rules mandating that lawmakers identify their earmarks in
letters to the committee certifying that they have no financial
interest in the project. The report accompanying the bill contained a
chart listing projects and sponsors, but not the amounts of the
earmark.

Still, it is clear that the chairman and ranking member are doing well
in this year's defense-spending bill, Ashdown added.

Murtha, the defense industry's darling, has been known throughout his
tenure on the defense panel to shell out a large number of earmarks.
His biggest earmark in the bill is $23 million for the National Drug
Intelligence Center (NDIC), a move that sparked a fierce fight with
Rep. Todd Tiahrt (R-Kan.), who earlier this year voted in a private
meeting to strip Murtha's earmark.

The Bush administration requested $16 million to shut down the center,
which is in Murtha's district, because it replicated the work of a
similar center.

Murtha's second highest earmark is for $15 million for a military
molecular medicine initiative.

Young has several requests valued at $5 million for projects such as
ballistic missile range safety technology, the Common Aero Vehicle
(another missile program) and rapid-response counter-measures to
chemical and biological weapons.

The embattled former Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. Jerry
Lewis (R-Calif.), also claims a big haul of earmark dollars, totaling
$95 million. He made some requests with Reps. Ellen Tauscher (D-
Calif.) and Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), including $2 million for an
integrated propulsion analysis tool, which would benefit Advatech
Pacific, a company represented in Washington by Innovative Federal
Strategies.

A partner of the firm is Letitia White, Lewis's former Appropriations
defense  staff member. She was formerly with the firm Copeland Lowery
Jacquez Denton &amp; White. Federal investigators are reportedly looking
into the connection between Lewis, White and Bill Lowery, the
lawmaker's longtime friend. Lewis also asked for $3 million to fund
the Lewis Center for Education Research.

Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.), one of the most senior defense
appropriators, was able to secure $44 million in earmarks, including
$1 million for medical technology to look into rare blood diseases. He
made that request with Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.). The two also
requested $5 million for a littoral sensor grid.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) got her share of pork projects - 11
projects valued at $37.3 million.

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's (D-Md.) haul is $26 million.

The lion's share of the earmarks can be found in the research,
development, test and evaluation budget account. Some of the biggest
requests in that account include $21.8 million for &quot;electronic combat
and counterterrorism training&quot; by FATS Inc. of Georgia, sponsored by
Jack Kingston (R-Ga). Kingston secured $55.3 million in total
earmarks, some of which he made with Rep. Jim Marshall (D-Ga.) and
Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.).

Another high request in the research account comes from Rep. Duncan
Hunter (R-Calif.), who got $19 million for an &quot;affordable weapons
system,&quot; according to Laura Peterson of TCS.

According to TCS, candidates for the non-defense  earmark category
include the Christian Sarkine Autism Treatment Center, which received
$2.5 million from Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), the Center for Genetic
Origins of Cancer at the University of Michigan, which got $3 million
from Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), and
$1.5 million for an eponymous project at the National Bureau for Asian
Research in Seattle, sponsored by Rep. Dicks.
