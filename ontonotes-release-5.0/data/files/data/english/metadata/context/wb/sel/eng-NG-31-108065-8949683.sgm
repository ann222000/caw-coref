Be advised that Roundup is highly controversial, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup . Any toxic effects would most
likely manifest themselves in your son, who is still in his maturation
process.

I would recommend that you use the no dig, lasagna technique and cover
the allotment with cardboard or several layers of newspaper, cover with
compost (if possible), sprinkle on some bone meal, spread a layer of
manure (to taste), and cover with mulch.

Get a copy of &quot;Teaming with Microbes&quot; (check library), and figure out
what you want to plant in the spring.

You are learning the first lesson of gardening - how to cope with weeds.

I wouldn't advice using Roundup in a food garden or if you have a child
whose condition may be sensitive to modern day chemicals, just plug away at
the soil preparation and get that right from the start.  As (and if) you
continue your gardening life, you will find that the soil is the MOST
important part of gardening and growing stuff comes secondary over time.  By
that I mean that you will learn that if your soil is right, then you will
never have any trouble growing things (if you don't try to grow things that
are either out of season or not suited to your climate)

thanx for the reply [not cheared me up though ] the ground is rock hard
and undigable so would the second part of my plan be a good idea
spreading manure over the site leaving it covered with a plastic sheet
untill i can get it rotivated i already have the sheet enough to cover
the whole plot .i got that f.o.c. from my brother inlaw i thought it
may make it easier to tackle the weeds as it would be easier to dig?
another idea i have is to make raised beds and move the weed free soil
into these but put cardboard under the weeded soil to prevent any
coming back up ? would 6 inches be high enough ? i could add extra
[6inches] on top in a year or twos time

What about raised beds?

No soil is so bad that it can't be improved.  I started my vegetable bed by
digging a plot about 6 ft long and about 3 ft wide - for several years it
was known as &quot;the Tomb of the Unknown Gardener&quot;.  I dug this in what was
rough native pasture grass in &quot;soil&quot; that had first ever in history been
cleared of trees in the late 1960s.  No soil improvement had ever been done
on it and I have to say that it was bloody ghastly - it was pale yellow in
colour, it was like concrete and I never saw a worm for several years.  I
worked for days with a pick doing half inch indentations and then putting a
sprinkler on and going back the next day to do a few more half inch pick
indentations etc.  My Brother in law eventually took pity on me and helped
me get it down about 4 inches into the ground.  My soil is now full of worms
and getting to be a good dark chocolate colour but still has further to go.
I use mountains of manure of any sort I can get my hands on.

My advice would be to make sure the soil is very moist and if it isn't moist
then water it or do as I did with my pick before watering, put on as much
poop as you can get your hands on, cover it with the plastic and leave it as
long as you can.  If you can get to the allotment and pull back the plastic
and rake back the poop, dig by hand with a fork a small section at a time
and then rake back the poop when you are done and put the plastic back and
keep doing that till you've done the whole area.  I recomend this because as
you a re in the UK, you are in winter and now is a good time to let the poop
sit and let the worms get to it.  Learn about worms, they are your friends
in the garden as is all soil biota.  The soil biota all do a huge amount of
work for you and you want to encourage them by disturbing them as little as
possible and machines do disturb them. Do everything you can to encourage
the build up of that soil life.  If your plot has had blackbverries on it,
then as irritating as they are to get rid of, they do improve the soil.
also if it has been an allotment in the past, it should have had some soil
imporvement done on it so you shouldn'be be too discouraged.

I know this cite won't fit the situation you find yourself in, but this site
has been inspirational to me in the past and may help you realise that it
CAN be done with a bit of patience and by working with nature, not against
it.  Start small, don't bite off more than you can chew and just keep at it,
bit by bit.  The more you learn the more you'll realise what a satisfying
(if occasionally infuriating) hobby you have taken on.

one thing to consider clearing an overgrown garden is how much space are you
going to use in your first year. You can slash everything down but if you
don't use it then the regrowth will simply come back. If you plan to leave
part of the area fallow and grow on the rest, why use round up to kill the
residual rubbish? Simply keep it covered for a season or 2 will deal to most
weeds without the need of any weedkiller. Slash away the weeds and on the
area you do not want to use chuck a good layer of poop across it and then
cover with something that will block light. Black plastic will be ok but
better still some old wool carpet or (better still) hessian type carpet
underlay. That will be heavier than plastic and will itself degrade
improving your soil. Don't bother with synthetics. You could also use well
weighed down large cardboard boxes. The weeds will die through lack of light
and when you want to get the rest of the land into production chances are
you will find a nice growing medium underneath the mulch. I have done this
and didn't need to use chemicals. The lack of light cleared the weeds.
