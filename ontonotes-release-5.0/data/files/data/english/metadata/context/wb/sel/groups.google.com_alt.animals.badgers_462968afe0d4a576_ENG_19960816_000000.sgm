After a week’s holiday, the nights are drawing in rapidly, and I set
off for the cubs sett on my bike at 7.30 p.m. in order to make sure
that I was in good time. When I got to the wood, I found that there
was a steady breeze blowing down the valley across the face of the
sett, so I decided that I could try for some close-up video. I had
seen enough of where the badgers liked to play and the directions they
took to leave the sett to know that I would probably be undetected at
a tree about ten yards from the main hole. I quickly crossed the
boggy ground in the bottom of the valley, and took my stand, quietly
removing the twigs from the trunk of the tree at my back which could
betray my movement later.

As I stood leaning against the tree, I could hear the cattle browsing
in the water meadow behind me, and the local robin singing his evening
song. A blur of wings resolved itself into a small bird which
alighted near the base of the tree in front of me, and then
industriously moved up the tree examining the bark - a tree-creeper.
When it reached a spot about twelve feet up, it flew to another tree
and started again from the bottom of the trunk upwards. The low
background hum of the wood signalled plenty of pickings for him and
other insect-eaters.

The cubs came out fighting. They fell over the edge of the mound
outside the hole and rolled in a ball down the slope to the floor of
the valley, where they continued to attack each others ears and tails
with fierce vigour. Suddenly one broke away and bounded up the
valley, pursued by the other until, after a short distance, it whirled
at bay and threatened his sibling with lowered head and fangs exposed.
A brief parade before each other was ended by a swift pounce and the
whirling wrestling match continued.

Mother came to the entrance and stood on the mound watching her
offspring, somehow conveying a hint of maternal anxiety. Both cubs
bounded up the slope and greeted her, one by climbing onto her back
and attempting to chew her ears, and the other by doing a “bum-press”
on her side, and then continuing the scrap with the other cub. For a
long time, the cubs played with seemingly inexhaustible energy, while
mother watched, groomed herself occasionally, and sometimes got
scragged by the cubs.

Eventually, she ambled off up the slope from the sett, following a
path which lead through a thorn bush near the edge of the wood. The
cubs followed, still bouncing, still scrapping. Almost immediately,
the other adult emerged and, after a brief scratch, followed them.
The wood bordered a grass field in which cattle were grazing, and I
wanted to find out where my badgers were headed. Were they going into
the field, or travelling up the wood towards the road?

I quietly walked up the floor of the valley, watching the skyline
above me and listening for badger sounds. When I came to a barbed
wire fence across the valley, I examined the bottom strand closely for
badger hairs, and looked for signs of a regular path up the wood, but
there were neither. If these badgers did regularly go across the road
to Quesse Wood and the other sett, they must go up into the field
first. I returned towards the sett, and froze as I heard the snorting
and rustling noises of a foraging badger. It was above me at the edge
of the wood, silhouetted on the skyline as it rooted in the grass.

I moved on, looking for the others, but one of them must have seen me
first, for there was a sudden rush and scamper along the path back to
the sett. Back at my original stand, I watched with binoculars as the
remaining badger came cautiously down the slope towards the bottom of
the valley along which I had walked just a few minutes before. It was
one of the adults, and from the broad head, I took it to be the male.

When he came to my trail, he nosed the ground cautiously, and then an
extraordinary change came over him as all of his body hairs stood on
end. With a body grotesquely enlarged by the outstretched fur,
apparently surrounded by a halo due to the white tips to each hair, he
stalked along the valley floor on legs which seemed unnaturally long,
a few steps at a time. The hairs on the head remained flat, making it
seem small in proportion to the body, and he glared from side to side,
looking for the source of the alien taint upon the ground. He had
suddenly changed from an animal which exuded bumbling good nature
mixed with caution to one which conveyed menace, and barely suppressed
violence. Looking through the binoculars, I felt a rush of adrenalin
as the quiet wood for a moment lost its ordinary safe quality and just
for a moment seemed to be owned by a being with power and baleful
intent, but the feeling disappeared as quickly as it came.

The badger returned to the hole where the others greeted him, and
after some reassuring scratchings and groomings, the family again
wandered off. I left in the opposite direction, pondering on their
astonishing tolerance of my disturbance.
