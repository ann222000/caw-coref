Ta-Da!--POOF! Like Magic!

This is a quote from The Coming Disaster in the Derivatives Market:

"For most people, the term "derivative" has little meaning. In many cases, the mere mention of the word is enough to cause eyes to glaze over. That is partly because these financial instruments are somewhat ethereal. They are, in other words, largely created out of thin air. Practically speaking, they have no value in and of themselves."

JUST LIKE INTEREST!!! Hel-looooo, is there anybody there? We're being HAD!!!

And, don't kid yourself; if you think it's not going to affect us little guys who don't even know what derivatives are, let alone invest in them, THINK AGAIN!

As usual, we will be the first to suffer.
