Since the radio has a wrong speaker and some other gizmo bolted
to the underside of the radio board... I would say that the speakers
and the Amp Power supply has been missing for sometime... and someone
tried to dummy it up to make it work...

the top chassis could be made to operate as a complete radio if you
added a power supply and wired it into the terminal strip on the
backside of the radio chassis... and added an output transformer..

would guess that something like that has happened in this radios
past... radio chassis looks to be rusty also...

Whoever buys this probably has a chassis set with no cabinet . The
missing pieces are all virtually unobtainable in their original

it will be interesting to see how much this one goes for.

Actually I think he just plain hates himself and therefore has to take
that out on everyone else.

and Yup... Alan I think has a complete set of guts and no cabinet.. and
I know where another set of partial chassis lives... a top and a bottom
one... no additional speakers other than Alans set though... this
cabinet is definitely going to make a whole radio from parts..

I guess the question becomes... if you had a complete set of chassis
and speakers... and no box .... what would you pay for a nice box?
Knowing that when you get it.. your looking at a 55k to 70K radio...

Some new pictures of my strat here...

http://johnjeanantiqueradio.com/strat-restore.htm

I have the electronics part all done and the beastie plays like
a champ... no time this year for Jean to deal with the cabinet..
too many customer pieces to work on... maybe next year...

I'm guessing it will go for about $20K, give or take $2500.

I make this prediction based on the following:

Half the parts are missing, so the radio will go for half the money a
complete one will go for.

There ain't THAT many people with a complete chassis sans cabinet. Some
that do may not have the resources immediately at hand to plop down a
five figure amount for a cabinet.

If the buyer does indeed have a complete chassis and is only looking for
a matching cabinet , he is still faced with a conundrum: The ebay radio
still  has an intact top half. Given the rarity of these sets, parting
that out is out of the question, so he will start out with an incomplete
radio, and wind up with......an incomplete radio! Ironic, isn't it?

Insurance won't replace something like that unless you can find another one

that's even worse. 3 cars at 25k each today.  8 years later they are
worth 1000.00.  you loose 72k.  if you box up a new mustang it MAY
bring what you paid for it 10 years later. probably not. in 30 years,
you will see an increase in value, but not the kind of return you
would see in other investments. this is obvious because people don't
do it.  unless it is a very special (expensive) car, they are
literally one in a million. if you have the extra cash laying around,
the strat is probably not the worst investment you could make.
certainly not the best either.  cool thing is....you get to look at it
and get pleasure from it.

While I wouldn't do it myself, I suspect *any* brand new car packed away and
put up for sale 20-30 years later will fetch far more than you paid for it.
Somewhere I saw a website with a Pinto that had something like 9,000 miles
on it, it had won quite a few awards at car shows which is not bad for a car
that was pretty much bottom of the line when it came out. There's a certain

&gt; &gt;&gt; Eddie dont change the story .. I mentioned ``brand new cars `` and
&gt; &gt;&gt; boxing up one for 30 - 50 years .

&gt; &gt; that's even worse. 3 cars at 25k each today.  8 years later they are
&gt; &gt; worth 1000.00.  you loose 72k.  if you box up a new mustang it MAY
&gt; &gt; bring what you paid for it 10 years later. probably not. in 30 years,
&gt; &gt; you will see an increase in value, but not the kind of return you
&gt; &gt; would see in other investments. this is obvious because people don't
&gt; &gt; do it.  unless it is a very special (expensive) car, they are
&gt; &gt; literally one in a million. if you have the extra cash laying around,
&gt; &gt; the strat is probably not the worst investment you could make.
&gt; &gt; certainly not the best either.  cool thing is....you get to look at it
&gt; &gt; and get pleasure from it.

&gt; While I wouldn't do it myself, I suspect *any* brand new car packed away and
&gt; put up for sale 20-30 years later will fetch far more than you paid for it.
&gt; Somewhere I saw a website with a Pinto that had something like 9,000 miles
&gt; on it, it had won quite a few awards at car shows which is not bad for a car
&gt; that was pretty much bottom of the line when it came out. There's a certain

they will be an increase in value, but not a good return. if the 75k
is put into a good investment it will double every 6-12 years.
(depending on return) at a doubling rate of 6 years, the 75k will turn
into 1.2 million in 30 years. at a doubling rate of 12 years, it will
be 300k in 36 years. you may do better than 1.2 million if you are
lucky. so, for a run of the mill car (25k) to be worth even 300k is
asking ALOT. it will probably be worth less than 1/3 that....way less.
unless...you get very lucky and happen to pick a car that is very
desireable in 30 years that is not desirable now. take the 70 plymouth
superbird for example. fat chance on that.

Right now I wish I had my 1994 Geo Metro (Suzuki) back.  50+ miles per gallon.  I
traded in my 1990 Metro on it, but the very next day I also traded my Plymouth Duster
even up for a van.  I got to love the van so much, I ended up putting the new Metro
in my storage bin.  Two years later, I sold it for $1600 more than what I paid, with
only 101 miles on it.

I wish GM (or anyone) would offer such a reasonably priced economy car now.  GM's
closest now is the Aveo (Daewoo) rated at only 37 mpg highway. They claim they don't
have the technology now to produce an efficient car that was already around in the
late 80's and early 90's before they upsized it out of existence.  The 1990 Metro XFI
version was rated at 53 city/58 hwy.  My regular Metro was rated at 46/50, and
averaged over 48 mpg during the 4-1/2 years I drove it.  I know that the new EPA
ratings take more into account, and they have done a backwards comparison to the
older EPA mileage guides now.  They rate the 55/60 Metro XFI as getting 43/51 under
the current standards.  That's still well above any gas only Honda, Toyota, Nissan
etc. available in the US now.  Time to bring the efficient subcompacts back.

Revised older EPA standards available at:

&gt; Since the radio has a wrong speaker and some other gizmo bolted

&gt; and the Amp Power supply has been missing for sometime... and someone
&gt; tried to dummy it up to make it work...

&gt; the top chassis could be made to operate as a complete radio if you
&gt; added a power supply and wired it into the terminal strip on the

&gt; would guess that something like that has happened in this radios
