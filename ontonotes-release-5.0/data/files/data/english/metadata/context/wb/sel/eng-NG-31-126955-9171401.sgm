In this lovely review of a bad restaurant:

http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,2203119,00.html

there is this sentence:

&quot;It had a weird plastic flavour which reminded me of the taste you get
when you blow up a new lilo.&quot;

So, er, what's a lilo?  It must be British slang, as m-w.com knows
naught of it, but google didn't either.

An inflatable mattress, traditionally rubber but now

Probably a BrE term. It's an inflatable bed, usually used as a
makeshift guest bed although the term is sometimes used for floating
lougers used in a swimming pool. Originally applied to products from
the Li-Lo company, the term is now used generically for any inflatable
bed.

OYID:

&lt; http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/lilo?view=uk &gt;
&quot;• noun (pl. lilos) an inflatable mattress used as a bed or for floating on
water.&quot;

They also hit the headlines every summer when someone sets off on a journey
into the unkown, for example:

&lt; http://archive.thisisdorset.net/2001/8/17/97419.html &gt;
&quot;A CHILD swept out to sea on a lilo in Weymouth Bay sparked one of a number
of rescue operations yesterday.&quot;

They're also often used for camping, so if you hear heavy breathing from the
next tent it could be someone blowing up their lilo rather than what you
might have thought it was.

Double surprise for me.  Never heard of the term &quot;lilo&quot;, and would

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, er, what's a lilo?
">

&quot;Lilo&quot; was the brand-name (trade mark) of a particular inflatable mattress
(then called the &quot;blow-up bed&quot;). It was one of these early plastic thingies,
but I don't recall &quot;Lilo&quot; ever made rubber mattresses. They were used in the
early 60s and had an inner smooth side, and a patterned outer-surface. The
plastic was soft, to they split easily, especially at the seams.

The Lilo was intended mainly for campers on a budget, but found favour with
bathers. When the canvas/rubber mattresses came out they used to rot very
quickly when used in the pool or sea - perish the thought! If you inflated
them by mouth then the rubber sides would stick together. This left the
Lilo's position secure as a popular favourite for bathers for quite a few
years.

But this is all from memory, with strong recollections from camping from
about 1958 onwards.

Indeed. Taking your lilo down the lido was the height of sophistication.
There was a character in a Brit sitcom called &quot;Lilo Lil&quot; because she was
reputed to have said cushioning strapped to her back in case she met anyone
she fancied.

I think it probably always was used generically (doubtless to the

&quot;Air bed&quot; is often found; and I think &quot;air mattress&quot; appears ... yes,
the British Argos catalogue index has a line reading &quot;Air beds and air

Right -- it is like Linnux.

Did you notice how Linus says &quot;Torvalds&quot;?  The &quot;o&quot; is just like a Latvian
&quot;o&quot; -- somewhat like the one in &quot;coffee&quot; in some parts of New Jersey and
thereabouts, I think.

In fact, he pronounces his name in perfect Latvian.

Given my upbringing and, at very least, my respect for Jesus of
Nazareth, I have never addressed a live person by the English
form of the name. If I had occasion to address Mr Lopez by his
first name, I would say /heIzu:s/ or &quot;Hayzus&quot;. I think that
would be close enough not to offend.

I would say Mosscoe but I have heard Mosscow often enough to
hardly notice it. I also say Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples, Sicily
and Venice for Italian place names and the list is long for
other countries. There are places where the English name is a
good compromise like Genf/Genève. I see no need to pretentiously
(IMHO) give up on traditional English spellings and
pronunciation unless perhaps I am trying to interpret a foreign
time table. There are some others where a point is being made,
especially  Burma as opposed to Mommyland (or whatever).

We had a couple of those for camping when I was a kid (early 1960's) but it
was inflated by repeatedly pressing down on a built-in pump and letting it
go. So no heavy breathing from our tent - not with a sweet, pure, innocent
child around anyway - but a sound more like a couple of grunting pigs.

His pronunciation of Linus is between Leenus and Linnus.  The Linux
