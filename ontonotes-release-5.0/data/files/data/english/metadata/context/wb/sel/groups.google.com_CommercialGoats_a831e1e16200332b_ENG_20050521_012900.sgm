In addition to having goats, I have Romney sheep and I
am told the wool is very sought after by hand
spinners. How do I find these hand spinners or a
market for the wool? I plan to shear the sheep and
then send them to market and try to have two markets
this way. I also want to market the wool from the
breeding stock as well. I got the sheep mainly to
co-species grazing and lambs have a higher price per
pound than do most of the goat kids around here.

Thanks,
Brenda
Dickson, TN

Hi Brenda,

There are some home spinners on the East Tennessee Homestead Farmer group.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EastTNHomesteadFarmers/

Also if you do a Yahoo search there are a lot of homestead groups as well.

Do you have any hair sheep?

Brenda,
Lamb wool is not usually worth much. Also some buyers want
unshorn lambs as sheared lambs means they are older.Check your market before
you shear those lambs !!!!!!!! REGARDS, SCOTT

These are grown sheep that I want to sell but you are
right about selling the lambs. The lamb sales would be
in the fall and I won't shear them. Thanks for the
good advice.
Thanks,
Brenda
