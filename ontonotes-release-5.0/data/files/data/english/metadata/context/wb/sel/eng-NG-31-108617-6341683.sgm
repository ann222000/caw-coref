Folks,

For some reason I "just" discovered this very cool Apollo Lunar
Landing simulation. The "Apollo-11 Short Flight" is free but $25
unlocks the rest of the sim and gets you many more missions.

Features include a working AGC (apollo guidance computer) with DSKY
console interface; mission specific lunar terain and radio chatter; 7
functional pannel switches; working gyro; etc.

Use "replay" mode to fly Apollo 12 to the Ocean of Storms then hit "0"
to start an EVA. Once on the ground hit "F" to plant the flag then
look around and you'll see Surveyor-3 in a near-by crator. Press "W"
to walk over to Surveyor-3.

Your patronage is important to encourage the author to develop more
features. Future updates are free to registered users.

Caveat: requires a graphics card with at least 128MB of RAM

If you like that you may want to try orbiter space simulator which is
free and has many free addons including my own Project Mercury and
Project Gemini

Have owned it for a few years. Â A great value for $25.
