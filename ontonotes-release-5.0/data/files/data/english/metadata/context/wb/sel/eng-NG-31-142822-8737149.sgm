THE MEDICAL SCIENCE OF THE AGE

Now I will tell you something about the medical science in the
Mahabharata period.

According to ayurveda, when the balance of the body is lost due to the
increase or decrease of vayu or pitta or kapha, disease starts. Medicine is
applied to restore balance. If the amount of vayu or pitta decreases,
medicine is applied to increase it ; if the amount of vayu or pitta
increases medicine is applied to decrease it. This is the ayurvedik system
of medicine. In the unani system, a similar system of medicine, there are
four factors (dhatu) -- vayu, pitta, kapha and rakta. The difference between
the two systems is that in the unani system one more factor, i.e., rakta,
has been added. The other three factors are the same. In both systems crude
medicine is applied and surgery ( shalya cikitsa ) is simply nominal. In the
pure ayurvedik system there is no surgery. But the vaedyaka shastra of India
which has been incorporated into the ayurvedik system included surgery.

And one more system is the homeopathic system popularized by Hahnemann, a
great man. In the ayurvedik system and in the unani system the medicine is
applied not to treat the disease but to bring about a balance among the
aforesaid factors. In homeopathy, too, whose principle is &quot;Samah samam
shamayati&quot; (like cures like), the disease is not treated, but the symptom of
the disease is treated. No matter whether the disease is diarrhea or
malaria, the symptom is treated and not the disease. Moreover, the medicine
is applied in a subtle form. It is theorized that the subtle affects the
crude, hence subtle medicine is applied to cure the crude disease. The more
subtle the medicine, the more effective the result on the crude disease.

Allopathic treatment is a direct treatment of the disease. A particular
disease is cured with the appropriate kind of medicine.

In India at that time, there was a mixture of ayurveda and vaedyaka shastra.
But a strange thing is that homeopathy incorporates the visa cikitsa of that
era, and through this visa cikitsa people were familiar with the principle
&quot;Samah samam shamayati.&quot; For instance, the Kaoravas gave poison to Bhiima,
and people announced that he had died. But the experts in ayurveda gave
injections of poison to Bhiima, by which he was cured. This proves that
people had the knowledge of visa cikitsa and the principle &quot;Samah samam
shamayati.&quot; i.e., homeopathy in an elementary form. Homeopathy was not
started by Mahatma Hahnemann, instead it was developed by him.

Visa cikitsa is native to India, and its first reference is found in the
Mahabharata period. Later on this visa cikitsa was encouraged not by Aryans,
but rather by non-Aryans, and South India, especially Malabar, saw it expand
a lot. These people attribute the origin of visa cikitsa to Lord Krsna,
i.e., visa cikitsa was originated by Krsna. And vaedyaka shastra was
originated by Lord Sadashiva. Actually, ayurveda was known to the Aryans
earlier than Lord Shiva. But Lord Sadashiva brought about a blending between
vaedyaka shastra and ayurveda.

But the originator of visa cikitsa was Lord Krsna. In the Mahabharata
period, it was appreciated a lot, and people discussed it and practised it
by applying different venoms such as the venom of the snake, the venom of
the spider, the venom of the scorpion, etc., to cure snake bite, spider
bite, scorpion bite, etc. In course of time, it was neglected. At last it
had some place in the royal family of Cochin. This system is neglected
nowadays, but if it is encouraged, a new system will be added to medical
science.

Perhaps you know arkavana ( arkapatra ), generally found in a cremation
ground. If this is used either externally or internally, the eye becomes
defective. But it was discovered in the Mahabharata period that if that same
arkavana is used in a subtle form, it is a very good medicine for various
eye diseases. The same system of &quot;Samah samam shamayati,&quot; i. e., poison
roots out poison, is there.

Surgery, which is considered to be a part of allopathy, is not really so ;
rather it is a part of ayurveda shastra. Since the time of Sadashiva, it has
developed a lot. In vaedyaka shastra, it is also explained how a dead body
is to be studied by students. The structure of the human body, how to keep
it clean, how it decomposes, is all explained in vaedyaka shastra. This
proves that surgery was very developed in that period. There is a very
interesting example of surgery. The cousin of Krsna (the son of the sister
of Lord Krsna's father) was Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, with his
capital at Rajgir. At the time of the birth of Jarasandha, the child had to
be cut out of the womb. People saw this child and threw it in the cremation
ground. Then there came a very famous non-Aryan (raksasii) lady doctor known
as Jara. She stitched the child in a proper surgical operation and saved it.
Since the lady Jara joined (sandhi) the pieces of the child's body, the name
of the child became Jarasandha. This proves that the people were well
acquainted with surgery.

It is improper to think that everything in India has come from abroad. I
have told you that Bhaskaracarya first discovered that the earth was round,
and not Copernicus. That the earth is moving was first discovered by
Bhaskaracarya and not by Galileo. The law of gravitation was first
discovered by Bhaskaracarya and not by Newton. We give incorrect training to
children.

Hence you see that homeopathy sprang up in India itself. Nor did surgery
originate with Aryans, but in India.

Suppose there are two persons. If the mind of either of them is stronger, it
will control the other mind and the controlled mind will follow the stronger
mind. The stronger mind imposes itself on the other mind either directly or
by some artificial means indirectly. Because of the effect of the stronger
mind, the controller mind utilizes its mental power against the disease and
gets free from it. This sort of treatment by hypnotic spell, people say, was
started by Dr. Mesmer of France, and so this system is known as &quot;mesmerism.&quot;
But prior to Dr. Mesmer, this system was known to Indians. In India it was
named &quot;raksasii vidya.&quot; In ancient India (by ancient India I mean the
non-Aryans, the natives of India) there was a non-Aryan lady doctor,
Karkatii Raksasii. This raksasii was very famous for her mesmeric treatment.
This sort of treatment should therefore not have been known as &quot;mesmerism&quot;
-- it should have been known as something different.

Hence we find that in the Mahabharata age, there was surgery, ayurveda,
vaedyaka shastra, visa cikitsa, and homeopathy ; and people were not
unacquainted with mesmeric treatment either. This proves that medical
science was not underdeveloped.

You can pose the question -- if medical science was developed so much, why
was it destroyed? The main reason was that touching the dead body, learning
about the physical structure of the skeleton of the dead body, etc, was not
considered to be lowly by the people of the early Buddhistic age; but after
Buddha, people began to take it as lowly. Touching the dead body was
considered to be most undesirable. This affected medical science a lot.
Surgery especially was much effected, and because of this all medical
science was affected.

Six or seven hundred years after Buddha, Buddhists once again discussed
medical science a lot and tried their best to develop it But immediately
after Buddha it was completely discouraged, and medical science in India had
its downfall. Moreover, when people did start to develop medical science,
sometime after Buddha, there was simultaneously an invasion from outside
India, due to which ayurveda, vaedyaka shastra, visa cikitsa and surgery
were discouraged in India and the unani ( hakimii ) System of medicine began
to take root. Because the hakimii system was not much cultivated in this
country, the downfall of India as far as medical science is concerned,
occurred.
