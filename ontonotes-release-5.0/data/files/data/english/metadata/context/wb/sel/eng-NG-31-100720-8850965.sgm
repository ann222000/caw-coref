After all the &quot;I'm gay by birth,&quot; &quot;I'm a thief by birth,&quot; and such
said by people that didn't want to change, claiming &quot;God made me this
way.&quot;...A new scientific study says the reverse is true...

http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20070906/sc_livescience/adultbrai...

This study being published in a professional journal says that the
adult brain can change and create new pathways.  There have been other
studies that have said the same in recent years, so this is just the
latest example of this truth: you cannot blame your genes for what YOU
chose to be and do.  NOTHING is HARD wired for your life.  Even if you
were born with genetic defects (like original sin's desire to sin),
EVERYTHING can change, IF you want it to.

The cited article does NOT say that.  Indeed it says the opposite.

The article reported changes that were detected NOT because the

Now it may turn out that *some* changes may be achievable through will
coupled with well-designed therapies.  But that is not what you are

It specifically said the adult brain could establish NEW pathways and
change over time.

Now, on an added but connected issue, if the will can change the
brain, where does this WILL come from, if not the spirit of a person.
If, as psychologists would have you believe, there is not spirit but
only the brain, the person being a reflection of the brain, how can
the brain be changed by the will (didn't that will come from the
brain)?

Only on Planet Ken is there &quot;all&quot; this claiming of such
things as &quot;I'm a thief by birth&quot;.

But as to the other example: when did YOU decide to be straight
rather than gay?  Could you change that decision right this moment
-- just for a half-hour, mind you, just to prove your point --
could you sit down this second and choose to get a hard-on thinking
about taking Johnny Depp's shirt off, or jack off to images of
giving Keanu Reeves a hummer?   Maybe get a squirt fantasizing about
rimming Matthew McConaughey?

If you can, then I'd say you've proved your point about conscious
choice -- at least for you, although perhaps then something is lacking in me,
as I don't believe that I could simply choose to have those feelings, no matter
how useful for the purposes of this argument that might be.

By an act of will, right?

If we're going to keep talking about current neurological research,
and as it pertains to the &quot;will&quot;, you're not going to be happy at
all with the direction THAT conversation will take.  Trust
me on this one.

Much of what you think of as your &quot;will&quot; is just along for the ride,
and charged with making up reasons why &quot;I&quot; chose to do something,
when in truth the decisions are made in regions of the brain
not accessible to the &quot;I&quot;.

Shall we discuss an example or two?

And of course the article says nothing at all like &quot;the will can

Nothing about &quot;the will&quot;.

based on the ability of organisms to change their DNA at will.

Oh ok so you don't believe in the Religious views your just a Bigot.
Lets start this slow then.
The Term Gay is derived from an Irish Portuguese Word &quot;Gall&quot; as in
Gallway Bay.
It refers to the &quot;Strange Invaders&quot; of Ireland or the Gaelic.
Their Chieftain was Called Laddie.
They are the Strange Women of the Bible.
In reference mine is the House of Nun, an ancient term for &quot;FISH&quot;.
Bigots.
Not nice to call women &quot;Fish&quot;, even if you don't like the Amazon's.
From the NUN came Dagon the Fish Man!
The stuff about wearing a Kilt, came from Dyionisis.
In other words, there are people who are genetically part of a
hermaphrodite race.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; coupled with well-designed therapies.  But that is not what you are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; claiming.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It specifically said the adult brain could establish NEW pathways and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;change over time.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes.  But it does NOT say that EVERY sort of particular changes are
&gt; &gt;&gt; possible, nor that whatever change is in question is under the control
&gt; &gt;&gt; of our will.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now, on an added but connected issue, if the will can change the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;brain,

&gt; &gt;&gt; That is not in evidence.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;where does this WILL come from,

&gt; &gt;&gt; We don't know.  It is an emergent phenomenon of our brains.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;if not the spirit of a person.

&gt; &gt;&gt; There is no evidence that there is such a thing as a &quot;spirit&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If, as psychologists would have you believe, there is not spirit but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;only the brain, the person being a reflection of the brain, how can
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the brain be changed by the will (didn't that will come from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;brain)?

&gt; &gt;&gt; The brain can and does change by itself without any conscious control.
&gt; &gt;&gt; It simply is not the case that any given change must be changed &quot;by&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; some intelligent agent.  Indeed most change takes place with no
&gt; &gt;&gt; intelligence whatsoever (which is why there is hope even for you).

I have no idea what you are talking about, and you appear not to
either.  The fact that you cannot spell makes it even less likely that
anyone will make sense of your rantings.  The people who Julius Caesar
conquered were called the Gauls.  Gall is a secretion of one of your
digestive organs.

Kilts have nothing to do with femininity. The particular distinctions
of dress in modern Western society have no relation to any
distinctions in dress that existed before late medieval times.
