Enough trash talk.  Trash talk is just that - talk.  We already have a
Browne Baking competition at the party on the 25th. Why not a Road
Bike vs. Tri Bike competition?   There is a nice little 0.86 mile loop
back in my neighborhood, just beyond my house.  Slight grade up going
out, slight grade down to close the loop.  What say y'all?     How
many laps?

MMmmm that could be a great place to have a training race !!

This should be considered, rushing through those dangerous
intersections is making me nervous, we could all get our jollys, then
go out for a social ride after.   Anybody know of a closed course we
could use,besides circling the gazebo in the park?

Safety first, beer last.

Yes Corey,  and that is the safest and only place, besides triathlons
that tri-bars should be used, or if you're riding alone across
Indiana.
I was merely trying to make a serious point in jest about the dangers
of riding with aero-bars in group rides. They really don't belong on
group rides, they obviously compromise the full control you'll have
with your bike.
I know some are gonna be mad at me for this post but.... really if you
think about it, aero-bars are for time-trials and triathlons.....you
know when you're riding alone.
Safety first, beer last!
Hope know body's mad at me.

Agreed, usage of aero extension portion of the bars should not be used
while in a paceline.

However if one is in front or behind they are fair game.

I believe this is the same discussion that was presented last year at
almost the exact same time.

Why Brotha Shawn has two sets of those Aero Bars.  One set he keeps in
his garage, and I have kept the other set in my garage/barn/Eads Fence
Complex for 8 years...I think he has forgotten that I even still have
them... I wonder if they have any sentimental value to him?  Oh well,
my fence workers like to use them occasionally so I will hang onto
them for now.

Anyway, I echo what Brotha Gary has to say.  Not suitable for group
rides.  Does this board have the capability for a &quot;sticky&quot; that we can
pin at the top?  We should do one for ridding form, technique and
etiquette.

That's not my position on this, there's still a handling issue here.
If you are in the &quot;aero extension portion position&quot; your handling is
compromised, you should know of all people Corey,(don't mean to bring
up bad memories there bud')

So...if your handling is compromised, and your at the front of the
group..... Well to me it raises the odds and probabilities for
accidents, for everybody!

I believe UCI rules should apply when we are doing our simulated race/
rides.
I don't recall seeing anybody with aero-bars on the Hyde Park ride,
(O'Brien would yell at em') or in any of the Spring series races.

I've been riding competitively for over 30 years, been perpendicular
since 1988,(hit a groundhog on the trail,stayed up, friend from behind
knocked me down) I want everybody and esp. me to keep it that way.

By the way ...last night was one of the best Wed. nights I've ever
been on!!
We had breaks and attacks and Roger sneeking away David on the last
kilo from the re-grouped field(via short-cut) was more fun than Super
gluing your Mom to here toilet seat!
That was big FUN guys thanks!

Corey,

From my experience aero bars should not be used in a paceline, especially in
the front. I have noticed on numerous occasions while in a paceline the
person in the aerobars neglects to point out obstacles or for that matter
anything while they are riding in that position.

But, on to more a more pressing and important issue. Why did we run out of
beer at 9:45p last night. The beer volunteers need to bring more than a case
to these events.

Gig, make note on your spreadsheet that there was a shortage and who should
be held accountable. It made for quite an expensive bar tab at the Works.

Jeez, what have we started now? There is no point in doing a Tri -
v- Road bike competition - that's simple physics. How many tour riders
do their (flat-ish) TT stages on a bloody road bike? DUH....

Now if we're trying to provoke a G4B TT slugfest here, I will
predict the excuses in advance:   &quot;Oh, but so-and-so had an unfair
advantage with that fancy bike!&quot; DUH #2....

Dale's comment on doing Cleves - if you really want to know what
you're capable of without draft assistance, then this is the way to
find out! But don't be surprised when you see that all of the fastest
guys are using aero bikes (even though the course is rolling) and many
of them power meters too. Technology is good!

One last word (from me) on tri bars - riding the bullhorns puts
your fingers closer to the brakes than on the hoods or drops of road
bars. Riding in the aero position is only O.K. if you're on the front,
or off the back/to the side. Anyone drafting a guy in his aero bars
assumes the risk! Just like anyone drafting whatever...

Mr. C. - OUT!

Its funny, as Corey mentioned earlier, we are discussing the same issues
we did at approximately the same time last year.  The points were/are:

1) Should people be riding in our group rides with Aero Bars?
I believe the consensus last year was, ok if you are riding out
front and doing the pulling.  Ok, if you stay to the
back of the group.  Otherwise, Aero Bars are &quot;more&quot; dangerous in
a group setting, especially a fast pace line!

2) Proper etiquette in a Pace line, what are your responsibilities?
- Do you maintain a steady pace
- When the leader pulls off, do you maintain a steady speed or
do you wick up the pace and cause the pace line to
yo-yo?
- Do you signal and look back before you pull off the lead?
- Overlapping the wheel in front of you in dangerous
- Allowing a gap to form in front of you, causing the rides
behind you to pass you and accelerate to catch up.
- Taking too long a pull.  Start at 26 mph and end at 18 mph.
- Making sure that when you pull off, you still have enough in
the tank to catch onto the tail.
- Hold your line, inconsistent riding creates all sorts of
havoc.  Look before you move over, do not rock back
and forth.
- etc...etc...etc...

This is the time of the year when most of our accidents have occurred.
People are riding stronger, moving into different speed groups, and at
times maybe really not strong enough to stay on.  Which means, not as
attentive as they should be, taking more risks to stay on, you get the
picture.

Bottom line, LETS BE SAFE OUT THERE!!

Gary -

My accident had nothing to do with tri-bars or any sort of &quot;handling&quot;
capabilities. It had to do with a mechanical failure that no one could
have forecasted, nor avoided. Riding on the cowhorns in a paceline is
just as stable as a road bike.

I never realized our rides were &quot;simulated races&quot;. I thought they were
group rides where we rode together and had a good time and drank beer.
If it is a &quot;simulated race&quot; I better start bringing my &quot;A&quot; game, or
doing a different ride.

Riding in aero bars behind the group places no one in jeopardy. Riding
aero bars on the pointy end of the arrow also places no one at any more
risk than a normal road bike. Rod Roof is far more stable in his aero
bars than many people are on a normal road bike in the group.

They are also riding close to 40mph too. Handling is exponentially more
complicated at speeds like that.

What does it matter if folks are on their aero bars at the pointy end of
the peloton? You are typically hanging out in the back anyhow. Something
about legs being tired and out late the night before and having just
done a solo ride to Shawnee and 7 Caves and all...

behind you to pass you and accelerate to catch up.
- Taking too long a pull.  Start at 26 mph and end at 18 mph.
- Making sure that when you pull off, you still have enough in
the tank to catch onto the tail.
- Hold your line, inconsistent riding creates all sorts of
havoc.  Look before you move over, do not rock back
and forth.
- etc...etc...etc...

This is the time of the year when most of our accidents have occurred.
People are riding stronger, moving into different speed groups, and at
times maybe really not strong enough to stay on.  Which means, not as
attentive as they should be, taking more risks to stay on, you get the
picture.

Bottom line, LETS BE SAFE OUT THERE!!

Why Brotha Shawn has two sets of those Aero Bars.  One set he keeps in
his garage, and I have kept the other set in my garage/barn/Eads Fence
Complex for 8 years...I think he has forgotten that I even still have
them... I wonder if they have any sentimental value to him?  Oh well, my
fence workers like to use them occasionally so I will hang onto them for
now.

Anyway, I echo what Brotha Gary has to say.  Not suitable for group
rides.  Does this board have the capability for a &quot;sticky&quot; that we can
pin at the top?  We should do one for ridding form, technique and
etiquette.

You didn't answer me. Did you use aero bars? Did you use the 1989 Greg
Lemond aero bars that were HORRIBLE?

Have you ever ridden a set of aero bars? Do you have any experience to
draw on when making these accusations? Or are you just regurgitating
what others have told you?

My view is it's 10% the aerobars, and 90% the person who's using them... aerobars don't kill people, people do... hmmmmm....

Pointing out road obstacles is just one example... I've been on a heck of a lot of rides with road bike riders who don't point out anything... it's the rider, not the bike.

I WILL say that tri bike riders in GENERAL seem to be less in the habit of thinking about the dynamics of the group behind them... such as slowing down further in advance of a stop sign when you've got a large group behind you; or being sure to not abruptly start coasting while looking over one's shoulder... but certainly there are plenty of roadies who do this too... again, it's the rider, not the bike!

Sure, an aerobar setup changes your body weight distribution on the bike, and subsequently your handling... but a proper tri bike geometry is designed to counteract this effect... quite UNLIKE a road bike with aerobars clipped on the handlebars.

More than anything, it's choosing when to use them... it's the rider, not the bike....

I use mine:
- on the front
- on the side (depending how far over I am)
- off the back
- or if I've got a gap that is at least two bike lengths long... and I ONLY do this IF I'm very close to the front AND I know the few people ahead of me are really solid riders AND the road is in good condition... so this last one is used very selectively and usually only for short times

... and all of the above ONLY if I'm not maxed out and suffering from impaired reaction speed and concentration.

Really, it makes me mad to see someone using their aerobars in the paceline... if you really need that 1% more gain (that's a rhetorical swag there, you analytical types!) that you're getting from your aerobars, while you're already getting most of your wind resistance blocked by the human beings in front of you... why are you riding with that speed group?

Plus anyone who uses aerobars should practice with them all the time... I can switch from my aerobars to the drops quickly and smoothly, I can look over my shoulder (at least my left shoulder... I'm still working on the right one!), while on the aerobars, without veering, and, when I'm on solo rides I practice riding with one hand on the aerobars... which enables me to point stuff out just fine on group rides... and you all know I do, you're probably tired of hearing me yell during rides! I'm certainly not perfect, and not claiming to be... but I bet I handle my tri bike as well as most typical riders handle their road bikes.

BTW, I really like the time trial suggestions... Cleves would be awesome, and a TT with Fraser would be too... but sorry James, you can't enter that one!

Out,
Mrs. C. :-)

Corey,

From my experience aero bars should not be used in a paceline, especially in
the front. I have noticed on numerous occasions while in a paceline the
person in the aerobars neglects to point out obstacles or for that matter
anything while they are riding in that position.

But, on to more a more pressing and important issue. Why did we run out of
beer at 9:45p last night. The beer volunteers need to bring more than a case
to these events.

Gig, make note on your spreadsheet that there was a shortage and who should
be held accountable. It made for quite an expensive bar tab at the Works.

Agreed, usage of aero extension portion of the bars should not be used
while in a paceline.

However if one is in front or behind they are fair game.

I believe this is the same discussion that was presented last year at
almost the exact same time.

Yes Corey,  and that is the safest and only place, besides triathlons
that tri-bars should be used, or if you're riding alone across Indiana.
I was merely trying to make a serious point in jest about the dangers
of riding with aero-bars in group rides. They really don't belong on
group rides, they obviously compromise the full control you'll have with
your bike.
I know some are gonna be mad at me for this post but.... really if you
think about it, aero-bars are for time-trials and triathlons.....you
know when you're riding alone.
Safety first, beer last!
Hope know body's mad at me.

The boss has the final word, so I'm done with this debate - but
I'll sign off with a plea - NO MORE personal attacks! It's O.K. when
it's just joking (I do thins plenty!) but I'm getting the impression
that this isn't going that way...

Kathy nailed it. There are many who I will follow closely and trust
implicitly - there are a few who I stay away from. We're all
responsible for each other to some degree. An attentive guy on aero
bars will ride smarter, and get to the brakes faster than a sloppy,
tired or stretched rider will. Fact. But they should be used
appropriately! Training for an Ironman? you gotta ride in that
position for ~6 hours. Better get used to it!

Time to move on!
Mr. C. - OUT!

I'd like to get back to what my esteemed colleague (and last night's
helpful super domestique) said earlier about the beer. We seem to
running out on a consistent basis. Besides... I failed to say thanks
to the big man for a pizza and beer treat at the works. THANKS ROG!
Always the classy gentleman.

Regarding Aerobars, and I have spent a lot of time in them... Off the
back or side no problem. Absolutely not in the paceline and I think we
all need to be vigilant (vigilante) about getting people off them in
the paceline! Leading the front is still somewhat dangerous,
especially if riding with the fast guys, because you don't have your
brakes handy and have to come off to get to them and at the speeds
were ridiing, just not enough reaction time. (yet I agree there are
some who are very solid in the aero position)

Tri geometry bikes are much, much more stable than road bikes
retrofitted (oversteer problems because the weight is out of balance).

In the end, we all have to comfortable with who we are riding behind,
and if not, then we need move to another area of the pack. (whether
it's the person who can't hold aline or is on his aero bars)

Rodney King

I have a very serious point to make on tri-bars. If you strap them to your
partners head you'll have better endurance in the lower  region.

Man you guys get serious . The only time you get the same result with a road
bike or time trail bike , is when you hit a great pereneese head on .

Tuesday nights time trail at cleves , could use a good boost with a large
turnout from the g4ber's .  It would be fun to see where you are at .

Don't want to take away from Jay's sprint night . Sprinting is another
good thing to work on . Let master Jay show you how its done .

If you get the chance at least try it once this year .

Brother Eads should show up at the time trail , I will bring you're 1972
set of aero bars , you can use them or give them to brother Gary Gorrell .
