Does Bruce head home between tour stops?  He finished in Chicago last night
and plays Oakland on Thursday - does he typically go home before flying to
the next city?
Just curious...I'm not tracking his whereabouts for any specific reason.
However, if you could also tell me what time his kids get out of school and
their favorite hangouts, that would be great, too;)

Yes.  Your best chance at an autograph is at the hotel the afternoon
before the second show.

It was a joke, jackass.  I was asked if I thought Bruce flew home between
tour stops, didn't know the answer, and thought I'd check with the rmas
sages.  I realized that the question I was asking could come across as a
little fishy, so I played it up a bit by asking for the info regarding the
kids.  Thanks for your response, but believe it or not, it wasn't all that
helpful, you humorless prick.

That might be why the Chicago show was so short.

Thanks, but I really have no interest in getting Bruce's (or anyone else's
for that matter) autograph.  I took a first-timer to last night's show in
Chicago and was asked by this guy if I thought Bruce flew home between
stops.  I had no idea, but I figured someone around here would know.  As I
was writing it, I realized that it might come across as if I had some
ulterior motive.  That's why I
joked about wanting info about the kids.  I really thought it was clear that
I was joking.

This is why I rarely post anything around here.  I think we have an
unusually high asshole quotient in these parts.  See darcman32's reply to me
for some proof.

I think it was clear to most people.  Don't worry about those who don't get
it.  And don't stop posting on account of them.  You're living in the
future, and none of this has happened yet!

I think Wendy was making fun of RMAS... as I am often tempted to do.
Most of RMAS are like Springsteen stalkers,  you want to know
everything right down to the last time he had a bowel movement.

Your joke was funny, made me laugh out loud.
And your assessment of darcdorc was quite accurate!

Maybe, but the newsgroup also allows you to filter out whomever you want
-- just use the filter/killfile/etc. settings on your newsreader and
voila! -- hassle free reading.

As for the original question -- it was clear to me at least that the bit
about his kids was a joke.  I just figured it was most relevant because
you were looking for an autograph/slip him a song request/etc.
