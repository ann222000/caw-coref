Patriotism, anyone?A gemstone among pebbles M Bakri Musa
Aug 30, 07 11:57amAdjust font size:M BAKRI MUSA is a surgeon in Silicon Valley, California and the author of The Malay Dilemma Revisited: Race Dynamics in Modern Malaysia. His views o&amp;shy;n Malaysia can be stated thus: Ours is a diverse nation; we can accept and celebrate this reality or by default, it becomes a liability.
This is a book review of Kota Baru MP Zaid Ibrahim's latest book, In Good Faith.

When you have a pathway of pebbles, expect your toes to be stubbed and knees scrapped. You certainly do not expect – nor do you purposely seek – any gem amongst the gravel. Nonetheless when there is a glint in your path, you do pause to examine it. If perchance you pick up a genuine gemstone, your heart bursts with joy for the rare and unexpected lucky fine.

This was my emotion upon reading Zaid Ibrahim’s In Good Faith. That is not to say that I did not expect great things from the man. After all, Zaid Ibrahim built Malaysia’s largest law firm that bears his name well before his 50th birthday! Size alone is not much of a bragging point especially with firms of professionals. His however, is the first to recognize the impact of globalization on professional – in particular legal – services, and thus the few if not the only local law firm to have a presence beyond Malaysia. His firm is also one of the few to have the expertise to meet the complex needs of transnational corporations.

In addition to being a practicing lawyer, Zaid is also an Umno politician and Member of Parliament. The standard vocabulary of parliamentary debates these days includes such words as bodoh (stupid!) and bocor (leaking – crude reference to the regular female biological process), as well as rude finger pointing and all-too-common racial taunting.

Rave reviews
As for Umno, its leaders are trapped in their keris-brandishing theatrics and Ketuanan Melayu (Malay hegemony) rhetoric. In short, both Parliament and Umno are bodies of pebbles; do not expect gemstones. Hence my pleasant surprise with Zaid Ibrahim!

This book, a collection of Zaid’s speeches, interviews, and essays, gets rave reviews from such luminaries as former Chief Justice Dzaiddin Abdullah and former top civil servant Ramon Navaratnam, as well as academician Khoo Kay Kim and writer Marina Mahathir. Former DPM Musa Hitam wrote a short laudatory introduction.

Apart from being a lawyer and politician, Zaid is also a Malay, Malaysian, Muslim, and world citizen. He is no ordinary global citizen for sure, having participated as a co-panelist with the Dalai Lama (“Forum 2000 Dialogue: Do Religions Offer a Solution or Are They Part of the Problem?”) organised under the auspices of former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel in October 2006. His insight with respect to Islam is thus: “[T]he development of Islamic thought has not progressed in a way it should have …. The intellectualism of Islam has been stagnant ….”

This issue of the intellectual development in Islam and of Muslims (Malays in particular) is dear to Zaid. Discourses in Islam, academic and public, are long on quoting the Quran and hadith but precious short on critical thinking and original thought. In an address to Suhakam’s Conference on Human Rights and Culture (“The Most Sacred of Rights”) Zaid observed, “There is a vast difference between the word of Allah and man’s interpretations of the word of Allah.” I might also add, of women’s.

Apart from sex, we bring our culture, language, ethnicity, and sets of experiences to these interpretations. Thus we should expect differences in our views, expectations, and interpretations. As per the wisdom of the Quran, differences amongst the ummah are Allah’s blessings.

Thus Zaid asserts that we should go beyond mere tolerating to embracing and celebrating our differences (“Pluralism and Democracy in Malaysia”). This is the only way for a plural society like Malaysia to survive and indeed thrive. I would go further; if we do not treat our diversity as an asset, it will by default become a liability. And what a horrendous liability! Malaysia had a foretaste of it in May 1969, and there are many ready tragic examples in the world today: Iraq, Darfur, and the Balkans.

Zaid is proud of his multiple identities and sees no contradictions with any combination thereof. He is not bothered at all nor does he indulge in silly pseudo-philosophical waxing on whether he is first and foremost a Malay, Malaysian, or Muslim. He is all that and more simultaneously, and he does not feel at all schizophrenic about it.
Sad state of our judiciary
Indeed each identity reinforces the others. Being a good lawyer makes him a better politician, and contributes to his being a more informed and rational Malay, which in turn makes him a better Malaysian and Muslim. Where is the conflict?

As a lawyer he is passionate about and totally committed to justice, freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. He leaves no doubt about that in this book and elsewhere. “If we continue to put ourselves in reverse gear by departing from democratic principles,” he said, “we will continue to fall behind other countries.” He added, “Democratic and civil values are not new novel concepts, alien to Malaysians! In fact, strong subscription to these values propelled us to where we are today.”

Freedom, especially of thought, conscience, and religion, is for all, including Muslim Malaysians. Zaid forthrightly stated his conviction in an address at the Middle Eastern Graduate Center (“Faith and Freedom To Think”).
In two essays (“Case Reaffirms Need for Press Council” and “More Freedom of Information, Please”) Zaid stresses the crucial role of press freedom and freedom to information generally in advancing democracy and development. On a pragmatic level, freedom empowers citizens, enabling them to realize their full God-given potential.

As a lawyer, Zaid is not at all shy on commenting on the sad state of our judiciary and the generally sorry performances of our judges. In a speech to local law students sponsored by his legal firm (“Attributes of an Independent Judiciary”), and in two essays published in the mainstream media (“Urgent Need to Reform Judiciary” and “Judges Must Show Courage”), he directly addressed the subject.
In the other essays he made tangential observations on the matter. He is critical of non-Syariah judges who shy away from cases remotely involving Islam or Muslims. Nor is Zaid complimentary towards Syariah judges. He clearly stated this singular point, purposefully made confusing by many, that while Islam is under state jurisdiction (except in the Federal territories), the Supreme Court decisions are binding upon all other courts, including the Syariah’s.
Rais Yatim and Zaid Ibrahim

Other lawyer-politicians have also expressed similar strong commitments to democracy and the rule of law. Consider Zaid’s parliamentary and Umno Supreme Council colleague Dr Rais Yatim. In his Freedom Under Executive Power in Malaysia: A Study of Executive Supremacy, Rais was scathing in his criticism of the unchecked powers of the executive. “Rule by law and not rule of law supersedes and takes priority in most aspects of ruling the people,” he wrote, thus producing “a culture of fear in an already non-critical society.”

Rais, like Zaid Ibrahim, also called for abolishing such repressive laws as the Internal Security Act and the Universities and University Colleges Act. There is however, one signal difference between these two lawyer-politicians.
Rais was vocal only when he was outside the political establishment, as when he was kicked out of the cabinet for joining the Umno-breakaway Party Semangat 46. Now that he is back in the cabinet, he is singing a decidedly different tune. He goes so far as to disavow his earlier views (which was his doctoral dissertation) as nothing more than a “mere academic exercise.”

With two notable exceptions, Zaid’s views and passions resonate with me. Zaid argues his points rationally, convincingly, and most of all, very clearly. If I have not stated it, few would know from reading this book that Zaid is a lawyer. It is pleasantly free of legal jargons and that most irritating habit of lawyers, of lacing their commentaries with ancient and barely comprehensible Latin phrases. Without exposing my obsessive compulsiveness, there are only eight such phrases, including such commonly used non-legal ones as de facto and modus operandus.
There are only three legal Latin phrases used in fewer than half a dozen times in all: An independent judiciary sine qua non (without which, non) to a real democracy; Montesquieu’s trias politica (separation of powers between executive, legislative and judiciary) doctrine; and the writ of habeas corpus (of appearing before a court).

I had the chance to listen to Zaid as part of the Fast Forward Panel this Monday night and he was excellent especially his response to a certain En Ali from Selangor who posited that non-Malays should be grateful for their wealth and control of the economy, citing the Sarawak timber trade.

Zaid answered that very well; citing that En Ali's &quot;non-Malays not grateful&quot; remark is aypical of many malays these days, without further examination and consideration of the actual situation. A very balance point of view.

Now compare that with the Talibanesque response from 4 other hooded Malaysians to Namewee's video:

Bad  acting again ?   Can't they do better ?
