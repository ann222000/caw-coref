Are we risking damage to our engine by not using the highest grade of gas?

We've been using the mid-grade of gas in our 1999 300GS since it was new.
We drive about 12,000 miles a year with an 80/20 mix of city/highway miles.

Elmo doesn't seem to have a working email address, but here is what I tried
to write to him:

Elmo,
Thanks for your thoughtful remarks regarding my use of mid-grade gas in a
Lexus 300G.

Actually, we did read the manual cover to cover several times, but being an
engineer, I wondered if the computer engine control would automatically
adjust the timing, etc, to compensate for lower octane without harming the
engine.  One Lexus mechanic, on the condition that he wouldn't ever admit
saying so, assured me that the computer would compensate the lower octane,
but that the mileage might be lower.

I carefully checked the mileage for the first six months using the highest
grade gas, and then for the next five and a half years using mid-grade.
There was no significant difference.  The car now has almost 80,000 miles on
it, and is purring as good as the day it was new.  The only mechanical
problem to date was a  leaking water pump - replaced by the Lexus dealer at
no cost.

Not bad for a brain-dead owner, don't you think?  BTW, not having a lot of
money has never been one of my problems.   I actually bought the Lexus
because it is a more cost-effective car to own than many cheaper
automobiles.  And a lot more pleasurable to drive.

You could do what I do. I put in 50% 93 octane and 50% 87 octane to get 90.5
which is close enough to the recommended 91. Sometimes I even tweak it a bit
toward the 93 to really get 91. It requires two credit cards at the pump (it
won't allow you to use the same card twice in a short period of time), and
you have to learn how many gallons are required from the various points on
the fuel gauge. Not a big deal. The cost ends up being the same as for "mid
grade" which is merely 89 octane in most places. In other words, for a
little extra work, you can get 90.5 octane for the same price as 89 octane.

Yeah, I squeeze the buffaloes and drive a Lexus. A contradiction? I would
argue that this is HOW I GOT TO DRIVE a Lexus!
