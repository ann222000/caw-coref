INTRODUCTION

AvC is one of the most highly subscribed Google groups in terms of
traffic and/or subscribers.  Dev is currently the most active poster
(August 2007) but is closely followed by rappoccio and Delusional.
All time ratings show that Dev is ranked sixth (plus or minus 2 evil
thirds) among the most active posters here.  In the course of AvC
there have only been five more active posters across time. In
alphabetical order they might be LL, Michael E., OldMan, rappoccio,
and Simpleton.  Pro-gympist, Michael Ewart, hasn't posted since May
'07 and I reckon Dev deserves to take his place.

In contrast, EGreg has only posted around about 630 posts to AvC.
Compare these ratings ... EGreg has garnered a one star rating from a
total of 150 raters ... yet Dev after posting nearly 4000 posts has
acquired a four star rating from a total of 700 raters.  Neither has
solicited the votes.

So what differentiates the two?

on hand one: Dev hates religious bullshit is articulate and isn't
afraid to speak his mind.

on hand two: EGreg just speaks a load of shit.

ACT ONE

EGreg (plays 'little miss goody two shoes') Jul 29
&quot; ... I even asked you to stop calling me names.&quot;

EGreg (aka Saint EGreg is horrified by a Dev comment) Jul 29
&quot; ... Dev posts new discussions ranting against Christians and
religions and religious figures of any sort all the time. he insults
people left and right.&quot;

EGreg (writes to bonfly, trying to muster support against Dev) Jul 29
&quot; ... at least you weren't dishontestly confrontational here. Thank
you. Let's go on being reasonable conversation partners. &quot;

EGreg (unsuccesfuly trys to defame Dev) Jul 29
&quot; ... dev - total dickhead with anger issues currently &quot;

EGreg (trys unsuccesfully to insult Dev, yet again) Jul 29
&quot; ... let me insult yo momma and then if you say anything bad abotu me
I'll use that as an excuse to throw some shit at you, call you names
constantly, be totally unreasonable and for some reason insinuate that
you're lying about me. &quot;

EGreg (failing to win bonfly's confidence against Dev) Jul 29
&quot; ... Dev and bonfly (mostly Dev) I am tired of fighting with you. &quot;

EGreg (admitting defeat for wound licking) Jul 29
&quot; ... i apologize. u win. goodbye &quot;

EGreg exits for a week and a half

ACT TWO

EGreg (returns, tries to spit at Dev, but misses) Aug 11
&quot; ... I figured maybe people would be nicer *cough Dev* so I'd come
back &quot;

EGreg (lies seven times in only 29 words, in a letter to Dev) Aug 12
&quot; ... I am not dishonest. I am not hypocritical. I am not stupid. But
you are the first two, at least. All I have been trying to be is
reasonable ...&quot;

EGreg (lies again, and again to Dev) Aug 12
&quot; ... Except I actually care about the truth&quot;

EGreg (offers an insult to bonfly) Aug 12
&quot; ... And here's another insult for you: in all your replies to me you
have offered only one post with logical substance addressing what I
said. THe rest are trolling nonsense. You are a troll. you feed other
trolls.&quot;

EGreg (tries to insult bonfly again, but lies) Aug 12
&quot; ... But here IS a real insult:  your sense of humor is horribly off,
and you seem to be pretty stupid in some things. And that's a
substantiated fact. &quot;

EGreg (plays 'miss goody two shoes liar' again, to Dev) Aug 12
&quot; ... Speaking only for myself, I have done nothing but try to be
reasonable with you,&quot;

EGreg (lying like a pro in bed, to Dev) Aug 12
&quot; ... I am not a hypocrite. I don't expedct more from you than from
myself. &quot;

EGreg (attempts to insult Dev again) Aug 12
&quot; ... personally think you're full of hate. &quot;

EGreg (tries for another joint insult) Aug 13
&quot; ... Some atheists here (dev, bonfly) have gone what might seem to be
nuts. &quot;

EGreg (EGreg cries crocodile tears to Dev) Aug 13
&quot; ... And all you continued to do is argue and hurl obscenities at me.
&quot;

EGreg mulls on getting even more nasty

ACT THREE

EGreg (finally admitting one lie, to Dev) Aug 13
&quot; ... why, I can freely admit that I said I won't respond to you and
bonfly, the two stooges without a brain, and then I still answered you
and communicated with you. I guess I lied about that, even though in
my mind I was trying to actually hold out hope that you will change
and have a nomal discourse.

EGreg (tries to jointly insult Dev and bonfly) Aug 13
&quot; ... you have shown yourselves by your behavior to be complete
assholes.&quot;

EGreg (singles an insult attempt to bonfly) Aug 13
&quot; ... off the deep end are you? &quot;

EGreg (reverse strategy, tries to play Dev against bonfly) Aug 13:
&quot; ... Dev sometimes posts intelligent replies, and bonfly did so once,
as far I as I recall although the percentage of intelligent replies
from him is something like 15%). &quot;

EGreg (one fucking lame christian hypocrite) Aug 14
&quot; ... it doesn't help to have a bunch of belligerent atheists hanging
around who never prove anything but just spew inane shit at people.&quot;

CONCLUSION

Simple conclusion.  EGreg lies and is driven by lying and being a
hypocrite,  He's a sadducee and a scribe rolled up into one dead mouse
which is then passed onto a non-existable satan/monkey.

As for Dev (or bonfly) being articulate, that is the biggest laugh of
the year. They can't string one meaningful sentence together without a
string of insults issuing from their mouths.

You don't have to be nice to be articulate. It's not a prerequisite.
In fact, in their minds, it's BAD to be polite to theists because they
think theism is evil in and of itself, so don't feel the need to be
nice to people they despise.

Wow. I have no idea what the best way to reply to this post would even
be. I know I need to say thanks but damn--how much time did you put
into digging up the EGreg shit? :)

Actually, the sixth place rating was from my old address which was
banned from Google because someone spoofed my address and posted porn
on this group to get me banned.

Old address: 3909
New address: 1908

5817 posts and counting. That would make me a close third to
Simpleton. The Dev is a franchise, baby.

To be fair to ETard a lot of people here do the exact same thing that
he does. They complain that I'm too insulting but if you look at many
of their posts towards me they are completely hostile so obviously
that isn't really the issue. Some people just simply hold no standards
to themselves and are completely incapable of recognizing how
hypocritical they're being. It isn't about the hostility because that
isn't the variable that differentiates me from them. It is that they
are wrong and I am right and it makes them angry. They just don't want
to admit that's what they're pissed about because they are petty, low,
desperate, stupid, hypocritical creatures who have given up on
aspiring to be human beings.

But again, thanks for the valentine honey. :)

Okay, that's technically untrue which proves that you're a liar. Call
&quot;liar&quot; an insult if you want, but telling the truth is only considered
evil among evil people.

&gt; &gt; All time ratings show that Dev is ranked sixth (plus or minus 2 evil

&gt; &gt; there have only been five more active posters across time. In

&gt; &gt; '07 and I reckon Dev deserves to take his place.

&gt; &gt; In contrast,EGreghas only posted around about 630 posts to AvC.
&gt; &gt; Compare these ratings ...EGreghas garnered a one star rating from a

&gt; &gt; &quot; ... why, I can freely admit that I said I won't respond to you and
&gt; &gt; bonfly, the two stooges without a brain, and then I still answered you
&gt; &gt; and communicated with you. I guess I lied about that, even though in
&gt; &gt; my mind I was trying to actually hold out hope that you will change
&gt; &gt; and have a nomal discourse.

&gt; &gt;EGreg(tries to jointly insult Dev and bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... you have shown yourselves by your behavior to be complete
&gt; &gt; assholes.&quot;

&gt; &gt;EGreg(singles an insult attempt to bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... off the deep end are you? &quot;

&gt; &gt;EGreg(reverse strategy, tries to play Dev against bonfly) Aug 13:
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Dev sometimes posts intelligent replies, and bonfly did so once,
&gt; &gt; as far I as I recall although the percentage of intelligent replies
&gt; &gt; from him is something like 15%). &quot;

&gt; &gt;EGreg(one fucking lame christian hypocrite) Aug 14
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... it doesn't help to have a bunch of belligerent atheists hanging
&gt; &gt; around who never prove anything but just spew inane shit at people.&quot;

&gt; &gt; CONCLUSION

&gt; &gt; Simple conclusion.  EGreglies and is driven by lying and being a
&gt; &gt; hypocrite,  He's a sadducee and a scribe rolled up into one dead mouse
&gt; &gt; which is then passed onto a non-existable satan/monkey.

Dev's not a big bloke but he punches about three classes above his
weight.  Every day he relentlessly practices by hammering his fists
into the ubiqutous sand bags on this group (names like yohan, omprem,
Checkers, EGreg, McNevins and mathematician choke to mind).  Dev ties
these theists up with thick rope to the ceiling joists in his garage,
just like you'd hang any ordinary sandbag.

Anyway ... Dev pummels the shit out of these hanging bag ladies two or
three times a day.  He's been doing this for years and has been
following a strict diet and training regime.  The results are
telling.  He's ready for a real contender.

Trouble is, there's not been a single poster boy for christ on this
board who has been able to lay a glove on Dev.  A few atheists have
entered well-matched scuffles and shared black eyes with him, but not
a single christophilliac has the guts to take him on.  Can't you
theists find a single able contender ?

No!

As Dev says: &quot;Sticking around here is like _Dawn of the Dead_:
standing on top of the mall, shooting the brainless zombies down one
by one for the fuck of it. &quot;

Honestly, I don't think it's _always_ bad to be polite to theists. I
usually am since I don't initiate every theist on the street in a
debate. I'm even polite to theists here sometimes. Of course, the real
issue is what qualifies as &quot;polite&quot;. Sometimes politeness is
dishonest, which I assume is the kind of politeness you're talking
about. &quot;Polite&quot; is often used as a synonym for &quot;dishonest in a nice
way&quot;. Like, you don't say everything you mean but &quot;I was being
polite&quot;. Or the tagline for _The Real World_: &quot;When people stop being
polite, and start being real.&quot;

Good points. I like the idea of &quot;polite&quot; as &quot;being dishonest in a nice
way&quot;. If you didn't need to be polite, you'd just be being honest and
it would be nice already.

&gt; EGreg (tries to insult bonfly again, but lies) Aug 12
&gt; &quot; ... But here IS a real insult:  your sense of humor is horribly off,

&gt; EGreg (attempts to insult Dev again) Aug 12

&gt; &quot; ... And all you continued to do is argue and hurl obscenities at me.
&gt; &quot;

&gt; EGreg mulls on getting even more nasty

&gt; ACT THREE

&gt; EGreg (finally admitting one lie, to Dev) Aug 13
&gt; &quot; ... why, I can freely admit that I said I won't respond to you and
&gt; bonfly, the two stooges without a brain, and then I still answered you
&gt; and communicated with you. I guess I lied about that, even though in
&gt; my mind I was trying to actually hold out hope that you will change
&gt; and have a nomal discourse.

&gt; EGreg (tries to jointly insult Dev and bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &quot; ... you have shown yourselves by your behavior to be complete
&gt; assholes.&quot;

&gt; EGreg (singles an insult attempt to bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &quot; ... off the deep end are you? &quot;

&gt; EGreg (reverse strategy, tries to play Dev against bonfly) Aug 13:
&gt; &quot; ... Dev sometimes posts intelligent replies, and bonfly did so once,
&gt; as far I as I recall although the percentage of intelligent replies

&gt; EGreg (one fucking lame christian hypocrite) Aug 14
&gt; &quot; ... it doesn't help to have a bunch of belligerent atheists hanging
&gt; around who never prove anything but just spew inane shit at people.&quot;

&gt; CONCLUSION

&gt; Simple conclusion.  EGreg lies and is driven by lying and being a
&gt; hypocrite,  He's a sadducee and a scribe rolled up into one dead mouse
&gt; which is then passed onto a non-existable satan/monkey.

You mean that if you forget the technicalities it is true. People only
resort to insult when they either have nothing worth saying, or else

&gt; &gt; AvC is one of the most highly subscribed Google groups in terms of

&gt; &gt; (August 2007) but is closely followed by rappoccio and Delusional.
&gt; &gt; All time ratings show that Dev is ranked sixth (plus or minus 2 evil
&gt; &gt; thirds) among the most active posters here.  In the course of AvC
&gt; &gt; there have only been five more active posters across time. In

&gt; &gt; and Simpleton.  Pro-gympist, Michael Ewart, hasn't posted since May
&gt; &gt; '07 and I reckon Dev deserves to take his place.

&gt; &gt; In contrast, EGreg has only posted around about 630 posts to AvC.
&gt; &gt; Compare these ratings ... EGreg has garnered a one star rating from a
&gt; &gt; total of 150 raters ... yet Dev after posting nearly 4000 posts has
&gt; &gt; acquired a four star rating from a total of 700 raters.  Neither has

&gt; &gt; So what differentiates the two?

rappoccio, I find it amusing that if you read everything bonfly wrote
in that post, but don't actually ASSUME that I am from the outset
lying, hypocritical, dishonest and stupid, then somehow I come out
from his own quotes as being reasonable and trying to set things
right, while calling Dev

So let's see, bonfly and Dev postulate a fact that has not been
demonstrated or even evidence presented for its case. Then they come
up with quotes from me that dispute this fact, and use it to support
that the fact exists in the first place. Rappoccio isn't that ironic
that this is exactly the bad stuff you said that happens in
religion? ;-)

example (paraphrased, for sources see all their posts)
&quot;EGreg is a liar. and a hypocrite&quot;
&quot;Oh yeah, where did I lie? I am not a liar or a hypocrite. Stop
attacking me.&quot;
&quot;See? Another two lies. You said you a not a liar. And you said you
are not a hypocrite. You are a trained donkey ass and you stink.&quot;

Just as Harris says religious moderates make the world safe for
religious extremists, so I say to you - are you making the board safe
for people like Dev who have presented absolutely no reason or
evidence of their claims personally attacking me, but just assume them
and keep using every one of my responses -- which dispute their claims
-- as support for their unfounded claims :-P Dev and bonfly is what I
mean by belligerent atheists, seriously.

Greg

PS: I added the words &quot;in that post&quot; because I am trying to be overly
precise when dealing with these assholes. Lest they say I'm lying
again.

&gt; You don't have to be nice to be articulate. It's not a prerequisite.
&gt; In fact, in their minds, it's BAD to be polite to theists because they

try reading it without assuming the conclusion he's trying to prove,

&gt; &gt;EGreg(reverse strategy, tries to play Dev against bonfly) Aug 13:
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Dev sometimes posts intelligent replies, and bonfly did so once,
&gt; &gt; as far I as I recall although the percentage of intelligent replies
&gt; &gt; from him is something like 15%). &quot;

&gt; &gt;EGreg(one fucking lame christian hypocrite) Aug 14
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... it doesn't help to have a bunch of belligerent atheists hanging
&gt; &gt; around who never prove anything but just spew inane shit at people.&quot;

&gt; &gt; CONCLUSION

&gt; &gt; Simple conclusion.  EGreglies and is driven by lying and being a
&gt; &gt; hypocrite,  He's a sadducee and a scribe rolled up into one dead mouse
&gt; &gt; which is then passed onto a non-existable satan/monkey.

Let us examine your post with the same rigor you'd apply to any other
evidence, shall we, bonfly.

Your thesis is that

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; EGreg is a liar, hypocrite, faux monkey, unabler to complete a PhD, &gt; and homo-taxationalist (metro church only)
">

I will propose my own thesis at the end about you. I think it will be
much more fair and supportable.

First of all, I guess something that has nothing to do with my posts
can be addressed first, for it's the easiest to disprove:

- unable to complete Ph. D
incorrect. In fact I am in a Ph. D program, completing my Ph. D and
there is absolutely not a shred of evidence that suggests I am unable
to do so. I already got a master's degree.

hmm, I guess you were wrong on that one. Not necessarily MALICIOUSLY
DEFAMING ME AND LYING, but just wrong. ok, moving on...

-homo-taxationalist
funny, I searched google to see what that term means, and the only
result was a link to your very post! hahaha
Do I tax homosexuals? no. Am I in support of it? Yeah, almost every
citizen should pay some sort of tax. That's as far as I go in trying
to guess what your absolute nonsense means.

Oh and about the nonsense? see my conclusion about you below. Scratch
that. I will also post a whole new thread about it.

-faux monkey
false monkey? fancy sounding term, uses a french word too. I suppose
you should set out the criteria for being such an animal, because you
might very well be a bigger faux monkey.

Hmm, I suppose you haven't really supported any of these claims. Are
you a theist? Dev hates theists, he says they are guilty of what you
just did right now. repeatedly. over and over. throughout many posts.
Should I quote them?

You know what it was? Saying things as if they were absolute truth,
except completely not supporting them with any evidence, let alone
proof. Rappoccio -- please apply your standards to bonfly here, and
don't just selectively focus on insults being ok to prove valid
points. The very poits here in are unproven/unsupported, and I claim,
FALSE and DEFAMATORY.

I see. This has to deal with my thesis about you, part of which is
that you speak a load of shit.

Let's see if you prove that I speak a load of shit, and if I am a
liar, hypcrite, faux monkey, thing that I've already shown evidence to
be a lie, and a thing that doesn't make any sense (although faux

say his anger leads him to be totally unreasonable.

As you can see, I am still trying to reason with Dev and show him how
it would feel if the same was done to him. In fact, I am pointing out
the very fact that Dev insults me first, then if I say anything in
turn he cries foul, calls me a liar and claims that I insulted him and
hold higher standards to him than to me, and calls me a hypocrite.
It's like punching a guy and crying when he punches you back, except
more lightly. Not only that, but when I asked how I offended him, he
offered: &quot;I find theism offensive&quot; (paraphrased).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

bonfly is being dishonest (selectively ignoring questions &amp; reason),
unfair (not siding with the person who is right), and constantly
attempts what seems to be really bad humor. Really bad humor, in fact,
is all he has to offer, instead of actual proof or evidence of any of
dev's, and his, claims.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If you look at the context, I just said
&quot;if you can't stop abusing me, after I asked you repeatedly to stop
this, then I'm leaving.&quot;
&quot;bonfly: aww, you are leaving into the night, without even
apologizing.&quot;
&quot;fine, I apologize. u win. goodbye.&quot; &lt;-- a facetious statement,
showing that, if bonfly had any kind of honesty or adult behavior, he
would realize I'm offended and giving up on reasoning with him.

Wait, that means you lied a lot in this post, doesn't it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; EGreg(lies again, and again to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &quot; ... Except I actually care about the truth&quot;

I think the gentle reader will notice a pattern here
If I did indeed have an original lie, that would make the subsequent
statements lies, it is surprising that after all this digging, bonfly
has not a shred of evidence.

bonfly, being the atheist that you are, shouldn't you apply the same
standards to yourself as you do to theists? Find the non-circular
support for your statement without the assumption. If I was such a
blatant liar, I think it wouldn't have been this hard.

dev -- if you're reading this, which I'm sure you are (by the way man,
if you are a serious and reasonable human being, which I know you can
be, drop this shit), please don't be a hypocrite yourself and judge
bonfly by your own criteria.

fact: bonfly asserts things without proof, tries to dig up lots of
supporting evidence and it all turns out to not to be not really
evidence at all. See rappoccio's excellent post :) recently about how
evidence can point to more than one thing is not considered conclusive
evidence.

fact: bonfly doesn't like when Theists claim things without evidence,
and when they produce some he says it is bullshit

fact: bonfly therefore holds higher standards to theists than himself

fact: you hate people like that

it has not been proven yet that I hold higher standards to others. I
have just proven that bonfly does. Therefore, please respond to bonfly
fairly, irrespective of the fact that politically, he's on the same
dodgeball team as you. If you really are not a hypocrite, like you say
you are not, then you will do it.

So here is a preliminary one.

You are not reasonable, most of the time.
You defame other people.
You support fellow atheists even when they are wrong, perhaps fully
knowing they are wrong.
You post complimentary things about Dev which are not true
When reasoned with you respond with unfunny but defamatory comments
about me
When left alone you start new threads trying to attack me. Some as
stupid as &quot;EGreg said PROFOUNDZ!! in response to SEARCHER. Do you

That's not the only question. I do it because my insults are truth.
You are an admitted liar, an obvious hypocrite, have no evidence, and
can't answer a fucking question. How can you sleep at night, you shit?
Is there not one part of you that is human?

if you weren't a hypocrite you'd criticise bonfly for being a
hypocrite, something I proved in my response to his post, and
something that you say you hate so much you will attack. so attack, if
you, yourself are not a hypocrite.

if you are, then you're also a liar - since you said you are not a
hypocrite :-P .... I am using your &quot;tactics&quot;.

I have never heard bonfly complain about insults because they are
insults--that's the point. Insults from people who bitch about insults
represent hypocrisy--that is different from people who bitch about
insults because of the hypocrisy because they have a point. This is so
simple, but people who believe in God are evidently retards with no
brains which explains everything they say and do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ACT THREE

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;EGreg(finally admitting one lie, to Dev) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; ... why, I can freely admit that I said I won't respond to you and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bonfly, the two stooges without a brain, and then I still answered you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and communicated with you. I guess I lied about that, even though in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my mind I was trying to actually hold out hope that you will change
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and have a nomal discourse.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;EGreg(tries to jointly insult Dev and bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; ... you have shown yourselves by your behavior to be complete
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assholes.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;EGreg(singles an insult attempt to bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; ... off the deep end are you? &quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;EGreg(reverse strategy, tries to play Dev against bonfly) Aug 13:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; ... Dev sometimes posts intelligent replies, and bonfly did so once,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as far I as I recall although the percentage of intelligent replies
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from him is something like 15%). &quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;EGreg(one fucking lame christian hypocrite) Aug 14
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; ... it doesn't help to have a bunch of belligerent atheists hanging
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around who never prove anything but just spew inane shit at people.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CONCLUSION

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Simple conclusion.  EGreglies and is driven by lying and being a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hypocrite,  He's a sadducee and a scribe rolled up into one dead mouse
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is then passed onto a non-existable satan/monkey.- Hide quoted text -

You have no evidence. And when I asked you a several times what I lied

Remember, you had absolutely nothing to back up your statements, but

And in a recent thread you advocated killing me.

Congrats eGreg - you must have struck a nerve for them to single you
out like this :-)

There are many atheists on this site that say interesting things and
you can engage in interesting conversations with them.   I have
learned a lot from from some of the atheists in this group.

But there are some that simply regurgitate the arguments of others.
Whenever you question them beyond the limit of their &quot;sound bites&quot;
they respond with personal attacks.  Normally they just reply to a
post telling you to f-off or something like that.  A few reponses like
that, is usually enough to make most christians lose interest and move
on.  But you got a whole thread dedicated to slamming you... even
though you don't have high stats yet, that still shows a lot of
tenacity..

&gt; INTRODUCTION

&gt; AvC is one of the most highly subscribed Google groups in terms of
&gt; traffic and/or subscribers.  Dev is currently the most active poster
&gt; (August 2007) but is closely followed by rappoccio and Delusional.
&gt; All time ratings show that Dev is ranked sixth (plus or minus 2 evil
&gt; thirds) among the most active posters here.  In the course of AvC
&gt; there have only been five more active posters across time. In
&gt; alphabetical order they might be LL, Michael E., OldMan, rappoccio,
&gt; and Simpleton.  Pro-gympist, Michael Ewart, hasn't posted since May
&gt; '07 and I reckon Dev deserves to take his place.

&gt; In contrast, EGreg has only posted around about 630 posts to AvC.
&gt; Compare these ratings ... EGreg has garnered a one star rating from a
&gt; total of 150 raters ... yet Dev after posting nearly 4000 posts has
&gt; acquired a four star rating from a total of 700 raters.  Neither has
&gt; solicited the votes.

&gt; So what differentiates the two?

&gt; &gt; EGreg (returns, tries to spit at Dev, but misses) Aug 11
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... I figured maybe people would be nicer *cough Dev* so I'd come
&gt; &gt; back &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (lies seven times in only 29 words, in a letter to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... I am not dishonest. I am not hypocritical. I am not stupid. But
&gt; &gt; you are the first two, at least. All I have been trying to be is
&gt; &gt; reasonable ...&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (lies again, and again to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Except I actually care about the truth&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (offers an insult to bonfly) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... And here's another insult for you: in all your replies to me you
&gt; &gt; have offered only one post with logical substance addressing what I
&gt; &gt; said. THe rest are trolling nonsense. You are a troll. you feed other
&gt; &gt; trolls.&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (tries to insult bonfly again, but lies) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... But here IS a real insult:  your sense of humor is horribly off,
&gt; &gt; and you seem to be pretty stupid in some things. And that's a
&gt; &gt; substantiated fact. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (plays 'miss goody two shoes liar' again, to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Speaking only for myself, I have done nothing but try to be
&gt; &gt; reasonable with you,&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (lying like a pro in bed, to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... I am not a hypocrite. I don't expedct more from you than from
&gt; &gt; myself. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (attempts to insult Dev again) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... personally think you're full of hate. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (tries for another joint insult) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Some atheists here (dev, bonfly) have gone what might seem to be
&gt; &gt; nuts. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (EGreg cries crocodile tears to Dev) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... And all you continued to do is argue and hurl obscenities at me.
&gt; &gt; &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg mulls on getting even more nasty

&gt; &gt; ACT THREE

&gt; &gt; EGreg (finally admitting one lie, to Dev) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... why, I can freely admit that I said I won't respond to you and
&gt; &gt; bonfly, the two stooges without a brain, and then I still answered you
&gt; &gt; and communicated with you. I guess I lied about that, even though in
&gt; &gt; my mind I was trying to actually hold out hope that you will change
&gt; &gt; and have a nomal discourse.

&gt; &gt; EGreg (tries to jointly insult Dev and bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... you have shown yourselves by your behavior to be complete
&gt; &gt; assholes.&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (singles an insult attempt to bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... off the deep end are you? &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (reverse strategy, tries to play Dev against bonfly) Aug 13:
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Dev sometimes posts intelligent replies, and bonfly did so once,
&gt; &gt; as far I as I recall although the percentage of intelligent replies
&gt; &gt; from him is something like 15%). &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (one fucking lame christian hypocrite) Aug 14
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... it doesn't help to have a bunch of belligerent atheists hanging
&gt; &gt; around who never prove anything but just spew inane shit at people.&quot;

&gt; &gt; CONCLUSION

&gt; &gt; Simple conclusion.  EGreg lies and is driven by lying and being a
&gt; &gt; hypocrite,  He's a sadducee and a scribe rolled up into one dead mouse
&gt; &gt; which is then passed onto a non-existable satan/monkey.

EGreg, the only positive thing I can say about you is that you're
vaguely more stupid than omprem.  Don't get me wrong, that's not meant
to be a compliment.

&gt; You post complimentary things about Dev which are not true

Yup--we singled EGreg out when we forced him to start a thread
singling us out and then retaliated. bonfly proved EGreg was a
hypocrite which is something most people would do if they were
attacked. As for &quot;regurgitating other arguments&quot;--that's a new one.
Most of the proof that theism is trash is old news, but I think I'm
pretty goddamned original relatively speaking. Not that being original
is important in refuting theism. You were wrong then and you're now
and you'll probably be wrong tomorrow so being repetitive is not a
valid criticism. If you don't want atheists to repeat themselves,
maybe you should be a human who can speak English and get it the first
fucking time.

&gt; There are many atheists on this site that say interesting things and
&gt; you can engage in interesting conversations with them.   I have
&gt; learned a lot from from some of the atheists in this group.

&gt; But there are some that simply regurgitate the arguments of others.
&gt; Whenever you question them beyond the limit of their &quot;sound bites&quot;
&gt; they respond with personal attacks.  Normally they just reply to a
&gt; post telling you to f-off or something like that.  A few reponses like
&gt; that, is usually enough to make most christians lose interest and move
&gt; on.  But you got a whole thread dedicated to slamming you... even

&gt; &gt; INTRODUCTION

&gt; &gt; AvC is one of the most highly subscribed Google groups in terms of
&gt; &gt; traffic and/or subscribers.  Dev is currently the most active poster
&gt; &gt; (August 2007) but is closely followed by rappoccio and Delusional.
&gt; &gt; All time ratings show that Dev is ranked sixth (plus or minus 2 evil
&gt; &gt; thirds) among the most active posters here.  In the course of AvC
&gt; &gt; there have only been five more active posters across time. In
&gt; &gt; alphabetical order they might be LL, Michael E., OldMan, rappoccio,
&gt; &gt; and Simpleton.  Pro-gympist, Michael Ewart, hasn't posted since May
&gt; &gt; '07 and I reckon Dev deserves to take his place.

&gt; &gt; In contrast, EGreg has only posted around about 630 posts to AvC.
&gt; &gt; Compare these ratings ... EGreg has garnered a one star rating from a
&gt; &gt; total of 150 raters ... yet Dev after posting nearly 4000 posts has
&gt; &gt; acquired a four star rating from a total of 700 raters.  Neither has
&gt; &gt; solicited the votes.

&gt; &gt; So what differentiates the two?

&gt; &gt; on hand one: Dev hates religious bullshit is articulate and isn't
&gt; &gt; afraid to speak his mind.

&gt; &gt; on hand two: EGreg just speaks a load of shit.

&gt; &gt; I'll use that as an excuse to throw some shit at you, call you names
&gt; &gt; constantly, be totally unreasonable and for some reason insinuate that
&gt; &gt; you're lying about me. &quot;

&gt; I have proven that you lied repeatedly. You want an example? What you
&gt; just said. You're acting like I have never even mentioned why I know
&gt; you're a liar and I have many times so shut the fuck up about that.
">

I see how you resort to

1) assuming I lied in the past
2) using that to prove i am lying now

Nice strategy, except you are guilty of circular reasoning. Does that
make you a theist? Now I urge you please don't go and commit suicide,
no matter how much you hate theists.

So if you mentioned why you know I'm a liar, I guess it wouldn't be
hard to write that here. I'm listening.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; And when I asked you a several times what I lied
&gt; &gt; about, 3 weeks ago, you kept dodging the question and spewing hateful
&gt; &gt; nonsense at me.

&gt; Blah, blah, blah.

wow, the first non hateful nonsense in a long time. congrats! KEEP IT
UP and you might be fun to talk to!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; You even did so after I asked to just drop it.

&gt; Of course a liar is going to ask me to &quot;just drop it&quot; after the liar
&gt; lies. Liars, in my experience, don't like getting caught.

Actually, I asked you to drop it because I didn't want to keep
debating a pointless argument with you, which I thoguht at the time to
be a minor thing. Since then I have seen that you are, apparently,a
psychopath.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Remember, you had absolutely nothing to back up your statements, but
&gt; &gt; you asserted them anyway.

&gt; Another lie from EGreg, ladies and gentleman. Hooray for lies!

So then prove that it's a lie. Oh wait, you can't seem to do that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; And in a recent thread you advocated killing me.

&gt; Anyone who is against bullshit wants you to die. I didn't make The

&gt; be a better place you want EGreg to die. If this bothers you, maybe
&gt; you should consider at least attempting to be a human being instead of
&gt; whatever the fuck you are.

&gt; &gt; I think that's not evidence of a sound mind.

&gt; Evidence of a sound mind is laughing when EGreg dies. So let's put the

&gt; Congrats eGreg - you must have struck a nerve for them to single you
&gt; out like this :-)

&gt; There are many atheists on this site that say interesting things and
&gt; you can engage in interesting conversations with them.   I have
&gt; learned a lot from from some of the atheists in this group.

&gt; But there are some that simply regurgitate the arguments of others.
&gt; Whenever you question them beyond the limit of their &quot;sound bites&quot;
&gt; they respond with personal attacks.  Normally they just reply to a
&gt; post telling you to f-off or something like that.
">

Yeah I have noticed that, and it was kind of annoying, which is why I
actually came to this group. If you rememebr, when I firest came I
postefd discussions like &quot;I awnt to discuss with intelligent
atheists&quot;. Because I felt there was a lot to be discussed, and I was
tired of these sound-bite people. I posted as much.

But Dev and bonfly are actually infiltrating all my discussions and
they have nothing better to do than to personally harrass me. Well, OK
they do other things too, but they seem to spend an awful lot of time
on this nonsense. I found it kind of amusing for a while to prove that
I am right. After all, it should be easy to defend a position where
you are right and can prove it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A few reponses like

&gt; tenacity..

I think I will move on, because there is nothing to be gained from
reasoning with them. Thanks for the support, though. I don't see that
many people posting here besides dev and bonfly. Even rap realized
it's pointless, I think :)

&gt; &gt; INTRODUCTION

&gt; &gt; AvC is one of the most highly subscribed Google groups in terms of
&gt; &gt; traffic and/or subscribers.  Dev is currently the most active poster
&gt; &gt; (August 2007) but is closely followed by rappoccio and Delusional.
&gt; &gt; All time ratings show that Dev is ranked sixth (plus or minus 2 evil
&gt; &gt; thirds) among the most active posters here.  In the course of AvC
&gt; &gt; there have only been five more active posters across time. In
&gt; &gt; alphabetical order they might be LL, Michael E., OldMan, rappoccio,
&gt; &gt; and Simpleton.  Pro-gympist, Michael Ewart, hasn't posted since May
&gt; &gt; '07 and I reckon Dev deserves to take his place.

&gt; &gt; In contrast, EGreg has only posted around about 630 posts to AvC.
&gt; &gt; Compare these ratings ... EGreg has garnered a one star rating from a
&gt; &gt; total of 150 raters ... yet Dev after posting nearly 4000 posts has
&gt; &gt; acquired a four star rating from a total of 700 raters.  Neither has
&gt; &gt; solicited the votes.

&gt; &gt; So what differentiates the two?

&gt; &gt; on hand one: Dev hates religious bullshit is articulate and isn't
&gt; &gt; afraid to speak his mind.

&gt; &gt; on hand two: EGreg just speaks a load of shit.

&gt; &gt; ACT ONE

&gt; &gt; EGreg (plays 'little miss goody two shoes') Jul 29
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... I even asked you to stop calling me names.&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (aka Saint EGreg is horrified by a Dev comment) Jul 29
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Dev posts new discussions ranting against Christians and
&gt; &gt; religions and religious figures of any sort all the time. he insults
&gt; &gt; people left and right.&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (writes to bonfly, trying to muster support against Dev) Jul 29
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... at least you weren't dishontestly confrontational here. Thank
&gt; &gt; you. Let's go on being reasonable conversation partners. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (unsuccesfuly trys to defame Dev) Jul 29
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... dev - total dickhead with anger issues currently &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (trys unsuccesfully to insult Dev, yet again) Jul 29
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... let me insult yo momma and then if you say anything bad abotu me
&gt; &gt; I'll use that as an excuse to throw some shit at you, call you names
&gt; &gt; constantly, be totally unreasonable and for some reason insinuate that
&gt; &gt; you're lying about me. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (failing to win bonfly's confidence against Dev) Jul 29
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Dev and bonfly (mostly Dev) I am tired of fighting with you. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (admitting defeat for wound licking) Jul 29
&gt; &gt;  &quot; ... i apologize. u win. goodbye &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg exits for a week and a half

&gt; &gt; ACT TWO

&gt; &gt; EGreg (returns, tries to spit at Dev, but misses) Aug 11
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... I figured maybe people would be nicer *cough Dev* so I'd come
&gt; &gt; back &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (lies seven times in only 29 words, in a letter to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... I am not dishonest. I am not hypocritical. I am not stupid. But
&gt; &gt; you are the first two, at least. All I have been trying to be is
&gt; &gt; reasonable ...&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (lies again, and again to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Except I actually care about the truth&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (offers an insult to bonfly) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... And here's another insult for you: in all your replies to me you
&gt; &gt; have offered only one post with logical substance addressing what I
&gt; &gt; said. THe rest are trolling nonsense. You are a troll. you feed other
&gt; &gt; trolls.&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (tries to insult bonfly again, but lies) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... But here IS a real insult:  your sense of humor is horribly off,
&gt; &gt; and you seem to be pretty stupid in some things. And that's a
&gt; &gt; substantiated fact. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (plays 'miss goody two shoes liar' again, to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Speaking only for myself, I have done nothing but try to be
&gt; &gt; reasonable with you,&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (lying like a pro in bed, to Dev) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... I am not a hypocrite. I don't expedct more from you than from
&gt; &gt; myself. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (attempts to insult Dev again) Aug 12
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... personally think you're full of hate. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (tries for another joint insult) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Some atheists here (dev, bonfly) have gone what might seem to be
&gt; &gt; nuts. &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (EGreg cries crocodile tears to Dev) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... And all you continued to do is argue and hurl obscenities at me.
&gt; &gt; &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg mulls on getting even more nasty

&gt; &gt; ACT THREE

&gt; &gt; EGreg (finally admitting one lie, to Dev) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... why, I can freely admit that I said I won't respond to you and
&gt; &gt; bonfly, the two stooges without a brain, and then I still answered you
&gt; &gt; and communicated with you. I guess I lied about that, even though in
&gt; &gt; my mind I was trying to actually hold out hope that you will change
&gt; &gt; and have a nomal discourse.

&gt; &gt; EGreg (tries to jointly insult Dev and bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... you have shown yourselves by your behavior to be complete
&gt; &gt; assholes.&quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (singles an insult attempt to bonfly) Aug 13
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... off the deep end are you? &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (reverse strategy, tries to play Dev against bonfly) Aug 13:
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... Dev sometimes posts intelligent replies, and bonfly did so once,
&gt; &gt; as far I as I recall although the percentage of intelligent replies
&gt; &gt; from him is something like 15%). &quot;

&gt; &gt; EGreg (one fucking lame christian hypocrite) Aug 14
&gt; &gt; &quot; ... it doesn't help to have a bunch of belligerent atheists hanging
&gt; &gt; around who never prove anything but just spew inane shit at people.&quot;

&gt; &gt; CONCLUSION

&gt; &gt; Simple conclusion.  EGreg lies and is driven by lying and being a
&gt; &gt; hypocrite,  He's a sadducee and a scribe rolled up into one dead mouse
&gt; &gt; which is then passed onto a non-existable satan/monkey.

have proven yuo are guilty of HYPOCRISY a crime which Dev says he
hates extremely. Yet Dev has been a hypocrite not to pummel you to the

Oh, and interesting how you don't actually ANSWER anything that I

What makes you think you're so goddam central to the rotation of the
earth that people should have to respond to all your posts (let alone
even read them)?  I did read the particular post you refer to but
didn't think it was worthy of a response.  You're just a lying sack of
shit typing hypocritical statements into a computer.  You stole Dev's
lunch money when he left it in the AvC boardroom a couple of weeks
ago.  He thought he could trust you at that time but when he returned
both you and his money had 'mysteriously' disappeared.    I don't know
how you can live with yourself.  I don't normally advocate suicide,
but in your case perhaps you should start to contemplate it.
