Freedom Next Time: Filmmaker &amp; Journalist John Pilger on Propaganda,
the
Press, Censorship and Resisting the American Empire

** John Pilger, speaking during the Socialism 2007 conference
in
Chicago.

_________________________________________________________________

&quot;Liberal Democracy is moving toward a form of corporate dictatorship.
This
is an historic shift, and the media must not be allowed to be its
facade,
but itself made into a popular, burning issue, and subjected to
direct
action,&quot; said John Pilger. &quot;That great whistleblower Tom Paine warned
that
if the majority of the people were denied the truth and the ideas of
truth, it was time to storm what he called the Bastille of words.
That
time is now.&quot; We spend the hour airing a recent lecture by the
acclaimed
Australian filmmaker and muckraker.
_________________________________________________________________

INTRODUCTION

When Rupert Murdoch won his bid to take over Dow Jones and the Wall
Street
Journal last week, the Australian media baron brought one of
America's
oldest, most respected and widely circulated newspapers into his vast
media empire. Murdoch's News Corp media conglomerate owns more than
175
other newspapers as well as the Fox Television network, 21st Century
Fox
film studios, several satellite networks, MySpace.com, HarperCollins,
and
much more.
Besides amassing a media empire, Murdoch has repeatedly been
accused of using his media holdings to advance his political agenda.
In
2003, all of Murdoch's 175 newspapers supported the Iraq invasion. He
spoke to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the lead-up to
the
invasion, some in Blair's inner circle even called him the 24th member
of
the [Blair] Cabinet.
After the announcement of the five billion dollar sale,
Murdoch
told the New York Times that in order for the Wall Street Journal to
remain editorially independent it needed to make healthy profits.
Murdoch
said, &quot;The first road to freedom, is viability.&quot;
Well, one of Rupert Murdoch's fellow countrymen, an Australian
who
also resides in Britain, strongly disagrees. John Pilger - the
eminent
investigative journalist and documentary filmmaker - is a harsh critic
of
the corporate media. Pilger began his career in journalism close to
half a
century ago. He has made over 50 documentaries and is the author of
numerous books, his most recent is titled &quot;Freedom Next Time:
Resisting
the Empire.&quot;
Today, we spend the hour with John Pilger talking about
journalism, war, propaganda, and silence.

_________________________________________________________________

PILGER TRANSCRIPT

JOHN PILGER: The title of this talk is Freedom Next Time, which is
the
title of my book, and the book is meant as an antidote to the
propaganda
that is so often disguised as journalism. So I thought I would talk
today
about journalism, about war by journalism, propaganda, and silence,
and
how that silence might be broken. Edward Bernays, the so-called father
of
public relations, wrote about an invisible government which is the
true
ruling power of our country. He was referring to journalism, the
media.
That was almost 80 years ago, not long after corporate
journalism
was invented. It is a history few journalist talk about or know about,
and
it began with the arrival of corporate advertising. As the new
corporations began taking over the press, something called
&quot;professional
journalism&quot; was invented. To attract big advertisers, the new
corporate
press had to appear respectable, pillars of the
establishmentobjective,
impartial, balanced.
The first schools of journalism were set up, and a mythology
of
liberal neutrality was spun around the professional journalist. The
right
to freedom of expression was associated with the new media and with
the
great corporations, and the whole thing was, as Robert McChesney put
it so
well, &quot;entirely bogus&quot;.

For what the public did not know was that in order to be
professional,
journalists had to ensure that news and opinion were dominated by
official
sources, and that has not changed. Go through the New York Times on
any
day, and check the sources of the main political stories - -domestic
and
foreign -- you'll find they're dominated by government and other
established interests. That is the essence of professional
journalism.
I am not suggesting that independent journalism was or is
excluded, but it is more likely to be an honorable exception. Think of
the
role Judith Miller played in the New York Times in the run-up to the
invasion of Iraq. Yes, her work became a scandal, but only after it
played
a powerful role in promoting an invasion based on lies.
Yet, Miller's parroting of official sources and vested
interests
was not all that different from the work of many famous Times
reporters,
such as the celebrated W.H. Lawrence, who helped cover up the true
effects
of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in August, 1945. &quot;No
Radioactivity
in Hiroshima Ruin,&quot; was the headline on his report, and it was false.

Consider how the power of this invisible government has grown. In 1983
the
principal global media were owned by 50 corporations, most of them
American. In 2002 this had fallen to just 9 corporations. Today it is
probably about 5. Rupert Murdoch has predicted that there will be
just
three global media giants, and his company will be one of them.
This concentration of power is not exclusive of course to the
United States. The BBC has announced it is expanding its broadcasts to
the
United States, because it believes Americans want principled,
objective,
neutral journalism for which the BBC is famous. They have launched
BBC
America. You may have seen the advertising.

The BBC began in 1922, just before the corporate press began in
America.
Its founder was Lord John Reith, who believed that impartiality and
objectivity were the essence of professionalism. In the same year the
British establishment was under siege. The unions had called a
general
strike and the Tories were terrified that a revolution was on the way.
The
new BBC came to their rescue. In high secrecy, Lord Reith wrote anti-
union
speeches for the Tory Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and broadcast
them to
the nation, while refusing to allow the labor leaders to put their
side
until the strike was over.
So, a pattern was set. Impartiality was a principle certainly:
a
principle to be suspended whenever the establishment was under
threat.

And that principle has been upheld ever since.

Take the invasion of Iraq.

There are two studies of the BBC's reporting. One shows that the BBC
gave
just 2 percent of its coverage of Iraq to antiwar dissent -- 2
percent.
That is less than the antiwar coverage of ABC, NBC, and CBS. A second
study by the University of Wales shows that in the buildup to the
invasion, 90 percent of the BBC's references to weapons of mass
destruction suggested that Saddam Hussein actually possessed them,
and
that by clear implication Bush and Blair were right. We now know that
the
BBC and other British media were used by the British secret
intelligence
service MI-6.
In what they called Operation Mass Appeal, MI-6 agents
planted
stories about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, such as weapons
hidden
in his palaces and in secret underground bunkers. All of these
stories
were fake. But that's not the point. The point is that the work of
MI-6
was unnecessary, because professional journalism on its own would
have
produced the same result.

Listen to the BBC's man in Washington, Matt Frei, shortly after the
invasion.
&quot;There is not doubt,&quot; he told viewers in the UK and all over
the
world, &quot;That the desire to bring good, to bring American values to
the
rest of the world, and especially now in the Middle East, is
especially
tied up with American military power.&quot;
In 2005 the same reporter lauded the architect of the
invasion,
Paul Wolfowitz, as someone who &quot;believes passionately in the power of
democracy and grassroots development.&quot; That was before the little
incident
at the World Bank.

None of this is unusual.
BBC news routinely describes the invasion as a miscalculation.
Not
Illegal, not unprovoked, not based on lies, but a miscalculation.

The words &quot;mistake&quot; and &quot;blunder&quot; are common BBC news currency, along
with
&quot;failure&quot;which at least suggests that if the deliberate, calculated,
unprovoked, illegal assault on defenseless Iraq had succeeded, that
would
have been just fine.
Whenever I hear these words I remember Edward Herman's
marvelous
essay about normalizing the unthinkable.
For that's what media cliched language does and is designed
to
doit normalizes the unthinkable; of the degradation of war, of
severed
limbs, of maimed children, all of which I've seen.
One of my favorite stories about the Cold War concerns a group
of
Russian journalists who were touring the United States. On the final
day
of their visit, they were asked by the host for their impressions.
&quot;I have to tell you,&quot; said the spokesman, &quot;that we were
astonished
to find after reading all the newspapers and watching TV day after
day
that all the opinions on all the vital issues are the same. To get
that
result in our country we send journalists to the gulag. We even tear
out
their fingernails. Here you don't have to do any of that. What is the
secret?&quot;

What is the secret?

It is a question seldom asked in newsrooms, in media colleges, in
journalism journals, and yet the answer to that question is critical
to
the lives of millions of people.
On August 24 last year the New York Times declared this in an
editorial: &quot;If we had known then what we know now the invasion if
Iraq
would have been stopped by a popular outcry.&quot;
This amazing admission was saying, in effect, that journalists
had
betrayed the public by not doing their job and by accepting and
amplifying
and echoing the lies of Bush and his gang, instead of challenging them
and
exposing them. What the Times didn't say was that had that paper and
the
rest of the media exposed the lies, up to a million people might be
alive
today. That's the belief now of a number of senior establishment
journalists. Few of them -- they've spoken to me about it -- few of
them
will say it in public.

Ironically, I began to understand how censorship worked in so-called
free
societies when I reported from totalitarian societies.
During the 1970s I filmed secretly in Czechoslovakia, then a
Stalinist dictatorship. I interviewed members of the dissident group
Charter 77, including the novelist Zdener Urbanek, and this is what
he
told me.
&quot;In dictatorships we are more fortunate that you in the West
in
one respect. We believe nothing of what we read in the newspapers and
nothing of what we watch on television, because we know it's
propaganda
and lies. Unlike you in the West. We've learned to look behind the
propaganda and to read between the lines, and unlike you, we know that
the
real truth is always subversive.&quot;

Vandana Shiva has called this subjugated knowledge. The great Irish
muckraker Claud Cockburn got it right when he wrote, &quot;Never believe
anything until it's officially denied.&quot;

One of the oldest cliches of war is that truth is the first casualty.
No
it's not. Journalism is the first casualty.
When the Vietnam War was over, the magazine Encounter
published an
article by Robert Elegant, a distinguished correspondent who had
covered
the war.
&quot;For the first time in modern history,&quot; he wrote, the outcome
of a
war was determined not on the battlefield, but on the printed page,
and
above all on the television screen.&quot;
He held journalists responsible for losing the war by opposing
it
in their reporting.
Robert Elegant's view became the received wisdom in Washington
and
it still is. In Iraq the Pentagon invented the embedded journalist
because
it believed that critical reporting had lost Vietnam.

The very opposite was true.

On my first day as a young reporter in Saigon, I called at the
bureaux of
the main newspapers and TV companies.
I noticed that some of them had a pinboard on the wall on
which
were gruesome photographs, mostly of bodies of Vietnamese and of
American
soldiers holding up severed ears and testicles. In one office was a
photograph of a man being tortured; above the torturers head was a
stick-on comic balloon with the words, &quot;that'll teach you to talk to
the
press.&quot;
None of these pictures were ever published or even put on the
wire.

I asked why.

I was told that the public would never accept them. Anyway, to
publish
them would not be objective or impartial. At first, I accepted the
apparent logic of this. I too had grown up on stories of the good war
against Germany and Japan, that ethical bath that cleansed the
Anglo-American world of all evil.

But the longer I stayed in Vietnam, the more I realized that our
atrocities were not isolated, nor were they aberrations, but the war
itself was an atrocity.

That was the big story, and it was seldom news. Yes, the tactics and
effectiveness of the military were questioned by some very fine
reporters.

But the word &quot;invasion&quot; was never used. The anodyne word used was
&quot;involved.&quot; America was involved in Vietnam.

The fiction of a well-intentioned, blundering giant, stuck in an
Asian
quagmire, was repeated incessantly.

It was left to whistleblowers back home to tell the subversive truth,
those like Daniel Ellsberg and Seymour Hersh, with his scoop of the My-
Lai
massacre. There were 649 reporters in Vietnam on March 16, 1968 -- the
day
that the My-Lai massacre happened -- and not one of them reported it.

In both Vietnam and Iraq, deliberate policies and strategies have
bordered
on genocide.

In Vietnam, the forced dispossession of millions of people and the
creation of free fire zones; in Iraq, an American-enforced embargo
that
ran through the 1990s like a medieval siege, and killed, according to
the
United Nations Children's fund, half a million children under the age
of
five.

In both Vietnam and Iraq, banned weapons were used against civilians
as
deliberate experiments. Agent Orange changed the genetic and
environmental
order in Vietnam. The military called this Operation Hades.

When Congress found out, it was renamed the friendlier Operation
Ranch
Hand, and nothing change.

That's pretty much how Congress has reacted to the war in Iraq. The
Democrats have damned it, rebranded it, and extended it.

The Hollywood movies that followed the Vietnam War were an extension
of
the journalism, of normalizing the unthinkable.

Yes, some of the movies were critical of the military's tactics, but
all
of them were careful to concentrate on the angst of the invaders.

The first of these movies is now considered a classic. It's The
Deerhunter, whose message was that America had suffered, America was
stricken, American boys had done their best against oriental
barbarians.
The message was all the more pernicious, because the Deerhunter was
brilliantly made and acted.

I have to admit it's the only movie that has made me shout out loud in
a
Cinema in protest.

Oliver Stone's acclaimed movie Platoon was said to be antiwar, and it
did
show glimpses of the Vietnamese as human beings, but it also promoted
above all the American invader as victim.

I wasn't going to mention The Green Berets when I set down to write
this,
until I read the other day that John Wayne was the most influential
movie
(actor) who ever lived. I saw the Green Berets starring John Wayne on
a
Saturday night in 1968 in Montgomery Alabama. (I was down there to
interview the then-infamous governor George Wallace). I had just come
back
from Vietnam, and I couldn't believe how absurd this movie was. So I
laughed out loud, and I laughed and laughed. And it wasn't long before
the
atmosphere around me grew very cold. My companion, who had been a
Freedom
Rider in the South, said, &quot;Let's get the hell out of here and run
like
hell.&quot;

We were chased all the way back to our hotel, but I doubt if any of
our
pursuers were aware that John Wayne, their hero, had lied so he
wouldn't
have to fight in World War II. And yet the phony role model of Wayne
sent
thousands of Americans to their deaths in Vietnam, with the notable
exceptions of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.

Last year, in his acceptance of the Nobel Prize for Literature, the
playwright Harold Pinter made an epic speech. He asked why, (and I
quote
him, )
&quot;The systematic brutality, the widespread atrocities, the
ruthless
suppression of independent thought in Stalinist Russia were well know
in
the West, while American state crimes were merely superficially
recorded,
left alone, documented.&quot;

And yet across the world the extinction and suffering of countless
human
beings could be attributed to rampant American power. &quot;But,&quot; said
Pinter,
&quot;You wouldn't know it. It never happened. Nothing ever happened. Even
while it was happening it wasn't happening. It didn't matter. It was
of no
interest.&quot; Pinter's words were more than the surreal. The BBC ignored
the
speech of Britain's most famous dramatist.

I've made a number of documentaries about Cambodia. The first was
Year
Zero: the Silent Death of Cambodia. It describes the American bombing
that
provided the catalyst for the rise of Pol Pot. What Nixon and
Kissinger
had started, Pol Pot completed -- CIA files alone leave no doubt of
that.
I offered Year Zero to PBS and took it to Washington. The PBS
executives
who saw it were shocked. They whispered among themselves. They asked
me to
wait outside. One of them finally emerged and said, &quot;John, we admire
your
film. But we are disturbed that it says the United States prepared the
way
for Pol Pot.&quot;

I said, &quot;Do you dispute the evidence?&quot; I had quoted a number of CIA
documents. &quot;Oh, no,&quot; he replied. &quot;But we've decided to call in a
journalistic adjudicator.&quot;

Now the term &quot;journalist adjudicator&quot; might have been invented by
George
Orwell. In fact they managed to find one of only three journalists who
had
been invited to Cambodia by Pol Pot. And of course he turned his
thumbs
down on the film, and I never heard from PBS again.
Year Zero was broadcast in some 60 countries and became one of
the
most watched documentaries in the world. It was never shown in the
United
States. Of the five films I have made on Cambodia, one of them was
shown
by WNET, the PBS station in New York. I believe it was shown at about
one
in the morning. On the basis of this single showing, when most people
are
asleep, it was awarded an Emmy. What marvelous irony. It was worthy of
a
prize but not an audience.

Harold Pinter's subversive truth, I believe, was that he made the
connection between imperialism and fascism, and described a battle
for
history that's almost never reported. This is the great silence of
the
media age. And this is the secret heart of propaganda today. A
propaganda
so vast in scope that I'm always astonished that so many Americans
know
and understand as much as they do. We are talking about a system, of
course, not personalities.

And yet, a great many people today think that the problem is George
W.
Bush and his gang. And yes, the Bush gang are extreme. But my
experience
is that they are no more than an extreme version of what has gone on
before. In my lifetime, more wars have been started by liberal
Democrats
than by Republicans.

Ignoring this truth is a guarantee that the propaganda system and the
war-making system will continue. We've had a branch of the Democratic
party running Britain for the last 10 years. Blair, apparently a
liberal,
has taken Britain to war more times than any prime minister in the
modern
era. Yes, his current pal is George Bush, but his first love was Bill
Clinton, the most violent president of the late 20th century. Blair's
successor, Gordon Brown is also a devotee of Clinton and Bush.
The other day, Brown said, &quot;The days of Britain having to
apologize for the British Empire are over. We should celebrate.&quot;

Like Blair, like Clinton, like Bush, Brown believes in the liberal
truth
that the battle for history has been won; that the millions who died
in
British-imposed famines in British imperial India will be
forgottenlike
the millions who have died in the American Empire will be forgotten.
And like Blair, his successor is confident that professional
journalism is on his side. For most journalists, whether they realize
it
or not, are groomed to be tribunes of an ideology that regards itself
as
non-ideological, that presents itself as the natural center, the very
fulcrum of modern life. This may very well be the most powerful and
dangerous ideology we have ever known because it is open-ended.

This is liberalism.

I'm not denying the virtues of liberalism -- far from it. We are all
beneficiaries of them. But if we deny its dangers, its open-ended
project,
and the all-consuming power of its propaganda, then we deny our right
to
true democracy, because liberalism and true democracy are not the
same.

Liberalism began as a preserve of the elite in the 19th century, and
true
democracy is never handed down by elites. It is always fought for and
struggled for.

A senior member of the antiwar coalition, United For Peace and
Justice,
said recently, and I quote her, &quot;The Democrats are using the politics
of
reality.&quot;

Her liberal historical reference point was Vietnam. She said that
President Johnson began withdrawing troops from Vietnam after a
Democratic
Congress began to vote against the war.

That's not what happened. The troops were withdrawn from Vietnam
after
four long years.

And during that time the United States killed more people in Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos with bombs than were killed in all the preceding
years.

And that's what's happening in Iraq. The bombing has doubled since
last
year, and this is not being reported.

And who began this bombing?

Bill Clinton began it. During the 1990s Clinton rained bombs on Iraq
in
what were euphemistically called the &quot;no fly zones.&quot;

At the same time he imposed a medieval siege called economic
sanctions,
killing as I've mentioned, perhaps a million people, including a
documented 500,000 children. Almost none of this carnage was reported
in
the so-called mainstream media.
Last year a study published by the Johns Hopkins School of
Public
Health found that since the invasion of Iraq 655, 000 Iraqis had died
as a
direct result of the invasion.
Official documents show that the Blair government knew this
figure
to be credible. In February, Les Roberts, the author of the report,
said
the figure was equal to the figure for deaths in the Fordham
University
study of the Rwandan genocide. The media response to Robert's
shocking
revelation was silence. What may well be the greatest episode of
organized
killing for a generation, in Harold Pinter's words, &quot;Did not happen.
It
didn't matter.&quot;

Many people who regard themselves on the left supported Bush's attack
on
Afghanistan.

That the CIA had supported Osama Bin Laden was ignored, that the
Clinton
administration had secretly backed the Taliban, even giving them
high-level briefings at the CIA, is virtually unknown in the United
States.

The Taliban were secret partners with the oil giant Unocal in building
an
oil pipeline across Afghanistan. And when a Clinton official was
reminded
that the Taliban persecuted women, he said, &quot;We can live with that.&quot;

There is compelling evidence that Bush decided to attack the Taliban
not
as a result of 9-11, but two months earlier, in July of 2001. This is
virtually unknown in the United States -- publicly.

Like the scale of civilian casualties in Afghanistan. To my knowledge
only
one mainstream reporter, Jonathan Steele of the Guardian in London,
has
investigated civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and his estimate is
20,000 dead civilians, and that was three years ago.

The enduring tragedy of Palestine is due in great part to the silence
and
compliance of the so-called liberal left.

Hamas is described repeatedly as sworn to the destruction of Israel.
The
New York Times, the Associated Press, the Boston Globe -- take your
pick.
They all use this line as a standard disclaimer, and it is false.

That Hamas has called for a ten-year ceasefire is almost never
reported.

Even more important, that Hamas has undergone an historic ideological
shift in the last few years, which amounts to a recognition of what
it
calls the reality of Israel, is virtually unknown; and that Israel is
sworn to the destruction of Palestine is unspeakable.

There is a pioneering study by Glasgow University on the reporting of
Palestine.

They interviewed young people who watch TV news in Britain. More than
90
percent thought the illegal settlers were Palestinian. The more they
watched, the less they knew -- Danny Schecter's famous phrase.

The current most dangerous silence is over nuclear weapons and the
return
of the Cold War.

The Russians understand clearly that the so-called American defense
shield
in Eastern Europe is designed to subjugate and humiliate them.

Yet the front pages here talk about Putin starting a new Cold War,
and
there is silence about the development of an entirely new American
nuclear
system called Reliable Weapons Replacement (RRW), which is designed
to
blur the distinction between conventional war and nuclear wara long-
held
ambition.

In the meantime, Iran is being softened up, with the liberal media
playing
almost the same role it played before the Iraq invasion.

And as for the Democrats, look at how Barak Obama has become the voice
of
the Council on Foreign Relations, one of the propaganda organs of the
old
liberal Washington establishment.

Obama writes that while he wants the troops home, &quot;We must not rule
out
military force against long-standing adversaries such as Iran and
Syria.&quot;
Listen to this from the liberal Obama:
&quot;At moment of great peril in the past century our leaders
ensured
that America, by deed and by example, led and lifted the world, that
we
stood and fought for the freedom sought by billions of people beyond
their
borders.&quot;

That is the nub of the propaganda, the brainwashing if you like, that
seeps into the lives of every American, and many of us who are not
Americans.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From right to left, secular to God-fearing, what so few people know
">

is
that in the last half century, United States adminstrations have
overthrown 50 governments -- many of them democracies. In the
process,
thirty countries have been attacked and bombed, with the loss of
countless
lives. Bush bashing is all very well -- and is justified -- but the
moment
we begin to accept the siren call of the Democrat's drivel about
standing
up and fighting for freedom sought by billions, the battle for history
is
lost, and we ourselves are silenced.

So what should we do? That question often asked in meetings I have
addressed, even meetings as informed as those in this conference, is
itself interesting. It's my experience that people in the so-called
third
world rarely ask the question, because they know what to do. And some
have
paid with their freedom and their lives, but they knew what to do.
It's a
question that many on the democratic left -- small &quot;d&quot; -- have yet to
answer.

Real information, subversive information, remains the most potent
power of
alland I believe that we must not fall into the trap of believing that
the
media speaks for the public.

That wasn't true in Stalinist Czechoslovakia and it isn't true of the
United States.

In all the years I've been a journalist, I've never know public
consciousness to have risen as fast as it's rising today.

Yes, its direction and shape is unclear, partly because people are
now
deeply suspicious of political alternatives, and because the
Democratic
Party has succeeded in seducing and dividing the electoral left.

And yet this growing critical public awareness is all the more
remarkable
when you consider the sheer scale of indoctrination, the mythology of
a
superior way of life, and the current manufactured state of fear.

Why did the New York Times come clean in that editorial last year?
Not
because it opposes Bush's wars -- look at the coverage of Iran.

That editorial was a rare acknowledgement that the public was
beginning to
see the concealed role of the media, and that people were beginning
to
read between the lines.

If Iran is attacked, the reaction and the upheaval cannot be
predicted.
The national security and homeland security presidential directive
gives
Bush power over all facets of government in an emergency. It is not
unlikely the constitution will be suspended -- the laws to round of
hundreds of thousands of so-called terrorists and enemy combatants
are
already on the books.

I believe that these dangers are understood by the public, who have
come
along way since 9-11, and a long way since the propaganda that linked
Saddam Hussein to al-Qaeda. That's why they voted for the Democrats
last
November, only to be betrayed. But they need truth, and journalists
ought
to be agents of truth, not the courtiers of power.

I believe a fifth estate is possible, the product of a people's
movement,
that monitors, deconstructs, and counters the corporate media. In
every
university, in every media college, in every news room, teachers of
journalism, journalists themselves need to ask themselves about the
part
they now play in the bloodshed in the name of a bogus objectivity.
Such a
movement within the media could herald a perestroika of a kind that
we
have never known. This is all possible.

Silences can be broken.

In Britain the National Union of Journalists has undergone a radical
change, and has called for a boycott of Israel. The web site
Medialens.org
has single-handedly called the BBC to account. In the United States
wonderfully free rebellious spirits populate the web -- I can't
mention
them all here -- from Tom Feeley's International Clearing House, to
Mike
Albert's ZNet, to Counterpunch online, and the splendid work of FAIR.
The
best reporting of Iraq appears on the web -- Dahr Jamail's courageous
journalism; and citizen reporters like Joe Wilding, who reported the
siege
of Fallujah from inside the city.

In Venezuela, Greg Wilpert's investigations turned back much of the
virulent propaganda now aimed at Hugo Chavez.

Make no mistake, it's the threat of freedom of speech for the majority
in
Venezuela that lies behind the campaign in the west on behalf of the
corrupt RCTV.

The challenge for the rest of us is to lift this subjugated knowledge
from
out of the underground and take it to ordinary people.

We need to make haste.
