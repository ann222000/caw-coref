The collateral deaths argument and the 'Perfect Solution Fallacy": a false dilemma.
</HEADLINE>

There's no perfect solution to this problem of the collateral
deaths found in agriculture, and the vegan's critic is often
foolishly persuaded to try using this dilemma to his advantage
when he's run out of valid arguments. He argues;

(Critic)
Abstaining from meat doesn't meet with the vegan's moral
requirement to not kill animals intentionally for food; animals
still die for their food during crop production.

This argument commits The Perfect Solution Fallacy by
assuming a perfect solution exists where no animals are killed
for their food in the practical World, and so their solution to
abide by their stated moral requirement to not kill animals for
food by abstaining from meat doesn't meet that requirement,
and so their solution (veganism) should be rejected because
some part of the problem (CDs) would still exist after it was
implemented.

(Rejoinder)
Some animals die during crop production, but those deaths
aren't requested, condoned or intentionally caused by vegans,
and this meets with their moral requirement to not kill animals
intentionally for food. Furthermore, the crops grown to feed
farmed animals far outweigh those grown ourselves, and they
also cause collateral deaths proportionally, as does fishing our
oceans for other sources of meat, known as by-catch. So while
the vegan abstains from farmed meat and fish he in fact reduces
those collateral deaths from what they would be if he were to
eat those meats.

A harsh critic of veganism even declared;

"This counting game will ALWAYS work against
meat eaters.  Far more of every bad thing you've
mentioned occurs as a result of people eating meat,
because so much of agriculture is simply to feed
the livestock. There would be far less agriculture
in general if everyone were vegetarian."
Jonathan Ball    4th May 03

And

"If you insist on playing a stupid counting game, you'll
lose. "vegans" and a few sensible meat eaters alike
have pointed out that the overwhelming majority of
grain is grown to feed livestock.  That means if you
eat meat that you bought at a store, you cause more
deaths:  the deaths of the animals you eat, plus the
CDs of the animals killed in the course of producing
feed for the animals you eat."
Jonathan Ball   22nd May 03

So, even while animals die during the course of crop
production, to assume the vegan's solution to this problem
should be rejected because some part of the problem would
still exist after it was implemented is specious.

A description of this fallacy and some further examples are
provided below.

The Perfect Solution Fallacy.
The perfect solution fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs
when an argument assumes that a perfect solution exists
and/or that a solution should be rejected because some part
of the problem would still exist after it was implemented.
Presumably, assuming no solution is perfect then no solution
would last very long politically once it had been implemented.
Still, many people (notably utopians) seem to find the idea of
a perfect solution compelling, perhaps because it is easy to
imagine.

Examples:
(critic)
This "terrorist safety net" is a bad idea. Terrorists will still be
able to get through!
(Rejoinder)
Yes, some terrorists would still be able to get through, but
would it be worth stopping those terrorists that it would stop?
(critic)
These anti-drunk driving ad campaigns are not going to work.
People are still going to drink and drive no matter what.
(Rejoinder)
It may not eliminate 100% of drunk driving, but is the amount
by which it would reduce the total amount of drunk driving
enough to make the policy worthwhile?
(Critic)
Seat belts are a bad idea. People are still going to die in car
wrecks.
(Rejoinder)
It may not save 100% of people involved in car wrecks, but
isn't the number of lives that would be saved enough to make
seat belts worthwhile?

It is common for arguments that commit this fallacy to omit
any specifics about how much the solution is claimed to not
work, but express it only in vague terms. Alternatively, it may
be combined with the fallacy of misleading vividness, when
a specific example of a solution's failing is described in eye-
catching detail and base rates are ignored (see availability
heuristic).
The fallacy is a kind of false dilemma.

Congratulations.  You've just committed the fallacy of "shifting the
goal posts"

I'm particularly struck by your wonderful embrace of the idea that
"accidental" deaths don't count in your moral calculus.

As long as we can say "oops!" or "didn't mean to!"  it's perfectly all
right to kill animals.  cool.

Which still doesn't address your shifting goalposts.  The core claim
that has been made by most vegan proponents is:

Their diet involves *no* (not fewer) animal deaths

Now, you are shifting the goal post by claiming that it involves
"fewer" deaths, again, without demonstrating that it does.

When it has been pointed out that agriculture does involve animal
deaths, you shift your goalposts to saying that they're "incidental"
and "accidental".

Saying that the argument poses a "false dilemma" just shows that one
of the core claims made by vegan proponents is false.  Thank you.

... the one you snipped away, unable to deal with it and the
fact that it shows where you've been arguing against the vegan
speciously for years.

&lt;restore&gt;
There's no perfect solution to this problem of the collateral
deaths found in agriculture, and the vegan's critic is often
foolishly persuaded to try using this dilemma to his advantage
when he's run out of valid arguments. He argues;

(Critic)
Abstaining from meat doesn't meet with the vegan's moral
requirement to not kill animals intentionally for food; animals
still die for their food during crop production.

This argument commits The Perfect Solution Fallacy by
assuming a perfect solution exists where no animals are killed
for their food in the practical World, and so their solution to
abide by their stated moral requirement to not kill animals for
food by abstaining from meat doesn't meet that requirement,
and so their solution (veganism) should be rejected because
some part of the problem (CDs) would still exist after it was
implemented.

(Rejoinder)
Some animals die during crop production, but those deaths
aren't requested, condoned or intentionally caused by vegans,
and this meets with their moral requirement to not kill animals
intentionally for food. Furthermore, the crops grown to feed
farmed animals far outweigh those grown ourselves, and they
also cause collateral deaths proportionally, as does fishing our
oceans for other sources of meat, known as by-catch. So while
the vegan abstains from farmed meat and fish he in fact reduces
those collateral deaths from what they would be if he were to
eat those meats.

A harsh critic of veganism even declared;

"This counting game will ALWAYS work against
meat eaters.  Far more of every bad thing you've
mentioned occurs as a result of people eating meat,
because so much of agriculture is simply to feed
the livestock. There would be far less agriculture
in general if everyone were vegetarian."
Jonathan Ball    4th May 03

And

"If you insist on playing a stupid counting game, you'll
lose. "vegans" and a few sensible meat eaters alike
have pointed out that the overwhelming majority of
grain is grown to feed livestock.  That means if you
eat meat that you bought at a store, you cause more
deaths:  the deaths of the animals you eat, plus the
CDs of the animals killed in the course of producing
feed for the animals you eat."
Jonathan Ball   22nd May 03

So, even while animals die during the course of crop
production, to assume the vegan's solution to this problem
should be rejected because some part of the problem would
still exist after it was implemented is specious.

A description of this fallacy and some further examples are
provided below.

The Perfect Solution Fallacy.
The perfect solution fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs
when an argument assumes that a perfect solution exists
and/or that a solution should be rejected because some part
of the problem would still exist after it was implemented.
Presumably, assuming no solution is perfect then no solution
would last very long politically once it had been implemented.
Still, many people (notably utopians) seem to find the idea of
a perfect solution compelling, perhaps because it is easy to
imagine.

Examples:
(critic)
This "terrorist safety net" is a bad idea. Terrorists will still be
able to get through!
(Rejoinder)
Yes, some terrorists would still be able to get through, but
would it be worth stopping those terrorists that it would stop?
(critic)
These anti-drunk driving ad campaigns are not going to work.
People are still going to drink and drive no matter what.
(Rejoinder)
It may not eliminate 100% of drunk driving, but is the amount
by which it would reduce the total amount of drunk driving
enough to make the policy worthwhile?
(Critic)
Seat belts are a bad idea. People are still going to die in car
wrecks.
(Rejoinder)
It may not save 100% of people involved in car wrecks, but
isn't the number of lives that would be saved enough to make
seat belts worthwhile?

It is common for arguments that commit this fallacy to omit
any specifics about how much the solution is claimed to not
work, but express it only in vague terms. Alternatively, it may
be combined with the fallacy of misleading vividness, when
a specific example of a solution's failing is described in eye-
catching detail and base rates are ignored (see availability
heuristic).
The fallacy is a kind of false dilemma.

That's your straw man vegan you thwack about because
the real vegans in the real World do acknowledge the
collateral deaths in crop production. No one believes
farming industries, or any other industry for that matter,
cause no collateral deaths. I've shown you articles from
vegan sources acknowledging CDs plenty of times now,
but you're still only interested in tackling your imaginary
vegan who refuses to acknowledge them instead because
it's easier for you. Here's an article from a vegan source
to remind you, yet again, that the vegan you argue against
is the vegan inside your head rather than the real vegan in
the real World.

[Collateral Damage

I was recently challenged to justify my consumption of rice.
After all, I am told, the process of harvesting rice (growing
in water) kills untold numbers of frogs, turtles, and fish.]
Robert Cohen author of: MILK A-Z
Executive Director (notmilk ... @notmilk.com)
Dairy Education Board
http://www.notmilk.com
This file: http://www.notmilk.com/collateraldamage.txt

Vegan web sources and literature acknowledge and discuss
the collateral deaths in agriculture at length. They aren't
ignored like you claim. It's clear, then, that your only argument
is against your imaginary vegan, and the argument you use
against this straw man vegan, as well as the real vegan,
commits the Perfect Solution Fallacy. You've been wasting
your time on this issue of collateral deaths for years now, I'm
very glad to say.

Vegans don't claim that their lifestyle is the perfect solution
to the killing of animals in food production. Only your straw
vegan claims that so he's easier to demolish. If you're only
capable of dealing with the imaginary vegans inside your
head, you're in the wrong place when trying to deal with the
real vegans in the real World here. I've shown you comments
from vegan web sites that deal with the problem of CDs, and
once again you've snipped those comments away, only to
proceed with trying to demolish your imaginary vegan again.
That's not good enough, so until you address the real vegan
your criticism of him has to be ignored.

Not at all.  In fact, of the total domestic consumption of cereal
grains 72% are used to feed livestock, 11% are for direct human

to produce different food products and alcoholic beverages.
Therefore, almost 90% of the cereal grains are consumed indirectly
by Americans. A similar pattern occurs for soybeans and oil seeds.
A large fraction of soybeans is used for feeding livestock, either
directly or in the form of by-products (bean meal) of soy oil
production, and in the food industry to produce soy oil for human
consumption.

The Least Harm Principle Suggests that Humans Should
Eat Beef, Lamb, Dairy, not a Vegan Diet.

S.L. Davis, Department of Animal Sciences, Oregon State
University, Corvallis, OR 97331.

Published in the Proceedings of the Third Congress of the
European Society for Agricultural and Food Ethics, 2001,
pp 440-450.

Key words: veganism, least harm, farm animals, field animals.

Introduction
Although the debate over the moral status of animals has been
going on for thousands of years (Shapiro, 2000), there has
been a resurgence of interest in this issue in the last quarter of
the 20th century.  One of the landmark philosophical works of
this period was the book by Regan (1983) called "A Case for
Animal Rights."  In that book, Regan concludes that animals
do have moral standing, that they are subjects-of-a-life with
interests that deserve equal consideration to the same interests
in humans, and therefore have the right to live their lives
without human interference.  As a consequence, he concludes
that humans have a moral obligation to consume a vegan (use
no animal products) diet and eliminate animal agriculture.
However, production of an all vegan diet also comes at the
cost of the lives of many animals, including mice, moles,
gophers, pheasants, etc.  Therefore, I asked Regan, "What
is the morally relevant difference between killing a field mouse
(or other animal of the field) so that humans may eat and killing
a pig (or chicken, calf or lamb) for the same purpose?  Animals
must die so that humans may eat, regardless whether they eat
a vegan diet or not.  So, how are we to choose our food supply
in a morally responsible manner?"  Regan's response could be
summarized by what may be called the "Least Harm Principle"
or LHP (Regan, Personal Communication).  According to LHP,
we must choose the food products that, overall, cause the
least harm to the least number of animals.  The following
analysis is an attempt to try to determine what humans should
eat if we apply that principle.

Regan's Vegan Conclusion is Problematic

I find Regan's response to my question to be problematic for
two reasons.  The first reason is because it seems to be a
philosophical slight of hand for one to turn to a utilitarian
defense (LHP) of a challenge to his vegan conclusion which
is based on animal rights theory.  If the question, "What is
the morally relevant difference?" can't be supported by the
animal rights theory, then it seems to me that the animal rights
theory must be rejected.  Instead, Regan turns to utilitarian
theory (which examines consequences of one's actions) to
defend the vegan conclusion.

The second problem I see with his vegan conclusion is that
he claims that the least harm would be done to animals if
animal agriculture was eliminated.  It may certainly be true
that fewer animals may be killed if animal agriculture was
eliminated, but could the LHP also lead to other alternative
conclusions?

Would pasture-based animal agriculture cause least harm?

Animals of the field are killed by several factors, including:

1. Tractors and farm implements run over them.
2. Plows and cultivators destroy underground burrows
and kill animals.
3. Removal of the crops (harvest) removes ground
cover allowing animals on the surface to be killed
by predators.
4. Application of pesticides.

So, every time the tractor goes through the field to plow,
disc, cultivate, apply fertilizer and/or pesticide, harvest,
etc., animals are killed.  And, intensive agriculture such
as corn and soybeans (products central to a vegan diet)
kills far more animals of the field than would extensive
agriculture like forage production, particularly if the forage
was harvested by ruminant animals instead of machines.
So perhaps fewer animals would be killed by producing
beef, lamb, and dairy products for humans to eat instead
of the vegan diet envisioned by Regan.

Accurate numbers of mortality aren't available, but Tew
and Macdonald (1993) reported that wood mouse
population density in cereal fields dropped from 25/ha
preharvest to less than 5/ha postharvest.  This decrease
was attributed to migration out of the field and to mortality.
Therefore, it may be reasonable to estimate mortality of
10 animals/ha in conventional corn and soybean
production.

There are 120 million ha of harvested cropland in the US
(USDA, 2000).  If all of that land was used to produce a
plant-based diet, and if 10 animals of the field are killed
per ha per year, then 10 x 120 million = 1200 million or
1.2 billion would be killed to produce a vegan diet.  If half
of that land (60 million) was converted to forage
production and if forage production systems decreased
the number of animals of the field killed per year by 50%
(5 per year per ha), the number of animals killed would be:

1. 60 million ha of traditional agriculture x 10 animals
per ha = 0.6 billion animals killed.
2. 60 million ha of forage production x 5 animals of
the field = 0.3 billion.

Therefore, in this hypothetical example, the change to
include some forage-based animal agriculture would
result in the loss of only 0.9 billion animals of the field
instead of 1.2 billion to support a vegan diet.  As a
result, the LHP would suggest that we are morally
obligated to consume a diet of ruminant products, not
a vegan diet, because it would result in the death of
fewer animals of the field.

But what of the ruminant animals that would need to
die to feed people?  According to the USDA numbers
quoted by Francione (2000), of the 8.4 billion animals
killed each year for food in the US, 8 billion of those
are poultry and only 41 million are ruminants (cows,
calves, sheep, lambs).  Even if the numbers of
ruminants killed for food each year doubled to replace
the 8 billion poultry, the total number of animals that
would need to be killed under this alternative would
still be fewer (0.9 billion + 82 million = 0.982 billion)
than in the vegan alternative (1.2 billion).

In conclusion, applying the Least Harm Principle as
proposed by Regan would actually argue that we
are morally obligated to move to a ruminant-based
diet rather than a vegan diet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You cannot claim that grass-fed beef isn't an option
">

Grass fed beef isn't a viable option because those animals
accrue collateral deaths like any other steer in the feedlot
from the crops they are fed.

While the meat pushers on these vegetarian and animal-
related forums try to convince vegans that grass fed
beef is that: grass fed, and therefore has a much lesser
association with the collateral deaths caused by farmers
growing animal feeds, they neglect to mention that
grass fed beef is also fed grains at the feedlot just like
any other steer, and therefore has a larger association
with collateral deaths than they would like to admit.

Meat-labeling guidelines are all over the place, allowing
producers to make whatever claims they want to with
impunity, so U.S.D.A. has "proposed minimum
requirements for livestock and meat industry production/
marketing claims, when adopted, will become the United
States Standards for Livestock and Meat Marketing
Claims." They are as follows;

[SUMMARY: These proposed minimum requirements
for livestock and meat industry production/marketing
claims, when adopted, will become the United States
Standards for Livestock and Meat Marketing Claims.
.....
Grass Fed Claims--Background: This claim refers
to the feeding regimen for livestock raised on grass,
green or range pasture, or forage throughout their
life cycle, with only limited supplemental grain
feeding allowed. Since it is necessary to assure the
animal's well being at all times, limited supplementation
is allowed during adverse environmental conditions.
Grass feeding usually results in products containing
lower levels of external and internal fat (including
marbling) than grain-fed livestock products.

Claim and Standard:
[sbull] Grass Fed.--Grass, green or range pasture, or
forage shall be 80% or more of the primary energy
source throughout the animal's life cycle.

BILLING CODE 3410-02-P]
http://www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/stand/ls0202.txt

These "proposed minimum requirements mean that
grass fed beef can in fact be fed up to 80% grains for
60 days in a feedlot, just like any other steer, and still
qualify as grass fed beef.

Comments from disgruntled grass fed beef producers
bear this out and reveal the lie behind grass fed beef;

[Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
most commented upon topic in this docket. We
will not belabor all the points of concern which
are addressed but will focus on the areas of
concern to our cooperative of growers. While
Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
you need to define both as what they ARE since
that is what is motivating the consumer.

While the intent of this language would suggest
that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
consumer expectations as is borne out in the
website comments.]
http://www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/stand/comments/mc213.pdf

and

Dear Mr. Carpenter,
The proposed definition of the claim ?grass fed,? as it
may appear on future USDA approved beef labels, is
meaningless in the context of the current United States
cattle market and would violate consumer trust if put
into effect.

The huge majority of all beef cattle in the United States
are ?finished? on a grain-based ration in a commercial
feed lot.  Even so, virtually all American cattle spend
80% or more of their lives on pasture eating grasses,
legumes and naturally occurring seeds (grain). Calling
these animals ?grass fed,? as proposed in the new label
claim definition, ignores the fact that in most cases their
whole diet for the last few months of their lives contains
no grass at all.   Calling these animals ?grass fed? therefore
becomes meaningless since virtually all cattle are grass fed
as in the proposed definition.

However, for the last decade, a small, but growing number
of producers, including ourselves, have been marketing
cattle finished exclusively on pasture and hay without the
use of unnatural levels of grain-based seeds.  This grass-
finished beef has been marketed as ?grassfed? or ?grass-
fed?, and these terms have come to be recognized by
millions of consumers.  The enormous publicity over the
last year for grassfed meats (following on best-selling
books such as The Omega Diet and Fast Food Nation)
has reinforced the perception that ?grass fed? is
synonymous with grass-finished and, by extension, that no
supplemental grain has been provided to the animals.

So, I feel that to call an animal that has received as much
as 20% of its total nutrition in a grain feeding finishing
program ?grass fed? could be misleading and confusing
to the consumer. Grain finishing of ruminants is an artificial
feeding practice born of our unique circumstances here in
the United States.  Grass feeding is the basis for ruminant
health consistent with the genetic structure and nutritional
requirements of the animals.  The claim ?grass fed? as used
on a USDA-approved label should mean that a grassfed
animal has received no grain other than that which is naturally
occurring on pasture or in hay feeds.

I am glad that the USDA is attempting to bring some order
to the grassfed meat discussion, but I join those voices that
have been raised calling for a larger forum in which to discuss
the definition of the grassfed claim as well as other new claims.
I ask that the March 31, 2003, deadline for public comment
be extended indefinitely to give all citizens, most particularly
those who have been building the grassfed meats market, our
customers, and those who support our efforts, the opportunity
to have our perspective thoroughly considered.

Thank you for your serious consideration of my comments.

Grass fed beef, then, isn't exactly what it's name
implies, and has just as much an association with
the collateral deaths found in crop production as
any other steer in the feedlot.

&gt;&gt;Some animals die during crop production, but those deaths

&gt;&gt;and this meets with their moral requirement to not kill animals
&gt;&gt;intentionally for food.

&gt;The Least Harm Principle Suggests that Humans Should
&gt;Eat Beef, Lamb, Dairy, not a Vegan Diet.

&gt;S.L. Davis,
">

.. and how many times those figures have been found
to be nothing other than guesswork. Davis' guesswork
is not peer-reviewed and has many flaws, as follows;

[While eating animals who are grazed rather than
intensively confined would vastly improve the welfare
of farmed animals given their current mistreatment,
Davis does not succeed in showing this is preferable
to vegetarianism. First, Davis makes a mathematical
error in using total rather than per capita estimates
of animals killed; second, he focuses on the number
of animals killed in ruminant and crop production
systems and ignores important considerations about
the welfare of animals under both systems; and third,
he does not consider the number of animals who are
prevented from existing under the two systems. After
correcting for these errors, Davis’s argument makes
a strong case for, rather than against, adopting a
vegetarian diet.

First, Davis makes an error in calculating how many
animals would be killed to feed a vegan-vegetarian
population.  He explains:

There are 120 million ha of cropland harvested in the
USA each year.  If all of that land was used to produce
crops to support a vegan diet, and if 15 animals of the
field are killed per ha per year, then
15 x 120 million  1800 million or 1.8 billion animals
would be killed annually to produce a vegan diet for
the USA (p. 5).

Davis estimates that only 7.5 animals of the field per
hectare die in ruminant-pasture. If we were to convert
half of the 120 million hectares of U.S. cropland to
ruminant-pasture and half to growing vegetables, Davis
claims we could feed the U.S. population on a diet of
ruminant meat and crops and kill only 1.35 billion animals
annually in the process. Thus, Davis concludes his
omnivorous proposal would save the lives of 450 million
animals each year (p. 6-7).

Davis mistakenly assumes the two systems—crops only
and crops with ruminant-pasture—using the same total
amount of land, would feed identical numbers of people
(i.e., the U.S. population). In fact, crop and ruminant
systems produce different amounts of food per hectare
-- the two systems would feed different numbers of people.
To properly compare the harm caused by the two systems,
we ought to calculate how many animals are killed in
feeding equal populations—or the number of animals killed
per consumer.

Davis suggests the number of wild animals killed per hectare
in crop production (15) is twice that killed in ruminant-pasture
(7.5). If this is true, then as long as crop production uses
less than half as many hectares as ruminant-pasture to
deliver the same amount of food, a vegetarian will kill fewer
animals than an omnivore. In fact, crop production uses less
than half as many hectares as grass-fed dairy and one-tenth
as many hectares as grass-fed beef to deliver the same
amount of protein. In one year, 1,000 kilograms of protein
can be produced on as few as 1.0 hectares planted with soy
and corn, 2.6 hectares used as pasture for grass-fed dairy
cows, or 10 hectares used as pasture for grass-fed beef
cattle (Vandehaar 1998; UNFAO 1996). As such, to obtain
the 20 kilograms of protein per year recommended for adults,
a vegan-vegetarian would kill 0.3 wild animals annually, a
lacto-vegetarian would kill 0.39 wild animals, while a Davis-
style omnivore would kill 1.5 wild animals. Thus, correcting
Davis’s math, we see that a vegan-vegetarian population
would kill the fewest number of wild animals, followed
closely by a lacto-vegetarian population.

However, suppose this were not the case and that, in fact,
fewer animals would be killed under Davis’s omnivorism.
Would it follow that Davis’s plan causes the least harm?
Not necessarily. Early in the paper, Davis shifts from
discussing the harm done to animals under different
agricultural systems to the number of animals killed. This
shift is not explained by Davis and is not justified by the
most common moral views, all of which recognize harms
in addition to those associated with killing.]
http://courses.ats.rochester.edu/nobis/papers/leastharm.htm

Davis' guesswork and bad math was debunked years ago,
so it's small wonder why he hasn't put his little paper up for
a peer review.

Nevertheless, that debunked and put aside, to reject a solution
(veganism) to the animal deaths found in man's diet on the basis
that some deaths will still occur after the solution is implemented
invokes the perfect solution fallacy, especially while that arguer
insists all foods cause animal deaths. In short, you're posing a
false dilemma to get your point accepted, and that wont do.

The Perfect Solution Fallacy.
The perfect solution fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs
when an argument assumes that a perfect solution exists
and/or that a solution should be rejected because some part
of the problem would still exist after it was implemented.
Presumably, assuming no solution is perfect then no solution
would last very long politically once it had been implemented.
Still, many people (notably utopians) seem to find the idea of
a perfect solution compelling, perhaps because it is easy to
imagine.

&gt; These &quot;proposed minimum requirements mean that
&gt; grass fed beef can in fact be fed up to 80% grains for
&gt; 60 days in a feedlot, just like any other steer, and still
&gt; qualify as grass fed beef.

&gt; Comments from disgruntled grass fed beef producers
&gt; bear this out and reveal the lie behind grass fed beef;

&gt; [Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
&gt; most commented upon topic in this docket. We
&gt; will not belabor all the points of concern which
&gt; are addressed but will focus on the areas of
&gt; concern to our cooperative of growers. While
&gt; Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
&gt; IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
&gt; NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
&gt; you need to define both as what they ARE since
&gt; that is what is motivating the consumer.

&gt; While the intent of this language would suggest
&gt; that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
&gt; especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
&gt; not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
&gt; 80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
&gt; the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
&gt; animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
&gt; 70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
&gt; fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
&gt; these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
&gt; consumer expectations as is borne out in the
&gt; website comments.]
&gt; http://www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/stand/comments/mc213.pdf

&gt; and

&gt; Dear Mr. Carpenter,
&gt; The proposed definition of the claim ?grass fed,? as it
&gt; may appear on future USDA approved beef labels, is
&gt; meaningless in the context of the current United States
&gt; cattle market and would violate consumer trust if put
&gt; into effect.

&gt; The huge majority of all beef cattle in the United States
&gt; are ?finished? on a grain-based ration in a commercial
&gt; feed lot.  Even so, virtually all American cattle spend
&gt; 80% or more of their lives on pasture eating grasses,
&gt; legumes and naturally occurring seeds (grain). Calling
&gt; these animals ?grass fed,? as proposed in the new label
&gt; claim definition, ignores the fact that in most cases their
&gt; whole diet for the last few months of their lives contains
&gt; no grass at all.   Calling these animals ?grass fed? therefore
&gt; becomes meaningless since virtually all cattle are grass fed
&gt; as in the proposed definition.

&gt; However, for the last decade, a small, but growing number
&gt; of producers, including ourselves, have been marketing
&gt; cattle finished exclusively on pasture and hay without the
&gt; use of unnatural levels of grain-based seeds.  This grass-
&gt; finished beef has been marketed as ?grassfed? or ?grass-
&gt; fed?, and these terms have come to be recognized by
&gt; millions of consumers.  The enormous publicity over the
&gt; last year for grassfed meats (following on best-selling
&gt; books such as The Omega Diet and Fast Food Nation)
&gt; has reinforced the perception that ?grass fed? is
&gt; synonymous with grass-finished and, by extension, that no
&gt; supplemental grain has been provided to the animals.

&gt; So, I feel that to call an animal that has received as much
&gt; as 20% of its total nutrition in a grain feeding finishing
&gt; program ?grass fed? could be misleading and confusing
&gt; to the consumer. Grain finishing of ruminants is an artificial
&gt; feeding practice born of our unique circumstances here in
&gt; the United States.  Grass feeding is the basis for ruminant
&gt; health consistent with the genetic structure and nutritional
&gt; requirements of the animals.  The claim ?grass fed? as used
&gt; on a USDA-approved label should mean that a grassfed
&gt; animal has received no grain other than that which is naturally
&gt; occurring on pasture or in hay feeds.

&gt; I am glad that the USDA is attempting to bring some order
&gt; to the grassfed meat discussion, but I join those voices that
&gt; have been raised calling for a larger forum in which to discuss
&gt; the definition of the grassfed claim as well as other new
&gt; claims.
&gt; I ask that the March 31, 2003, deadline for public comment
&gt; be extended indefinitely to give all citizens, most
&gt; particularly
&gt; those who have been building the grassfed meats market, our
&gt; customers, and those who support our efforts, the opportunity
&gt; to have our perspective thoroughly considered.

&gt; Thank you for your serious consideration of my comments.

Actually,  it isn't.

However, every argument, except for one, *for* veganism is fallacious.
It is not healthier than other diets, it is not more environmentally
friendly, it does not cause fewer deaths, and it not more efficient.

Each of those arguments falls apart in the face of real data, of which
the collateral deaths argument is one.

The *only* argument for it is "I prefer it."  That's the only valid
one.  Everything else is garbage.

&gt;&gt; the United States.  Grass feeding is the basis for ruminant
&gt;&gt; health consistent with the genetic structure and nutritional
&gt;&gt; requirements of the animals.  The claim ?grass fed? as used
&gt;&gt; on a USDA-approved label should mean that a grassfed
&gt;&gt; animal has received no grain other than that which is naturally
&gt;&gt; occurring on pasture or in hay feeds.

&gt;&gt; I am glad that the USDA is attempting to bring some order
&gt;&gt; to the grassfed meat discussion, but I join those voices that
&gt;&gt; have been raised calling for a larger forum in which to discuss
&gt;&gt; the definition of the grassfed claim as well as other new
&gt;&gt; claims.
&gt;&gt; I ask that the March 31, 2003, deadline for public comment
&gt;&gt; be extended indefinitely to give all citizens, most
&gt;&gt; particularly
&gt;&gt; those who have been building the grassfed meats market, our
&gt;&gt; customers, and those who support our efforts, the opportunity
&gt;&gt; to have our perspective thoroughly considered.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for your serious consideration of my comments.

&gt;&gt; Sincerely,

&gt;&gt; Grass fed beef, then, isn't exactly what it's name
&gt;&gt; implies, and has just as much an association with
&gt;&gt; the collateral deaths found in crop production as
&gt;&gt; any other steer in the feedlot.
&gt;&gt;Nope.

Yes, that is true, for several reasons.

Current methods of crop production (probably; presumptively ) may
involve collateral deaths, but raising, transporting, and marketing
animals for food *certainly* do, and always will. The question of
which diet involves fewer cannot be answered on a black-and-white
basis, because each individual diet must be evaluated independently.
However, given the optimum example of each type, a vegan diet will
always involve fewer deaths than a diet including meat, given the
same parameters in each case.  An *ideal* vegan diet would indeed
involve no animal deaths at all, while even an *ideal* omnivore
diet would involve at least some animal deaths.  As Derek has noted,
the ideal in either case is probably impossible in the real world,
so it cannot be used to critique any specific diet in the real
world.  It can only be used as a goal, or theoretical concept, and
in that case, the vegan diet must be better for animals.

Secondly, as far as the concept of animal rights, or animal liberation,
is concerned, the vegan diet wins hands-down.  Even a diet of hunted
meat involves a violation of the rights of the hunted animal by
its death at human hands. An equivalent diet of gathering need not
involve any intentional killing of rights-bearing animals at all.
If we consider a diet involving farmed animals, the animals' rights
are violated both by the entire process of breeding and raising
them, and the basic injustice of treating them as property, and
again in the process of slaughtering them.  Collateral deaths in
the field, or in protection of food in storage, would involve, at the
most, the single injustice of lack of consideration of the animals'
rights in "pest control."

There is absolutely no way a diet involving meat can be seen as more
just for animals, or less harmful for them, if the same criteria are
applied to any individual example.  It is only by comparing vastly
different examples ("comparing apples and oranges" ) that any diet
including meat can be seen as less harmful on a utilitarian basis.
This must be a dishonest approach to the issue.

BTW, Jane Goodall has recently published a new book on the issue of
animal- and environmentally-friendly diet, for those who are interested.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   .....
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Grass Fed Claims--Background: This claim refers
&gt;&gt;&gt;  to the feeding regimen for livestock raised on grass,
&gt;&gt;&gt;  green or range pasture, or forage throughout their
&gt;&gt;&gt;  life cycle, with only limited supplemental grain
&gt;&gt;&gt;  feeding allowed. Since it is necessary to assure the

&gt;&gt;&gt;  is allowed during adverse environmental conditions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Grass feeding usually results in products containing
&gt;&gt;&gt;  lower levels of external and internal fat (including
&gt;&gt;&gt;  marbling) than grain-fed livestock products.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [sbull] Grass Fed.--Grass, green or range pasture, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;  forage shall be 80% or more of the primary energy

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/stand/ls0202.txt

&gt;&gt;&gt; These &quot;proposed minimum requirements mean that
&gt;&gt;&gt; grass fed beef can in fact be fed up to 80% grains for
&gt;&gt;&gt; 60 days in a feedlot, just like any other steer, and still
&gt;&gt;&gt; qualify as grass fed beef.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Comments from disgruntled grass fed beef producers
&gt;&gt;&gt; bear this out and reveal the lie behind grass fed beef;

&gt;&gt;&gt; [Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
&gt;&gt;&gt; most commented upon topic in this docket. We
&gt;&gt;&gt; will not belabor all the points of concern which
&gt;&gt;&gt; are addressed but will focus on the areas of
&gt;&gt;&gt; concern to our cooperative of growers. While
&gt;&gt;&gt; Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
&gt;&gt;&gt; IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you need to define both as what they ARE since
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is what is motivating the consumer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; While the intent of this language would suggest
&gt;&gt;&gt; that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
&gt;&gt;&gt; especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
&gt;&gt;&gt; 80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
&gt;&gt;&gt; the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
&gt;&gt;&gt; animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
&gt;&gt;&gt; 70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
&gt;&gt;&gt; fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
&gt;&gt;&gt; these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
&gt;&gt;&gt; consumer expectations as is borne out in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; website comments.]
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/stand/comments/mc213.pdf

&gt;&gt;&gt; and

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Mr. Carpenter,
&gt;&gt;&gt; The proposed definition of the claim ?grass fed,? as it
&gt;&gt;&gt; may appear on future USDA approved beef labels, is
&gt;&gt;&gt; meaningless in the context of the current United States
&gt;&gt;&gt; cattle market and would violate consumer trust if put
&gt;&gt;&gt; into effect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The huge majority of all beef cattle in the United States
&gt;&gt;&gt; are ?finished? on a grain-based ration in a commercial
&gt;&gt;&gt; feed lot.  Even so, virtually all American cattle spend
&gt;&gt;&gt; 80% or more of their lives on pasture eating grasses,
&gt;&gt;&gt; legumes and naturally occurring seeds (grain). Calling
&gt;&gt;&gt; these animals ?grass fed,? as proposed in the new label
&gt;&gt;&gt; claim definition, ignores the fact that in most cases their
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole diet for the last few months of their lives contains
&gt;&gt;&gt; no grass at all.   Calling these animals ?grass fed?
&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore
&gt;&gt;&gt; becomes meaningless since virtually all cattle are grass fed
&gt;&gt;&gt; as in the proposed definition.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, for the last decade, a small, but growing number
&gt;&gt;&gt; of producers, including ourselves, have been marketing
&gt;&gt;&gt; cattle finished exclusively on pasture and hay without the
&gt;&gt;&gt; use of unnatural levels of grain-based seeds.  This grass-
&gt;&gt;&gt; finished beef has been marketed as ?grassfed? or ?grass-
&gt;&gt;&gt; fed?, and these terms have come to be recognized by
&gt;&gt;&gt; millions of consumers.  The enormous publicity over the
&gt;&gt;&gt; last year for grassfed meats (following on best-selling
&gt;&gt;&gt; books such as The Omega Diet and Fast Food Nation)
&gt;&gt;&gt; has reinforced the perception that ?grass fed? is
&gt;&gt;&gt; synonymous with grass-finished and, by extension, that no
&gt;&gt;&gt; supplemental grain has been provided to the animals.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I feel that to call an animal that has received as much
&gt;&gt;&gt; as 20% of its total nutrition in a grain feeding finishing
&gt;&gt;&gt; program ?grass fed? could be misleading and confusing
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the consumer. Grain finishing of ruminants is an
&gt;&gt;&gt; artificial

=============================
No fool, the dishonesty is from vegans.  They cannot compare
real-world diets to each other.  But then, that's not news
because they don't even compare the foods they do eat to each
other and make choices that cause n0/fewer/less deaths of
animals.  You follow only a simply rule for your simple mind, eat
no meat.  You focus only on what you think others are doing so
that you can ignore your own bloody footprints.
The truth is that the typical usenet vegan does nothing to
alleviate animal death and suffering.  You could reduce your
impact without any major changes in lifestyle/convenience by
replacing 100s of 1000s of veggie calories with the death of one
animal.  Those meat choices are readily available while your
fairy-tale gathering is, well, just a fairy-tale.
Another proof of your relying on your simple rule for your simple
mind is your focus on meat.  A product that you claim not to eat,
and totally ignoring any comparisons of the foods you do eat.  If
animal death and suffering were of any real concern to vegans
there would be a list of veggies and the cost in animal deaths
that each cause.  I know that there is no concern for this as
vegan food groups/recipes/foods always talk about bananas.  A
product that has caused the destruction of millions and millions
of acres of rain-forests, and depends on massive use of
pesticides and transportation.

Precisely, and the distinction between the two does bear some

You've misused the term. My comment follows from what I
wrote, and from Rick's response to what I wrote. Foraging
for wild vegetables and fruits easily beats grass fed beef or
hunted meat.

[Many people who live in the countryside already know how
to harvest nature's bounty, food that is available to anyone
who takes the time and trouble to learn about 'wild foods'
that abound in their localities. Much of this knowledge has
been passed down through the generations, and many of the
'wild foods' that made up the staple diets of peoples over the
past 15,000 years or more are still available today ...

Below are a small selection of books about the 'wild foods'
that can be found in the countryside, both in North America,
and overlapping with plants common to parts of northwestern
Europe. In subsequent pages there are books about small-scale
organic food production, survival skills and wilderness living,
along with articles and some step-by-step details about becoming
as 'self-sufficient' as possible in an increasingly uncertain world.
Useful skills for expeditions, exploring, camping trips, and for
those simply wanting to re-learn the 'ancient survival skills' of our
ancestors who survived the cataclysms of the distant past ...
...
The most seriously committed vegans forage for their own foods,
taking advantage of some of nature's lesser-known but often
intensely flavorful wild bounty. As "Wildman" Steve Brill points
out in The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook, it takes a lot of education
and plenty of experience to identify and make use of the bounty
of the earth's forests and seas. Foragers must learn to distinguish
not only between the toxic and the edible but also must discern
which among the edible plants are actually tasty and worth
harvesting and cooking. Brill offers an encyclopedia of lore and
plenty of identifying botanical data for wild foods, but more pictures
would help sort out these thousands of plants from one another,
especially in the perilous world of fungi identification. Recipes
abound, and they follow vegan principles, using everyday oils,
vinegars, and other basic ingredients.]
http://www.morien-institute.org/wildfoodbooks_us.html

So, why do you promote a least-harm diet that includes the deaths
of animals when foraging is the better option? Why, to promote
meat at any cost, that's why, meat pusher.

&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL  Thanks for admitting you are wrong

&gt;&gt; No, I've shown that I'm right by offering a better solution
&gt;&gt; than the grass fed beef or hunted meat you offer: foraging
&gt;&gt; for wild vegetables and fruits. You'll do best to include
&gt;&gt; that solution when offering the least harm diet, but being
&gt;&gt; the meat pusher that you are you'll probably ignore it and
&gt;&gt; continue offering your CD-laden grass fed beef instead.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [SUMMARY: These proposed minimum requirements
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  for livestock and meat industry production/marketing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  claims, when adopted, will become the United States
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Standards for Livestock and Meat Marketing Claims.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   .....
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Grass Fed Claims--Background: This claim refers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  to the feeding regimen for livestock raised on grass,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  green or range pasture, or forage throughout their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  life cycle, with only limited supplemental grain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  feeding allowed. Since it is necessary to assure the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  animal's well being at all times, limited supplementation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  is allowed during adverse environmental conditions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Grass feeding usually results in products containing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  lower levels of external and internal fat (including
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  marbling) than grain-fed livestock products.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Claim and Standard:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [sbull] Grass Fed.--Grass, green or range pasture, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  forage shall be 80% or more of the primary energy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  source throughout the animal's life cycle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These &quot;proposed minimum requirements mean that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grass fed beef can in fact be fed up to 80% grains for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60 days in a feedlot, just like any other steer, and still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; qualify as grass fed beef.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Comments from disgruntled grass fed beef producers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bear this out and reveal the lie behind grass fed beef;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most commented upon topic in this docket. We
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will not belabor all the points of concern which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are addressed but will focus on the areas of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concern to our cooperative of growers. While
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you need to define both as what they ARE since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is what is motivating the consumer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While the intent of this language would suggest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consumer expectations as is borne out in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; website comments.]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/stand/comments/mc213.pdf

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Mr. Carpenter,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The proposed definition of the claim ?grass fed,? as it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may appear on future USDA approved beef labels, is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meaningless in the context of the current United States
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cattle market and would violate consumer trust if put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into effect.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The huge majority of all beef cattle in the United States
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are ?finished? on a grain-based ration in a commercial
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feed lot.  Even so, virtually all American cattle spend
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 80% or more of their lives on pasture eating grasses,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legumes and naturally occurring seeds (grain). Calling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these animals ?grass fed,? as proposed in the new label
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claim definition, ignores the fact that in most cases their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole diet for the last few months of their lives contains
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no grass at all.   Calling these animals ?grass fed?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; becomes meaningless since virtually all cattle are grass fed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as in the proposed definition.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, for the last decade, a small, but growing number
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of producers, including ourselves, have been marketing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cattle finished exclusively on pasture and hay without the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use of unnatural levels of grain-based seeds.  This grass-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finished beef has been marketed as ?grassfed? or ?grass-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fed?, and these terms have come to be recognized by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; millions of consumers.  The enormous publicity over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last year for grassfed meats (following on best-selling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books such as The Omega Diet and Fast Food Nation)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has reinforced the perception that ?grass fed? is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; synonymous with grass-finished and, by extension, that no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supplemental grain has been provided to the animals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I feel that to call an animal that has received as much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as 20% of its total nutrition in a grain feeding finishing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; program ?grass fed? could be misleading and confusing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the consumer. Grain finishing of ruminants is an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; artificial
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feeding practice born of our unique circumstances here in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the United States.  Grass feeding is the basis for ruminant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; health consistent with the genetic structure and nutritional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requirements of the animals.  The claim ?grass fed? as used

Hmm.. according to several of your colleagues, lobsters are sentient -
despite the fact that they have the same nervous system as a thrip.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I've shown that I'm right by offering a better solution
&gt;&gt;&gt; than the grass fed beef or hunted meat you offer: foraging
&gt;&gt;&gt; for wild vegetables and fruits. You'll do best to include
&gt;&gt;&gt; that solution when offering the least harm diet, but being
&gt;&gt;&gt; the meat pusher that you are you'll probably ignore it and
&gt;&gt;&gt; continue offering your CD-laden grass fed beef instead.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; qualify as grass fed beef.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most commented upon topic in this docket. We
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will not belabor all the points of concern which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are addressed but will focus on the areas of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concern to our cooperative of growers. While
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you need to define both as what they ARE since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is what is motivating the consumer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While the intent of this language would suggest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consumer expectations as is borne out in the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Mr. Carpenter,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The proposed definition of the claim ?grass fed,? as it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may appear on future USDA approved beef labels, is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meaningless in the context of the current United States
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cattle market and would violate consumer trust if put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into effect.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The huge majority of all beef cattle in the United States
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are ?finished? on a grain-based ration in a commercial
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feed lot.  Even so, virtually all American cattle spend
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 80% or more of their lives on pasture eating grasses,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legumes and naturally occurring seeds (grain). Calling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these animals ?grass fed,? as proposed in the new label
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claim definition, ignores the fact that in most cases their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole diet for the last few months of their lives contains
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no grass at all.   Calling these animals ?grass fed?

No matter what we do it will involve animals existing,
unless we can prevent all of them from ever being born.
So the question should ALWAYS be asked: which
animals do we want to promote life for. If you feel it's
none, then explain why. If you feel we should promote
life for some and not for others, explain that. You, Dutch
and Goo all agree that we should provide lives for wildlife
INSTEAD OF lives for wildlife AND livestock, but none
of you can explain WHICH wildlife, and/or WHY. Even
more absurdly: you/"they" insist that we should consider
the lives of wildlife and also other potential future wildlife,
but we should NOT do the same in regards to livestock.

The ONLY way to prevent the killing of wildlife in crop
fields is to prevent them from living, the same as the only
way to prevent humans, livestock, and all other beings
from dying is to prevent them from living. Much as all of
you appear to hate it for some odd reason, death means
life, and life means death. ALWAYS!!!

every turn, so explain to me why you favour livestock animals
over wild animals, Harrison? Also, if your argument is to provide
lives for livestock animals, why choose large animals that require
a lot space when rats would populate that same space in larger
numbers? Surely, if your goal is to produce more lives by eating
livestock, you should be eating rats.

That sounds right. Try asking an "ARA" which rights they
would provide for which animals. There could be none for
domestic animals which would no longer exist of course, but
what about wildlife? "ARAs" contribute to wildlife deaths by
their use of roads, buildings, paper and wood products,
electricity, food, products which have been mined etc just
as everyone else does, so *which* animals do they expect
us to be fooled into thinking they want to provide with *which*
rights???

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some animals die during crop production, but those deaths

Comments from disgruntled grass fed beef producers
bear this out and reveal the lie behind grass fed beef;

[Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
most commented upon topic in this docket. We
will not belabor all the points of concern which
are addressed but will focus on the areas of
concern to our cooperative of growers. While
Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
you need to define both as what they ARE since
that is what is motivating the consumer.

While the intent of this language would suggest
that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
consumer expectations as is borne out in the
website comments.]

Yes, you can't ignore the claims standard for grass fed beef
issued by U.S.D.A. and the messages from disgruntled farmers
over it. Even consumer magazines show the lie behind so-called
grass fed beef, and indicate the farmers' protests over the claims
standard. Read on.

[The claims “100 percent grass fed” and “grass fed only,”
which may appear on other companies’ packaging, would
be useful if true, but they’re not verified, either.

A proposal by the USDA for an optional verification program
for “process claims,” including feeding methods, would only
add to the confusion. Products that passed an inspection could
carry a “USDA Process Verified” shield next to the label “grass
fed” if as little as 80 percent of the feed were grass, with no
limits on the other 20 percent; “grain fed” could be used with a
diet of as little as 50 percent grain. The agency has delayed
implementation of the rule after protests from farmer and
consumer groups, including Consumers Union, publisher of
Consumer Reports magazine.]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This argument commits The Perfect Solution Fallacy

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Fallacy is that veganism is a Perfect Solution, a &quot;death-free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lifestyle&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vegans don't claim that their lifestyle is the perfect solution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the killing of animals in food production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, for the most part that is exactly what they believe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No.

&gt;&gt;&gt;At the very least they claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution,

&gt;&gt; No,

&gt;What *do* they think is the best solution?
">

I'll leave you to ask them that; that way you'll have no
excuse when misinterpreting their position to knock it
down more easily. Now for the rest of the post you've
snipped away in embarrassment; do you have the
courage to address it?

&lt;restore entire post&gt;
No, you don't get to make claims on behalf of all vegans.
That's your straw man again. Abstaining from meat is a
solution to avoid the killing of animals for food, and while
that solution still involves the killing of some animals in
crop production, it's a fallacy to reject that solution on
that basis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Yet again, instead of dealing with real vegans in the real
&gt;&gt; World who acknowledge collateral deaths in crop production,
&gt;&gt; you choose to focus on the imaginary straw man vegan that

&gt;&gt; easy to knock down, leaving the way open for you to declare
&gt;&gt; you've demolished the true vegan's position in the real World.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; real vegans in the real World here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Real World vegans display the attitudes and ideas I am attributing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;them.

&gt;&gt; No, they don't. I've provided examples from various vegan web

&gt;&gt; vegans refuse to acknowledge them in light of this evidence is

&gt;A couple of sites give cds a passing mention, always in some obscure part of
&gt;the site, always to dismiss their importance.

Whatever they say about their importance is of little concern
here. What IS of concern is your reluctance to concede that,
contrary to what you try to claim, vegan literature does
acknowledge them, and individual vegans like myself discuss
them at length. Those fact in place, it's a lie to claim vegans
ignore them. In short, you're a liar.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's not good enough, so until you address the real vegan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your criticism of him has to be ignored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The issue of collateral deaths is ignored or trivialized by vegans.

&gt;&gt; No, once again, it is not. Try dealing with the arguments put
&gt;&gt; forward by the real vegans in the real World instead of those
&gt;&gt; imaginary vegans inside your head. It's patently obvious that
&gt;&gt; you have no valid complaint against the real vegan until you do.

That's a non-response. You cannot expect your criticism of

&gt;&gt; because you'll be invoking the perfect solution fallacy. Like
&gt;&gt; I said, you've been wasting your time on this collateral deaths
&gt;&gt; issue for years, and it's about time you thought of something
&gt;&gt; else to challenge the vegan with apart from fallacies and lies.

&gt;Thanks for mentioning the Perfect Solution fallacy, it's very descriptive of
&gt;veganism.

Rather, it pertains to the fallacy non-vegans use to reject
veganism. Rejecting veganism as a solution to the animal
deaths associated in man's diet on the basis that animal
deaths will still exist after veganism is implemented in a
World where collateral deaths are ubiquitous is specious.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It's certainly the best solution where the deaths of farmed

collateral deaths.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Hitting a nerve? That's good. The collateral deaths argument
is debunked, so it's back to the drawing board for you until
you can come up with something that doesn't invoke logical
fallacies, doesn't include a straw man vegan who refuses to
acknowledge collateral deaths, and isn't based on lies.
&lt;end restore&gt;

You're screwed. All the antis are screwed, and it's your
own fault because you've hinged everything on the
collateral deaths argument and now been shown that it's
nothing more than a common little false dilemma.

Do you believe that the solution (drug squad) to drug
addiction must be rejected as a nonsense and hypocrisy
simply because drug addicts still exist after the solution's
implementation?

Do you believe that the solution (oral hygiene) to dental
decay must be rejected as a nonsense and hypocrisy
simply because tooth decay still occurs after the solution's
implementation?

If the answer is 'no' to both of those examples, and it is, it
then follows that the same answer must be given when
considering;

Do you believe that the solution to halt animal deaths in
man's diet (veganism) must be rejected as a nonsense
and hypocrisy simply because animal deaths (CD) still
occur after the solution's implementation?

As we can see, the collateral deaths argument against the
proposition of veganism poses a false dilemma, and so it
is rejected on that basis, as well as quite a few others I
can think of as well.

&gt; [Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
&gt; most commented upon topic in this docket. We
&gt; will not belabor all the points of concern which
&gt; are addressed but will focus on the areas of
&gt; concern to our cooperative of growers. While
&gt; Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
&gt; IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
&gt; NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
&gt; you need to define both as what they ARE since
&gt; that is what is motivating the consumer.

&gt; While the intent of this language would suggest
&gt; that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
&gt; especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
&gt; not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
&gt; 80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
&gt; the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
&gt; animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
&gt; 70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
&gt; fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
&gt; these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
&gt; consumer expectations as is borne out in the
&gt; website comments.]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beef is that: grass fed, and therefore has a much lesser

&gt;&gt; the least-harm diet, you meat pushing liar?
&gt;&gt;Because fairy-tales don't count.
">

Foraging for wild vegetables and fruits isn't a fairy tale, and
it beats your CD-laden so-called grass fed beef and hunted
meat every time, so why don't you offer that instead? Look
below at the information on foraging, you stupid liar.

[Many people who live in the countryside already know how
to harvest nature's bounty, food that is available to anyone
who takes the time and trouble to learn about 'wild foods'
that abound in their localities. Much of this knowledge has
been passed down through the generations, and many of the
'wild foods' that made up the staple diets of peoples over the
past 15,000 years or more are still available today ...

Below are a small selection of books about the 'wild foods'
that can be found in the countryside, both in North America,
and overlapping with plants common to parts of northwestern
Europe. In subsequent pages there are books about small-scale
organic food production, survival skills and wilderness living,
along with articles and some step-by-step details about becoming
as 'self-sufficient' as possible in an increasingly uncertain world.
Useful skills for expeditions, exploring, camping trips, and for
those simply wanting to re-learn the 'ancient survival skills' of our
ancestors who survived the cataclysms of the distant past ...
...
The most seriously committed vegans forage for their own foods,
taking advantage of some of nature's lesser-known but often
intensely flavorful wild bounty. As "Wildman" Steve Brill points
out in The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook, it takes a lot of education
and plenty of experience to identify and make use of the bounty
of the earth's forests and seas. Foragers must learn to distinguish
not only between the toxic and the edible but also must discern
which among the edible plants are actually tasty and worth
harvesting and cooking. Brill offers an encyclopedia of lore and
plenty of identifying botanical data for wild foods, but more pictures
would help sort out these thousands of plants from one another,
especially in the perilous world of fungi identification. Recipes
abound, and they follow vegan principles, using everyday oils,
vinegars, and other basic ingredients.]
http://www.morien-institute.org/wildfoodbooks_us.html

So, why do you promote a least-harm diet that includes the deaths
of animals when foraging is the better option? Why, to promote
meat at any cost, that's why, you dirty meat pusher.

Yes, liar. Grass fed beef IS finished at the feedlot like any
other steer and accumulates collateral deaths by virtue of
the feed given it during that time. That is the inescapable
fact that ruins your argument permanently.

&gt;&gt; [Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
&gt;&gt; most commented upon topic in this docket. We
&gt;&gt; will not belabor all the points of concern which
&gt;&gt; are addressed but will focus on the areas of
&gt;&gt; concern to our cooperative of growers. While
&gt;&gt; Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
&gt;&gt; IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
&gt;&gt; NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
&gt;&gt; you need to define both as what they ARE since
&gt;&gt; that is what is motivating the consumer.

&gt;&gt; While the intent of this language would suggest
&gt;&gt; that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
&gt;&gt; especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
&gt;&gt; not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
&gt;&gt; 80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
&gt;&gt; the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
&gt;&gt; animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
&gt;&gt; 70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
&gt;&gt; fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
&gt;&gt; these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
&gt;&gt; consumer expectations as is borne out in the
&gt;&gt; website comments.]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's no perfect solution to this problem of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; collateral deaths found in agriculture, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vegan's critic is often foolishly persuaded to try
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using this dilemma to his advantage when he's run
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out of valid arguments.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL  It's the vegan that has no valid argument fool.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You've yet to EVER prove your claims that your deit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is better. I have easily shown that there are diets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that are better than many vegan diets, and yours in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;particular, killer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, you can't beat foraging for wild vegetables and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't do that do you, fool!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, your grass fed beef or hunted meat cannot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; best forging for wild vegetables and fruits. Whether I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forage or not is irrelevant.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL  Thanks for admitting you are wrong

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I've shown that I'm right by offering a better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than the grass fed beef or hunted meat you offer:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; foraging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for wild vegetables and fruits. You'll do best to include
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that solution when offering the least harm diet, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the meat pusher that you are you'll probably ignore it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; continue offering your CD-laden grass fed beef instead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I have. You can't beat foraging for wild vegetables
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Resorting to your dishonest snipping again

&gt;&gt;&gt; I snip where I want without your permission, so deal with
&gt;&gt;&gt; my comment and stop whining.You can't beat foraging
&gt;&gt;&gt; for vegetables and fruits with your CD-laden grass fed
&gt;&gt;&gt; beef and hunted meat, so why don't you offer that instead
&gt;&gt;&gt; when asked for your opinion on what you consider to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; the least-harm diet, you meat pushing liar?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because fairy-tales don't count.

&gt; Foraging for wild vegetables and fruits isn't a fairy tale, and
&gt; it beats your CD-laden so-called grass fed beef and hunted
&gt; meat every time, so why don't you offer that instead? Look
&gt; below at the information on foraging, you stupid liar.

&gt; [Many people who live in the countryside already know how
&gt;  to harvest nature's bounty, food that is available to anyone
&gt;  who takes the time and trouble to learn about 'wild foods'
&gt;  that abound in their localities. Much of this knowledge has
&gt;  been passed down through the generations, and many of the
&gt;  'wild foods' that made up the staple diets of peoples over the
&gt;  past 15,000 years or more are still available today ...

&gt;  Below are a small selection of books about the 'wild foods'
&gt;  that can be found in the countryside, both in North America,
&gt;  and overlapping with plants common to parts of northwestern
&gt;  Europe. In subsequent pages there are books about small-scale
&gt;  organic food production, survival skills and wilderness
&gt; living,
&gt;  along with articles and some step-by-step details about
&gt; becoming
&gt;  as 'self-sufficient' as possible in an increasingly uncertain
&gt; world.
&gt;  Useful skills for expeditions, exploring, camping trips, and
&gt; for
&gt;  those simply wanting to re-learn the 'ancient survival skills'
&gt; of our
&gt;  ancestors who survived the cataclysms of the distant past ...
&gt;  ...
&gt; The most seriously committed vegans forage for their own foods,
&gt;  taking advantage of some of nature's lesser-known but often
&gt;  intensely flavorful wild bounty. As &quot;Wildman&quot; Steve Brill
&gt; points
&gt;  out in The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook, it takes a lot of
&gt; education
&gt;  and plenty of experience to identify and make use of the
&gt; bounty
&gt;  of the earth's forests and seas. Foragers must learn to
&gt; distinguish
&gt;  not only between the toxic and the edible but also must
&gt; discern
&gt;  which among the edible plants are actually tasty and worth
&gt;  harvesting and cooking. Brill offers an encyclopedia of lore
&gt; and
&gt;  plenty of identifying botanical data for wild foods, but more
&gt; pictures
&gt;  would help sort out these thousands of plants from one
&gt; another,
&gt;  especially in the perilous world of fungi identification.
&gt; Recipes
&gt;  abound, and they follow vegan principles, using everyday oils,
&gt;  vinegars, and other basic ingredients.]
&gt; http://www.morien-institute.org/wildfoodbooks_us.html

&gt; So, why do you promote a least-harm diet that includes the
&gt; deaths
&gt; of animals when foraging is the better option? Why, to promote
&gt; meat at any cost, that's why, you dirty meat pusher.
">

I promote a viable, convienent, available for everyone diet,
unlike you, fool.  I see you still cannot defend YOUR diet,
hypocrite?  Why is it that you continue to focus on a fairy-tale
instead of the diet you really eat?  Oh, yeah, because the one
you eat causes massive, unnecessary death and suffering of
animals, eh killer?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No fool, they do not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Evidence from U.S.D.A. shows that grass fed beef can be

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you did, you would have seen that the meat from those
&gt;&gt;&gt; so-called grass fed animals can legitimately carry a “USDA
&gt;&gt;&gt; Process Verified” shield next to the label “grass fed” if as
&gt;&gt;&gt; little as 80 percent of the feed were grass, with no limits
&gt;&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the other 20 percent. Read U.S.D.A.'s claims standard for
&gt;&gt;&gt; grass fed beef again and see it for yourself.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No

&gt; Yes, liar. Grass fed beef IS finished at the feedlot like any
&gt; other steer and accumulates collateral deaths by virtue of
&gt; the feed given it during that time. That is the inescapable
&gt; fact that ruins your argument permanently.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
&gt;&gt;&gt; most commented upon topic in this docket. We
&gt;&gt;&gt; will not belabor all the points of concern which
&gt;&gt;&gt; are addressed but will focus on the areas of
&gt;&gt;&gt; concern to our cooperative of growers. While
&gt;&gt;&gt; Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
&gt;&gt;&gt; IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you need to define both as what they ARE since
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is what is motivating the consumer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; While the intent of this language would suggest
&gt;&gt;&gt; that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
&gt;&gt;&gt; especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
&gt;&gt;&gt; 80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
&gt;&gt;&gt; the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
&gt;&gt;&gt; animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
&gt;&gt;&gt; 70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
&gt;&gt;&gt; fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
&gt;&gt;&gt; these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
&gt;&gt;&gt; consumer expectations as is borne out in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; website comments.]
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/stand/comments/mc213.pdf

&gt;&gt;&gt; Grass fed beef can be and is finished on grains like any
&gt;&gt;&gt; other steer with U.S.D.A.'s full seal of approval, despite
&gt;&gt;&gt; your empty, desperate denials.

&gt; You can't escape this fact, you dirty liar, and denying it

The facts speak for themselves, all beef cattle eat grass most of
their lives, and then only 3/4 of those are sent to feedlots.
That's striaght from the USDA fool.  Too bad you're just too

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The perfect solution fallacy is a logical fallacy that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occurs when an argument assumes that a perfect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution exists and/or that a solution should be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rejected because some part of the problem would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still exist after it was implemented. Presumably,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assuming no solution is perfect then no solution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would last very long politically once it had been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implemented. Still, many people (notably utopians)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to find the idea of a perfect solution compelling,

So quit wasting your time trying.

The "False [moral] Dilemma" here is the killing of animals in the production
of food, and veganism is it's false solution. The collateral deaths
revelation unmasks the false dilemma while at the same time tearing away the
facade of veganism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still die for their food during crop production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This argument commits The Perfect Solution Fallacy

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Fallacy is that veganism is a Perfect Solution, a &quot;death-free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lifestyle&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vegans don't claim that their lifestyle is the perfect solution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the killing of animals in food production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, for the most part that is exactly what they believe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;At the very least they claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution,

&gt;&gt;&gt; No,

&gt;&gt;What *do* they think is the best solution?

&gt; I'll leave you to ask them that;

Aren't you one? Or at least I thought you were representing their position,
YOU answer. If veganism is not the best solution to this "Dilemma" then what
is?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out of valid arguments.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL  It's the vegan that has no valid argument fool.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You've yet to EVER prove your claims that your deit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is better. I have easily shown that there are diets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that are better than many vegan diets, and yours in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;particular, killer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, you can't beat foraging for wild vegetables and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't do that do you, fool!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, your grass fed beef or hunted meat cannot

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I've shown that I'm right by offering a better solution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than the grass fed beef or hunted meat you offer: foraging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for wild vegetables and fruits. You'll do best to include
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that solution when offering the least harm diet, but being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the meat pusher that you are you'll probably ignore it and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; continue offering your CD-laden grass fed beef instead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I have. You can't beat foraging for wild vegetables

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because fairy-tales don't count.

&gt;&gt; Foraging for wild vegetables and fruits isn't a fairy tale, and
&gt;&gt; it beats your CD-laden so-called grass fed beef and hunted

&gt;&gt; below at the information on foraging, you stupid liar.
&gt;&gt;Fairy-tales, fool.
">

People have survived for thousands of years on staple diets
by foraging wild vegetables and fruits. Read the comments
on foraging again (below).

[Many people who live in the countryside already know how
to harvest nature's bounty, food that is available to anyone
who takes the time and trouble to learn about 'wild foods'
that abound in their localities. Much of this knowledge has
been passed down through the generations, and many of the
'wild foods' that made up the staple diets of peoples over the
past 15,000 years or more are still available today ...

Below are a small selection of books about the 'wild foods'
that can be found in the countryside, both in North America,
and overlapping with plants common to parts of northwestern
Europe. In subsequent pages there are books about small-scale
organic food production, survival skills and wilderness living,
along with articles and some step-by-step details about becoming
as 'self-sufficient' as possible in an increasingly uncertain world.
Useful skills for expeditions, exploring, camping trips, and for
those simply wanting to re-learn the 'ancient survival skills' of our
ancestors who survived the cataclysms of the distant past ...
...
The most seriously committed vegans forage for their own foods,
taking advantage of some of nature's lesser-known but often
intensely flavorful wild bounty. As "Wildman" Steve Brill points
out in The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook, it takes a lot of education
and plenty of experience to identify and make use of the bounty
of the earth's forests and seas. Foragers must learn to distinguish
not only between the toxic and the edible but also must discern
which among the edible plants are actually tasty and worth
harvesting and cooking. Brill offers an encyclopedia of lore and
plenty of identifying botanical data for wild foods, but more
pictures would help sort out these thousands of plants from one
another,  especially in the perilous world of fungi identification.
Recipes abound, and they follow vegan principles, using everyday
oils, vinegars, and other basic ingredients.]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm not.

&gt;&gt; Yes, you are lying, and the evidence from U.S.D.A. proves

&gt;Styraight from the USDA
">

Fine. Now go back to the U.S.D.A. and see how it defines
the remainder of that "three fourths of them" which aren't
(allegedly) grain fed: grass fed.

Grass Fed Claims--Background: This claim refers
to the feeding regimen for livestock raised on grass,
green or range pasture, or forage throughout their
life cycle, with only limited supplemental grain
feeding allowed. Since it is necessary to assure the
animal's well being at all times, limited supplementation
is allowed during adverse environmental conditions.
Grass feeding usually results in products containing
lower levels of external and internal fat (including
marbling) than grain-fed livestock products.

Claim and Standard:
[sbull] Grass Fed.--Grass, green or range pasture, or
forage shall be 80% or more of the primary energy
source throughout the animal's life cycle.

Dated: December 20, 2002.

BILLING CODE 3410-02-P]
http://www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/stand/ls0202.txt

This standard means that grass fed beef can in fact be
fed up to 80% grains for 60 days in a feedlot, just like
any other steer, and still qualify as grass fed beef.

Comments from disgruntled grass fed beef producers
bear this out and reveal the lie behind grass fed beef;

[Grass Fed Claims; This would appear to be the
most commented upon topic in this docket. We
will not belabor all the points of concern which
are addressed but will focus on the areas of
concern to our cooperative of growers. While
Grain Fed addressed specifically what the method
IS, Grass Fed seems to try to define what it IS
NOT. This dichotomy is confusing. We feel that
you need to define both as what they ARE since
that is what is motivating the consumer.

While the intent of this language would suggest
that Grass Fed animals are not Grain Finished,
especially in Feedlots, the language as written is
not at all clear to that end. In fact by allowing
80% of consumed energy to be concentrated at
the finishing stage, our data suggests that beef
animals could be fed 50% forage /50% grain for
70 days at finishing. Likewise an animal could be
fed 85% grain for 60 days and still qualify under
these guidelines. This is absolutely not in line with
consumer expectations as is borne out in the
website comments.]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, for the most part that is exactly what they believe.

Veganism. Now, that behind us, when are you going to
summon the courage to address this post you keep
snipping away and explain why you insist on arguing
with your straw man vegan instead of the real vegans
if not to knock your straw vegan down easily to then
declare a defeat of the real vegan's position?

No, you don't get to make claims on behalf of all vegans.
That's your straw man again. Abstaining from meat is a
solution to avoid the killing of animals for food, and while
that solution still involves the killing of some animals in
crop production, it's a fallacy to reject that solution on
that basis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; real vegans in the real World here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Real World vegans display the attitudes and ideas I am attributing to

&gt;&gt; No, they don't. I've provided examples from various vegan web

&gt;A couple of sites give cds a passing mention, always in some obscure part of
&gt;the site, always to dismiss their importance.

Whatever they say about their importance is of little concern
here. What IS of concern is your reluctance to concede that,
contrary to what you try to claim, vegan literature does
acknowledge them, and individual vegans like myself discuss
them at length. Those fact in place, it's a lie to claim vegans
ignore them. In short, you're a liar.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's not good enough, so until you address the real vegan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your criticism of him has to be ignored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The issue of collateral deaths is ignored or trivialized by vegans.

&gt;&gt; No, once again, it is not. Try dealing with the arguments put
&gt;&gt; forward by the real vegans in the real World instead of those
&gt;&gt; imaginary vegans inside your head. It's patently obvious that
&gt;&gt; you have no valid complaint against the real vegan until you do.

&gt;It's obvious that you're talking through your hat.

That's a non-response. You cannot expect your criticism of
vegans to be taken seriously while your definition and criticism
focuses on your imaginary vegan. What would be the point in
arguing against a critic who's only criticism focuses on HIS

&gt;&gt; When or if you finally decide to challenge the real vegan's

&gt;&gt; because you'll be invoking the perfect solution fallacy. Like
&gt;&gt; I said, you've been wasting your time on this collateral deaths
&gt;&gt; issue for years, and it's about time you thought of something
&gt;&gt; else to challenge the vegan with apart from fallacies and lies.

&gt;Thanks for mentioning the Perfect Solution fallacy, it's very descriptive of
&gt;veganism.

Rather, it pertains to the fallacy non-vegans use to reject
veganism. Rejecting veganism as a solution to the animal
deaths associated in man's diet on the basis that animal
deaths will still exist after veganism is implemented in a
World where collateral deaths are ubiquitous is specious.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Vegans think that there is a Perfect Solution to animal death and

It's certainly the best solution where the deaths of farmed
animals and fish is concerned, and their huge associated
collateral deaths.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What a bunch of wankers.

Hitting a nerve? That's good. The collateral deaths argument
is debunked, so it's back to the drawing board for you until
you can come up with something that doesn't invoke logical
fallacies, doesn't include a straw man vegan who refuses to
acknowledge collateral deaths, and isn't based on lies.

You're screwed. All the antis are screwed, and it's your
own fault because you've hinged everything on the
collateral deaths argument and now been shown that it's
nothing more than a common little false dilemma.

Do you believe that the solution (drug squad) to drug
addiction must be rejected as a nonsense and hypocrisy
simply because drug addicts still exist after the solution's
implementation?

Do you believe that the solution (oral hygiene) to dental
decay must be rejected as a nonsense and hypocrisy
simply because tooth decay still occurs after the solution's
implementation?

If the answer is 'no' to both of those examples, and it is, it
then follows that the same answer must be given when
considering;

Do you believe that the solution to halt animal deaths in
man's diet (veganism) must be rejected as a nonsense
and hypocrisy simply because animal deaths (CD) still
occur after the solution's implementation?

As we can see, the collateral deaths argument against the
proposition of veganism poses a false dilemma, and so it
is rejected on that basis, as well as quite a few others I
can think of as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Read it and find that you've been wasting your time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the collateral deaths issue for years, I'm glad to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Har har

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's no getting away from it; the collateral deaths
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; argument against veganism is a fallacy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;==========================
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ROTFLMAO  What a hoot!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Get used to it, Etter, however hard it must be for someone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like you to accept. You have no choice but to accept the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fact that the collateral deaths argument is specious in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that it poses a false dilemma.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;===========================
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL  The problem for you is that you cannot accept the fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that you kill animals for nothing more than your convenience
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and entertainment.   There is no meaning to your veganism,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;killer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once again you have fallen for the perfect solution fallacy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by rejecting *my* veganism on the basis that, despite *my*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implementation of veganism as a solution to animal deaths,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; animal deaths still occur in a World where animal deaths
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot be avoided in food production generally. In short,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you're posing a false dilemma as described above. Thanks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for lending yourself so willingly in such a clear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstration.
&gt;&gt;&gt;===========
&gt;&gt;&gt;No

&gt;&gt; Yes, you stupid imbecile, you've tried posing exactly the
&gt;&gt; same false dilemma that you always do, and I reject it on
&gt;&gt; the basis that it invokes a fallacy. You lose, you dirty little
&gt;&gt; liar.
&gt;===========
&gt;No
">

Repeating you denial at this stage after being shown this
false dilemma you pose is absurd, but then you deny the
facts to everything that ruins your trolling here, so it isn't
as absurd as I first believed. I reject your argument on
the basis that it poses a false dilemma, and I've given you
examples analogous to your collateral deaths argument to
show that you are posing a sub fallacy of the false dilemma
known as 'the perfect solution fallacy.' You and your false
dilemma are old news now.

Once again you have fallen for the same fallacy by
rejecting veganism as a solution on the basis that some
animals deaths will still occur after its implementation in
a World where animal deaths in food production are
allegedly inescapable.

The Perfect Solution Fallacy.
The perfect solution fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs
when an argument assumes that a perfect solution exists
and/or that a solution should be rejected because some part
of the problem would still exist after it was implemented.
Presumably, assuming no solution is perfect then no solution
would last very long politically once it had been implemented.
Still, many people (notably utopians) seem to find the idea of
a perfect solution compelling, perhaps because it is easy to
imagine.

Examples:
(critic)
This "terrorist safety net" is a bad idea. Terrorists will still be
able to get through!
(Rejoinder)
Yes, some terrorists would still be able to get through, but
would it be worth stopping those terrorists that it would stop?
(critic)
These anti-drunk driving ad campaigns are not going to work.
People are still going to drink and drive no matter what.
(Rejoinder)
It may not eliminate 100% of drunk driving, but is the amount
by which it would reduce the total amount of drunk driving
enough to make the policy worthwhile?
(Critic)
Seat belts are a bad idea. People are still going to die in car
wrecks.
(Rejoinder)
It may not save 100% of people involved in car wrecks, but
isn't the number of lives that would be saved enough to make
seat belts worthwhile?

It is common for arguments that commit this fallacy to omit
any specifics about how much the solution is claimed to not
work, but express it only in vague terms. Alternatively, it may
be combined with the fallacy of misleading vividness, when
a specific example of a solution's failing is described in eye-
catching detail and base rates are ignored (see availability
heuristic).
The fallacy is a kind of false dilemma.

No, of course not.  You could just as well claim that the idea that
killing *humans* is a moral problem in a world where human deaths,
collateral, accidental, and intentional, are ubiquitous is specious.

The scale may be different in *some* areas -- although not all --
for humans.  In some times and places, the scale is similar, and
sometimes even the rationale is similar.  But because it's
*our* species, humans other than those doing the killing usually
consider the killing a moral problem.

Consider "ethnic cleansing" or "the final solution" or the
campaign against the kulaks in Soviet Russia, or the killing
of the aristocrats in France during the Terror, or many other
examples.  The humans killed were defined as a threat or even
a "pest" in much the same way animals are defined in
agriculture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Taking account of something does not require that others respond in the

The solution does not work *for you*.  It does work for others,
because the moral issue for them is, or may be, different.  If
the issue is the property status of farmed animals, and the
injustice of denying them appropriate liberty and moral status,
veganism is a solution to that moral issue.  You cannot define
that moral issue as meaningless *for others* because you see it
as meaningless for you.

[Non-human] animals are simply orders of magnitude more common than humans.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Taking animals as a group, the scale of killing of animals vs humans is not
comparable at all. If you single out species of animals to make the
comparison then you must justify doing so. I would agree that great apes and
whooping cranes are killed far less frequently by humans than humans are
killed by other humans, so a rationale for not killing them applies to those
species for reasons specific to them. Another contradiction of vegans/ARAs

As I said above, if you define the issue rationally, then within those

NOT address the underlying principle of justice that you just asserted.
Animal products do NOT necessarily imply the denying of liberty or freedom

There are several answers to this given by various writers on
animal rights.  Regan, and those who accept his basic rights-based
concept, feel that because humans are the only moral agents we
know, only humans have an obligation to act ethically toward moral
patients, which include most animals above a certain degree of
self-awareness.  Francione takes a legal-style approach, which
is reasonable since he is a professor who teaches law.  He uses
the human example that we are obligated not to violate the rights
of others actively, but we are not legally obligated to aid other
humans, and the same applies to animals. What we are obligated to
do is not to treat animals as property or mere resources. Linzey,
like C.S. Lewis in an earlier generation, refers to predation as
"the vampire's dilemma," regards it as a result of the Fall and
the corrupt state of Creation, and sees no end to it until the
Second Coming when all creation will be made new.  He says that
"there is no pure land" and we can only change our own behavior
toward animals.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We would be violating the rights of
&gt; these animals
">

Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but in doing so we would prevent the rights of many
&gt; more animals from being violated.
">

Not according to the rights-based theories, which hold that
only a moral agent can violate rights, and so that, while
prey animals would suffer death, their *rights* would not
be violated, because moral patients cannot hold rights against
other moral patients.

Most pro-animal-rights people simply note that obligate
carnivores *must* kill, and that when there is
real necessity, this cannot be a moral issue.

I think the most convincing position, for me, is that of
Sapontzis in his _Morals, Reason, and Animals_.  His
answer is somewhat like yours below.  He says that "humans
are morally obligated to prevent predation whenever doing
so would not occasion as much or more suffering than it
would prevent."  This seems very much in tune with a common
sense approach in the real world.  For example, humans are
obligated to prevent predation by their companion animals,
to defend animals over whom they have stewardship (animals
in zoos, domestic flocks and herds, and so on) from
predation by other animals, and so on.  However, exterminating
wild predators not only causes suffering to them, but suffering
to their prey when the ecosystem in unbalanced, and there is
no practical way to make it work.  We've seen this many time
in the real world when predators have been removed from an
ecosystem.  However, because we *are* moral agents, and
because humans are not obligate carnivores, we cannot take
over the role of predators without violating the rights of
the prey animals.  Recent efforts to reintroduce top predators
to ecosystems where they have been eliminated, such as the
wolves in Yellowstone, seem to me to be the best solution.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; have a useful role to play in the ecosystem, maintaining the balance

I'd say that ecosystems have no interests -- an ecosystem is not
conscious.  Only individual conscious beings within an ecosystem
have interests _per se_.  However, preserving a healthy, balanced
ecosystem is usually the best way to foster the interests of the
conscious members of the ecosystem.

Yes, in and of itself.  However, the other additional injustices
involved in farming animals make it, as I see it, worse.  An
animal spending a lifetime in a factory farm surely suffers
more, and has his natural behaviors frustrated longer and worse, than
a free animal who lives his own life and pursues his own interests
up until the time of his death.

If we go back to the scavenger model, that would certainly be true.

We'd have to ask if we are considering "harmful" in a pure
utilitarian sense, the net balance of suffering for all concerned,
or if we are talking about harm in an at-least-partly rights-based
sense, in which harm cannot justly be done in violation of a being's
rights, even if such harm will provide a benefit to others.  We
already generally agree this is unethical in the case of rights-
bearing beings (e.g. humans).

&gt; (Critic)
&gt; Vegans claim that abstaining from meat means their diet does not

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; collateral deaths issue for years, I'm glad to say.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Har har

&gt;&gt; &gt;There's no getting away from it; the collateral deaths argument
&gt;&gt; &gt;against veganism is a fallacy.

&gt;&gt; Actually,  it isn't.

&gt;&gt; However, every argument, except for one, *for* veganism is fallacious.
&gt;&gt; It is not healthier than other diets, it is not more environmentally
&gt;&gt; friendly, it does not cause fewer deaths, and it not more efficient.

&gt; The problem with all these claims is that there is no single &quot;vegan
&gt; diet&quot;
&gt; and no single &quot;other diet&quot;.

Excellent observation, you are failing veganism 101.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Each of those arguments falls apart in the face of real data, of which
&gt;&gt; the collateral deaths argument is one.
&gt; As a general rule vegan diets compare favourably to other diets in

&gt; a piece of meat you also indirectly consume the plants that were fed to
&gt; the animals.

But veganism is not a "general rule" proposition, it's a binary "solution".
It does not refer only to animals that are fed supplementally, it refers to
all animals killed to obtain "products" therefore this argument is a red
herring.

&gt;&gt; Not necessarily. Avoiding all animal products will certainly reduce

&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, as far as the concept of animal rights, or animal liberation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;is concerned, the vegan diet wins hands-down.  Even a diet of hunted

&gt;&gt;&gt;its death at human hands.

&gt;&gt; If predation is a violation of an animals rights then why shouldn't we
&gt;&gt; exterminate predator species?

&gt; There are several answers to this given by various writers on
&gt; animal rights.  Regan, and those who accept his basic rights-based
&gt; concept, feel that because humans are the only moral agents we
&gt; know, only humans have an obligation to act ethically toward moral
&gt; patients, which include most animals above a certain degree of
&gt; self-awareness.  Francione takes a legal-style approach, which
&gt; is reasonable since he is a professor who teaches law.  He uses
&gt; the human example that we are obligated not to violate the rights
&gt; of others actively, but we are not legally obligated to aid other
&gt; humans, and the same applies to animals. What we are obligated to
&gt; do is not to treat animals as property or mere resources. Linzey,
&gt; like C.S. Lewis in an earlier generation, refers to predation as
&gt; &quot;the vampire's dilemma,&quot; regards it as a result of the Fall and
&gt; the corrupt state of Creation, and sees no end to it until the
&gt; Second Coming when all creation will be made new.  He says that
&gt; &quot;there is no pure land&quot; and we can only change our own behavior
&gt; toward animals.

Occam's Razor says that killing other animals to obtain food, as other

&gt; I think the most convincing position, for me, is that of

&gt; so would not occasion as much or more suffering than it
&gt; would prevent.&quot;  This seems very much in tune with a common
&gt; sense approach in the real world.  For example, humans are
&gt; obligated to prevent predation by their companion animals,
&gt; to defend animals over whom they have stewardship (animals
&gt; in zoos, domestic flocks and herds, and so on) from
&gt; predation by other animals, and so on.  However, exterminating
&gt; wild predators not only causes suffering to them, but suffering
&gt; to their prey when the ecosystem in unbalanced, and there is
&gt; no practical way to make it work.  We've seen this many time
&gt; in the real world when predators have been removed from an
&gt; ecosystem.  However, because we *are* moral agents, and
&gt; because humans are not obligate carnivores, we cannot take
&gt; over the role of predators without violating the rights of

&gt;&gt; and when it is in the interests of a given ecosystem for him to do so?

&gt; I'd say that ecosystems have no interests -- an ecosystem is not

&gt;&gt;&gt;An equivalent diet of gathering need not

&gt;&gt;&gt;If we consider a diet involving farmed animals, the animals' rights

&gt;&gt;&gt;them, and the basic injustice of treating them as property,

&gt;&gt; I am not comfortable with the idea of animals being reduced

&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;again in the process of slaughtering them.  Collateral deaths in

&gt;&gt;&gt;rights in &quot;pest control.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Which is every bit an injustice as killing an animal for food.

&gt; Yes, in and of itself.  However, the other additional injustices
&gt; involved in farming animals make it, as I see it, worse.  An
&gt; animal spending a lifetime in a factory farm surely suffers
&gt; more, and has his natural behaviors frustrated longer and worse, than
&gt; a free animal who lives his own life and pursues his own interests
&gt; up until the time of his death.

&gt;&gt; In fact
&gt;&gt; if we ate the victims of 'pest control' then we would need to grow
&gt;&gt; less food and hence cause fewer injustices.

&gt; By that logic, a murderer who ate his victim would be less

I disagree on both counts. Veganism is the best solution
to by-catch;

[About 2.3 billion pounds of sea life were discarded in
the U.S. in 2000 alone, and thousands of the ocean's
most charismatic species - including sea turtles, marine
mammals, sharks and seabirds - are killed each year
by fishing nets, lines and hooks. These deaths have
implications for both marine populations and marine
food webs.

"Considering the documented decline in global fisheries,
this kind of waste is unacceptable. But because this
travesty is unseen by most people, it continues," said
Dr. Crowder.

Experts agree that bottom trawls are one of the worst
offenders, entrapping

**vast numbers of non-targeted animals.**

"The first time I was on a trawler, I was appalled to see
that for every pound of shrimp caught there were 20
pounds of sharks, rays, crabs, and starfish killed. The
shrimpers called this bycatch 'trawl trash' - I call it
'biodiversity'," noted Elliott Norse of the Marine
Conservation Biology Institute. "Of course I recognize
in some trawls it could be only one pound - in others
100 pounds for every pound of shrimp."

**This bycatch is not the only collateral damage**

associated with fishing. Many experts agreed that habitat
destruction that some fishing gears cause is even more
ecologically damaging than the harm caused by bycatch.]
http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/innews/destfish2003.htm

And veganism is certainly the best solution to reduce
the collateral deaths associated with the vast majority
of crops, because it's fed to livestock animals which

You're now trying to move the goalposts from your original

still die in crop production after veganism is implemented,
to a different type of rejection entirely; that the killing of
animals in agriculture isn't a moral dilemma.

There's nothing absurd about finding the collateral deaths in
agriculture morally wrong. If you don't find anything morally

&gt;Veganism specifically fails to address the problem of collateral deaths of
&gt;animals
">

I disagree. Veganism is the best solution to by-catch;

[About 2.3 billion pounds of sea life were discarded in
the U.S. in 2000 alone, and thousands of the ocean's
most charismatic species - including sea turtles, marine
mammals, sharks and seabirds - are killed each year
by fishing nets, lines and hooks. These deaths have
implications for both marine populations and marine
food webs.

"Considering the documented decline in global fisheries,
this kind of waste is unacceptable. But because this
travesty is unseen by most people, it continues," said
Dr. Crowder.

Experts agree that bottom trawls are one of the worst
offenders, entrapping

**vast numbers of non-targeted animals.**

"The first time I was on a trawler, I was appalled to see
that for every pound of shrimp caught there were 20
pounds of sharks, rays, crabs, and starfish killed. The
shrimpers called this bycatch 'trawl trash' - I call it
'biodiversity'," noted Elliott Norse of the Marine
Conservation Biology Institute. "Of course I recognize
in some trawls it could be only one pound - in others
100 pounds for every pound of shrimp."

**This bycatch is not the only collateral damage**

associated with fishing. Many experts agreed that habitat
destruction that some fishing gears cause is even more
ecologically damaging than the harm caused by bycatch.]
http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/innews/destfish2003.htm

And veganism is certainly the best solution to reduce
the collateral deaths associated with the vast majority
of crops, because it's fed to livestock animals which
vegans don't eat. Those two examples alone show that
veganism is a solution to the animal deaths associated
with man's diet, and I haven't even included the billions
of target animals and fish yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Alternatively, it may
&gt;&gt; be combined with the fallacy of misleading vividness, when

Surely it's classified as some form of bullshit, like most
"AR" fantasy. LOL. Do you know the one about the kid
who killed and ate his parents? He then bitched about
being an orphan. That's a Goo/Dutch fantasy they equate
to raising animals for food. Human child sex slavery is
another, and Dutch claims to have developed that
comparison from his own experience(s) with farm animals.
Maybe you can spot the idiocy in their "AR" drenched
fantasies, but then again maybe you can't...they can't...

Hey, maybe you can help them. We've been trying to
figure out which type wildlife we should put in place of
livestock and why, and so far about the best we have is
a short list from Coproph Boy (Dutch) which consists of:
mice, frogs and groundhogs. Unless it would be paved
or used for crops as I'm convinced it would, the land would
probably provide life for some types of animals. What type
animals do YOU want it to support INSTEAD OF livestock,
and why? If/when you can't answer the question, you
might finally consider that it would be just about as good
to provide the livestock with decent lives as it would to
instead provide life for wildlife that you don't care enough
about to even know what kind(s) you're trying to talk about.
Because so far it certainly appears that's the way it is in
some cases. Even if you do manage to explain a few wild
animals you'd want to promote life for, like mice, then we
(those of us who think it through) would also have to wonder
why it wouldn't be just as well to raise some other form of
livestock than your mice...it just keeps on and on... But
hate it though you do, it ALWAYS comes down to which
animals we're going to promote life for and which ones
we're not. That's just the way it is, so I'm still suprised that
even the honest "ARAs" can hate a fact so much, and
can not believe that true "AR" opponents hate it, since
there's no reason why any of us should.

&gt;&gt;&gt;This argument commits The Perfect Solution Fallacy by

&gt;&gt;&gt;abide by their stated moral requirement to not kill animals for
&gt;&gt;&gt;food by abstaining from meat doesn't meet that requirement,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and so their solution (veganism) should be rejected because
&gt;&gt;&gt;some part of the problem (CDs) would still exist after it was

&gt;&gt;Vegans claim that abstaining from meat means their diet does not
&gt;&gt;cause any animals to die. This justification is false.

&gt;     No doubt. They contribute to animal deaths with their diet,
&gt; use of roads and building, electricity, paper and wood, etc
&gt; like everyone else does. ALL they appear to avoid trying to
&gt; contribute to is life and death for livestock.

They are not doing a disservice to any animals by not
eating meat.  Your phony "consideration" of their lives

There is no moral good that results from the basic

way, "benefit" from coming into existence.  The benefit
is entirely a material one for the people who consume
the animals.

Guarantee:  you will puke out your "some do, some
don't" bullshit.  You are wrong.  NO animals "benefit"
from coming into existence.

The only consideration due the lives of livestock is
potentially negative:  one might, and "vegans" do,
conclude that their lives are too bad, even at their
best, to justify breeding them into existence, and so
one might choose not to consume products made from
domestic livestock (interestingly, I think one could
justify consuming products from opportunistically
obtained wild animals.)  But no one should conclude
that the lives of livestock animals are somehow "worth
it" to them; that is complete illogic and a transparent
rationalization of *your* interest, not theirs.

The method of husbandry determines
whether or not the life has positive or negative value to the animal.

That is a true fact that Copro got from somewhere else but does
not understand. How could he understand all of this, but still be
opposed to considering animals when we think about human
influence on animals? Answer: he could not. So since we KNOW
he is opposed to considering animals when considering human
influence on animals, we KNOW he either can't understand that
life can have positive value for animals, or is opposed to the fact
being taken into consideration because it works against what
he WANTS people to believe.

Yes, it is a perfect example of "apples and oranges."  A typical urban

in producing the boats, the fuel for them, the nets and other
equipment, the transportation to market, the displacement of animals in
creating highways, factories, supermarkets, and processing and storage
facilities, and so on.  Apples and oranges.  If you are talking about a
VSG gathered diet vs a diet including "fresh caught fish" caught
one-by-one by an individual and consumed on the spot, the VSG diet
wins again.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually,  it isn't.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It is not healthier than other diets, it is not more environmentally

&gt; You are probably right -- *very* impractical for most people,
&gt; though.

&gt; &gt;&gt;so it cannot be used to critique any specific diet in the real
&gt; &gt;&gt;world.  It can only be used as a goal, or theoretical concept, and
&gt; &gt;&gt;in that case, the vegan diet must be better for animals.

&gt; &gt; Not necessarily. Avoiding all animal products will certainly reduce
&gt; &gt; the impact of your diet compared with that of any remotely typical
&gt; &gt; Western omnivore. However it remains plausible that a diet based
&gt; &gt; around the lowest impact plant foods and supplements you can
&gt; &gt; obtain to provide adequate nutrition could be improved by replacing
&gt; &gt; some of these with meat from grass-fed and/or wild animals.

&gt; I'd agree if the meat were scavenged, as you said above. However,
&gt; on an animal rights basis, hunting or ranching animals for meat
&gt; would not be acceptable on ethical grounds.
">

It is understood that shooting hunting or ranching is not compatible
with the priniple of animal rights but what if the products of these
activities accrue fewer animal deaths per calorie of food than
the non-animal foods that represent the real-world alternative?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, as far as the concept of animal rights, or animal liberation,
&gt; &gt;&gt;is concerned, the vegan diet wins hands-down.  Even a diet of hunted
&gt; &gt;&gt;meat involves a violation of the rights of the hunted animal by
&gt; &gt;&gt;its death at human hands.

&gt; &gt; If predation is a violation of an animals rights then why shouldn't we
&gt; &gt; exterminate predator species?

&gt; There are several answers to this given by various writers on
&gt; animal rights.
">

What do you believe?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Regan, and those who accept his basic rights-based
&gt; concept, feel that because humans are the only moral agents we
&gt; know, only humans have an obligation to act ethically toward moral
&gt; patients, which include most animals above a certain degree of
&gt; self-awareness.
">

The only rational reason I can think of for declaring an action (in
this
case predation) unethical is the harm that it does. Now if you accept
that predation is unethical on that basis then it follows that more
predation means more harm and if we predate the foxes then we
decrease the total amount of predation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Francione takes a legal-style approach, which
&gt; is reasonable since he is a professor who teaches law.  He uses
&gt; the human example that we are obligated not to violate the rights
&gt; of others actively, but we are not legally obligated to aid other
&gt; humans, and the same applies to animals.
">

Fair enough but not being obligated to exterminate predators is
a long way from being ethically forbidden from doing so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What we are obligated to
&gt; do is not to treat animals as property or mere resources. Linzey,
&gt; like C.S. Lewis in an earlier generation, refers to predation as
&gt; &quot;the vampire's dilemma,&quot; regards it as a result of the Fall and
&gt; the corrupt state of Creation, and sees no end to it until the
&gt; Second Coming when all creation will be made new.  He says that
&gt; &quot;there is no pure land&quot; and we can only change our own behavior
&gt; toward animals.
">

With all due respect to Linzey this reads like a load of babble.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; We would be violating the rights of
&gt; &gt; these animals

&gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; but in doing so we would prevent the rights of many
&gt; &gt; more animals from being violated.

&gt; Not according to the rights-based theories, which hold that
&gt; only a moral agent can violate rights, and so that, while
&gt; prey animals would suffer death, their *rights* would not
&gt; be violated, because moral patients cannot hold rights against
&gt; other moral patients.
">

This is an example of what I like to term "arbitrary ethics" They
are self consistent and superficially reasonable but serve no
obvious practical purpose in terms of making the planet a better
place for those sentient creatures who inhabit it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most pro-animal-rights people simply note that obligate
&gt; carnivores *must* kill, and that when there is
&gt; real necessity, this cannot be a moral issue.

&gt; I think the most convincing position, for me, is that of
&gt; Sapontzis in his _Morals, Reason, and Animals_.  His
&gt; answer is somewhat like yours below.  He says that &quot;humans
&gt; are morally obligated to prevent predation whenever doing
&gt; so would not occasion as much or more suffering than it
&gt; would prevent.&quot;
">

That's more like it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  This seems very much in tune with a common
&gt; sense approach in the real world.  For example, humans are
&gt; obligated to prevent predation by their companion animals,
&gt; to defend animals over whom they have stewardship (animals
&gt; in zoos, domestic flocks and herds, and so on) from
&gt; predation by other animals, and so on.  However, exterminating
&gt; wild predators not only causes suffering to them,
">

Sterilization programmes or even humane culls could, in theory at
least be conducted with none or at least minimal suffering. Naturally
they would also prevent suffering to large numbers of future prey
animals.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but suffering
&gt; to their prey when the ecosystem in unbalanced, and there is
&gt; no practical way to make it work.  We've seen this many time
&gt; in the real world when predators have been removed from an
&gt; ecosystem.  However, because we *are* moral agents, and
&gt; because humans are not obligate carnivores, we cannot take
&gt; over the role of predators without violating the rights of
&gt; the prey animals.  Recent efforts to reintroduce top predators
&gt; to ecosystems where they have been eliminated, such as the
&gt; wolves in Yellowstone, seem to me to be the best solution.
">

Now we come to the crux of the matter. Although predation may
cause considerable distress to the victims and their companions
it is also an important means of maintaining a healthy balance
within an ecosystem. Thus although we violate the theoretical
rights of prey animals when we take on the role of predator, our
actions do not seem so inexcusable when we consider the
bigger picture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; My answer to this is that predators
&gt; &gt; have a useful role to play in the ecosystem, maintaining the balance
&gt; &gt; between vegan animals and their food supply but this then begs the
&gt; &gt; obvious question, why shouldn't man play the role of predator as
&gt; &gt; and when it is in the interests of a given ecosystem for him to do so?

&gt; I'd say that ecosystems have no interests -- an ecosystem is not
&gt; conscious.  Only individual conscious beings within an ecosystem
&gt; have interests _per se_.  However, preserving a healthy, balanced
&gt; ecosystem is usually the best way to foster the interests of the
&gt; conscious members of the ecosystem.
">

Although it isn't strictly accurate it makes sense to think of the
ecosystem as a single organism whose consciousness is
basically the total consciousness of the individuals within it.

That is not the foundation of the collateral deaths argument. The revelation
of Collateral Deaths intoduces the real possibility that rather than
*solving* this alleged "problem", abstaining unconditionally from animal
products may exacerbate it. Under those conditions, and they are many, it is
very reasonable to consume animal products, *even considering* your alleged
moral issue. So despite the obvious attraction of this animal product
"tee-totalling" to some people, it must be rejected as a universal solution
to this alleged problem. Then add to that the fact that we don't accept that
killing animals per se is a problem in the first place and you understand my

animals/environment?  Any?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As Derek has noted,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the ideal in either case is probably impossible in the real

&gt;&gt; There is no reason to talk in absolutes except to create false

&gt; Which was what I said below:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so it cannot be used to critique any specific diet in the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;concept, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in that case, the vegan diet must be better for animals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An equivalent diet of gathering need not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involve any intentional killing of rights-bearing animals at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we consider a diet involving farmed animals, the animals'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are violated both by the entire process of breeding and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;raising
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them, and the basic injustice of treating them as property,

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not comfortable with the idea of animals being reduced
&gt;&gt;&gt;to economic resources either.

&gt;&gt; We are all economic resources, we are all exploited in many
&gt;&gt; different ways.

&gt; But we are not all *reduced* to economic resources *only*.
&gt; That is
&gt; the injustice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is only by comparing vastly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;different examples (&quot;comparing apples and oranges&quot; ) that any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;diet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;including meat can be seen as less harmful on a utilitarian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;basis.

&gt;&gt; Same lie. A typical urban vegan diet can plausibly be improved
&gt;&gt; by replacing some of the high-impact plant-based foods with
&gt;&gt; fresh caught fish. This is not &quot;apples and oranges&quot;.

&gt; Yes, it is a perfect example of &quot;apples and oranges.&quot;

==========================
Again, no it is not.  Both are readily available items.

A typical urban

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; diet including factory-farmed meat and battery eggs would be
&gt; the
&gt; equivalent, not an urban vegan diet vs &quot;fresh caught fish&quot;.
">

===============================
No fool.  The types of meat represented by fish are easily
available to any urban clueless loon like you.

If you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; were talking about commercially-caught fish, you would have to
&gt; consider
&gt; the massive deaths involved in by-catch, the collateral deaths
&gt; involved
&gt; in producing the boats, the fuel for them, the nets and other
&gt; equipment, the transportation to market, the displacement of
&gt; animals in
&gt; creating highways, factories, supermarkets, and processing and
&gt; storage
&gt; facilities, and so on.  Apples and oranges.  If you are talking
&gt; about a VSG gathered diet vs a diet including &quot;fresh caught
&gt; fish&quot; caught
&gt; one-by-one by an individual and consumed on the spot, the VSG

&gt; wins again.

No, because you have now resorted to your fairy-tale diet again,
not one that is reasonable or readily available.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, that is true, for several reasons.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Current methods of crop production (probably; presumptively ) may
&gt; &gt;&gt; involve collateral deaths, but raising, transporting, and marketing
&gt; &gt;&gt; animals for food *certainly* do, and always will. The question of
&gt; &gt;&gt; which diet involves fewer cannot be answered on a black-and-white
&gt; &gt;&gt; basis, because each individual diet must be evaluated independently.

&gt; &gt; Absolutely!

&gt; Having said that, she will not entertain any comparison of diets wrt to
&gt; animal harm wherein the non-vegan diet wins, vegans won't do that, it goes
&gt; against their nature.

&gt; &gt;&gt; However, given the optimum example of each type, a vegan diet will
&gt; &gt;&gt; always involve fewer deaths than a diet including meat, given the
&gt; &gt;&gt; same parameters in each case.

&gt; See?

&gt; &gt;&gt;  An *ideal* vegan diet would indeed
&gt; &gt;&gt; involve no animal deaths at all, while even an *ideal* omnivore
&gt; &gt;&gt; diet would involve at least some animal deaths.

&gt; What about an very good non-vegan diet including a nominal amount of
&gt; free-range game or fish compared with a less-than-ideal vegan diet?

&gt; &gt; The ideal omnivore diet in this context would be a scavenger-gatherer
&gt; &gt; diet. There is no reason why this need cause any more deaths than
&gt; &gt; a pure gatherer diet.

&gt; There's no reason to believe that anyone with access to fresh or game cannot
&gt; cause as little or less harm than a person who consumes all commercially
&gt; obtained plant-based foods.

&gt; &gt;&gt; As Derek has noted,
&gt; &gt;&gt; the ideal in either case is probably impossible in the real world,

&gt; &gt; Impractical but not impossible.

&gt; There is no reason to talk in absolutes except to create false impressions.

&gt; &gt;&gt; so it cannot be used to critique any specific diet in the real
&gt; &gt;&gt; world.  It can only be used as a goal, or theoretical concept, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; in that case, the vegan diet must be better for animals.

&gt; &gt; Not necessarily. Avoiding all animal products will certainly reduce
&gt; &gt; the impact of your diet compared with that of any remotely typical
&gt; &gt; Western omnivore. However it remains plausible that a diet based
&gt; &gt; around the lowest impact plant foods and supplements you can
&gt; &gt; obtain to provide adequate nutrition could be improved by replacing
&gt; &gt; some of these with meat from grass-fed and/or wild animals.

&gt; That's the idea, except that I would not replace the lowest impact plant
&gt; foods if I wanted to reduce animal harm, I would focus on high-impact foods
&gt; like imported fruit, rice and grain products.
">

I see I have been misunderstood. If you wish to show that following the
LHP within the constraints of what you consider "practical" then it is
not enough to show that replacing imported fruit, rice and grain
products
with flesh from local grass-fed and/or wild animals will lead to
reduced
harm if they can instead be replaced by locally grown, organic,
minimally
packaged fruit, rice and grain products. You would need to show that
your omnivorous LHP diet compares favourably with a vegan LHP diet.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Secondly, as far as the concept of animal rights, or animal liberation,
&gt; &gt;&gt; is concerned, the vegan diet wins hands-down.  Even a diet of hunted
&gt; &gt;&gt; meat involves a violation of the rights of the hunted animal by
&gt; &gt;&gt; its death at human hands.

&gt; &gt; If predation is a violation of an animals rights then why shouldn't we
&gt; &gt; exterminate predator species? We would be violating the rights of
&gt; &gt; these animals but in doing so we would prevent the rights of many
&gt; &gt; more animals from being violated. My answer to this is that predators
&gt; &gt; have a useful role to play in the ecosystem, maintaining the balance
&gt; &gt; between vegan animals and their food supply but this then begs the
&gt; &gt; obvious question, why shouldn't man play the role of predator as
&gt; &gt; and when it is in the interests of a given ecosystem for him to do so?

&gt; This is another indicator of what I said previously about the absurdity of
&gt; extrapolating human moral ideals to animals.

&gt; &gt;&gt; An equivalent diet of gathering need not
&gt; &gt;&gt; involve any intentional killing of rights-bearing animals at all.
&gt; &gt;&gt; If we consider a diet involving farmed animals, the animals' rights

In a way this is true but we still treat each other as sentient beings
first and
economic resources second. Where animals are concerned it often
seems the other way round.

&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; again in the process of slaughtering them.  Collateral deaths in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the field, or in protection of food in storage, would involve, at the
&gt; &gt;&gt; most, the single injustice of lack of consideration of the animals'
&gt; &gt;&gt; rights in &quot;pest control.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Which is every bit an injustice as killing an animal for food. In fact
&gt; &gt; if we ate the victims of 'pest control' then we would need to grow
&gt; &gt; less food and hence cause fewer injustices.

&gt; Excellent point in theory, except that in reality they're usually poisoned.

Posioning is not the only method of pest control. It is usually the
most
economic but if we were prepared to eat pests then maybe that would
change. I must admit that for reasons I can't quite put my finger on
I find the idea of eating rats or mice quite repulsive. Pet food maybe?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Too bad birds and other scavengers don't know that.

&gt; &gt;&gt; There is absolutely no way a diet involving meat can be seen as more

&gt; &gt;&gt; applied to any individual example.

&gt; This is a lie.

I don't believe predation is *unethical* except when it is

I think you have to consider such questions as soon as you

It is not quite that easy.  There is the ethical issue if one
believes in animal rights, but there are also a variety of
practical issues involved in humans trying to artificially
reproduce a natural predator/prey system.  Most predation
by humans would be by sport or subsistence hunters, and they
( especially sport hunters )often do not remove the same animals
other animal predators would.  Culls by biologists might be
closer to natural predation, but would still be artificial and
couldn't include *all* the subtle factors involved in
animal/animal prey/predator interactions.  We don't -- possibly
can't -- understand the natural systems well enough to
reproduce them exactly, and that can have drastic results.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An equivalent diet of gathering need not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involve any intentional killing of rights-bearing animals at all.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we consider a diet involving farmed animals, the animals' rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are violated both by the entire process of breeding and raising
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them, and the basic injustice of treating them as property,
&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not comfortable with the idea of animals being reduced

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;again in the process of slaughtering them.  Collateral deaths in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights in &quot;pest control.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Which is every bit an injustice as killing an animal for food.
&gt;&gt;Yes, in and of itself.  However, the other additional injustices
&gt;&gt;involved in farming animals make it, as I see it, worse.
&gt; We can remove these injustices from the equation by considering

It is relevant, but it is indeed "apples and oranges," because
large-scale pest control only applies to large-scale farming
of vegetables.  The artificial quantity of food in a limited
area is what brings the "pest" animals in large numbers, so
in a sense, humans "farm" "pests" just as much as they farm
domestic animals.  The only really wild animals would be those
humans ran into in your scavenging/gathering or a hunting/gathering

Or fewer other animals.  Given a rigorous animal rights approach,
a human who ate his human victim would need less other food, and
so would cause fewer direct deaths of animals slaughtered for meat,

This isn't an exercise in high school logic, it's reality. Animals not only
exist in numbers many orders of magnitude greater than humans, animals are
frankly "worth-less" than humans. For the first part, *if* indeed through
some doomsday scenario humans were as numerous as the rest of the animal
kingdom, in such a world I figure that it probably *would* be quite all
right to kill them, in fact we would likely all have bountys on our heads
because the world could not support us all. And as for the second part, the
only sensible worldview is one of "rational speciesism", to pretend that
animals deserve the same consideration as humans is right daft. You people
who pretend to believe so need your heads examined.

"No, you don't get to make claims on behalf of all vegans.
That's your straw man again. Abstaining from meat is a
solution to avoid the killing of animals for food, and while
that solution still involves the killing of some animals in
crop production, it's a fallacy to reject that solution on
that basis."

As we can see, you removed everything after the "No,",
and that "No" pertained to your making claims on behalf
of all vegans, not to the comment;

"At the very least they claim that it is "the best" solution"

as you're now insisting it does. You just can't help yourself,

You just HAD to snip away the evidence of YOUR collateral
deaths, didn't you? And why would that be, I wonder. Pah!

&lt;restored evidence of the meat eater's collateral deaths&gt;

[About 2.3 billion pounds of sea life were discarded in
the U.S. in 2000 alone, and thousands of the ocean's
most charismatic species - including sea turtles, marine
mammals, sharks and seabirds - are killed each year
by fishing nets, lines and hooks. These deaths have
implications for both marine populations and marine
food webs.

"Considering the documented decline in global fisheries,
this kind of waste is unacceptable. But because this
travesty is unseen by most people, it continues," said
Dr. Crowder.

Experts agree that bottom trawls are one of the worst
offenders, entrapping

**vast numbers of non-targeted animals.**

"The first time I was on a trawler, I was appalled to see
that for every pound of shrimp caught there were 20
pounds of sharks, rays, crabs, and starfish killed. The
shrimpers called this bycatch 'trawl trash' - I call it
'biodiversity'," noted Elliott Norse of the Marine
Conservation Biology Institute. "Of course I recognize
in some trawls it could be only one pound - in others
100 pounds for every pound of shrimp."

**This bycatch is not the only collateral damage**

associated with fishing. Many experts agreed that habitat
destruction that some fishing gears cause is even more
ecologically damaging than the harm caused by bycatch.]
http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/innews/destfish2003.htm

And veganism is certainly the best solution to reduce
the collateral deaths associated with the vast majority
of crops, because it's fed to livestock animals which
vegans don't eat. Those two examples alone show that
veganism is a solution to the animal deaths associated
with man's diet, and I haven't even included the billions
of target animals and fish yet.
&lt;end restore&gt;

Pathetic dodge, but not unexpected.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;death-free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lifestyle&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vegans don't claim that their lifestyle is the perfect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the killing of animals in food production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, for the most part that is exactly what they believe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;At the very least they claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What *do* they think is the best solution?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll leave you to ask them that;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Aren't you one?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I am.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or at least I thought you were representing their position

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I let them represent their own position.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;YOU answer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Veganism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That would tend to prove my point now wouldn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now that you've switched from 'the perfect solution' to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'the best solution', yes, if indeed that was the point you
&gt;&gt;&gt; were trying to make.

&gt;&gt;That WAS the question I asked, &quot;At the very least they claim that it is
&gt;&gt;&quot;the
&gt;&gt;best&quot; solution&quot;

&gt;&gt;you answered &quot;No&quot;.

&gt; That's a lie, as I'll show. Go back up this thread and see
&gt; where I answered, and you will see that in response to
&gt; your comment;

&gt;  &quot;At the very least they claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution&quot;

&gt; I wrote;

&gt; &quot;No, you don't get to make claims on behalf of all vegans.
&gt;  That's your straw man again. Abstaining from meat is a
&gt;  solution to avoid the killing of animals for food, and while
&gt;  that solution still involves the killing of some animals in
&gt;  crop production, it's a fallacy to reject that solution on
&gt;  that basis.&quot;

&gt; As we can see, you removed everything after the &quot;No,&quot;,
&gt; and that &quot;No&quot; pertained to your making claims on behalf
&gt; of all vegans, not to the comment;

&gt;    &quot;At the very least they claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution&quot;

&gt; as you're now insisting it does. You just can't help yourself,
&gt; can you? You lie and twist, thrash straw men, and cut your
&gt; opponent's sentences down to misrepresent their answers,
&gt; and just about anything you can think of instead of making
&gt; an effort to deal with the real thing. You're a joke.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Taking animals as a group, the scale of killing of animals vs humans

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then, taking Germany's victims of ethnic cleansing as a group, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; scale of killing them vs non-victims during that time when they

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Veganism from a categorical standpoint does not even necessarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reduce the number of animal deaths.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, even if your ipse dixit were true, you cannot

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still occur after its implementation. Doing so invokes the perfect

&gt;&gt;&gt;That is not the foundation of the collateral deaths argument.

&gt;&gt; It certainly is. As with the &quot;terrorism safety net&quot;, you think

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; animals still die for their food during crop production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This argument commits The Perfect Solution Fallacy

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Fallacy is that veganism is a Perfect Solution, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;death-free lifestyle&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vegans don't claim that their lifestyle is the perfect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution to the killing of animals in food production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, for the most part that is exactly what they believe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;At the very least they claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What *do* they think is the best solution?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll leave you to ask them that;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Aren't you one?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I am.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or at least I thought you were representing their position

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I let them represent their own position.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;YOU answer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Veganism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That would tend to prove my point now wouldn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now that you've switched from 'the perfect solution' to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'the best solution', yes, if indeed that was the point you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were trying to make.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That WAS the question I asked, &quot;At the very least they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you answered &quot;No&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a lie, as I'll show. Go back up this thread and see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where I answered, and you will see that in response to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your comment;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &quot;At the very least they claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wrote;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;No, you don't get to make claims on behalf of all vegans.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  That's your straw man again. Abstaining from meat is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  solution to avoid the killing of animals for food, and while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  that solution still involves the killing of some animals in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  crop production, it's a fallacy to reject that solution on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  that basis.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As we can see, you removed everything after the &quot;No,&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and that &quot;No&quot; pertained to your making claims on behalf
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of all vegans, not to the comment;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    &quot;At the very least they claim that it is &quot;the best&quot; solution&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as you're now insisting it does. You just can't help yourself,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can you? You lie and twist, thrash straw men, and cut your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opponent's sentences down to misrepresent their answers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and just about anything you can think of instead of making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an effort to deal with the real thing. You're a joke.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Recovered from the sewage below..

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Nonsense; abstaining from fish is always the BEST solution...&quot;

&gt;&gt; And it is, so why did you try to claim I wrote otherwise by

&gt;&gt; that way, liar Ditch?

&gt;The rest of that paragraph is consistent with your &quot;No&quot;.

The rest of my sentence after "No," pertained to your making
claims on behalf of all vegans;

"No, you don't get to make claims on behalf of all vegans."

It had nothing to do with your comment;

"At the very least they claim that it is "the best" solution"

You lied, Ditch, but I'm not surprised in the least.

Here's a thought; look at those two statements from this thread, Jon.
After a while it dawned on me that yes, in this particular instance,
rejecting veganism on the basis that it doesn't fully solve the problem
of animal deaths found in agriculture is denying the antecedent.

1) If veganism fully solves the problem of animal deaths found in agriculture, then veganism should be implemented.
2) Veganism doesn't fully solve the problem of animal deaths found in agriculture (not a)
therefore
3) Veganism should not be implemented.

The collateral deaths argument is specious in more ways than
one; it denies the antecedent and poses a false dilemma at
the same time.

No, that's not at all what Occam's razor is about.  Occam

medieval philosopher (c 1285 - 1349)involved in the
argument against the reality of Platonic Universals, the
philosophical position known as Nominalism.  His position
was that only individual entities exist, and that abstract
categories (such as "Man" or "Tree" ) exist only as
intellectual concepts, not as realities in themselves.
When he said that entities should not be multiplied without
necessity, that was what he was talking about.  His "razor"
had nothing to do with claiming the "most *obvious* answer
is usually correct.  The most obvious answer is
frequently wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That is completely true.  I can see no ethical problem with a

&gt; Yes, true.  I am more concerned with the spirit than the letter

&gt; no ethical issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;on an animal rights basis, hunting or ranching animals for
&gt;&gt;&gt;meat
&gt;&gt;&gt;would not be acceptable on ethical grounds.

&gt;&gt; It is understood that shooting hunting or ranching is not

&gt;&gt; then it follows that more

&gt;&gt; decrease the total amount of predation.

&gt; But not necessarily the total amount of harm, especially if
&gt; the prey population then increases to levels the ecosystem
&gt; cannot support well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Francione takes a legal-style approach, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;is reasonable since he is a professor who teaches law.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;uses
&gt;&gt;&gt;the human example that we are obligated not to violate the
&gt;&gt;&gt;rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;of others actively, but we are not legally obligated to aid
&gt;&gt;&gt;other
&gt;&gt;&gt;humans, and the same applies to animals.

&gt;&gt; Fair enough but not being obligated to exterminate predators
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; a long way from being ethically forbidden from doing so.

&gt; Agreed.  I don't find Francione convincing here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What we are obligated to
&gt;&gt;&gt;do is not to treat animals as property or mere resources.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Linzey,
&gt;&gt;&gt;like C.S. Lewis in an earlier generation, refers to predation
&gt;&gt;&gt;as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;the vampire's dilemma,&quot; regards it as a result of the Fall
&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;the corrupt state of Creation, and sees no end to it until the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Second Coming when all creation will be made new.  He says
&gt;&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;there is no pure land&quot; and we can only change our own
&gt;&gt;&gt;behavior
&gt;&gt;&gt;toward animals.

&gt;&gt; With all due respect to Linzey this reads like a load of
&gt;&gt; babble.

&gt; I think it does make sense, but only in a specifically
&gt; theological
&gt; context.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We would be violating the rights of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;these animals

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but in doing so we would prevent the rights of many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more animals from being violated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not according to the rights-based theories, which hold that
&gt;&gt;&gt;only a moral agent can violate rights, and so that, while
&gt;&gt;&gt;prey animals would suffer death, their *rights* would not
&gt;&gt;&gt;be violated, because moral patients cannot hold rights against
&gt;&gt;&gt;other moral patients.

&gt;&gt; This is an example of what I like to term &quot;arbitrary ethics&quot;
&gt;&gt; They
&gt;&gt; are self consistent and superficially reasonable but serve no
&gt;&gt; obvious practical purpose in terms of making the planet a
&gt;&gt; better
&gt;&gt; place for those sentient creatures who inhabit it.

&gt; I think you have to consider such questions as soon as you
&gt; introduce the concept of rights at all.  You don't *need*
&gt; to involve a concept of rights.  You can go with a purely
&gt; utilitarian ethic.  That can present problems of its own,
&gt; however.  Singer's support for infanticide has been
&gt; criticized on that basis.

&gt;&gt; Now we come to the crux of the matter. Although predation may
&gt;&gt; cause considerable distress to the victims and their
&gt;&gt; companions
&gt;&gt; it is also an important means of maintaining a healthy balance
&gt;&gt; within an ecosystem. Thus although we violate the theoretical
&gt;&gt; rights of prey animals when we take on the role of predator,
&gt;&gt; our
&gt;&gt; actions do not seem so inexcusable when we consider the
&gt;&gt; bigger picture.

&gt; It is not quite that easy.  There is the ethical issue if one
&gt; believes in animal rights, but there are also a variety of
&gt; practical issues involved in humans trying to artificially
&gt; reproduce a natural predator/prey system.  Most predation
&gt; by humans would be by sport or subsistence hunters, and they
&gt; ( especially sport hunters )often do not remove the same
&gt; animals
&gt; other animal predators would.  Culls by biologists might be
&gt; closer to natural predation, but would still be artificial and
&gt; couldn't include *all* the subtle factors involved in
&gt; animal/animal prey/predator interactions.  We don't -- possibly
&gt; can't -- understand the natural systems well enough to
&gt; reproduce them exactly, and that can have drastic results.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An equivalent diet of gathering need not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involve any intentional killing of rights-bearing animals at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we consider a diet involving farmed animals, the animals'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are violated both by the entire process of breeding and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;raising
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them, and the basic injustice of treating them as property,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not comfortable with the idea of animals being reduced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to economic resources either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;again in the process of slaughtering them.  Collateral
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deaths in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the field, or in protection of food in storage, would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involve, at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;most, the single injustice of lack of consideration of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;animals'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights in &quot;pest control.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Which is every bit an injustice as killing an animal for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;food.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, in and of itself.  However, the other additional
&gt;&gt;&gt;injustices
&gt;&gt;&gt;involved in farming animals make it, as I see it, worse.

&gt;&gt; We can remove these injustices from the equation by
&gt;&gt; considering
&gt;&gt; only wild animals. I realise this leads to an apples and
&gt;&gt; oranges
&gt;&gt; type of equation but unless you are able to eat &quot;justly&quot; in
&gt;&gt; the real
&gt;&gt; world then the comparison is still highly relevant.

&gt; It is relevant, but it is indeed &quot;apples and oranges,&quot; because
&gt; large-scale pest control only applies to large-scale farming

very brutal, inhumane deaths of animals that YOU claim have

to the worldwide population of some rodents. This is now Science Fiction
Horror, we have a human race SO numerous that there is no food left at all

&gt; &gt;&gt;Francione takes a legal-style approach, which
&gt; &gt;&gt;is reasonable since he is a professor who teaches law.  He uses
&gt; &gt;&gt;the human example that we are obligated not to violate the rights
&gt; &gt;&gt;of others actively, but we are not legally obligated to aid other
&gt; &gt;&gt;humans, and the same applies to animals.

&gt; &gt; Fair enough but not being obligated to exterminate predators is
&gt; &gt; a long way from being ethically forbidden from doing so.

&gt; Agreed.  I don't find Francione convincing here.

&gt; &gt;&gt;What we are obligated to
&gt; &gt;&gt;do is not to treat animals as property or mere resources. Linzey,
&gt; &gt;&gt;like C.S. Lewis in an earlier generation, refers to predation as
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;the vampire's dilemma,&quot; regards it as a result of the Fall and
&gt; &gt;&gt;the corrupt state of Creation, and sees no end to it until the
&gt; &gt;&gt;Second Coming when all creation will be made new.  He says that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;there is no pure land&quot; and we can only change our own behavior
&gt; &gt;&gt;toward animals.

&gt; &gt; With all due respect to Linzey this reads like a load of babble.

&gt; I think it does make sense, but only in a specifically theological
&gt; context.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;We would be violating the rights of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;these animals

&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;but in doing so we would prevent the rights of many
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;more animals from being violated.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Not according to the rights-based theories, which hold that
&gt; &gt;&gt;only a moral agent can violate rights, and so that, while
&gt; &gt;&gt;prey animals would suffer death, their *rights* would not
&gt; &gt;&gt;be violated, because moral patients cannot hold rights against
&gt; &gt;&gt;other moral patients.

&gt; &gt; This is an example of what I like to term &quot;arbitrary ethics&quot; They
&gt; &gt; are self consistent and superficially reasonable but serve no
&gt; &gt; obvious practical purpose in terms of making the planet a better
&gt; &gt; place for those sentient creatures who inhabit it.

&gt; I think you have to consider such questions as soon as you
&gt; introduce the concept of rights at all.  You don't *need*
&gt; to involve a concept of rights.

Perhaps not although it is possible to frame plausible utilitarian
arguments to justify the concept of rights.

To me it is not good enough to say Singer supports infanticide
therefore there must be something wrong with his
utilitarian ethic. A better approach would be to consider his

&gt; &gt; Now we come to the crux of the matter. Although predation may
&gt; &gt; cause considerable distress to the victims and their companions
&gt; &gt; it is also an important means of maintaining a healthy balance
&gt; &gt; within an ecosystem. Thus although we violate the theoretical
&gt; &gt; rights of prey animals when we take on the role of predator, our
&gt; &gt; actions do not seem so inexcusable when we consider the
&gt; &gt; bigger picture.

&gt; It is not quite that easy.  There is the ethical issue if one
&gt; believes in animal rights, but there are also a variety of
&gt; practical issues involved in humans trying to artificially
&gt; reproduce a natural predator/prey system.  Most predation
&gt; by humans would be by sport or subsistence hunters, and they
&gt; ( especially sport hunters )often do not remove the same animals
&gt; other animal predators would.  Culls by biologists might be
&gt; closer to natural predation, but would still be artificial and
&gt; couldn't include *all* the subtle factors involved in
&gt; animal/animal prey/predator interactions.  We don't -- possibly
&gt; can't -- understand the natural systems well enough to
&gt; reproduce them exactly, and that can have drastic results.

These are all good points but it must also be noted that natural
predators don't bother to analyse the effects of their predation
on their ecosystems.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An equivalent diet of gathering need not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involve any intentional killing of rights-bearing animals at all.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we consider a diet involving farmed animals, the animals' rights
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are violated both by the entire process of breeding and raising
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them, and the basic injustice of treating them as property,

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I am not comfortable with the idea of animals being reduced
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;to economic resources either.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;again in the process of slaughtering them.  Collateral deaths in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the field, or in protection of food in storage, would involve, at the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;most, the single injustice of lack of consideration of the animals'
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights in &quot;pest control.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Which is every bit an injustice as killing an animal for food.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, in and of itself.  However, the other additional injustices
&gt; &gt;&gt;involved in farming animals make it, as I see it, worse.

&gt; &gt; We can remove these injustices from the equation by considering
&gt; &gt; only wild animals. I realise this leads to an apples and oranges
&gt; &gt; type of equation but unless you are able to eat &quot;justly&quot; in the real
&gt; &gt; world then the comparison is still highly relevant.

&gt; It is relevant, but it is indeed &quot;apples and oranges,&quot; because
&gt; large-scale pest control only applies to large-scale farming
&gt; of vegetables.  The artificial quantity of food in a limited
&gt; area is what brings the &quot;pest&quot; animals in large numbers, so
&gt; in a sense, humans &quot;farm&quot; &quot;pests&quot; just as much as they farm
&gt; domestic animals.  The only really wild animals would be those
&gt; humans ran into in your scavenging/gathering or a hunting/gathering
&gt; lifestyle.
">

Then the LHP indicates scavenged/gathered products as the first
preference. If it is not practical to meet your nutritional needs that
way
then the next best thing would be local organic plant foods harvested,
packaged processed and stored in an animal friendly manner.
If it is still not practical to meet your nutritional needs then it is
at least plausible that eating the flesh of hunted wild animals or
handlined fish is in accordance with the LHP or the
least violations of animal rights principle.

With domestic fowl, you would know if there was a male in with

Within a few days, the developing embryo shows up as a network

I don't think an early-development embryo is sentient or has
rights or welfare on its own.  What bothers me about gathering
eggs is the effect on the parents.  If all the eggs are removed,
the parents often produce another clutch, which can be hard on
the female.  Also, if the species is under stress, removing too
many eggs can threaten the species's survival. So I would
suggest leaving at least a few eggs in a nest if you gather
some.

Then we have to find other real world alternatives.

This is a hard ethical limit for me.  I don't see how we can consider
animal *rights* _per se_ without applying the same basic criterion
we apply to human rights: a genuine right cannot justly be violated
no matter what benefit results for others on a utilitarian basis. To
do that is to deny the concept of rights.  This isn't an issue for
a pure utilitarian calculation.  Also, in the real world we often end
up with a very unclear balancing act where neither act can be seen as
just on the basis of rights and we are forced to choose a lesser evil.
The bombing of Hiroshima is an example.  There is no question that by
traditional laws of war, mass killing of civilian noncombatants was
unethical.  It was justified (and still is) by claiming many Allied
lives were saved by avoiding an invasion of the Home Islands.  You
can apply the same logic to hunting and ranching animals.  But it is
always hypothetical.  You can never *know* for sure how many lives
were saved, while the concrete act is a certain violation of a right.
Also,if we routinely violate rights on utilitarian calculation, the
very idea of rights eventually becomes moot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now if you accept

&gt;&gt;I don't believe predation is *unethical* except when it is

&gt;&gt;an act which is harmful and an act which is unethical. Most
&gt;&gt;unethical acts will cause harm of some kind, but the reverse
&gt;&gt;is not necessarily true.
&gt; To my way of thinking the idea that other humans or companion
&gt; animals should be prevented or discouraged from prevention
&gt; does not sit easily side by side with the idea that preventing wild

I understand your point.

Yes, I agree, in terms of the system as a whole.  Unless
we can control fertility of wild animals, it is
necessary.  But, as above, I believe it is *unethical*
when carried out by moral agents (human).

That's where the theological argument comes in.  I agree
with C.S. Lewis and Linzey that a creation where death
and predation are necessary for the system to function
properly is a basically flawed (evil/sinful/imperfect)
system, and so it could not be the Creation as God intended
or intends it.  It must be the result of the corruption
inherent in the whole of Creation as it now exists.
This is only an important consideration for Christian
or other religious people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt; Linzey,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like C.S. Lewis in an earlier generation, refers to predation as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;the vampire's dilemma,&quot; regards it as a result of the Fall and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the corrupt state of Creation, and sees no end to it until the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Second Coming when all creation will be made new.  He says that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;there is no pure land&quot; and we can only change our own behavior
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;toward animals.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We would be violating the rights of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;these animals
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but in doing so we would prevent the rights of many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more animals from being violated.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not according to the rights-based theories, which hold that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only a moral agent can violate rights, and so that, while
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;prey animals would suffer death, their *rights* would not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be violated, because moral patients cannot hold rights against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other moral patients.
&gt;&gt;&gt;This is an example of what I like to term &quot;arbitrary ethics&quot; They
&gt;&gt;&gt;are self consistent and superficially reasonable but serve no
&gt;&gt;&gt;obvious practical purpose in terms of making the planet a better
&gt;&gt;&gt;place for those sentient creatures who inhabit it.
&gt;&gt;I think you have to consider such questions as soon as you
&gt;&gt;introduce the concept of rights at all.  You don't *need*
&gt;&gt;to involve a concept of rights.
&gt; Perhaps not although it is possible to frame plausible utilitarian
&gt; arguments to justify the concept of rights.
&gt;&gt; You can go with a purely
&gt;&gt;utilitarian ethic.  That can present problems of its own,
&gt;&gt;however.  Singer's support for infanticide has been
&gt;&gt;criticized on that basis.
&gt; To me it is not good enough to say Singer supports infanticide
&gt; therefore there must be something wrong with his
&gt; utilitarian ethic.
">

I agree. Given his premises, his conclusion is quite reasonable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A better approach would be to consider his
&gt; reasoning and either come up with a counter argument or
&gt; revise your assumption that infanticide is never justified.

I could see situations in which infanticide ( or euthanasia )
of severely damaged new-borns might be justified on both a
utilitarian and a rights basis, using the same argument Regan
uses in _The Case For Animal Rights_ to apply to euthanasia
of non-humans on a rights basis.

I am in favor of the option of assisted suicide for those who
want it also.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now we come to the crux of the matter. Although predation may
&gt;&gt;&gt;cause considerable distress to the victims and their companions
&gt;&gt;&gt;it is also an important means of maintaining a healthy balance
&gt;&gt;&gt;within an ecosystem. Thus although we violate the theoretical
&gt;&gt;&gt;rights of prey animals when we take on the role of predator, our
&gt;&gt;&gt;actions do not seem so inexcusable when we consider the
&gt;&gt;&gt;bigger picture.
&gt;&gt;It is not quite that easy.  There is the ethical issue if one
&gt;&gt;believes in animal rights, but there are also a variety of
&gt;&gt;practical issues involved in humans trying to artificially
&gt;&gt;reproduce a natural predator/prey system.  Most predation
&gt;&gt;by humans would be by sport or subsistence hunters, and they
&gt;&gt;( especially sport hunters )often do not remove the same animals
&gt;&gt;other animal predators would.  Culls by biologists might be
&gt;&gt;closer to natural predation, but would still be artificial and
&gt;&gt;couldn't include *all* the subtle factors involved in
&gt;&gt;animal/animal prey/predator interactions.  We don't -- possibly
&gt;&gt;can't -- understand the natural systems well enough to
&gt;&gt;reproduce them exactly, and that can have drastic results.
&gt; These are all good points but it must also be noted that natural
&gt; predators don't bother to analyse the effects of their predation
&gt; on their ecosystems.
">

Could we see it as an "Invisible Hand" at work. :)  No, it doesn't
always work out in real life.  I'd rather trust to it in most
cases, because the natural predators and prey have evolved together
and adjusted to each other more exactly than humans have.  There
seems to be considerable evidence that early humans were responsible
for the extinction of several species of megafauna even before
civilization developed.  We're just clumsy that way, and I don't
trust us to do a really good job of fine-tuning the ecosystem.

I guess one major purpose would be to defend and define rights
and assure they are not violated for purely utilitarian considerations.
The interests of the weaker can only be given consideration by
appealing to ethics, I think.  Probably this is why Dutch refuses
to see killing of animals in food production as a moral issue at
all.  It's a lot easier to dismiss the question entirely than to
try to grapple with the complexities of ethical trade-offs in the
real world.

I would never bother to expend the effort again to attempt a detailed
explanation for you because you are insincere and hostile. The explanations
I have already given in the past are more than adequate for anyone to
understand my position clearly *if they wanted to*.

Here, read this, it explains rights in great detail;

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/

"Within the will theory it is impossible for "incompetents" like infants,
animals, and comatose adults to have rights. Yet we ordinarily would not
doubt that these incompetents can have rights, for example the right not to
be tortured (MacCormick 1982, 154-66)."

The first sentence there reveals the theoretical basis of Jonathan and
other's position that animals cannot hold rights. In "theory" that's true.
Yet the second sentence reveals what I have been saying, they undoubtedly do
anyway.

If there is an opening to misconstrue and misintepret you will find it, no
matter how silly. Of course we can make up rules to compare foods, if we
hate yellow vegetables then when choosing vegetables we would eliminate yams
on the basis of colour. If one hates meat, then one would impose a rule
eliminating meat.

In the current discussion however we are supposed to using the criterion of
"probable degree of impact on animals", therefore no rule based on "fairness
to vegans" or "fairness to meat eaters" makes any sense at all. I am
complaining about the vegan's absurd refusal to simply compare all foods
objectively without imposing artificial "rules" prohibiting certain specific
comparisons. "We can't compare Organic/Free Range meat with factory farmed
rice or imported bananas because it's "not fair". When you go into a market
do you ever see signs saying, "When making your food choices please refrain
from comparing aisle 6 with aisle 12, it's unfair to aisle 6"? Of course the
reason for this absurd position is obvious, it would force the vegan to
either admit that some meats might have a lesser impact than some plant
foods, or to mount another obfuscation, which is what I expect you will now
do.

This line of argument is clear evidence of the 'Perfect Solution Fallacy"
that vegans promote, why else would you be engaging in such sophistry?

We've all agreed to this already, several steps back in the discussion.

What I'm saying is that you have to consider similar foods within the
same kind of category to get a real, meaningful comparison.  If you

plants come out better; if you consider hand-gathered wild plants vs

There is every reason to do it, if one is dealing with people in the
real world.  People don't all have access to all kinds of foods.
They have to choose from what they can find and afford, so you have to
compare within categories they can use.

If one is a poor person in the inner city with no car, one's only
*practical* source of food is going to be corner mom-and-pop convenience
stories, cheap fast-food restaurants, and big chain mega-supermarkets
(and perhaps small ethnic stores in some cities).  So we compare
factory-farmed animal foods vs agribusiness plant foods.  Even if
grass-fed niche-market meat is available, poor city people aren't going
to be able to afford it.  They're going to have to choose peanut butter
vs factory-farmed eggs, or chicken, or canned/frozen commercial products.

If one lives in the country, or can visit wilderness areas, one will
have access to hunted meat and gathered plants, so we can compare
the harm involved in those foods.  These are either rich sport hunters
and gourmet gatherers, or poor but rural subsistence hunter/gatherers.

If one is relatively wealthy in the city or suburbs, one can choose
niche-market meats, like "free-range" chicken or imported grass-fed
beef, or small-scale organic vegetables from local farmers' markets
or hothouses.

It may work to try to convince one of the people in the last two
categories to buy or hunt less-harmful meats, but they can *also*
buy or gather less-harmful plants, and if they are looking for
the *lowest*-impact foods, the plants are the way they will go.
It's a matter of education and putting out the information on the
sources of agribusiness veggies and factory-farmed animal products.

It's useless to tell a poor inner-city person to buy local grass-fed
beef instead of peanut butter.  They simply can't do it.

carry free-range, grass-fed, hormone-free meats.  Instead of

vegans, to purchase your imported fruits and veggies without

have your simple rule for your simple mind, eh hypocrite?  Never

least/most amount of death and suffering to animals, and make
your choices accordingly.  Instaed, like I said, you follow only

&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, true.  I am more concerned with the spirit than the letter
&gt; &gt;&gt;here.  Scavenging meat, gathering unfertilized eggs,

&gt; &gt; Aside: Is it possible to determine whether eggs are fertilized
&gt; &gt; or not as you gather them?

&gt; With domestic fowl, you would know if there was a male in with
&gt; the females, and with both domestic and wild eggs, you could
&gt; candle the eggs -- with a bright flashlight in the wild.
&gt; Within a few days, the developing embryo shows up as a network
&gt; of blood lines.

&gt; I don't think an early-development embryo is sentient or has
&gt; rights or welfare on its own.  What bothers me about gathering
&gt; eggs is the effect on the parents.  If all the eggs are removed,
&gt; the parents often produce another clutch, which can be hard on
&gt; the female.  Also, if the species is under stress, removing too
&gt; many eggs can threaten the species's survival. So I would
&gt; suggest leaving at least a few eggs in a nest if you gather
&gt; some.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Because I do accept the idea of animal rights, I would not
&gt; &gt;&gt;generally agree that the rights of individual animals can be
&gt; &gt;&gt;sacrificed in a purely utilitarian calculation.

&gt; &gt; Fair enough. Allow me to rephrase my question:
&gt; &gt; What if hunting and ranching involved fewer violations of animal
&gt; &gt; rights than the non-animal foods that represent the real world
&gt; &gt; alternative?

&gt; Then we have to find other real world alternatives.

Ok. How does an ordinary Joe with no direct control over his

animal rights violations?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't see how we can consider
&gt; animal *rights* _per se_ without applying the same basic criterion
&gt; we apply to human rights: a genuine right cannot justly be violated
&gt; no matter what benefit results for others on a utilitarian basis. To
&gt; do that is to deny the concept of rights.  This isn't an issue for
&gt; a pure utilitarian calculation.  Also, in the real world we often end
&gt; up with a very unclear balancing act where neither act can be seen as
&gt; just on the basis of rights and we are forced to choose a lesser evil.
&gt; The bombing of Hiroshima is an example.  There is no question that by
&gt; traditional laws of war, mass killing of civilian noncombatants was
&gt; unethical.  It was justified (and still is) by claiming many Allied
&gt; lives were saved by avoiding an invasion of the Home Islands.  You
&gt; can apply the same logic to hunting and ranching animals.  But it is
&gt; always hypothetical.  You can never *know* for sure how many lives
&gt; were saved, while the concrete act is a certain violation of a right.
&gt; Also,if we routinely violate rights on utilitarian calculation, the
&gt; very idea of rights eventually becomes moot.
">

Actually I am open to the concept of rights but only if
they serve utilitarian purposes. The torturing of terrorist
suspects might serve as an example here. If a terrorist
attack can be prevented by extracting information by
torture than the torture can clearly be justified on utilitarian
grounds. The problem is that once torture is sanctioned
it is liable to gradually become more and more routine.
The argument that a society with some moral boundaries
or "rights" would be a better society in which to live than
a society that used utilitarian judgements on a case by
case basis is plausible. I'm not sure it is correct but it is
certainly plausible. This line of reasoning is also relevant
to the issue of animal experiments among other things.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Now if you accept
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that predation is unethical on that basis

&gt; &gt;&gt;I don't believe predation is *unethical* except when it is
&gt; &gt;&gt;carried out by moral agents.  There is a difference between
&gt; &gt;&gt;an act which is harmful and an act which is unethical. Most
&gt; &gt;&gt;unethical acts will cause harm of some kind, but the reverse
&gt; &gt;&gt;is not necessarily true.

&gt; &gt; To my way of thinking the idea that other humans or companion
&gt; &gt; animals should be prevented or discouraged from prevention
&gt; &gt; does not sit easily side by side with the idea that preventing wild
&gt; &gt; predators from doing the same is actively wrong.

&gt; I understand your point.

&gt; &gt; Then we're back to predation is not necessarily harmful
&gt; &gt; within the context of the bigger picture.

&gt; Yes, I agree, in terms of the system as a whole.  Unless
&gt; we can control fertility of wild animals, it is
&gt; necessary.  But, as above, I believe it is *unethical*
&gt; when carried out by moral agents (human).

&gt; That's where the theological argument comes in.  I agree
&gt; with C.S. Lewis and Linzey that a creation where death
&gt; and predation are necessary for the system to function
&gt; properly is a basically flawed (evil/sinful/imperfect)
&gt; system, and so it could not be the Creation as God intended
&gt; or intends it.  It must be the result of the corruption
&gt; inherent in the whole of Creation as it now exists.
&gt; This is only an important consideration for Christian
&gt; or other religious people.

I probably shouldn't get involved in theological debates
because I am grossly ignorant of the subject but is it
not a basic tenet of Christian Theology that God is
all powerful? By definition an all powerful God can not
make a mistake and the nature of Creation MUST be
exactly as God intended.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the corrupt state of Creation, and sees no end to it until the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Second Coming when all creation will be made new.  He says that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;there is no pure land&quot; and we can only change our own behavior
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;toward animals.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We would be violating the rights of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;these animals

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but in doing so we would prevent the rights of many
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more animals from being violated.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not according to the rights-based theories, which hold that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only a moral agent can violate rights, and so that, while
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;prey animals would suffer death, their *rights* would not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be violated, because moral patients cannot hold rights against
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other moral patients.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;This is an example of what I like to term &quot;arbitrary ethics&quot; They
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;are self consistent and superficially reasonable but serve no
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;obvious practical purpose in terms of making the planet a better
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;place for those sentient creatures who inhabit it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I think you have to consider such questions as soon as you
&gt; &gt;&gt;introduce the concept of rights at all.  You don't *need*
&gt; &gt;&gt;to involve a concept of rights.

&gt; &gt; Perhaps not although it is possible to frame plausible utilitarian
&gt; &gt; arguments to justify the concept of rights.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You can go with a purely
&gt; &gt;&gt;utilitarian ethic.  That can present problems of its own,
&gt; &gt;&gt;however.  Singer's support for infanticide has been

&gt; &gt; To me it is not good enough to say Singer supports infanticide
&gt; &gt; therefore there must be something wrong with his

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Now we come to the crux of the matter. Although predation may
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;cause considerable distress to the victims and their companions
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it is also an important means of maintaining a healthy balance
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;within an ecosystem. Thus although we violate the theoretical
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;rights of prey animals when we take on the role of predator, our
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;actions do not seem so inexcusable when we consider the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;bigger picture.

&gt; &gt;&gt;It is not quite that easy.  There is the ethical issue if one
&gt; &gt;&gt;believes in animal rights, but there are also a variety of
&gt; &gt;&gt;practical issues involved in humans trying to artificially
&gt; &gt;&gt;reproduce a natural predator/prey system.  Most predation
&gt; &gt;&gt;by humans would be by sport or subsistence hunters, and they
&gt; &gt;&gt;( especially sport hunters )often do not remove the same animals
&gt; &gt;&gt;other animal predators would.  Culls by biologists might be
&gt; &gt;&gt;closer to natural predation, but would still be artificial and
&gt; &gt;&gt;couldn't include *all* the subtle factors involved in
&gt; &gt;&gt;animal/animal prey/predator interactions.  We don't -- possibly
&gt; &gt;&gt;can't -- understand the natural systems well enough to
&gt; &gt;&gt;reproduce them exactly, and that can have drastic results.

&gt; &gt; These are all good points but it must also be noted that natural
&gt; &gt; predators don't bother to analyse the effects of their predation
&gt; &gt; on their ecosystems.

&gt; Could we see it as an &quot;Invisible Hand&quot; at work. :)  No, it doesn't
&gt; always work out in real life.  I'd rather trust to it in most
&gt; cases, because the natural predators and prey have evolved together
&gt; and adjusted to each other more exactly than humans have.
&gt; There seems to be considerable evidence that early humans
&gt; were responsible for the extinction of several species of
&gt; megafauna even before civilization developed.  We're just

&gt; Ok. How does an ordinary Joe with no direct control over his

&gt; animal rights violations?
">

Probably not possible in the real world.  In fact, it is
virtually impossible for anyone in the real world in our
Western industrialized civilization to live without
being responsible for *some* violation of animal rights, at
least indirectly.  Human civilization is built on use of
animals, displacement of animals, collateral deaths of animals
in the production of goods and services.  The same is true
of human rights.  Hardly a week goes by that an article does
not come out about horrible conditions among the workers in
China who produce the products for Wal-Mart and Target, or
the child slaves who pick cocoa beans, or sweatshop labor
among undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles, and so on.
In the real world, all people have to work to reduce their
negative impact on others, direct and indirect, as far as
reasonably practical.  It will never be perfect, for human
or animal rights, but we can try to do our best to avoid the
worst choices.  Vegetarianism/veganism I see as one of the
better choices.

&gt; The torturing of terrorist
&gt; suspects might serve as an example here. If a terrorist
&gt; attack can be prevented by extracting information by
&gt; torture than the torture can clearly be justified on utilitarian
&gt; grounds. The problem is that once torture is sanctioned
&gt; it is liable to gradually become more and more routine.
&gt; The argument that a society with some moral boundaries
&gt; or &quot;rights&quot; would be a better society in which to live than
&gt; a society that used utilitarian judgements on a case by
&gt; case basis is plausible. I'm not sure it is correct but it is
&gt; certainly plausible. This line of reasoning is also relevant
&gt; to the issue of animal experiments among other things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Then we're back to predation is not necessarily harmful
&gt;&gt;&gt;within the context of the bigger picture.
&gt;&gt;Yes, I agree, in terms of the system as a whole.  Unless
&gt;&gt;we can control fertility of wild animals, it is
&gt;&gt;necessary.  But, as above, I believe it is *unethical*
&gt;&gt;when carried out by moral agents (human).

&gt;&gt;That's where the theological argument comes in.  I agree
&gt;&gt;with C.S. Lewis and Linzey that a creation where death
&gt;&gt;and predation are necessary for the system to function
&gt;&gt;properly is a basically flawed (evil/sinful/imperfect)
&gt;&gt;system, and so it could not be the Creation as God intended
&gt;&gt;or intends it.  It must be the result of the corruption
&gt;&gt;inherent in the whole of Creation as it now exists.
&gt;&gt;This is only an important consideration for Christian
&gt;&gt;or other religious people.
&gt; I probably shouldn't get involved in theological debates
&gt; because I am grossly ignorant of the subject but is it
&gt; not a basic tenet of Christian Theology that God is
&gt; all powerful? By definition an all powerful God can not
&gt; make a mistake and the nature of Creation MUST be
&gt; exactly as God intended.
">

You are not the first person to express this idea -- it's
one of the classic arguments against the goodness of God, or
even God's existence.  While some human pain can be seen as
punishment or teaching, animal pain and pain in innocent
humans are difficult to square with an all-good, all-powerful
God.

One response which makes sense to me is the idea that God
is love, and love requires more than one being for its
expression.  The Christian idea of the Trinity involves the
idea that the three Persons within the unity of God allows
God to express love perfectly within His own Being.  He
created a universe outside Himself so that He might love it,
conscious beings within it might love Him, and all might
glorify Him.

God might eliminate all pain and sin by making all created
beings unable to act sinfully, and all nature to be unable to
harm those within it.  But in doing so, He would eliminate all
freedom for created beings, make us all respond like rocks
falling under the influence of gravity.  In order for humans
and other created beings to act freely and respond to God's
love, nature must be concrete and universal -- a rock must act
the same whether someone is using it as a shelter or using it
to bash in another being's head.  And in order for beings,
especially humans and (if one believes in them) angels, to
respond to the love of God and other beings, to be moral
beings *at all*, they must have free will to act.  That means
they must have, be allowed, the ability and freedom to act
sinfully, harmfully, as well as morally, in good ways.  Some
beings will use this freedom in wrong and harmful ways.
According to Christian belief, Satan has already done so, and
Linzey and C.S. Lewis suggest Satan has corrupted created
nature by introducing predation and animal pain even before
humans existed.  Humans also create(d) pain, suffering, injustice
through their own free-will sinful acts.  But that free will
also allows them to love God and other beings (including
animals) and act morally toward them.  Without freedom, good
and evil cannot exist, there can be no good moral action.

The theological idea is that the whole of creation will eventually
be redeemed and made perfect.  In the present created order, Jesus in
His incarnation took on our nature, became a part of the suffering of
all created beings, sacrificed Himself for all created beings, and
will eventually redeem all suffering.  Linzey says that our human
role as stewards of God's creation requires us to follow Jesus's
example and live as the "servant species" working with God, Christ,
and the Holy Spirit in creation to relieve suffering, bring about
justice and "hasten the Kingdom" and the redemption of the world.

&gt;&gt;utilitarian and a rights basis, using the same argument Regan
&gt;&gt;uses in _The Case For Animal Rights_ to apply to euthanasia
&gt;&gt;of non-humans on a rights basis.
">

I probably should note that the major difference between Singer's
utilitarian approach to euthanasia and a rights-based approach
like Regan's is that Singer says the decision should be based
on which choice increases the total sum of happiness in the
whole system.  That includes the idea that a new, healthy baby can
"replace" the severely disabled baby and increase the happiness
of the parents, the new baby, and society as a whole.  A rights
based approach like Regan's concept of "preference-respecting
euthanasia" says that the only being whose welfare/rights matters
is the individual human or animal to be euthanized.  Those who
can make their preference known (as in assisted suicide) should
have their preference respected.  Those who can't (as babies and
non-human animals) should have the decision made on the basis of
what is in *their* best interests as far as we can determine their
preference to be -- that is, what their own choice would be if
they could express it.  Euthanasia of such beings in acute,
untreatable suffering, which will continue as long as they are
conscious, can be seen as a kind of assisted suicide for them.
To be just and recognize their rights, euthanasia cannot be based
on our own utilitarian considerations ( for example, how difficult
it is for us to care for them, or how expensive the treatment
required, or how much it bothers *us* to watch them suffer, or
how nice it would be for us to have a new, healthy pet) but on
the basis of what value their continued life has *for them*.

&gt; How do you feel about conservation charities that sometime use
&gt; mass culls as an attempt to repair ecosystems that have become
&gt; unbalanced somehow, for example as a result of the introduction
&gt; of a non-native species or sudden environmental changes?
">

Very, very conflicted, I must say.  If it is a matter of massive
overpopulation in a devastated area, and the animals cannot be
removed to another habitat, and no appropriate predator or other
factor can be introduced, a cull might be seen as a form of
"preference-respecting euthanasia" as above, considering the
value of his life to each of the animals involved.

The first example I find much more problematical.  I see a sound
native ecosystem as very important, and contribute to several
wilderness organizations.  I would wish that the original ecological
balance of plants, animals, and other elements like wetlands, rivers,
clean air, and so on, could be restored in as many areas as
possible.  I'd like to see species reintroduced in their former
habitats whenever possible.  From a rights perspective, however,
it does not matter if an individual animal belongs to a "native"
species or not -- it still has an inherent value as an individual
which must be respected.  It's wrong to kill a feral burro because
she isn't a desert bighorn, or a pigeon because he isn't a bluebird,
or even a feral cat because she preys on native birds or animals in
an area.  What I'd like is for wilderness supporters to avoid mass
culls and work on methods of decreasing the fertility of non-native
species.  Eggs of non-native bird species (e.g. pigeons) can be removed
and destroyed, contraceptives can be introduced in feed or baits,
and so on.  Animals can even be trapped, spayed/neutered and released,
as is done with feral cat colonies in many places.  Dominant animals
can be nurtured rather than culled, so as to prevent sub-dominant
animals from replacing them and breeding.  There are a lot of non-lethal
options to be explored before resorting to culling.

No, it is entirely plausible and even probable.  However, from a rights
perspective, the violation of the deer's rights as an individual cannot
be justified on the basis of the violation of the mice's rights as
individuals.  In effect, "two wrongs don't make a right."  The only
just course of action would be to respect the rights of *both* by
trying to avoid poisoning the mice in production of vegetables and
using some other method of protecting the crop (for example, better
fences, or more secure storage buildings).

&gt; &gt;&gt;I am in favor of the option of assisted suicide for those who
&gt; &gt;&gt;want it also.

&gt; &gt; I wholeheartedly agree on both counts.

&gt; &gt; How do you feel about conservation charities that sometime use
&gt; &gt; mass culls as an attempt to repair ecosystems that have become
&gt; &gt; unbalanced somehow, for example as a result of the introduction
&gt; &gt; of a non-native species or sudden environmental changes?

&gt; Very, very conflicted, I must say.  If it is a matter of massive
&gt; overpopulation in a devastated area, and the animals cannot be
&gt; removed to another habitat, and no appropriate predator or other
&gt; factor can be introduced, a cull might be seen as a form of
&gt; &quot;preference-respecting euthanasia&quot; as above, considering the
&gt; value of his life to each of the animals involved.

&gt; The first example I find much more problematical.  I see a sound
&gt; native ecosystem as very important, and contribute to several
&gt; wilderness organizations.  I would wish that the original ecological
&gt; balance of plants, animals, and other elements like wetlands, rivers,
&gt; clean air, and so on, could be restored in as many areas as
&gt; possible.  I'd like to see species reintroduced in their former
&gt; habitats whenever possible.  From a rights perspective, however,
&gt; it does not matter if an individual animal belongs to a &quot;native&quot;
&gt; species or not -- it still has an inherent value as an individual
&gt; which must be respected.  It's wrong to kill a feral burro because
&gt; she isn't a desert bighorn, or a pigeon because he isn't a bluebird,
&gt; or even a feral cat because she preys on native birds or animals in
&gt; an area.  What I'd like is for wilderness supporters to avoid mass
&gt; culls and work on methods of decreasing the fertility of non-native
&gt; species.  Eggs of non-native bird species (e.g. pigeons) can be removed
&gt; and destroyed, contraceptives can be introduced in feed or baits,
&gt; and so on.  Animals can even be trapped, spayed/neutered and released,
&gt; as is done with feral cat colonies in many places.  Dominant animals
&gt; can be nurtured rather than culled, so as to prevent sub-dominant
&gt; animals from replacing them and breeding.  There are a lot of non-lethal
&gt; options to be explored before resorting to culling.

It's academic for most people.  It also ignores all the additional
animal deaths and rights violations which are involved in that
animal shot in his natural habitat, if the hunter does not also
live in that habitat.  It's not just one hunted animal = one death.
It's all the collateral damage involved in the environmental impact
of the things required to get the hunter there and back.  This
kind of calculation ends up being pretty much academic as well,
because the variables are so difficult to measure against each other.

The best alternative would be for a person with even a small area
where he can raise crops to grow as much food as possible --
anything from a couple of fruit trees and some tomato plants in his
backyard to a real vegetable garden, or participating in one of
the community gardens which are found in many progressive towns.
After that, buying from local farmers.  In my town, there is a tour
of local organic farms every year, so that customers can see
for themselves the conditions under which the produce is grown,
and a co-op which buys the produce and distributes it to members in
the nearby towns.  Beyond that, all one can do is research the
products one buys, and try to choose those with a lower environmental
impact.

&gt;&gt;While some human pain can be seen as
&gt;&gt;punishment or teaching, animal pain and pain in innocent
&gt;&gt;humans are difficult to square with an all-good, all-powerful
&gt;&gt;God.
&gt;&gt;One response which makes sense to me is the idea that God
&gt;&gt;is love, and love requires more than one being for its
&gt;&gt;expression.  The Christian idea of the Trinity involves the
&gt;&gt;idea that the three Persons within the unity of God allows
&gt;&gt;God to express love perfectly within His own Being.  He
&gt;&gt;created a universe outside Himself so that He might love it,
&gt;&gt;conscious beings within it might love Him, and all might
&gt;&gt;glorify Him.
&gt;&gt;God might eliminate all pain and sin by making all created
&gt;&gt;beings unable to act sinfully, and all nature to be unable to
&gt;&gt;harm those within it.  But in doing so, He would eliminate all
&gt;&gt;freedom for created beings,
&gt; Fair enough but why not create beings with no desire to sin?
">

Sin is defined as turning one's will away from God -- it does
not have to result in harm for any other being.  It's an issue
of freedom again.  For a being to say "yes" *freely* she must
be able to say "no" freely; to obey freely, one must be
capable of disobeying as well.  To have a will which can turn
to God *freely* and love and obey Him freely, a person must
have the capacity to turn away freely as well.  God does not,
we believe, want zombie automatons, but loving sons and
daughters.

Christianity has generally taught that humans had a bit of help
in becoming sinful -- they were tempted.  Most modern Christians
see this as metaphorical, rather than a literal Adam and Eve.
My church teaches that original sin does not follow from the Fall
of Adam and Eve, but from this ability and tendency of humans to
act contrary to God's will.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again why can a being need some evil in order to have free will?

He doesn't, but free will will usually involve some times when a being
will make wrong choices, just because we aren't perfect.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;That means
&gt;&gt;they must have, be allowed, the ability and freedom to act
&gt;&gt;sinfully, harmfully, as well as morally, in good ways.
&gt; Freedom to act sinfully is not the same as willingness to
&gt; act sinfully.
">

No.  In fact, many people, starting with St. Paul, have
complained that they don't want to act sinfully, but they
end up doing so anyway.  It's part of being human.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Some
&gt;&gt;beings will use this freedom in wrong and harmful ways.
&gt;&gt;According to Christian belief, Satan has already done so, and
&gt;&gt;Linzey and C.S. Lewis suggest Satan has corrupted created
&gt;&gt;nature by introducing predation and animal pain even before
&gt;&gt;humans existed.
&gt; I suppose if Satan is infinitely powerful and infintely evil then
&gt; it is possible for evil to be compatible with an infinitely good
&gt; infinitely powerful god.
">

No, that's a Gnostic or Zoroastrian belief.  Christianity teaches
that Satan is also a created being and less powerful than God,
but more powerful and cunning than humans (or animals).  He doesn't
really have to be blamed for human sin; we do it on our own.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Humans also create(d) pain, suffering, injustice
&gt;&gt;through their own free-will sinful acts.  But that free will
&gt;&gt;also allows them to love God and other beings (including

&gt;&gt;and evil cannot exist, there can be no good moral action.
&gt; They say I don't belong.. I must stay below, alone..
&gt; Because of my beliefs, I'm supposed to stay where evil is sown..
&gt; But what is evil anyway? Is there reason to the rhyme..?
&gt; Without Evil, there can be no good..
&gt; So it must be good to be evil sometimes..
">

It's sort of like light and dark: without dark, we wouldn't understand
light.  There can be good without evil, but there cannot be
good done *freely*, good with moral value, unless there is
the capacity to do otherwise.  This is similar to the secular
idea that moral patients ( in Regan's system ) cannot violate
rights, because they cannot act either morally or immorally.
Many people have said animals are sinless, or innocent, in
this way, but it does not mean they cannot do harm to others.
They are just not morally responsible for what they do.  In
the same way, a severely retarded person or a young child can
do harm or even kill another person, but we don't hold them
morally responsible, or try them as adults in our legal system.

A similar thought to yours is an old medieval poem:

"Adam lay yboundan, bounden in a bond
Four thousand yeare thought he not too long.
And all was for an apple, and apple that he took,
As clerkes finden written in here booke.
Never had that apple, apple taken been,
Never had Our Lady been Heaven's Queen.
Blessed be that apple, apple take was.
Therefore we maun sing, "Deo gratias!"

The idea is that God always brings good out of evil, and turns
all sin into redemption.  The sin isn't good in itself, but
God will use it to bring about a good result.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How does following Jesus's example require us not to eat meat?
">

There is a fairly elaborate discussion of this in Andrew Linzey's
books, and for a more complete analysis, I'd suggest reading
at least _Christianity and the Rights of Animals_ and _Animal
Theology_.

Animals are more like us than the rest of Creation -- something
which is obvious to everyone who has had any experience with them.
They have consciousness and ability to feel pleasure and pain,
and what we do to them matters more to them, than what we do to
other created things matters to them.  This is reflected in the
Biblical story of the Flood, where the Covenant between God and
humanity afterward includes animals as well, and animals are said
to share the same basic nature -- the same "breath" -- as humans,
unlike plants or inanimate objects.  The story in Genesis states
that in our uncorrupted state, in Eden, humans were created to be
vegetarian (Genesis 1:29-30).  This is the ideal.  In the same
way, there was no predation in the paradicical state, no violence.
We should remember that the animals are created by God, and thus
*belong* to God -- anything we do to them, we are doing, in essence,
to Someone Else's property, and only under His sufferance.  We have
to answer to God for the life of every one of His creatures that
we take, and had better have a really good reason.  "It tastes good"
is not a good enough reason to kill.  What Linzey says is that:
"When we have to kill to live we may do so, but when we do not, we
should live otherwise."  We almost never *have* to use animals in the
way they are used in commercial farming today, or kill them as they are
killed in factory farms.  We have other options.  Even so, Linzey adds,
"The truth is that even if we adopt a vegetarian or vegan life-style, we
are still not free of killing, either directly or indirectly...it is
only *one* very small step toward the vision of a peaceful world."

If we take the example of Jesus, Linzey notes that, "...there is a
powerful strand in his ethical teaching about the primacy of mercy
to the weak, the powerless and the oppressed...Who is more deserving
of this special compassion than the animals so commonly exploited
in our world today?"  In other words, the example of Jesus is
showing mercy to those in our power, in "lowering" ourselves to
serve those who are helpless, suffering, and in need, in sacrificing
ourselves for those who cannot help themselves and are oppressed
and hurt and killed.  The animals, even more than humans, are "the
least of these" whom we are to feed and offer shelter and comfort,
for as we do

suffering.  She asks her family to help her with assisted
suicide, and they do.  In that case, she is taking the costs

own body, and be based on a utilitarian analysis of the total

OTOH, take the same sick old woman who does *not* want to die.

&gt; My church teaches that original sin does not follow from the Fall
&gt; of Adam and Eve, but from this ability and tendency of humans to
&gt; act contrary to God's will.

I don't feel that really answers the question. I can accept that God
wanted
to give us the freedom to commit sin but that still doesn't explain why
we
should have the desire to sin.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Again why can a being need some evil in order to have free will?

&gt; He doesn't, but free will will usually involve some times when a being
&gt; will make wrong choices, just because we aren't perfect.

And if God is all powerful and we are not perfect the only logical
explaination is that God doesn't want us to be perfect.

&gt; &gt;&gt;That means
&gt; &gt;&gt;they must have, be allowed, the ability and freedom to act
&gt; &gt;&gt;sinfully, harmfully, as well as morally, in good ways.

&gt; &gt; Freedom to act sinfully is not the same as willingness to
&gt; &gt; act sinfully.

&gt; No.  In fact, many people, starting with St. Paul, have
&gt; complained that they don't want to act sinfully, but they
&gt; end up doing so anyway.  It's part of being human.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Some
&gt; &gt;&gt;beings will use this freedom in wrong and harmful ways.
&gt; &gt;&gt;According to Christian belief, Satan has already done so, and
&gt; &gt;&gt;Linzey and C.S. Lewis suggest Satan has corrupted created
&gt; &gt;&gt;nature by introducing predation and animal pain even before
&gt; &gt;&gt;humans existed.

&gt; &gt; I suppose if Satan is infinitely powerful and infintely evil then
&gt; &gt; it is possible for evil to be compatible with an infinitely good
&gt; &gt; infinitely powerful god.

&gt; No, that's a Gnostic or Zoroastrian belief.  Christianity teaches
&gt; that Satan is also a created being and less powerful than God,
&gt; but more powerful and cunning than humans (or animals).  He doesn't
&gt; really have to be blamed for human sin; we do it on our own.

OK. Thanks for the Theology lesson. BTW it is mathematically
possible for the Devil to be infinitely poweful *and* less powerful
than God.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Humans also create(d) pain, suffering, injustice
&gt; &gt;&gt;through their own free-will sinful acts.  But that free will

&gt; &gt;&gt;animals) and act morally toward them.  Without freedom, good

&gt; &gt; They say I don't belong.. I must stay below, alone..

&gt; It's sort of like light and dark: without dark, we wouldn't understand

&gt; good done *freely*, good with moral value, unless there is

That can explain away a small amount of sin and suffering but not
realisitically on the scale we witness in the real world.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is similar to the secular
&gt; idea that moral patients ( in Regan's system ) cannot violate
&gt; rights, because they cannot act either morally or immorally.
&gt; Many people have said animals are sinless, or innocent, in
&gt; this way, but it does not mean they cannot do harm to others.
&gt; They are just not morally responsible for what they do.  In
&gt; the same way, a severely retarded person or a young child can
&gt; do harm or even kill another person, but we don't hold them
&gt; morally responsible, or try them as adults in our legal system.

&gt; A similar thought to yours

I stole the thought from the South Park movie.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; is an old medieval poem:

&gt;      &quot;Adam lay yboundan, bounden in a bond
&gt;       Four thousand yeare thought he not too long.

&gt;       As clerkes finden written in here booke.

&gt;       Blessed be that apple, apple take was.
&gt;       Therefore we maun sing, &quot;Deo gratias!&quot;

&gt; The idea is that God always brings good out of evil, and turns
&gt; all sin into redemption.  The sin isn't good in itself, but
&gt; God will use it to bring about a good result.

It's still very hard to believe that sin is necessary on the scale
of reality.

&gt; &gt; How does following Jesus's example require us not to eat meat?

&gt; There is a fairly elaborate discussion of this in Andrew Linzey's
&gt; books, and for a more complete analysis, I'd suggest reading
&gt; at least _Christianity and the Rights of Animals_ and _Animal
&gt; Theology_.

&gt; Animals are more like us than the rest of Creation -- something
&gt; which is obvious to everyone who has had any experience with them.
&gt; They have consciousness and ability to feel pleasure and pain,
&gt; and what we do to them matters more to them, than what we do to
&gt; other created things matters to them.  This is reflected in the
&gt; Biblical story of the Flood, where the Covenant between God and
&gt; humanity afterward includes animals as well, and animals are said
&gt; to share the same basic nature -- the same &quot;breath&quot; -- as humans,
&gt; unlike plants or inanimate objects.  The story in Genesis states
&gt; that in our uncorrupted state, in Eden, humans were created to be
&gt; vegetarian (Genesis 1:29-30).  This is the ideal.  In the same
&gt; way, there was no predation in the paradicical state, no violence.

If the "paradicial" state is superior to our current state why did
God abandon it? If it wasn't why did he create it in the first place?

&gt; &gt; Thanks for that summation. I think Regan is wrong to trivialise

&gt; I don't think he trivializes those things, but he ( and I )

I see all the interested parties, as having needs that ought to
be given consideration. It appears that Regan and you want to
pay far more attention to the needs of the infant than his/her
parents. In your ethics the parents needs appear to be little
more than a tie-breaker if the judgement is too close to call.
Is this fair?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Let's take another example.  Suppose we have a sick old woman
&gt; who wants to spare her family financial and emotional
&gt; suffering.  She asks her family to help her with assisted
&gt; suicide, and they do.  In that case, she is taking the costs
&gt; to others into consideration, and suicide under those conditions
&gt; would respect her right to choose what she wants done with her
&gt; own body, and be based on a utilitarian analysis of the total
&gt; system as well.

Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; OTOH, take the same sick old woman who does *not* want to die.
&gt; If her family kills her to spare themselves suffering (or for her

">

Although it is perhaps inconsistent of me to be introducing
non-utilitarian considerations, I think there is a relevant difference
between
an old woman and infant here. The woman will likely have invested
a great deal of time and/or money and (during pregnancy) health in
order to bring her children up. If she wants to be kept alive the
children
sort of owe it to her in a way. A baby killed shortly after birth is in
the same position as a baby who hadn't been concieved, at least
from an atheistic perspective.

&gt; &gt; If we accept Francoine's argument that we are obligated not to
&gt; &gt; violate the rights of others but not morally obligated to help
&gt; &gt; others then is it not better to painlessly euthanise the infant
&gt; &gt; than to wait for him/her to die of neglect?

&gt; Oh, yes.  I think so.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I'm still not entirely sure what reasons. You have conceded that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;lethal methods of pest control are in violation of animal rights. Is it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;implausible to you that the number of rodents deliberately posioned per
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;calorie of grain is greater than the number of deer deliberately shot
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;per calorie of venison?

&gt; &gt;&gt;No, it is entirely plausible and even probable.  However, from a rights
&gt; &gt;&gt;perspective, the violation of the deer's rights as an individual cannot
&gt; &gt;&gt;be justified on the basis of the violation of the mice's rights as
&gt; &gt;&gt;individuals.  In effect, &quot;two wrongs don't make a right.&quot;

&gt; &gt; But we are not talking about violating the rights of the deer and the
&gt; &gt; rights
&gt; &gt; of the mice. We are talking about violating the rights of the deer or
&gt; &gt; the rights of the mice.

&gt; Either one is wrong from a rights perspective.  While one may have to
&gt; choose between two wrongs, it is better to try to avoid either one by
&gt; looking for least-harmful sources of vegetables.

Of course.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And, of course,
&gt; humans are not pure carnivores.  Even if a hunter reduces the amount
&gt; of vegetable food in his diet, he will still eat some.  Unless it is
&gt; gathered plants, he will then violate the rights of both groups
&gt; anyway.

Surely what matters is how many individual animals are violated, not
how many groups are? Do vegans not eat more plant matter than
non-vegans?

&gt; &gt;&gt;The only
&gt; &gt;&gt;just course of action would be to respect the rights of *both* by
&gt; &gt;&gt;trying to avoid poisoning the mice in production of vegetables and
&gt; &gt;&gt;using some other method of protecting the crop (for example, better
&gt; &gt;&gt;fences, or more secure storage buildings).

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, that's a major question, isn't it?  I'm not sure I can give
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a simple answer off the top of my head.  You first: what do *you*
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;see as the purpose of ethics?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;How about to balance the conflicting interests of sentient beings
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;in such a way as to foster the greatest overall quality (x quantity)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of life?

&gt; &gt;&gt;I would see that as a good goal, as long as the inherent value of
&gt; &gt;&gt;each individual within the whole is respected first, as in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;example of the mice above, or the euthanized animal above.  I would
&gt; &gt;&gt;see considering *only* the overall sum of welfare as a potential
&gt; &gt;&gt;slippery slope which can lead to very bad consequences for the
&gt; &gt;&gt;minority victims.

&gt; &gt; This is where the concept of rights comes in - as a means to an end.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess one major purpose would be to defend and define rights
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and assure they are not violated for purely utilitarian considerations.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I see rights as a means to an end, not an end in themselves.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I see them as a means of defining how the inherent value of each
&gt; &gt;&gt;individual should justly be respected, independent of utilitarian
&gt; &gt;&gt;benefit to others.

&gt; &gt; I guess that's where we have to agree to differ. I am interested in
&gt; &gt; the whole.

&gt; I understand.  We can agree to disagree here.

Sure. You are welcome to present arguments in favour of your
position but my belief that it is the whole that matters is an axiom
to me.
