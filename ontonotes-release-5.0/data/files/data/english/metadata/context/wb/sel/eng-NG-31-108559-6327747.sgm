I always thought the voltage across an inductor was -Ldi/dt. Yet it
cannot be, because for a conductor with zero resistance and carrying a
finite current, the electric field inside it must be 0 meaning there
is no voltage across it's ends. When we talk about a voltage existing
across an inductor, what we really mean is that the voltage across the
terminals of the voltmeter is -LdI/dt.

In a volume of space that is subject to a changing magnetic field,

That's why you can have voltage across the ends of a transformer
winding.

No. Place a coil or loop in a time-varying magnetic field. Connect its
ends to a twisted pair or a coaxial cable and run that cable a mile
away, far from the magnetic field zone, and use the voltmeter there.
Same voltage.

Of course, if the voltmeter and its leads are in the field, you'll
have to take the additional potentials into account. In the case of a
voltmeter connected to the secondary of a transformer, the voltmeter
isn't exposed to much field, but it still measures the winding
voltage.

As noted, you can move the voltmeter far away, out of the field, and
accurately measure the non-zero coil or loop voltage. And a 100-turn
coil pumps move voltage into the meter than a 5-turn coil, or a bigger
loop more than a small one, so there must be voltage within the coil.

There *is* an electric field inside a conductor which is immersed
inside a changing magnetic field. "Ohm's law" is trashed by
electrodynamics. The electric field is like a gravitational field...
it permeates everything. If that were not true, every generator and
transformer and motor on the planet would instantly stop working.

In Hertz's seminal experiments, he detected em fields by using a
single metal wire that *almost* made a full ring, leaving just a tiny
gap. When exposed to a sufficiently strong em field, he observed
sparks jumping across the small gap. No voltmeter needed.

If the current is finite and resistance is 0, then the charge inside
the conductor rearranges itself to create an electric field that
cancels the applied electric field. The net electric field is
therefore zero. Since the electric field is the measured force on a
unit positive charge placed there and an infinitesimally small i.e. 0
force is required to move it because the reistance is zero, then the
electric field has to be zero.

I think the answer is that Faraday's law is true for any passive
region that modifies the electric field, and the electric field in
Faraday's law is the total electric field in the passive region and
not just the induced electric field. So that the electric field
through the terminals of the voltmeter is that due to an
infinitesimally small current that generates a voltage across it's
internal resistance.

Suppose a conductor requires 0.01V applied across it to push 1A
through it. If it is now wound into an inductor and pushes 1A through
1R, the voltage through the 1R will be 1V, and through the inductance
still 0.01V. An electron in the inductance will still require the same
force to move it for the same current, whether that force is from a
static electric field or a changing magnetic field. If the force is
the same, the electric field there is the same.

Yes. And the electric field in the gap was several orders of magnitude
greater than that in the metal wire.

&gt; That's why you can have voltage across the ends of a transformer
&gt; winding.

&gt;&gt;If there was, the current would be
&gt;&gt;infinite. Therefore there is no electric field inside an inductance of
&gt;&gt;zero resistance carrying a finite current. The line integral of E
&gt;&gt;across the terminals of the voltmeter - its measured voltage - equals
&gt;&gt;the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit consisting of

&gt; No. Place a coil or loop in a time-varying magnetic field. Connect its
&gt; ends to a twisted pair or a coaxial cable and run that cable a mile
&gt; away, far from the magnetic field zone, and use the voltmeter there.
&gt; Same voltage.

&gt; Of course, if the voltmeter and its leads are in the field, you'll
&gt; have to take the additional potentials into account. In the case of a
&gt; voltmeter connected to the secondary of a transformer, the voltmeter
&gt; isn't exposed to much field, but it still measures the winding
&gt; voltage.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When we talk about a voltage existing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;across an inductor, what we really mean is that the voltage across the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;terminals of the voltmeter is -LdI/dt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Same thing, if you have a voltmeter. Same thing if you don't.

&gt;&gt;This is not obvious to me. With the voltmeter and leads connected to
&gt;&gt;the inductor, only V across the voltmeter contributes to the total
&gt;&gt;E.dl around the loop, since E is zero inside the leads and the
&gt;&gt;inductor. So the voltage across the voltmeter equals the total E.dl.
&gt;&gt;Take the leads away and E.dl across the voltmeter no longer equals the
&gt;&gt;total E.dl around the loop because E is no longer zero where the leads
&gt;&gt;were.

&gt; As noted, you can move the voltmeter far away, out of the field, and
&gt; accurately measure the non-zero coil or loop voltage. And a 100-turn
&gt; coil pumps move voltage into the meter than a 5-turn coil, or a bigger
&gt; loop more than a small one, so there must be voltage within the coil.

&gt; There *is* an electric field inside a conductor which is immersed
&gt; inside a changing magnetic field. &quot;Ohm's law&quot; is trashed by
&gt; electrodynamics. The electric field is like a gravitational field...
&gt; it permeates everything. If that were not true, every generator and
&gt; transformer and motor on the planet would instantly stop working.

&gt; In Hertz's seminal experiments, he detected em fields by using a
&gt; single metal wire that *almost* made a full ring, leaving just a tiny
&gt; gap. When exposed to a sufficiently strong em field, he observed
&gt; sparks jumping across the small gap. No voltmeter needed.

You won't be able to maintain a steady-state DC voltage drop
across a conductor with zero DC resistance, because that would
imply infinite current.  However, the transient or AC-voltage
case the story is entirely different.  Consider, for example,
my 10kV 300kHz ferrite-core transformer, which has 22 turns on
its secondary.  The single-turn primary has 450 volts across
its ends.  Since it's a thick band of 1"-wide copper, with for
all practical purposes, zero DC resistance, by your obviously-
incorrect understanding this is not possible.  BTW, the current
in my transformer's single thick strip of copper is modest and

That lecture note is poorly written, confused, and useless. A voltage
drop, or more accurately potential drop, is understood to be a measure
of energy expenditure per unit of charge injected through the component.
There is no such energy expenditure in a pure inductance, it is all
storage, and therefore there is no potential drop across it. Faraday's
law introduces the concept of electromotive force due to induction, or
e.m.f., and quantifies its interaction with the electric field in closed
loops. It is a statement about the net potential drops around the loop
external to the inductor and not the inductor itself. You cannot have a
di/dt in the inductor without an external circuit loop, the loop will
always be present, but because it can take many forms, it is simpler to
consider that the algebraic sum of the external loop drops as appearing
across the inductor in the sense that this is where one would place the
measurement probes. Get real.

Let's assume the secondary is open-circuit so that it has no effect on
the the primary. When you apply 450V across the primary, that doesn't
mean the primary winding has a voltage of magnitude 450V through it
because total EMF = 450V - primary = rate of change of magnetic flux =
Lp*d(Ip)/dt. With static I, total EMF = 450 - primary = 0, and so
primary = 450V which, as you pointed out, would give an infinite
current for a 0R primary.

Where there is a changing magnetic field, the electric field isn't
conservative and so you can't assume that components in parallel will
have the same volage through them. Suppose you have a ring of 1R in a
uniform magnetic field normal to the plane of the ring. Suppose it
changes at a uniform rate so that it induces an electric field in the
ring with the total EMF around the the ring being 1V. The voltage
across a 0.1R segment = 0.1V is in parallel with the rest of the 0.9R
= 0.9V segment, yet the voltage drops are not the same. In a
conservative field where total EMF around ring = 0V, you can say
V_0.1R = V_0.9R.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;OK

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Yet it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cannot be, because for a conductor with zero resistance and carrying a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;finite current, the electric field inside it must be 0 meaning there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;is no voltage across it's ends.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The electric field is nonzero because there's a changing magnetic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; field, which creates potential. The magnetic field is changing because
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of...   dI/dT !

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;There is no electric field inside a conductor of zero resistance
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;carrying a finite current.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In a volume of space that is subject to a changing magnetic field,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there *is* a corresponding electric field. If there's a conductor in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that space, the electric field is present inside the conductor, too.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That's why you can have voltage across the ends of a transformer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; winding.

&gt;&gt; &gt;If the current is finite and resistance is 0, then the charge inside
&gt;&gt; &gt;the conductor rearranges itself to create an electric field that
&gt;&gt; &gt;cancels the applied electric field. The net electric field is
&gt;&gt; &gt;therefore zero.

&gt;&gt; It's not. Just quit being silly. If that were so, nothing would work.

&gt;&gt; Since the electric field is the measured force on a

&gt;&gt; &gt;unit positive charge placed there and an infinitesimally small i.e. 0
&gt;&gt; &gt;force is required to move it because the reistance is zero, then the
&gt;&gt; &gt;electric field has to be zero.

&gt;&gt; OK, OK, I give up. Believe whatever you insist on believing.

&gt;&gt; And don't send me a resume.

&gt;Are you that important that I should want to?

Yes.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You won't be able to maintain a steady-state DC voltage drop
&gt; &gt;&gt; across a conductor with zero DC resistance, because that would
&gt; &gt;&gt; imply infinite current.  However, the transient or AC-voltage
&gt; &gt;&gt; case the story is entirely different.  Consider, for example,
&gt; &gt;&gt; my 10kV 300kHz ferrite-core transformer, which has 22 turns on
&gt; &gt;&gt; its secondary.  The single-turn primary has 450 volts across
&gt; &gt;&gt; its ends.  Since it's a thick band of 1&quot;-wide copper, with for
&gt; &gt;&gt; all practical purposes, zero DC resistance, by your obviously-
&gt; &gt;&gt; incorrect understanding this is not possible.  BTW, the current
&gt; &gt;&gt; in my transformer's single thick strip of copper is modest and
&gt; &gt;&gt; due almost entirely to activities outside the copper strip.

&gt; &gt; Let's assume the secondary is open-circuit so that it has no effect
&gt; &gt; on the the primary. When you apply 450V across the primary, that
&gt; &gt; doesn't mean the primary winding has a voltage of magnitude 450V
&gt; &gt; through it because total EMF = 450V - primary = rate of change of
&gt; &gt; magnetic flux = Lp*d(Ip)/dt.  With static I, total EMF =
&gt; &gt; 450 - primary = 0, and so primary = 450V which, as you pointed out,
&gt; &gt; would give an infinite current for a 0R primary.

&gt;  What are you, a TROLL?  You wrote &quot;I always thought the voltage
&gt;  across an inductor was -Ldi/dt.  Yet it cannot be ...&quot;  Silly boy.
">

With hindsight, I think I have to agree with you. I should have said
"I always thought that an EMF = Ldi/dt was generated INSIDE the
conductor of an inductor. In fact the EMF is infinitesimally small
i.e. 0 if it has a resistance of 0R and carries a finite current."

the problem with that line of reasoning is that the voltmeter is outside

How does that create a problem in my reasoning? I'm just using
Faraday's law for the loop consisting of the inductor, leads and
voltmeter. E.dl through inductance and leads is zero , with E.dl
through the voltmeter making up the rest = Ldi/dt.
