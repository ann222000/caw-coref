There has been discussion recently concerning the policy for posting
RFDs.  I would like to float an idea for formalizing a policy related to
this issue.  If there's sufficient support, I'll write it up and submit
it as an RFD.  As a side effect, it might demonstrate whether it's
possible to conduct a coherent discussion in news.groups.

For purposes of this discussion, let's divide submitted RFDs into two
categories -- the ones that might pass eventually, and the ones that
don't have any chance of passing a Board vote.  It's obviously
impossible to determine in advance which RFDs will pass and which won't,
but I do believe that it's possible to deduce in some cases that a
particular RFD cannot garner sufficient support to obtain a majority of
YES votes when the Board votes.  In these cases it's a waste of time to
go through the formal process of posting the RFD, debating it, voting,
and announcing a result.

The goal is to establish a threshold that a submitted RFD must meet to
continue the process.  This threshold should be low, but consistent.  I
suggest a procedure analogous to the motion/second procedure used in
traditional in-person meetings.

In a traditional formal meeting, one person *makes a motion* and someone
else *seconds the motion*.  Normally the second is a routine matter that
takes only (no pun intended) seconds.  On rare occasions, a motion dies
for want of a second.  In this case, it's obvious that the motion would
not have passed and the meeting attendees save the time to debate it.

Extending this to the electronic meeting that the Board conducts, I
suggest that each RFD be required to receive an affirmative &quot;second&quot;
from two Board members before moving forward.  If there aren't two Board
members who think that the proposal has sufficient merit to even be
published, it's obvious that the proposal will not pass a Board vote.
Just as in the traditional parliamentary world, a &quot;second&quot; does not
imply that the person seconding is going to vote for the proposal later;
it simply states that they feel that it has sufficient merit to be
discussed further.

The problem that I see with this idea is the height of the bar that it
puts in place.  Maybe it's too high, and useful RFDs will be screened
out.  Maybe it's too low, and it won't screen out anything.  Maybe it's
actually not a change in procedure at all and this is effectively what's
already happening.  It's just an idea, and I'm curious what comments it
will elicit.

Yes, that's a perfectly reasonable idea in something approximating a
perfect world.  Usenet is not a perfect world.  I don't think it's
reasonable to allow the RFD process to be abused to the point of making
it useless.  There needs to be some filtering process in place to remove
submissions that are intended to abuse the system rather than use it.

I'm not under a delusion that people will be satisfied with any
procedure.  If everything is published, some people will complain that
the clearly-ridiculous RFDs are clogging up the system and increasing
the S/N.  If *anything* is filtered, the submitter will not be pleased.

I'm just wondering if some formalization of the current ad hoc procedure
would be beneficial.

Well, yes, I do admit that it would take someone with a callous

My category for the latter case is &quot;doesn't have a snowball's chance
in hell of passing.&quot;  I think it is a waste of time to publish such
RFDs.  A &quot;request for discussion&quot; (in my view) should suggest that
the board is open to the discussion.  Putting out &quot;requests for
discussion&quot; on issues that are already virtually decided seems to
me to cheapen the medium.

I estimate that all of the RFDs published in n.a.n so far have
already met the standard that &quot;at least two board members would
like to see the RFD published.&quot;  I think the bar has to be raised
higher to keep frivolous RFDs from swamping the system.

Jim Riley's RFD for a 9th hierarchy was borderline, in my view.
It was a snowball when received.  I didn't object to publishing
it because I wanted to see what kind of ideas might come out of
the discussion about potential revisions in policies for one
of the current big-8 hierarchies and/or creation of a different
kind of managed hierarchy loosely sponsored by the board.

There wasn't any chance that we would create a new hierarchy
called 9th.  (I say that on the basis of ESP which, of course,
I am prohibited from using when dealing with mere mortals.)
I do think the question of whether we could modify management
rules for an existing hierarchy or for a new hierarchy is one
of the most interesting and novel ideas suggested in the last
year or two.  I didn't keep any notes on the thread, but it
seems to me that the support for the idea in the specific
case (9th.*) or in the general case (modified management
for an existing or new hierarchy) was not much different
from zero.

&gt;actually not a change in procedure at all and this is effectively what's
&gt;already happening.  It's just an idea, and I'm curious what comments it
&gt;will elicit.
">

Here is an outline of how I see the process:

1. An RFD is posted to n.a.n.

2. The RFD is relayed to the board.

3. The board decides whether to publish the RFD in n.a.n.

3.1 If the RFD is rejected, a rejection notice is
sent to the proponent.

3.2 If the RFD is published, the steps for participating
in the discussion are outlined in the RFD itself.

3.2.1 Discussion ensues.

3.2.2 Discussion is brought to an end.  Either the
proponent withdraws the RFD or the board makes a
formal decision on it.

Your questions deal with step 3.  Under the rules of consensus,
the board lets the chair seek agreement informally.  Two cases
are possible:

&quot;If I hear no objections in [some time specified], I will publish
the RFD in n.a.n.&quot;

&quot;If I hear no objections in [some time specified], I will NOT publish
the RFD in n.a.n.&quot;

If there is an objection in either case, more formal procedures
should kick in.  I don't see any reason why the board can't take
a formal vote on the question of whether a particular RFD should
be published--except that it takes about a week or so to go through
the formal vote.  But that is the only reliable method to determine
what the board as a whole wants to do with the RFD.

The board can create subcommittees and assign votetakers to run
particular votes, so IF formal procedures are needed, they wouldn't
become too burdensome for any one member.

There is an alternate model of what happens in step 3.  Some people
(understandably) use the norms for moderated groups as a guide
to thinking about how the decision is made.  In this model, a
moderation policy is set for n.a.n, just like any other newsgroup.
All posts that arguably meet the formal standards of the moderation
policy have to be published regardless of what the board thinks of
them.

I am opposed to using that model in step 3.  It sets too low a
bar for publication and would not keep n.a.n from coming under
flood attacks.

We have recently rewritten and expanded the policy on the kinds of
proposals that are discouraged:

http://www.big-8.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=policies:discouraged

This list gives some idea of the standards that are applied in
sifting out RFDs.  I don't think we can give a clear and
distinct definition of what are nonsense proposals, trolls,
flames, or other kinds of snowballs.  There is no way that I
can see to formalize the procedure further than giving these
general guidelines.  There are exceptions to every rule,
except the rule that there are exceptions to every rule;
humans are the final exception handlers in any system like
this.

I am opposed to that approach.

Generating properly formatted RFDs with all the words spelled
correctly is trivial.  Your simple suggestion would open the
door to flood attacks that would render n.a.n useless as a
place for people to see what is and is not on the board's
agenda.

Checking RFDs for proper format can be automated.  It, too,
is trivial.

Content issues cannot be checked solely by looking at
the form of the RFD.  The meaning of the RFD is what
matters more than the form and there is no mindless
method of determining meaning.  Someone has to read
the RFD and make a judgment about the value of the
ideas expressed in it.  I think that kind of evaluation
is the job of the board or its delegates.

Couple minor teeny problems with your board slurping *grandstanding*

1. The board could have approved the RFD, demonstrated its failings
and voted to not approve. All grandstanding aborted.

2. They could have taken the high road and followed their own
*simplified* procedure.

3. If the RFD was as flawed as was stated, then all could have had a
laugh at Adam's expense.

But the board played games, hid behind ill defined rules and then
blamed the poster of the RFD and called him a liar, without supplying
one shred of proof to support their accusation he was lying.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a perfectly reasonable idea in something approximating a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perfect world.  Usenet is not a perfect world.  I don't think it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonable to allow the RFD process to be abused to the point of making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it useless.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where the hell did THAT spurious accusation come from? What properly
&gt;&gt;&gt; formatted RFDs abused process to the point of making it useless?

&gt;&gt; Well, yes, I do admit that it would take someone with a callous
&gt;&gt; disregard for the process to submit something that was properly
&gt;&gt; formatted, but yet not really an RFD, then to grandstand in news.groups
&gt;&gt; that it wasn't posted.  An even more callous individual would refuse to
&gt;&gt; disclose what he submitted in order to further extend the grandstanding.

Russ Allbery, who finally disgraced himself to the point
that he simply had to run away in shame.

WHO elected you, you bunch of sickos with megalomaniacal
tendencies?

WHO asked you for your &quot;assistance&quot;?

WHO authorized you to do this dirtiest disservice to
Usenet?

You see, you live in democratic societies. But according to

You can weasel all you want.
The bottom line is you accepted an RFD. A 2nd RFD based upon the first
RFD was rejected and the proponent was called &quot;frivolous and
disingenuous&quot;. No evidence was ever supplied o support those claims.
You and the rest hid behing ill defined rules and played word games.
Claiming that an RFD that followed all you silly rules was
unacceptable and should be posted somewhere else. Demanding the
proponent post it to news.groups when YOUR rules REQUIRE it be posted
to NAN.

&gt;&gt;How does creating a procedure, as you have, where RFDs and proponents

&gt;&gt;as opposed to using n.a.n. for that purpose, as you say above?

&gt;The proposal for the bulk creation of newsgroups was published

&gt;It was an unusual RFD, but an RFD nonetheless.

So you are saying, that it isn't an RFD unless published in NAN and
that an RFD that does not fit the norm is acceptable, as long as it
was written by a b8mbie.

&gt;Try again, Marty. I'm not asking about the RFD... I'm asking about how
&gt;that procedure shows people what is and is not on the board's agenda,
&gt;when RFDs and proponents are no longer required for group creation.
">

I think we're at an impasse here.

I do not see the situation the way you do.

The RFD for the bulk creation showed people what
the board had placed on its agenda.

It was published in n.a.n with the board's approval.

If I'm not mistaken, the question that Steve Bonine
began this thread with was, &quot;When should RFDs be
posted to n.a.n?&quot;

My answer to that question is: when the board is
willing to entertain them as items to be formally
decided.

Our rules only require it to be posted to NAN if we are to seriously
consider it.  It was not a serious proposal and was not going to be
considered, so the proponent was invited to post it to NG to demonstrate
that the proposal was as serious as he was claiming.  Since it was not,
of course he didn't do so.

No, it is required to be posted to NAN BEFORE it becomes an RFD. All
discussion of RFDs is REQUIRED to be in NGP. Publishing anywhere else
removes any requirement of *official* board notice.

The mind reading and aspersions continue.

The RFD was posted to the correct venue NAN. That the board refused to
publish does not lay the onus upon the proponent to prove the boards
actions but upon the board to substantiate the reason why it was not
published. The claims made were &quot;frivolous and disingenuous&quot;. However
those claims lack all substantion beyond &quot;trust us, we read the
proponents mind&quot;.

I will once more reiterate:
Why didn't the board snuff all of this in the beginning, rather than
hiding behind a smoke screen of ill defined rules and attacks upon the
character of the proponent?

1. Publish the RFD.
2. Point out the deficiencies.
3. Vote and reject if deficient.

But no, you took the arrogant and dismissive path of &quot;we know what the
proponent is thinking, so shut the fuck up&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

More mind reading with, of course, the required &quot;blame the proponent&quot;.

&gt;It's obviously

Disagree. The value of an RFD may not be in the actual proposal, but in
the ideas that the discussion brings forth. For just one example, the
RFD for the '9th' hierarchy. I think it is obvious that proposal will
not pass.  Period. Is that a reason not to accept it? No, because it
should have generated a discussion about how one performs experiments
in a running Usenet. This also ignores the fact that some proposals
would obviously not pass in their original form, but are modified into
passable form via discussion.

Nonsense, Kathy. There was no such written guideline requiring a
proponent to demonstrate seriousness by posting to news.groups. If you
expect proponents to follow guidelines, you're obliged to write them
down. Till then, I seriously expect you to follow your own guidelines as
written.

Various Board members repeatedly calling me a liar that I didn't seriously
want the RFD discussed is not conducive to congeniality. But it seems that
in practice, some guidelines apply only to me but not Board members.

I see no rules about this, only a section of a FAQ that makes this claim.
I also see something saying these are not rules, just guidelines.

I also see a &quot;rule&quot; in that section of the FAQ that says that a proponent

The latter does not follow from the former. Posting a proposal to
news.groups does not prove that it is serious. Posting a proposal to
news.groups also does not make it an RFD. &quot;Post your RFD to news.groups&quot;
is a violation of the board guidelines for group creation.
