Does anyone make a 30 cal sabot for the 50 cal muzzleloader?

I'd like to try these on small game if it is available.

Has anyone done this?

It would seem to be a "do-able" thing as the Remington Accellerator is
at .224 from a .308 (about 72% of original) and .308 is not much more
than that below .50.

Thanks.

Mark

It might be do-able, but the slow pitch rate of the rifling used in muzzle
loading rifle barrels would be insufficient to stabilize any but the very
shortest of .30 cal. projectiles. (.30 carbine maybe)
Rifling pitch rates for .30 caliber barrels run about 1" in 10". Whereas,
muzzle loading rifles for use with patched balls run 1" in 66" or 72". My TC
Renegade has a 1" in 48" pitch for stabilizing maxi balls, but it doesn't
work that well with patched balls.

Sabot for .50 Cal. rifles are typically for .44 or .45 cal. pistol bullets
that have a smaller length to diameter ratio than rifle bullets.

The 30 cal carbine bullet would be fine for rabbits, etc.

The sabot is the issue for me.

My barrel has a 1 in 26 or 1 in 28 twist. Still slow, but I wondered if
anyone had done it or if the sabots were available.

Just a way to make an all season gun out of the .50, thats all.

Thanks.

I have seen 50 cal sabots intended to load 30 cal bullets into 50 BMG
cases. I don't know if that will help are not but there it is. Look
toward the back of ShotGun News. Try jdcomponents.com
