Misc.invest.financial-plan is a *moderated* newsgroup, meaning
moderators review posts.

In general you can expect that any well-tempered post dealing with
general financial planning will be posted.  Further:

1.  Lengthy posts, cross posts, &quot;colorful&quot; language, copyrighted
material, in depth conversations in one area of financial planning and
political opinions should be sent elsewhere.  And except in flattering
terms, reference to another poster or group of people is
inappropriate.

2.  Posters should trim posts to which they respond.  &quot;Trim&quot; means
that except for a FEW lines to provide context, the previous posts are
deleted.  For more on posting etiquette, go to
http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2000/06/14/quoting

3.  Advertisements/solicitations are not welcome.  A commercial
reference in the signature lines is Ok as long as the body of the post
makes a substantive contribution.

4.  Where posts do not comply with the guidelines and the poster uses
a working email address and the Moderator has time, the moderators
will return the post with a suggestion/comment.  Posts from repeat
offenders will be deleted.

5. The moderators have adopted a fast approval process for those
posters who *consistently* comply with the guidelines.  That list is
reviewed periodically for both additions and deletions.

The developing misc.invest.financial-plan FAQ is at
http://financial-planning.algebra.com/ Posters are requested to
refer new participants to it instead of repeating earlier discussions.
Submissions to the FAQ are encouraged and should be directed to the
FAQ Editor's private email which is   mifp_faq at pacbell dot net

Lastly, the moderators cannot explain why posts occasionally appear on
some news readers and not on others.  Inquiries about same should be
directed to the affected news server.
