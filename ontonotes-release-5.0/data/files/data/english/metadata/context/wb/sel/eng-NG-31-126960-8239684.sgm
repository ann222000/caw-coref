Will Andrew Lloyd Webber be the next Simon?
By Jeannette Walls | MSNBC
July 9, 2007

Will Simon Cowell meet his match? The buzz is that another mega-
producer Brit wants to go head-to-head with Cowell on U.S. turf.

Andrew Lloyd Webber, the man behind the hit musical &quot;Phantom of the
Opera,&quot; says that he has been swamped by offers for an American TV
show and adds that he has a &quot;major announcement&quot; to make in the next
few weeks.

&quot;The thought of spending three months in the U.S. is not necessarily
what I want at my age,&quot; the 59-year-old told the London Daily Mail.
&quot;On the other hand, it's a fantastic opportunity. If it's the right
offer, I think I will say yes.&quot;

He had some unkind words for his &quot;American Idol&quot; rival: &quot;One idea is
that I should go into high schools and find young talent. ... we are
not like Simon Cowell. We nurture; we don't torture.&quot;
__ end

The only &quot;major announcement&quot; I'd like to hear from Webber would be
that he's keeping his butt in his own country and that Americans won't
be subjected to yet another annoying Brit coming over to whine about
what's wrong with American entertainment television and what &quot;he's&quot;
going to do to improve it.

I must be in the minority - but given millions upon millions of sweet

Okay okay - I'm sure Mr. Webber is a great little fella, but of all
the countries I've visited, and the people I've encountered personally
and professionally, IMO no one comes across as uppity as our British
buddies.  The French come close, but it's so obvious they're just
after our women.

&lt;gasp!&gt; Ouch! My eye!!  Watch it with that thing, will ya'?!
Hey! - and is that MY razor?!!  Good grief, how many times do I have
to say it, &quot;Get your OWN razor and stop using mine!&quot;
I swear, last time I'd just changed to a new blade when the little
woman, who just swears up and down that she doesn't use my razor,
hopped in and out of the shower - I got in, went to shave with my
brand new blade and ::::SCRAPE::::  AEEIIIIEEE!!!!..
She: &quot;Whats wrong?&quot;
Me: &quot;Did you use my razor?&quot;
&quot;No, why?&quot;
&quot;OMGod, you DID use it!!  Geeze, I just scraped off half my face, the
blade is so freakin' rough!&quot;
&quot;Oh big deal, I just used it once.&quot;
&quot;On what?&quot;
&quot;My legs.&quot;
&quot;OMGod! Your LEGS?!!  Dear, it's not how &quot;many times&quot; you use it, it's
the acreage. The acreage!! Shaving your legs once is like me shaving
my face 100 hundred times!!  Oh man, it burns.&quot;
&quot;Oh fine, I won't use it again.  Here, put some alcohol on it and be
quiet.&quot;
&quot;I think I'm blacking out.&quot;

Webber conceived the &quot;cast the next Broadway star on reality tv&quot; concept
that became &quot;Grease, You're the One That I Want&quot; here, this spring.  It
started in England with &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.  The second year was &quot;Joseph&quot;
and next season is the Brit version of &quot;Grease&quot;.

I was simply responding to dave in his generalization.  I meant no
offense to your French ancestry, my friend.  My experiences within the
French culture have not been the most positive as compared to others
than I've been exposed to, however.

&gt; Webber conceived the &quot;cast the next Broadway star on reality tv&quot; concept

&gt; started in England with &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.  The second year was &quot;Joseph&quot;

Oh yeah, how quickly I forgot that bomb of a show (IMHO) &quot;You're The
One That I Want.&quot;  On second thought Andrew, STAY HOME.  :-o

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Will Andrew Lloyd Webber be the next Simon?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By Jeannette Walls | MSNBC
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; July 9, 2007

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Will Simon Cowell meet his match? The buzz is that another mega-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; producer Brit wants to go head-to-head with Cowell on U.S. turf.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Andrew Lloyd Webber, the man behind the hit musical &quot;Phantom of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Opera,&quot; says that he has been swamped by offers for an American TV
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show and adds that he has a &quot;major announcement&quot; to make in the next
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few weeks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The thought of spending three months in the U.S. is not necessarily
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what I want at my age,&quot; the 59-year-old told the London Daily Mail.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;On the other hand, it's a fantastic opportunity. If it's the right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offer, I think I will say yes.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He had some unkind words for his &quot;American Idol&quot; rival: &quot;One idea is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I should go into high schools and find young talent. ... we are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not like Simon Cowell. We nurture; we don't torture.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; __ end

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only &quot;major announcement&quot; I'd like to hear from Webber would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he's keeping his butt in his own country and that Americans won't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be subjected to yet another annoying Brit coming over to whine about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what's wrong with American entertainment television and what &quot;he's&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to do to improve it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; HEY - I like ALW.................. back away from an angry Fille, dave
&gt; &gt; &gt; - baaaaaaaaack
&gt; &gt; &gt; away............grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  :-O

&gt; &gt; I like him as well - long as he stays over there .&lt;points with right
&gt; &gt; eyebrow towards Atlantic ocean&gt;.

&gt; &gt; Okay okay - I'm sure Mr. Webber is a great little fella, but of all
&gt; &gt; the countries I've visited, and the people I've encountered personally
&gt; &gt; and professionally, IMO no one comes across as uppity as our British
&gt; &gt; buddies.  The French come close, but it's so obvious they're just
&gt; &gt; after our women.

&gt; Disagree, none are worse than the friggin French.
">

I know what you mean - but my experience with Frenchies has typically
been their thinking they 'know' better, followed by their ignoring all
other pov's - whereas the Brits think they 'know' better, followed by
their insistance that you conform to their MO.  Plus the Frenchies get
mucho points for their awesome culinary contributions to the world -
the Brits? not so much.  :-D

&gt; level, there's something really creepy about him that I would rather
&gt; not watch on TV.  Kind of like David Foster.

I think he's derivitive on the edge of plagiaristic, but agree with you
that he's seems pretty creepy. While I've never met him personally, I
know several folk who do know him and their opinions pretty much jibe

I don't know. As I mentioned, most of the people I know who have met him
wouldn't much care or at least not any more than they would care about
something bad happening to anyone else. In other words, he is for them
nothing special. I don't care to see anyone get sick, and this would be
the feelings of most folk, I would imagine.

Nah, I mean I do, but that's not it - although sometimes she does lash
out for no reason - the other day for instance.  In from a week of
vacation, we all got ready to go take in the new 'Transformers' movie;
I paid her a compliment, and she lashed out;
Me:  &quot;Come on, Babe.  We're going to be late!&quot;
She: &quot;Almost&quot;
Me:  &quot;Come on!  The theatre's dark anyway, no one's going to even see
you!!&quot;
She:  &quot;I don't care, I'm almost done.&quot;
Me:  &quot;Fine, I'll be in the car!&quot;

At this point, I'm obviously showing gobs and gobs of patience, class,
and gentlemanly consideration, as I've not even honked the car horn,
right?  Then my little Princess comes bounding out of the castle and
like a Gazelle, is able to slide gracefully into the co-pilot seat
with the car barely, I said &quot;barely&quot;, starting to roll.

Me:  &quot;Oh my GOD!!  What did you do, pour the whole bottle of perfume
on your head?!!  Geeze!&quot;
She:  &quot;Oh, I forgot.&quot;
Me:   &quot;Babe!!  You know I get headaches and nauseous when you wear too
much perfume!  I'm cracking the windows!&quot;
She:  &quot;If you open the windows, my hair's going to get messed up!&quot;
Me:  &quot;Well if I don't, I'm going to puke all over you!!  Ooh, I like
that dress!&quot;
She:  &quot;Oh shut up.&quot;

See what I mean, Bob?  She just lashes out for no reason.
