The scope of the New American Fascism continues to grow. Fascism is evident when:
1.  Major powers pretend that the status quo is fine-when the status quo includes
murder, death camps, killing fields, torture chambers, and secret operatives to run
all of the machines of death in various modes.
2.  Environmental destruction results in epidemics of cancer and other diseases in
humans as well as animals. This destruction is also looked upon as a 'necessary evil'
for the betterment of society at large.
3. Then there are people like Stu Bykofsky who is given major print space for
suggesting we should, as an Nation, sacrifice another 3,000 souls to the god of war.

Stu Bykofsky | To save America, we need another 9/11
ONE MONTH from The Anniversary, I'm thinking another 9/11 would help America.

What kind of a sick bastard would write such a thing?

A bastard so sick of how splintered we are politically - thanks mainly to our
ineptitude in Iraq - that we have forgotten who the enemy is.

It is not Bush and it is not Hillary and it is not Daily Kos or Bill O'Reilly or
Giuliani or Barack. It is global terrorists who use Islam to justify their hideous
sins, including blowing up women and children.
. . . .

America's fabric is pulling apart like a cheap sweater.

What would sew us back together?

Another 9/11 attack.

The Golden Gate Bridge. Mount Rushmore. Chicago's Wrigley Field. The Philadelphia
subway system. The U.S. is a target-rich environment for al Qaeda.

Is there any doubt they are planning to hit us again?

If it is to be, then let it be. It will take another attack on the homeland to quell
the chattering of chipmunks and to restore America's righteous rage and singular
purpose to prevail.

I'm reviewing Angus MacKenzie's book, &quot; Secrets, The CIA's War at Home&quot;

http://politicsusaweb.com/index.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------
Still the most concise explanation of how we are who we are:
&quot;Let me give you a word of the philosophy of reform. The whole history of the progress
of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her August claims, have been
born of earnest struggle. The conflict has been  exciting, agitating, all-absorbing,
and for the time being, putting all other tumults to silence. It must do this or it
does nothing. If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor
freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the
ground, they want rain without thunder and lightening. They want the ocean without
the awful roar of its many waters.&quot;
&quot;This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may
be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing
without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will
quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong
which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with
either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the
endurance of those whom they oppress.&quot;

-------------------------------
A reasonably just and well-ordered democratic society might be possible, and . . .
justice as fairness should have a special place among the political conceptions in
its political and social world. . . [M]any are prepared to accept the conclusion
that a just and well-ordered democratic society is not possible, and even regard
it as obvious. Isn't admitting it part of growing up, part of the inevitable loss
of innocence? But is this conclusion one we can so easily accept?
The answer we give to the question of whether a just democratic society is
possible and can be stable for the right reasons affects our background thoughts
and attitudes about the world as a whole. And it affects these thoughts and
attitudes before we come to actual politics, and limits or inspires how we take
part in it. . .  If we take for granted as common knowledge that a just and
well-ordered democratic society is impossible, then the quality and tone of those
attitudes will reflect that knowledge. A cause of the fall of Weimar's
constitutional regime was that none of the traditional elites of Germany supported
its constitution or were willing to cooperate to make it work.  They no longer
believed a decent liberal parliamentary regime was possible. Its time had past.
The regime fell first to a series of authoritarian cabinet governments from 1930
to 1932. When these were increasingly weakened by their lack of popular support,
President Hindenburg was finally persuaded to turn to Hitler, who had such support
and whom conservatives thought they could control.
~ John Rawls &quot;Political Liberalism&quot; pg. lx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- --

TODAY as never before in their history Americans are enthralled
with military power. The global military supremacy that the United
States presently enjoys—and is bent on perpetuating—has become central
to our national identity. More than America's matchless material
abundance or even the effusions of its pop culture, the nation's arsenal
of high-tech weaponry and the soldiers who employ that arsenal have come
to signify who we are and what we stand for.
When it comes to war, Americans have persuaded themselves that the
United States possesses a peculiar genius. Writing in the spring of
2003, the journalist Gregg Easterbrook observed that &quot;the extent of
American military superiority has become almost impossible to
overstate.&quot; During Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forces had shown beyond
the shadow of a doubt that they were &quot;the strongest the world has ever
known,... stronger than the Wehrmacht in 1940, stronger than the legions
at the height of Roman power.&quot; Other nations trailed &quot;so far behind they
have no chance of catching up.&quot;1 The commentator Max Boot scoffed at
comparisons with the German army of World War II, hitherto &quot;the gold
standard of operational excellence.&quot; In Iraq, American military
performance had been such as to make &quot;fabled generals such as Erwin
Rommel and Heinz Guderian seem positively incompetent by comparison.&quot;2
Easterbrook and Boot concurred on the central point: on the modern
battlefield Americans had located an arena of human endeavor m which
their flair for organizing and deploying technology offered an
apparently decisive edge. As a consequence, the United States had (as
many Americans have come to believe) become masters of all things military.
Further, American political leaders have demonstrated their
intention of tapping that mastery to reshape the world in accordance
with American interests and American values. That the two are so closely
intertwined as to be indistinguishable is, of course, a proposition to
which the vast majority of Americans subscribe. Uniquely among the great
powers in all of world history, ours (we insist) is an inherently
values-based approach to policy.
Furthermore, we have it on good authority that the ideals we
espouse represent universal truths, valid for all times. American
statesmen past and present have regularly affirmed that judgment. In
doing so, they validate it and render it all but impervious to doubt.
Whatever momentary setbacks the United States might encounter, whether a
generation ago in Vietnam or more recently in Iraq, this certainty that
American values are destined to prevail imbues U.S. policy with a
distinctive grandeur. The preferred language of American statecraft is
bold, ambitious, and confident.
Reflecting such convictions, policymakers in Washington nurse (and
the majority of citizens tacitly endorse) ever more grandiose
expectations for how armed might can facilitate the inevitable triumph
of those values. In that regard, George W Bush's vow that the United
States will &quot;rid the world of evil&quot; both echoes and amplifies the large
claims of his predecessors going at least as far back as Woodrow
Wilson.3 Coming from Bush the warrior-president, the promise to make an
end to evil is a promise to destroy, to demolish, and to obliterate it.
One result of this belief that the fulfillment of America's
historic mission begins with America's destruction of the old order has
been to revive a phenomenon that C. Wright Mills in the early days of
the Cold War described as a &quot;military metaphysics&quot;—a tendency to see
international problems as military problems and to discount the
likelihood of finding a solution except through military means.4
To state the matter bluntly, Americans in our own time have fallen
prey to militarism, manifesting itself in a romanticized view of
soldiers, a tendency to see military power as the truest measure of
national greatness, and outsized expectations regarding the efficacy of
force. To a degree without precedent in U.S. history, Americans have
come to define the nation's strength and well-being in terms of military
preparedness, military action, and the fostering of (or nostalgia for)
military ideals.5

One 'sick bastard' is just the beginning of it. Why was he published
at all? Why is he still employed today? Why has this been treated as
something within the tolerable norms of commentary by his peers and the
home land security government?

Since this is an open wish for the deaths of thousands of American
citizens and since this is tolerated and even treated with respect, as it
apparently has been, by news corporations...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAoVkD_0sVM

this indicates that the system in which this is tolerated is also 'sick'
and, in fact, insane?

Look that the opening lines of his article:
=====================
&quot;ONE MONTH from The Anniversary, I'm thinking another 9/11 would help
America.

What kind of a sick bastard would write such a thing?

A bastard so sick of how splintered we are politically...&quot;
==================

He begins by substituting actually being in a 'sick' state with the
metaphorical 'sick of', using the metaphor to justify the mental condition.
This could be clever if it weren't so serious because this is an
invitation to the reader to adapt insanity as a way to met a political
end.

To convince the reader that this is a political tact, he shames them
with a jaw dropping, disjointed analogy:

&quot;We've been in Iraq for four years, but to some it seems like a century.
In contrast, Britain just pulled its soldiers out of Northern Ireland
where they had been, often being shot at, almost 40 years.&quot;

... while trivializing American deaths ...

&quot;There is the drip of daily casualties ....&quot;

The goal of this necessary insanity is apparently to...

&quot;....restore America's righteous rage and singular purpose to prevail.&quot;

This article shames Americans into thinking that they must be killed for
their own common good. That lives already lost are mere drips and what is
really needed is another gusher of American deaths. This isn't the end, he
dramatically concludes...

&quot;The unity brought by such an attack sadly won't last forever.
&quot;The first 9/11 proved that. &quot;

So we learn that insanity must be forever vigil. That Americans, sadly,
will always need to be killed en mass for their own good. Why? To keep
them killing others who hopefully, as this insanity goes, will keep
killing Americans so Americans will keep killing..... etc etc etc...

What is this but insanity?

Insanty, maybe.  Giving aid and comfort to the enemy, yep.
I thought the Bushecons had a plan for people who give aid
to terrorist - I guess that's only if you are something
other than a republiscum.  I say we call it Treason and put
a bullet in the Bykofsky brain.

&gt;From The Guardian in the UK:
">

&quot;A few days ago, a group of lawyers from western Massachusetts met
with the local congressman, Democrat John Olver. Their request was
that Olver take part in the urgent effort to impeach Bush and Cheney.
Olver responded by saying that he had no intention of doing anything
to support impeachment. He went further, offering the information that
the United States would soon attack Iran, and that these hostilities
would be followed by the imposition of a martial law regime here.

According to reports in the British press, the Cheney war party has
gained the upper hand in the secret councils of the Bush White House,
pushing aside the purported hesitations of Miss Rice, Secretary Gates,
and the NATO allies to chart a direct course towards war with Iran:

'The balance in the internal White House debate over Iran has shifted
back in favour of military action before President George Bush leaves
office in 18 months, the Guardian has learned. The shift follows an
internal review involving the White House, the Pentagon and the state
department over the last month. Although the Bush administration is in
deep trouble over Iraq, it remains focused on Iran. A well-placed
source in Washington said: &quot;Bush is not going to leave office with
Iran still in limbo.&quot; at a meeting of the White House, Pentagon and
state department last month, Mr Cheney expressed frustration at the
lack of progress and Mr Bush sided with him. &quot;The balance has tilted.
There is cause for concern,&quot; the source said this week. &quot;Cheney has
limited capital left, but if he wanted to use all his capital on this
one issue, he could still have an impact,&quot; said Patrick Cronin, the
director of studies at the International Institute for Strategic
Studies.' (&quot;Cheney pushes Bush to act on Iran; Military solution back
in favour as Rice loses out; President 'not prepared to leave conflict
unresolved'&quot;

Source: Guardian, July 16, 2007.)

Deluded supporters of the Democratic Party may soon have to throw away
their pathetic countdown clocks, those self-consoling little devices
that remind them of how much time remains until noon on January 20,
2009, the moment when it is thought that Bush will finally leave
office. These countdown clocks make no provision for the Cheney
doctrine, which calls for a new super 9/11 with weapons of mass
destruction in the US, to be used as the pretext for a nuclear attack
on Iran and for martial law at home. Those who think the Republicans
cannot hold the White House in 2008 have forgotten that neocons always
prefer a coup d'etat to an election. As Cheney told Bob Schieffer of
CBS's Face the Nation on April 15, 2007:

'The greatest threat now is &quot;a 9/11 occurring with a group of
terrorists armed not with airline tickets and box cutters, but with a
nuclear weapon in the middle of one of our own cities.&quot;'

=============

Fed attempts to bail out bankrupt Wall Street speculators while Cheney
demands staged terror attacks and then war with Iran

by Webster G. Tarpley

The disintegration of the dollar system is ultimately one of the
strongest factors driving Cheney's controllers - I refer to the George
Shultz-Rupert Murdoch faction of the US-UK ruling elite. From Cheney's
point of view, an economic depression requires drastic austerity
measures so as to drive the standard of living down even further below
its presently reduced level, with the proceeds going to the finance
oligarchs. Can these cuts in the standard of living be accomplished
under the present system? If not, what kind of dictatorship can be
used to impose them?

Here's the plan:  A staged terror attack in the US using WMD, followed
by an attack on Iran and the declaration of martial law under Bush's
many executive orders. As I pointed out on July 21 in my &quot;Cheney
Determined to Strike in US with WMD this Summer,&quot; there are many signs
that the neocon group is driving hard to implement the Cheney doctrine
this summer.

http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_2316.shtml

Cheney's plan begins to make sense when you read this statement from a
rightwing site called FamilySecurityMatters.com.  (Founding members of
its umbrella organization include Cheney, Wolfowitz and James Woolsey,
former head of the CIA.)  When the site got too much publicity among
liberals, following statement was pulled off the site, but you can
still read it at www.DemocraticUnderground.com , where it was
preserved.  That link is included at the end of the statement:

&quot;Caesar pacified Gaul by mass slaughter; he then used his successful
army to crush all political opposition at home and establish himself
as permanent ruler of ancient Rome. This brilliant action not only
ended the personal threat to Caesar, but ended the civil chaos that
was threatening anarchy in ancient Rome - thus marking the start of
the ancient Roman Empire that gave peace and prosperity to the known
world.

If President Bush copied Julius Caesar by ordering his army to empty
Iraq of Arabs and repopulate the country with Americans, he would
achieve immediate results: popularity with his military; enrichment of
America by converting an Arabian Iraq into an American Iraq (therefore
turning it from a liability to an asset); and boost American prestiege
while terrifying American enemies.

He could then follow Caesar's example and use his newfound popularity
with the military to wield military power to become the first
permanent president of America, and end the civil chaos caused by the
continually squabbling Congress and the out-of-control Supreme Court.

President Bush can fail in his duty to himself, his country, and his
God, by becoming &quot;ex-president&quot; Bush or he can become &quot;President-for-
Life&quot; Bush: the conqueror of Iraq, who brings sense to the Congress
and sanity to the Supreme Court. Then who would be able to stop Bush
from emulating Augustus Caesar and becoming ruler of the world? For
only an America united under one ruler has the power to save humanity
from the threat of a new Dark Age wrought by terrorists armed with
nuclear weapons.

http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:cnnnSRimWmcJ:www.familysecuritym...

Watch Cheney explain (in 1994) how any invasion of Iraq would result
in a quagmire:
Scroll down to the end at:
http://blog.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2007/08/the_untold_story_of_the...

Then realize how Cheney and his neocon-dominated Bush administration
must have known full well how this invasion/occupation of Iraq in 2003
was going to go, from the beginning, and they pushed on ahead anyway.

The result that they got from launching an invasion that they knew
would destabilize a volatile region, and doing so with an undermanned,
underequipped force and without the approval of the UN or most of the
countries of the world was exactly what they secretly wanted.

It gives them an excuse to wage indefinite war, to funnel money to
their cronies in the military-industrial and petroleum industries, to
always have an easy &quot;enemy&quot; to use whenever they're in need of a
&quot;booga booga!&quot; and to drain the US' coffers and run up deficits so as
to have an excuse to cut social programs.

This Cheney video seals the deal;  with regard to the question that
keeps popping up--evil or incompetent?--the Cheney video supplies an
answer.

Evil.  They did it all on purpose.  The purpose is to end democracy in
the US and take permanent control of this country.

In March 1937 Mussolini made a spectacular state visit to Libya, where
he opened a new military highway running the entire length of the
colon., He had himself declared protector of Islam and was presented
with a symbolic sword.

http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Libya/History

the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini arranged for Muslim notables
from Italian-ruled Libya to gird him with the &quot;sword of Islam&quot; during
a visit to Tripoli. &quot;Muslims may rest assured,&quot; Mussolini intoned on
that occasion, &quot;that Italy will always be the friend and protector of
Islam throughout the world.&quot; His foreign minister declared Muslim
values perfectly compatible with fascism: &quot;The Islamic world, in
accordance with its traditions, loves in the Duce the wisdom of the
statesman united to the action of the warrior.&quot;74
