Now think again the senerio of sending people to freaking MARS !

Humans SNAP.

You put...what 5-6 humans in a can an send them to Mars.....6 months
one way....??!!!!

It the human factor man...consider the human factor !!!

Oh there will be screwing....not much to do...crew screw !!!
Lots and lots of screwing.
Female/male gets tried of a particluar partner...trys someone
else...jealousy...
raging raging jealousy 1 million miles from earth.
Not much to do...jealousy burning their brains.....

Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do.
I'm half crazy, all for the love of you.
It won't be a stylish marriage.

This seems ironic to me. There are loads of solid reasons against
sending people to Mars based on cost, distortion of scientific
programs and possibilily (could I put it stronger probability) of
contamination of any Martian life. Is there life on Mars? There soon
will be. A manned expedition just cannot be totally hygenic. As I have
stated many times the raiding of scientiific programs is to me the key
argument.

Yet a specious argument about sex appears to have more force than all
of these! In fact if you have 3 men and 3 women they will sinply have
sex with each other in turn, and there will be no jealousy - at least
not until they get back to Earth. This is what regularly happens in
small communities of both people and chimpanzees. In small South Sea
islands this principle has been followed. The children were looked
after collectively. Of course on Mars medical means will be used to
ensure there are no children.

There is one aspect of the present scandal that touhces on the deeper
reasons though. Astronauts appear to thrive on buzz and do stupid
things when there is no buzz. Drawing parallels with Iraq was a good
point. When Mallory was asked "why climb Everest?" - "Because it is
there?". Mars is there - We do however need a better reason for the
best part od $100 billion.

Small South Sea Islands like, say, Pitcairn?  Try again.

The "problem" of sex on a long-duration spaceflight is probably not
too difficult to solve, but simply assuming it is going to solve
itself by means of everybody living happily and polyamorously after,
is almost certainly a recipe for disaster.  As, for that matter, is
any attempt at real-world social engineering based on the anthropology
of Margaret Mead.

One unconditional requirement for anyone planning to travel to Mars
any time in this century, is a willingness to go entirely without
sex (except the solo kind) for the duration, *even if* the entire
rest of the crew is a bunch of perfect-10 hardbodies getting it on
with one another and for some inexplicable reason leaving you out
of it.  Probably won't happen that way, but it might, and you can't
turn the ship around if it does.

Fortunately, the real world includes millions of qualified men and
women who can handle this if need be.

No I was thinking of pure Polynesian settlements. Not mixed European &amp;
Polynesian. Pitcairn has an odd history. You Americans have done a
great disservice to accurate history by making the film "Mutiny on the
Bounty". The facts are these. Lieutenant Blyth was a promising young
officier. The title "captain" simply meant he was in command
"lieutenant" was his gazetted rank at that time. Eventually he became
an admiral. Blyth was in command of what would be described today as a
research ship, it was a converted coastal ship and he did not have a
quarterdeck. He was not "free with the cat". His crew in fact was
small and trusted. He trusted Fletcher Christian. They stopped at
Tahiti. Fletcher Christian forgot he was a British sailor and was
attracted to the Polynesian women. The mutiny was due purely to his
desire to return to Tahiti.

This mixed Polynesian and European culture - Flether Christian was a
criminal but is glorified by Hollywood produced some peculiar results.
Basically on Pitcairn there is conventional Marriage BUT all unmarried
women are fair gam to anyone at the time.

If you believe that DNA influences our behaviour you must take into
account that the European men were all traitors. Blyth swore to hang
them all when he got back.

Yes but if you restrict space travel to a certain type of individual.
You may well miss the individual who will have insights. In essence
what you are implying is that you restrict space travel to the
repressed military types. If that is the case then you might as well
have machines. You are certainly NOT going to get any thinking outside
the box.

In 1831 Joseph Banks reccommended a young biologist called Charles
Darwin for the Beagle expedition. Darwin would not have been the first
choice of NASA. He was seasick, yet his discoveries are epic. Captain
Fitzroy believed implicitly in Adam and Eve and the fact that
organisms could not change.

Would NASAs forst choice have believed in Adam, Eve and Archbishop
Ussher. It was the CONVENTIONAL (and psychologically correct) thing to
believe.

OK in Science you cannot single out one discoverer - True. Wallace did
indeed produce essentially the same theory. however Darwin produced a
more complete theory than Wallace and I think progress would have been
slower though perhaps marginally if someone else had gone on the
Beagle.

If Einstein had not discovered relativity someone else would. Indeed
as far as special relativity is concerned it is surprising in view of
the results of the Michaelson Morley experiment that it was not
discovered sooner. General Relativity might not have been discovered
till much later.

No it is not a stereotype. My arumments are based on 2 propositions.

1) The more people you have the more chance there is of making an
outstanding choice  That is if the selection process if good. Looking
at Bush however it would seems that statistics breaks down. There must
be many, many people who could do a far better job than him, but were
not picked.

2) We are giving enormous power to the medics and shrinks. Far more
than they should properly have. The right answer to blobs (as I have
already said) is randomness and pseudorandomness. Prime numbers,
modular functions, Taniyama Shimura and Fermat. That is the
OUTSTANDING answer. How many shrinks would appreciate that?

We can take a specific example, the denial of sexuality has led to
distortions in Theology. Virginity is assumed to be the superior form
of motherhood. The analysis of Geza Vermes is illuminating but we are
departing from the main point.

Shrinks can determine what is and what is not investigated in the
course of a mission.

It is debatable how much was due to Bligh and how much was due to
government policy. Let us put in into another context. If you had
settled on a terraformed Mars or even Venus would you appreciate
convicts being sent there? If I were in NSW at the time I would want
full independence regardless of who the governor was. I have I think
said this before. If I were a Martian I would do what was done in

So you are a follower of Pencho Valev! I am not. Relativity, both
special and general is one of the best verified scientific theories.
The muon comes in from 20km up at just below the speed of light. Time
dilation means that it can penetrate 20km even though its half life is
only about a microsecond.

Eddington observed the movement of stars close to the Sun during an
eclipse. The amount was twice that of simple corpuscular theory and
exactly in accordance with GR. The corrections to GPS are exacly in
accord with Relativity both special and general. In fact if you have a
(gedanken) tower up to MEO and you send coherent signals the bending
of the wavefront is again what you would expect. It is just another
way of looking at Eddington.

Black holes do exist. Their existance has been confirmed by a hot
gases surrounding them. The energy of quasars and the jets they often
have is caused by spinning black holes.

Gravitational waves, the final experimental chapter of GR have not yet
been directly observed, but their presence has been inferred by a pair
of closely orbiting pulsars (or neutron stars). The change in orbit,
which incidentally won a Nobel prize, is within 10% of GR. With tidal
forces having such an effect this is really the best that can be hoped
for.

Gravitons, or gravitational waves have a spin of 2 this means that
they are quadrupolar. This makes them difficult to observe with small
baselines. LISA will be an equilateral triangle of 5 million km. As
people are doubting GR perhaps this is a confirmation of my deeply
held view that we should not be going to Mars AT ALL. Projects like
LISA are being squeezed to feed the infatuation with manned space
flight. Someone else has said I have sterotypes. Perhaps I do, but
they are accurate. Manned space flight has, despite what the NASA
establishment says, has achieved little of real scientintfic value.
The only advances are in space medicine and that is incestuous.

LISA, as I have said, is a project that has caught my imagination. It
promises real scientific advance. I uses to believe that 300,000 years
was the earliest we could ever observe. Gravitational observations
will push this right back into the first 3 minutes.

BTW - Do you accept the basic rubric of Big Bang cosmology?

There is no evidence that Darwin was psychologically unstable. Also,

He was seasick and would not have made a modern selection board.
Anyway the other point I am making is that you do not have to be
psychologically unstable to be rejected by shrinks. In fact they will
present their data along a continuum. I also think (I have given
examples) that the sort of personality that can make outstanding
progress is often not the person beloved of shrinks. That does not
necessarily make him/her psychologically unstable. It just means the S
does not get the extected answer- Randomness, prime numbers, Taniyama
Shimura, Fermat. Of course there is the dishonest response. This just
means that people are wasting their energies in glorified IQ tests.
Perhaps it might be a good idea if "hard" scientists learned a little
more sociology but that is another story.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; and more importantly, the Beagle expedition wasn't six men in a box

What I am claiming is that conformity is often confusted with
stability. The two things are completly different. There is also the
question of different psychological schools. One of the factors that
prejudices me against the medical profession is their attitude to
masturbation in the 19th century. It would weaken you, it would drive
you mad. Can such a profession really be trusted to decide who is
stable and who is not. OK it was the 19th century. Still the facts
were the same. What was the outermost planet before Pluto was
discovered? Some wit might well say that the IAU has made Neptune the
outermost planet.

Now the medical profession are claiming that sex is good for you.
Probably is, but that is not the point. Most schools would probably
agree with me about what should happen on a Mars trip, assuming it
takes place at all. Most schools now would in fact agree with me.

Empirical facts would support the notion that with sex astronauts
would be less likely to crack up or make disastrous mistakes.

For optical observations, yes.

These measurements also done in the radio range.  You don't need to wait for an
eclipse and the radio precision (from arrays) is better than telescopes.  And
when the source is a spacecraft coming very close to going behind the sun, you can
get time delay measurements as well.  These are among the most, if not *the* most,
precise measurements of GR effects.

Or you need some other kind of object and a slightly different theory of
gravity -- a possibility that can't be entirely ruled out, given some of
the problems with GR (notably its prediction of ways to build time
machines, and its apparently-fundamental incompatibility with quantum
mechanics).  None of its current competitors looks like a good bet, but
GR is unsatisfactory enough that people keep trying.

If there's one thing we have learned in the last forty years, it's that
when we find a way to observe something "out there" that we thought we

examine directly, more often than not there's a big surprise waiting.

Geometrically the universe appears to be very 'flat' - right on the
border of open and closed.  This is a natural consequence of
inflation, and quite a coincidence otherwise, so it's seen as support
for inflation (as are the spatial frequencies of the ripples in the
background radiation)

What happens next is a very good question to which no one knows the
answer.  If 'dark energy' is  some intrinisic property of space, such
that as space expands you get more of it, then the expansion
accelerates, followed by the 'big rip'.  If on the other hand the
expanding force is some more or less fixed amount, so it gets more
dilute as the universe expands, then maybe it still collapses. Or
maybe it's time varying, or depends on something else.  Almost nothing
is known about what causes this acceleration, so all predictions are
guesses at this point.

Thany you all. Thank you all the other contributors. There is only one
conclusion - we must take a look and see. We must observe
gravitational waves directly. Compatability with quantum theory has
been mentioned. In fact the String Theory based theory of supergravity
goes some way to resolving this. Simple quantum electyrodynamics does
not fit gravity - Correct.

Inflation is about 10^-38sec. A pattern of gravitational waves will
decide whether there is indeed inflation or not. Indeed the first 3
minutes contains many epochs. Mising mass ia another case in point.

I agree completely that where there is only indirect observation
surprises are in store.

As the only way forward is to take a look, the conclusion that NOBODY
should go to Mars is inescapable. LISA is scheduled for 2012. Will it
fly? Of course not. Some emergency repair job will be needed for the
manned program. Mars has alfter all geen oberved by unmanned probes.
There can be no surprises.

LISA is in fact inadaquate. I wouold like something like a
gravitational COBE

You would be surpised at how much people have "feet of clay".
Homosexuality heloped to bind Spartan societ together and was rampant
in single sex public schools (in American parlance private schools).
In a mixed boarding school activity is more normal.

Mars will be like a public school. I went to Mars College. Trouble is
that in modern times there is far less privacy and people's behaviour
is put under a microscope.

He forgot, GR predicts nothing at all.

The advance of longitude perihelion of Mercury is entirely predicted
by Newtonian Mechanics to within 43 arc seconds per 415 orbits
which is

43 / ( 415 * 360 * 60 * 60 ) x 100 = 0.00000799494273389855719%

and Einstein with his 4-figure log tables and 3-figure sliderule
could not be that accurate, besides which he left out the gravitational
pull of Venus, Earth and Jupiter, all of which would advance the
longitude of perihelion of Mercury.

So what we have here is a strongly stinking case of lying bullshit,
Ian Parker has never even observed Mercury once, neither
did the con-artist Einstein the charlatan.
Nor would Ian Parker know how to use GR,  he's a fuckwit.

It's a *somewhat* separate question.  In the old theory, with gravity the
only significant force involved, if the universe was massive enough for
gravity to eventually halt the expansion, it was also massive enough to be
"closed", with positive curvature (like a higher-dimensional sphere),
while insufficient gravity for a halt also meant "open", with negative
curvature (like a higher-dimensional saddle).  There was a lot of doubt,
then, about the exact expansion rate, the universe's mass, and its age,
although the most plausible numbers said that the *visible* mass was
inadequate to halt the expansion.

Courtesy of the work on the microwave background radiation, these numbers
are now tied tightly together, and we have much better measurements too.
To pretty fair accuracy, the universe is *exactly* at the borderline
between the two cases, with *no* large-scale curvature (which does make it
"open", as a boundary case).  This cannot possibly be coincidence, since
any deviation from flatness would grow rapidly with time -- if it's that
close to flat after 13-odd billion years, it was flat, *flat*, FLAT, *FLAT*
at its beginning.

The "cosmic inflation" theory explains this and some other suspicious
uniformities tolerably well:  very early in its history, thanks to some
odd physics, the universe briefly expanded at an immense rate, so what we
now see is a spectacularly-enlarged version of what was originally a very
small universe, too small to have much curvature or other unevenness.  The
underlying physics is still pretty iffy, but the results fit the numbers,
and the competing theories don't.  Closer examination of the microwave
background may reveal more about the details.

Oh, and the visible mass is only about 4.2% of the total mass of the
universe.  Another 20% or so is "dark matter", some sort of exotic matter
that doesn't interact with light at all (it can't be black holes or
anything so tame :-)) but does clump in response to gravity like normal
matter.  The rest -- most of the universe's mass! -- is "dark energy",
whose properties are almost totally unknown; it's a good bet that it also
supplies the pressure that is accelerating the expansion, but we can't say
for sure until we know more about it.

The simplest "dark energy" model has the dark energy, anticipated as
Einstein's "cosmological constant" fudge factor, supplied by the soup of
"virtual particles" constantly appearing and disappearing in empty space.
(This may sound bizarre, but it has measurable consequences -- e.g, the
speed of light is finite because light interacts with those particles --
and particle-physics measurements confirm its existence.)  Unfortunately,
attempts to compute the cosmological constant from virtual-particle theory
yield admittedly-rough guesses(*) that are preposterously large, over 100
orders of magnitude bigger than the largest value it could possibly have
without other observable consequences.

(* The computed value depends on properties of all types of particles,
*including* as-yet-undiscovered ones.  But current particle theory says
the properties of the different particle families are independent, so it
would be a striking coincidence for undiscovered ones to cancel out known
ones to more than 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, and 100+ is just beyond all
belief... )

The universe is a *much* stranger place than we thought twenty years ago.

What was Vulcan about? In 1846 Adams and Leverrier discovered Neptune
by predicting its position by means of the perturbations on the orbit
of Uranus. Towards the end of his life Leverrier attemted to do the
same thing for Mercury. Mercury's orbit precesses by 43" per century.
Leverrier explained this by postulating a planet between Mercury and
The Sun called Vulcan.

The correct explanation is that since space is curved the Sun is in
fact about 27km closer to Mercury than would be the case with Eucidean
geometry. This is known as the Schwartzchild radius. What is the Sun
were compressed to 27km size. Perhaps I differ from some people. The
conventional GR explanation is that it would become a black hole with
the event horizon 27km away from the center.

Needless to add this explanation is a completely satisfactory
explanation of Mercury's orbit.

Yes it does. By Newtonian laws a uniform sphere attracts as if all the
mass were concentrated at the center. In GR attraction is towards a
point some distance away from the center. In the case of the Sun this
is 27km. This is independent of how dense the Sun is. In the extreme
case where the Sun is 27km in radius we have an event horizon. This is
the way it works.

If you hae a mass at the center you have a nice elliptical Keplerian
orbit which does not precess. With a mass displaced onto a virtual
sphere you get precession.

There are indeed many issues for us, not all of them about sex. There
is also the question of responsibility. I feel that a great many of
the problems the west faces stem from an artifically prolongued
adolescence (not reciprocated in any other culture). I feel that part

responsibility for cleaning a school (this is already the case in

Careful, your description gives the impression that the universe must
be finite in spatial extent, which is not actually a constraint in
the current theory, AFAIK. Better to replace "mass" with "mass density"
above; and though the spatial separation of points of matter has
vastly increased via inflation, smoothing out any inhomogeneity,
this doesn't prevent the pre-inflationary space from having been
infinite in extent. We only have access to the light x time region
of the universe around us, so we may never know if the universe
has infinite spatial extent.

Orbitally it's a bit difficult, and at the very least, the final orbit
would have to intersect Mercury's.  And I think there are contradictory
requirements:  it would have to be big enough to show a noticeable disk

The advantage of invoking near-Earth asteroids as the objects is that they
can be quite close to the observer, and hence need not be large.

&gt;What was Vulcan about? In 1846 Adams and Leverrier discovered Neptune

&gt;of Uranus. Towards the end of his life Leverrier attemted to do the
&gt;same thing for Mercury. Mercury's orbit precesses by 43&quot; per century.
&gt;Leverrier explained this by postulating a planet between Mercury and
&gt;The Sun called Vulcan... [but GR explains the precession].

Uh, no, that's by no means the full story.

People were looking for intra-Mercurian planets considerably before
Leverrier's 1860 announcement.  The discovery of Uranus in 1781
established that there were more planets than the classical naked-eye
ones(*), so it was not unreasonable that there might be undiscovered
planets inside Mercury's orbit as well as outside Saturn's.  For example,
Schwabe discovered the sunspot cycle while planet-hunting, starting in
1826.

(* Uranus actually is a naked-eye object, given good eyes and dark skies,
but was not noticed in classical times because it's faint and moves quite
slowly. )

Moreover, Leverrier initially proposed that the unknown mass disturbing
Mercury's orbit might be an intra-Mercurian *asteroid belt* rather than a
single planet, probably because he knew that Herrick had already made a
systematic search for intra-Mercurian planets (in response to the
discovery of Neptune) and had found none.

(Indeed, the object that Lescarbault observed in transit -- which
Leverrier eventually named Vulcan -- was clearly too small to account for
Mercury's orbit by itself, although it was about right to be the largest
object in Leverrier's hypothetical asteroid belt.)

Leverrier's theoretical support for intra-Mercurian object(s) strengthened
interest in the possibility, yes, but it wasn't the sole reason that
people went looking for them.

(Reference:  Willy Ley's "Watchers of the Skies".)

Oh, and incidentally, Mercury's orbit precesses 5599.7 arcseconds per
century -- the 43 arcseconds in question is not the precession rate, but
the (then) *unexplained* part of the precession rate.  Most of the
precession is caused by well-understood factors like perturbations by the
other planets.  The minuteness of the discrepancy against a background of
large known causes, plus the difficulty of getting good observations of
Mercury at all, is why it took someone of Leverrier's talents to establish
that the discrepancy was real and beyond easy explanation.

(Reference:  Skinner's "Relativity for Scientists and Engineers".)

&gt;Thany you all. Thank you all the other contributors. There is only one
&gt;conclusion - we must take a look and see. We must observe
&gt;gravitational waves directly.

Yes, it's well worth doing, and efforts in that direction are already
underway, e.g. LIGO.

&gt;As the only way forward is to take a look, the conclusion that NOBODY
&gt;should go to Mars is inescapable.

Um, what are you talking about?  There are currently *no* plans to send
anyone to Mars.  Bush's "Vision for Space Exploration" marching orders to
NASA include Mars only as a far-distant long-term goal, not as something
that significant money will be spent on any time soon.  (VSE's near-term
focus is on shuttle replacement, and its medium-term goal is the Moon.)

&gt;LISA is scheduled for 2012. Will it fly? Of course not.
">

If it doesn't, that's likely to have more to do with the difficulty of
doing LISA than with competition for funds from manned spaceflight.  LISA
is a large, complex, technologically-challenging mission, which is almost
certain to hit cost overruns and delays just because it's *hard*.

Indeed, looking at current status, there's just no way that LISA will fly
in 2012, the *original* target date -- it would appear that you're a bit
behind the news.  ESA's LISA Pathfinder mission, an essential preliminary
which will test some of the key LISA technologies in space, is itself
nearly two years behind schedule -- some technology that they thought was
off-the-shelf wasn't -- and probably won't launch until 2010.  That puts
LISA launch in 2014-2015 at the earliest, I'd say, and indeed, 2017 seems
to be the current target for when LISA will actually be in position,
checked out, and observing.
