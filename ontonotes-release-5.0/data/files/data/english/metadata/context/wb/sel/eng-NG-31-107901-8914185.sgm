What his purpose in life is is unknown, but he is reminiscent of the
Comte de Saint-Germain in some ways.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Let me remind you who the famous Comte de Saint-Germain was. Of
course, his name was not Saint-Germain and he was not a count. His
real identity is unknown; what little can be discovered of his back
trail leads to Poland, Germany, and Portugal, but it is not known in
which country he was born. Neither is it known precisely what his
racket was, for, unlike Casanova, he was not an ordinary swindler. One
theory is that he was an espionage agent in the pay of Catherine the
Great of Russia.

At all events, he was supplied with evidently unlimited funds from
some mysterious source, and when he turned up in Paris in 1748 as the
Comte de Saint-Germain, he quickly became one of the most influential
men in France, an adviser to Louis XV, and the darling of all the
&quot;intellectuals.&quot;

He had many charms. He was, for example, the perfect dinner guest. For
one thing, he never ate anything at dinner. He had, you see, made a
great scientific discovery and extracted the vital essence directly
from the atmosphere. For another thing, he was such an interesting
conversationalist; he could, for example, tell you all about the
Crucifixion of Christ, at which he had been present. He was, you see,
2,000 years old, and explained that he was so well preserved for his
age because, in addition to living on air, he took every 20 years a
spoonful of colorless liquid that rejuvenated him for 20 years. Of
course, the &quot;intellectuals&quot; had no difficulty in believing such
things.

The Comte de Saint-Germain had quite a career, but finally in 1784,
presumably at the ripe old age of 2000-plus, he died and was buried in
Schleswig.

So you will see why I was a little startled when the lady told me that
her society was headed by an individual who for 150 years had been in
the good earth of Schleswig sprouting -- well, not daisies, I'm sure,
but perhaps poison ivy. So I ventured to suggest that the Comte de
Saint-Germain was probably in no condition to think Big Thoughts.&quot;&lt;&lt;

Interesting but we have seen it before, Bratwig. What has it to do
with anything? -- AJ

Bret... May I ask you a question?  Yesterday I posted a question about
electronic reference books. You chastised me for being off-topic. The NG was
inappropriate for that non-tube post.  May I ask if you have special
privileges that allow you to post topics like &quot;The defective ....?&quot;  Just
asking for a clarification on the rules. Thank you.

Cordially,
west

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this most
important matter.

I am not a Net Cop and don't care what anyone posts except for the
bandwidth hogging &quot;MI5 Persecution&quot; type shit.

I did not &quot;chastise&quot; you.

All I said was that you were far more likely to get the information
you seek on another NG, and that this one would do you little good
because few here are into current IC applications.

And I was right-the same question does come up on sci.electronics
groups fairly often and does get some very good answers.  I Googled
and got a bunch.
