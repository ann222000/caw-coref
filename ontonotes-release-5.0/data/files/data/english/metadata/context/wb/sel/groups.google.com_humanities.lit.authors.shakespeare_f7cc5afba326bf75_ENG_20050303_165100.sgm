(quote, excerpts)

Emmerich's first feature under the Reel Machine label will be &quot;Soul of
the Age,&quot; a political thriller set in Elizabethan England that explores
the controversial theory that William Shakespeare was not the author of
his famous plays.

&quot;I am convinced that the William Shakespeare we know was a fraud,&quot;
Emmerich said, &quot;that he almost certainly did not write the Shakespeare
plays.&quot;

He plans to begin shooting &quot;Soul&quot; in England in the fall with an
all-British cast.

&quot;This will be a chance for me to show people I can work with actors,
that I can direct drama,&quot; he said.

Emmerich said he will use substantial special effects in the film --
including re-creating the entire city of London in the 17th century.

The project is a major departure from his previous films. In addition
to &quot;Independence Day&quot; and last summer's &quot;The Day After Tomorrow,&quot;
Emmerich directed &quot;Godzilla,&quot;&quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Universal Soldier.&quot;

This is the same man who thinks that evil space aliens possessing

I take it, then, that you never saw ID4. Frankly, neither did I. But the
ending, in which Our Heroes defeat the Slimy Space Invaders by using a
MacOS virus to crash their systems, is infamous among computer programmers.

Indeed, Emmerich is notorious for movies that make educated people bang
their heads against the wall. &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;. &quot;The Patriot&quot;.
&quot;Stargate&quot; (the subsequent TV series is pretty decent, but the original
movie is pretty much pure dumbth. Heck, he couldn't even do a decent
remake of &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

If you were fair, you would admit that Professor Webb's posts are
always models of appropriateness, if slightly abstract to the point of
occasionally seeming to assume that all bindings of concrete to general
terms are equally apropos, not unsurprising in one of his profession.
Do they always advance the discussion in the way they seem to intend?
Perhaps not. But they cannot really be faulted for failing to
accomplish what someone with only his training could not have been
trained to do (in other words, to be as clever with language as you and
e.g. Mr. Fryzer are). In any event, it's pretty obvious this one was
only a pleasantry, and to read more into it would be a mistake, much
less to read into it something &quot;suspicious.&quot; Next you'll be trying to
use deconstruction on them, I suppose.

Pure research is not supposed to have any application (scientists and
mathematicians are primarily interested in what is true, what will
advance knowledge of the subject matter studied by each discipline, not
in how new knowledge will affect new technology); doubtless that less
than one percent is open to criticism on precisely those grounds.

Anyway, I feel sure that what is in fact being done has &quot;application&quot;
in the sense that it meets the needs of those who pay the bills
(society and in particular the university community as a whole), even
if it's to be admitted that most of what pure mathematicians do can't
be connected directly to any publicly useful inventions at all.

Have you ever written a straightforward sentence?

Does everything your write have to be choked with
manipulative verbiage?

I am being specific. I walked into a room where the
radio was on and I heard part of a short interview
that featured a philosopher of mathematics from Harvard
University. He sounded like he was in his thirties.

The sink ran over, the cat vomited, the smoke alarm
went off--I didn't hear all of the interview.

The sentence that you quoted above is quite straightforward, although
it presupposes a literate reader with a modest command of English.

&quot;A philosopher of mathematics from Harvard&quot; is not very specific,

locutions (&quot;it's on record that...,&quot; etc.).

What an extraordinary sequence of misfortunes! Are there any causal
