David,

Over the last years you and I have often come down on different sides of
an issue - we tend to look at the world through different colored
lenses.

Not this time!

Well said and thank you for the passion and the tone of this e-mail.

Warmest regards,

Len Lawrence

Len and Dan really bring home the point that we need to be aware of the
poor in the Jewish community. We should be proud of the efforts of
enlightened funeral directors and we should support them in educating
other funeral directors.

There is a fundamental difference between individuals and business
giving charity to a poor person, and the community taking ongoing
responsibility to cover or reduce the costs of funeral and burial.

Look at some of the historic Jewish precedents, especially in the field
of funeral and burial.

Start with Rabbi Hamnuna, who placed a town under a ban because he saw
people working during a funeral. When told there was a Chevra Kadisha in

town, he lifted the ban. Why? Because the people of the town, as a
group, had taken on the communal responsibility and created a society to

handle the tasks related to burial. The key is for the community to
recognize its responsibility, and to create societies or institutions to

address those needs.

Look at Rabbi Gamliel. When poor people were unable to afford the
expense of a funeral and burial, he did not beg for a reduced price
funeral. Instead he mandated funerals and burials at lower cost for
everyone so poor people would not be ashamed.

Look at Rabbi Jacob Rader Marcus' book Sickcare in the German Ghetto.
Here we see communities that confronted issues of sickness, dying,
death, and mourning. They not only created a Chevra Kadisha, and a
cemetery, but societies to visit the sick which evolved in the Jewish
hospital model.

It really hurts when Len describes the inadequate performance of a
Jewish Family Services or Federation that does not support the Jewish
poor with funeral or burial assistance. This is a wake up call for every

Chevra Kadisha. This is a call to action. Yes, we all have telephones.
Let's use them.

Every Chevra Kadisha should find out if there is a Free Burial Society
in their community. Every Chevra Kadisha should call their Federation
and Jewish Family Services agency and find out just what they do for
indigent funeral or burial. Ask questions. Is there a governing board or

advisory committee? Is there a fund? Is it publicized? Can the Chevra
Kadisha contribute to that fund?

Rabbi Hamnuna and Rabbi Gamliel's analysis and directives have been
preserved for thousands of years. They were speaking to us. It is
important that we listen, and act.

After you place those calls, write to the list and tell us what you
found.
