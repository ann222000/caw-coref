THE FUTURE OF WORDPERFECT
I've been a hardcore WordPerfect user since 1989 so I took note when it was announced today that Vector Capital is taking over Corel Corp . (the current owner of WordPerfect). I've tried other word processors off and on over the years (including the biggies). But I always end up back at WordPerfect because it is so powerful and flexible. However, Corel has a rocky history and hasn't had the strength to confront Microsoft Word. So hopefully Vector will either sell WordPerfect to someone who can do it right or will capitalize the product itself.
