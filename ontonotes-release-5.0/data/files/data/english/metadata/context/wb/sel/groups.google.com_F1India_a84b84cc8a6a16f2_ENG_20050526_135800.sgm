&quot;Powering along the start-finish straight at the Nürburgring you reach
290km/h in sixth gear, before braking hard for the entrance to the
Mercedes Arena, which is a tight right hand hairpin that sees you drop
into first gear. This is immediately followed by a long 180-degree left
hander and a 90-degree right hander, which swings you back round onto
the straight.&quot;

&quot;Powering up through the gears on the approach to the fast left of
Valvoline Kurve, you brake from speeds of 265km/h in fifth gear to
177km/h in third gear to negotiate the sweeping bend. A short burst on
the throttle takes you to the second gear Ford Kurve, this bumpy right
hander is taken at 104km/h. On the exit you accelerate downhill up to
297km/h in sixth gear as you approach the hairpin, which is taken at
96km/h in second.&quot;

&quot;It is crucial to take a good line through the hairpin so that you can
push hard and early on the throttle on the exit. Up the hill towards
the Michelin Kurve you reach speeds of 281km/h, lifting slightly for
the left-right flick of the chicane, before braking hard for Michelin,
dropping down to 136km/h in third for the 90-degree left-hander.&quot;

&quot;A similar right-hander, which is one of the most crucial corners on
the circuit, follows and takes you onto the back straight. Taken
flat-out, the fast, sweeping straight, with a slight right kink, sees
you reach 300km/h in seventh gear as you approach the Veedol-S chicane,
the main overtaking opportunity at the circuit. This is another tough
braking point as you drop from the highest speed at the Nürburgring to
96km/h in second to negotiate the chicane where you have to drive
aggressively over the curbs in order to carry the speed through the
corner.&quot;

&quot;Accelerating out, a short burst on the throttle sees you reach 225km/h
in fourth before dabbing the brakes for the final corner. Taken at
120km/h and using the whole curb as you exit, the right-hander flicks
you back onto the start-finish straight to begin another lap.&quot;
