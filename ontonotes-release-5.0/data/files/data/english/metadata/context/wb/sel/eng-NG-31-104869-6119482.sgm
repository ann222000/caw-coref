Ok everyone- our Lori sent this information so we can help!! The Honor Program is on the verge of cancellation-and this program is successful! Why the powers that be would want to cancel a program that is postive and has beneficial effects is really beyond me. I am asking you all to get invloved, print these letters out and mail them in- if you dont have the extra postage- we can find the email address and fax numbers..Judge Henderson does not have an email address that I am aware of...So, come on-lets do this for our prisoners...they NEED US TO SPEAK UP FOR THEM!!  Lets start this New Year off right and on a postive note!!

ps- should the attachment not come through for those on digest- please email me..and I will send the information directly to you!!
thank you all!!

Hi Carol,

My penpal from CSP_LAC just sent me a package
with letters to send to various officials (6 to be exact) regarding the closure
of the Honor Yard along with the threat of being transferred all over the state
if the yard is converted to a receiving yard.

He has asked me to send these letters and also
to pass them on to everyone to send.  The purpose is to make the Honor Yard
part of the Title 15.  It doesn't have any protection to exist since it
isn't official.

Oddly enough, they have created an Honor Unit on
C yard of CCWF.  That is probably easier because it isn't taking up a whole
yard, just one unit on the yard.

The files did not come through- I copied and pasted them here...I do apologize, I have been having issues with my email~

YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED

Unless our state representatives have the Honor Program
placed in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15.  If you doubt this, then you must be unaware
prison administrators have been stating publicly that this whole prison will be
converted to reception, with “A” yard converted after “C” yard.

Yes, some guys will kid themselves they will be able to stay
here anyway (not unless they’re Level III).
Yes, the conversion will take awhile.
Yes, a lot of guys in prison like to pretend everything is going to be
okay, that they don’t have to do much to help themselves.  But we have
started something good here, and we have
won important support in Sacramento.  It is now time to finish the job.  We have approximately 90 days to make the
Honor Program a permanent programming alternative for those of us that would
like it to succeed.  Very strong
arguments are being made in Sacramento
on our behalf.  Right now is the time to
show the politicians there is active public support for the Honor Program.  It is time to flood Sacramento with letters endorsing the Honor
Program’s inclusion in the Title 15.

Over the next 60 days have your families and friends copy
and send any (or all) of the attached letters.
All of them are simple and direct, because the discussion has already
been defined and we do not want to muddy the message.  It is true most of the staff do not support
the Honor Program.  But did you really
think they were going to fight your battle for you?  Lets get everyone we know to fill the listed
politicians (and others) mailboxes with letters of support, by the time the new
legislative session starts.

The alternative is to stick our heads in the sand and wait
to be transferred to a less desirable program.
Everything worthwhile requires effort.
Have the heart to fight this battle.

RE:     SUPPORT FOR THE HONOR PROGRAM AT CSP-LAC

Dear Mr. Cate:

I am writing this letter to encourage you to publicly
support the Honor Program at the California
State Prison-Los
Angeles County, in Lancaster.  I am also writing to seek your active
intervention to protect the progress made in this program

The Honor Program saves money, creates a safer environment
for prisoners and staff, and helps start the rehabilitation process that is
needed to bring fundamental reform to the prison system.

My (son/brother/husband/father/friend) is incarcerated in
the Honor Program, and he tells me that the staff still doesn’t support the
program.  In fact, I am told that the Department
of Corrections and Rehabilitation plans to end the program in favor of
something called Behavior Modification Units.
Isn’t it time to investigate why the Department continues to refuse to
adopt actual rehabilitative policies?

I believe canceling the Honor Program would be a serious
mistake, and would be another blow to the reform so desperately needed.  Instead of this retreat, I suggest placing
the Honor Program into the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, and providing
the kinds of direct support necessary to make the program grow and
prosper.  I believe this would radically
transform the prison system in the ways necessary to fix what is clearly
broken.  I urge you to publicly call for
this to occur.

Thank you for your attention to these matters.

Sincerely,

(Your name)
