This article is so important, it needs to be reposted and passed on,so
that more and more people around the world will come to know the truth
about the ZYD COLLABORATION with nazis.
It will not be surprising to find after even more research, that even
more incidents of ZHID/Nazi COLLABORATION happened!!

Even about the HOLOHOAX, based on zyd lies!!

More and more truth is coming out, about the perfidious ZYD
COLLABORATION with the nazis!!

Surely this should cause those countries paying tribute dollars to the
ZYDS, to consider demanding repayment?

&gt;&gt;&gt;51 Documents: Zionist Collaboration With the Nazis
&gt;&gt;&gt;September 2004, page 86
&gt;&gt;&gt;Book Review
&gt;&gt;&gt;51 Documents: Zionist Collaboration With the Nazis
&gt;&gt;&gt;By Lenni Brenner, ed. Barricade Books, 2002, 342 pp. List:$22; AET:
&gt;&gt;&gt;$15.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Reviewed by Sara Powell
&gt;&gt;&gt;It's no secret that Zionism embraced political expediency to
advance
&gt;&gt;&gt;the cause of carving Eretz-Israel from the land of its native
&gt;&gt;&gt;inhabitants. In his 1983 book, Zionism in the Age of the Dictators,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Lenni Brenner shows that 20th century Zionists observed shockingly
few
&gt;&gt;&gt;limits to that expediency. Not surprisingly, the book received
little
&gt;&gt;&gt;coverage in the American media.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, in 51 Documents, Brenner has compiled a wide variety of
letters,
&gt;&gt;&gt;statements, articles, and judgements?some of which appeared in his
&gt;&gt;&gt;earlier  book?by a broad array of activists and authors, that
&gt;&gt;&gt;documents Zionist cooperration with the Nazis.
&gt;&gt;&gt;On the face of it, the notion seems absurd. However, Brenner
&gt;&gt;&gt;presents the case?made in many Zionists? own words?that the Nazi
&gt;&gt;&gt;agenda of expelling the Jews from Germany fit nicely with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Zionist plan for enticing those Jews into settling in Palestine and
&gt;&gt;&gt;creating a new Jewish nation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;In addition to introductory and concluding chapters, the book is
&gt;&gt;&gt;organized into five sections which lead the reader through early,
&gt;&gt;&gt;pre-Zionist documents; pre-Holocaust ideological factions; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Holocaust era itself; and a chapter on the Stern Gang and the
">

Nazis.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Readers should note that a few documents are not indicative of
&gt;&gt;&gt;collaboration in and of themselves, but provide the background to
&gt;&gt;&gt;others written in response.
&gt;&gt;&gt;These latter do indicate levels of collaboration between Zionists
and
&gt;&gt;&gt;fascists, both the Nazis in Germany, and those in Mussolini's
Italy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Brenner's brief explanatory notes at the beginning of each document
&gt;&gt;&gt;are helpful, as are the glossary and index.
&gt;&gt;&gt;51 Documents assumes a certain knowledge of Zionist history, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;requires a close reading and some deconstructive efforts on the
part
&gt;&gt;&gt;of the reader. Those willing to commit the time and effort,
however,
&gt;&gt;&gt;are rewarded with some stunning revelations. The reason some
&gt;&gt;&gt;Zionists eschewed the boycott against Hitler?s Germany, for
instance, is
&gt;&gt;&gt;that they had a financial deal?Ha'avara?with Germany allowing Jews
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;exchange their wealth for goods to be exported to Palestine at less
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;a loss, as an incentive to emigrate. Those wondering why Zionists
&gt;&gt;&gt;today are so organized and experienced in their public relations
&gt;&gt;&gt;efforts discover that these battles have been fought before.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, the section on Nazi and Zionist understandings of
'nationality'
&gt;&gt;&gt;versus citizenship reveals how German and Israeli practices are
based on
&gt;&gt;&gt;the same concept.
&gt;&gt;&gt;51 Documents also sheds a whole new light on the term Holocaust
&gt;&gt;&gt;guilt, frequently understood to mean Western, non-Jewish guilt for
&gt;&gt;&gt;not acting against the Holocaust earlier. However, these documents
&gt;&gt;&gt;make it clear that Holocaust guilt began with those Zionists who
&gt;&gt;&gt;made the undoubtedly difficult, but politically expedient choice to
&gt;&gt;&gt;place Eretz-Israel at the top of their priorities, above the lives
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;their threatened European brethren.
&gt;&gt;&gt;From a Zionist Executive Meeting speech by Yitzhak Gruenbaum on
&gt;&gt;&gt;Feb. 18, 1943:
&gt;&gt;&gt;And when some asked me: Can't you give money from Keren Ha Yesod
&gt;&gt;&gt;(Palestine Foundation Fund) to save Jews in the Diaspora? I said:
&gt;&gt;&gt;?No!  And again I say no....And, because of these things, people
&gt;&gt;&gt;called me an anti-Semite, and concluded that I'm guilty, for the
fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;that we don't give ourselves completely to rescue actions.(p. 211)
&gt;&gt;&gt;However difficult it may be, the reader must confront some rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;disturbing conclusions. The most unsettling realization for this
&gt;&gt;&gt;reviewer is that pre-Holocaust Zionists were able to politically
&gt;&gt;&gt;align themselves with the Nazis because both groups fundamentally
saw
&gt;&gt;&gt;race as an important dividing line?and, moreover, were determined
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;keep it that way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;From Vladimir Jabotinsky to Albert Einstein,'assimilation' of Jews
&gt;&gt;&gt;into the societies in which they lived was not an acceptable
option.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Rather, Jewish nationalism required equality on a national level,
not
&gt;&gt;&gt;a personal one. As Jabotinsky explained, 'It is impossible for a
man
&gt;&gt;&gt;to become assimilated with people whose blood is different from his
&gt;&gt;&gt;own'
&gt;&gt;&gt;(p. 10); in Einstein?s words, ?Palestine is first and foremost not
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;refuge for East European Jews, but the incarnation of a reawakening
&gt;&gt;&gt;sense of national solidarity? (p. 29).
&gt;&gt;&gt;Finally, David Yisraeli, a member of the STERN  GANG, , wrote the
&gt;&gt;&gt;following in late 1940, as part of a proposal to Hitler. It was
&gt;&gt;&gt;delivered in 1941 to two German diplomats in Lebanon.
&gt;&gt;&gt;3. The establishment of the historic Jewish state on a national and
&gt;&gt;&gt;totalitarian basis, bound by a treaty with the German Reich, would
be
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the interest of a maintained and strengthened future German
&gt;&gt;&gt;position of power in the Near East (p. 301).
&gt;&gt;&gt;Such beliefs, of course, were not limited to Nazis and Zionists.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Scientific and philosophical constructs of the day considered such
&gt;&gt;&gt;differentiation legitimate, and ideas of racial difference?and,
&gt;&gt;&gt;therefore, racial supremacy?were practiced around the world.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Another disturbing conclusion a reader must inevitably face is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;Zionists learned both tactical and political lessons from the Nazis
&gt;&gt;&gt;and that, even today, these lessons are applied to further the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Zionist cause. Although most likely known to potential readers of
this
&gt;&gt;&gt;book,another disturbing element is the cover-up of the less than
savory
&gt;&gt;&gt;roles of current Israeli leaders, including former prime ministers,
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the terrorist Irgun and Stern Gang just before, during, and after
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Holocaust. Likewise, the succumbing of various U.S. officials to
&gt;&gt;&gt;Zionist pressure is a familiar, but distressing, story.
&gt;&gt;&gt;51 Documents seems to represent a renewed attempt by Brenner to
&gt;&gt;&gt;bring information regarding Zionist collaboration with the Nazis to
U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt;supporters of Israel, as well as to Jews and Muslims, in order to
&gt;&gt;&gt;expand dialogue with knowledge, and save lives 'both Palestinian
&gt;&gt;&gt;and Israeli' in the process. Readers of 51 Documents will find it
&gt;&gt;&gt;difficult not to remove the rose colored glasses that so many seem
to wear
&gt;&gt;&gt;when examining Zionism.

# 5                           The Kastner Case
ZHID  KOLABORACI WITH EICHMANN &amp; NAZIS!!
Extracted from a pamphlet issued by BAZO-PS - 1981

Introduction

The most notorious case of Nazi-Zionist collaboration is
that involving Rudolf Kastner.

Most Jewish people have never heard of Rudolf Kastner.
Those who have, are generally under the impression that
there is some &quot;controversy&quot; about negotiations he undertook
for &quot;the purchase of Jewish lives for money and military
equipment,&quot; but that he was &quot;fully rehabilitated&quot; by the
Supreme Court of Israel.

The Accusations

Briefly, the accusations against Kastner are as follows:

Dr. Rudolf Verba, a Doctor of Science now serving at the
British Medical Research Council, was one of the few
escapees from Auschwitz. In his memoirs published in
February, 1961, in the London Daily Herald, he wrote:

I am a Jew. In spite of that - indeed because of that -
I accuse certain Jewish leaders of one of the most ghastly
deeds of the war.

This small group of quislings knew what was happening to
their brethren in Hitler's gas chambers and bought their
own lives with the price of silence.

Among them was Dr. Kastner, leader of the council which spoke
for all Jews in Hungary.
While I was prisoner number 44070 at Auschwitz - the number is
still on my arm - I compiled careful statistics of the
exterminations...I took these terrible statistics with me
when I escaped in 1944 and I was able to give Hungarian
Zionist leaders three weeks notice that Eichmann planned
to send a million of their Jews to his gas chambers...
Kastner went to Eichmann and told him, &quot;I know of your plans;
spare some Jews of my choice and I shall keep quiet.&quot;

Eichmann not only agreed, but dressed Kastner up in S.S.
uniform and took him to Belsen to trace some of his friends.

Nor did the sordid bargaining end there.

Kastner paid Eichmann several thousand dollars. With this
little fortune, Eichmann was able to buy his way to freedom
when Germany collapsed, to set himself up in the Argentine...
(Ben Hecht, Perfidy, pp 261-2)

These accusations are confirmed by the &quot;Eichmann Confessions&quot;
published in Life magazine, 28 November and 5 December 1960:

&quot;I resolved to show how well a job could be done when the
commander stands 100% behind it. By shipping the Jews off
in a lightning operation, I wanted to set an example for
future campaigns elsewhere...In obedience to Himmler's
directive I now concentrated on negotiations with the Jewish
political officials in Budapest...Among them, Dr. Rudolph Kastner,
authorized representative of the Zionist Movement.

This Dr. Kastner was a young man about my age, an ice-cold
lawyer and a fanatical Zionist. He agreed to help keep the
Jews from resisting deportation - and even keep order in the
collection camps - if I could close my eyes and let a few
hundred or a few thousand young Jews emigrate illegally to
Palestine. It was a good bargain. For keeping order in the
camps, the price...was not too high for me.

&quot;...We trusted each other perfectly. When he was with me,
Kastner smoked cigarets as though he were in a coffeehouse.
While we talked he would smoke one aromatic cigaret after
another, taking them from a silver case and lighting them
with a silver lighter. With his great polish and reserve
he would have made an ideal Gestapo officer himself.

&quot;Dr. Kastner's main concern was to make it possible for
a select group of Hungarian Jews to emigrate to Palestune...

&quot;As a matter of fact, there was a very strong similarity
between our attitudes in the S.S. and the viewpoint of these
immensely idealistic Zionist leaders....I believe that Kastner
would have sacrificed a thousand or a hundred thousand of his
blood to achieve his political goal...
'You can have the others', he would say, 'but let me have
this group here'. And because Kastner rendered us a great
service by helping keep the deportation camps peaceful, I
would let his groups escape. After all, I was not
concerned with small groups of a thousand or so Jews...
That was the 'gentleman's agreement' I had with Kastner.&quot;
(Hecht, Ibid., pp.260-61)

Quite clearly these accusations, whether true or false,
do not relate merely to &quot;the purchase of Jewish lives for
money and military equipment.&quot;

Are the accusations against Kastner true?
According to the Government of Israel, they are a lie.
When Malchiel Greenwald, a strongly pro-Zionist Israeli
citizen published these accusations against Kastner, the
Israeli Government did rather more  than demand that his
views should not be broadcast. Because a prominent Zionist
official Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the Ministry of
Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General
of the State of Israel prosecuted Greenwald for criminal libel.

The Kastner Case

Introduction

Rather than answer every complaint in the same detail, we are taking
up the issue which the VJBD has declared to be the most offensive of
all and will show that on this question 'The documentation available
is overwhelming and its message is thundering&quot;, just as Palestine
Speaks claimed in one of the extracts complained about by the VJBD.

Since the accusation of direct Zionist cooperation and assistance in
the extermination of hundreds of thousands of Jewish people, and the
accusation that this flowed logically from shared aims, are clearly
the most 'extreme' and 'offensive' accusations of Nazi-Zionist
collaboration broadcast on 3CR programs, we will deal with this first,
and in greater detail.

Since the 'Kastner case' is the subject of most of the broadcasts
concerning collaboration which have been specifically complained
about, we shall go into this in greatest detail, and have put some
books in as evidence about it. Having answered the VJBD where its
case appears strongest, and on the points to which it has given
greatest emphasis,we hope it may become apparent to the Tribunal that
things are not quite what they may have appeared before this inquiry
began.

The most notorious case of Nazi-Zionist collaboration is that
involving Rudolf Kastner.

Most Jewish people in Australia have never heard of Rudolf Kastner.
Those who have, are generally under the impression that there is some
'controversy' about negotiations he undertook for 'the purchase of
Jewish lives for money and military equipment', but that he was 'fully
ehabilitated' by the Supreme Court of Israel.

That is exactly the line taken by Dr. John Foster, the Victorian
Jewish Board of Deputies expert witness, in his evidence condemning
3CR for anti-semitism.

It is quite clear from this evidence, that Dr. Foster does not know
anything at all about the Kastner case, since he does not even know
what Kastner was accused of.

This may not be his fault however, since one cannot read an accurate
account of the Kastner case in any of the widely available works
dealing with the Holocaust, either in bookshops or libraries. Apart
from 3CR, the suppression of information has been so complete, that
even an expert like Dr. Foster, specifically asked to give evidence on
the matter, has been unable to find out what it is all about.

The Accusations
----------------
Briefly, the accusations against Kastner are as follows:

&quot;Dr. Rudolf Verba, a Doctor of Science now serving at the British
Medical Research Council, was one of the few escapees from Auschwitz.
In his memoirs published in February, 1961, in the London Daily

Jews...
That was the 'gentleman's agreement' I had with Kastner&quot; (Hecht, ibid,
p.26ö-61)

Quite clearly these accusations, whether true or false, do not relate
merely to 'the purchase of Jewish lives for money and military
equipment', as Dr. Foster imagines, and the term 'collaboration' is
the term that would apply. It seems unlikely that if Dr. Foster had
known what the accusation actually was, he would have condemned 3CR
saying 'In these circumstances, to talk of collaboration is malicious
and absurd'.

Are the accusations against Kastner true?

According to the Government of Israel, they are a lie. When Malchiel
Greenwald, a strongly pro-Zionist Israeli citizen published these
accusations against Kastner, the Israeli Government did rather more
than demand that his views should not be broadcast. Because a
prominent Zionist official (Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the
Ministry of Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General of
the State of Israel prosecuted Greenwald for criminal libel.

The Verdict
------------
Let the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi in Israel's District Court of
Jerusalem speak for itself, given in criminal case No. 124 of 1953.
The Attorney General v. Malchiel Greenwald. This material should be
studied carefully, since a substantial extract from it, broadcast on
3CR, has been complained about by the VJBD as allegedly offensive to
the Jewish community, likely to promote anti-semitism, likely to
promote racism, in bad taste and contrary to common sense.

It is the actual words used that are the subject of the Board's
complaint, not the manner of their representation by 3CR. Presumably
the Board itself was not aware just whose words they were when it made
its' complaint, which shows how complete suppression of information
can backfire on the censors themselves.

Here then are excerpts from the verdict of Judge Halevi, who later
became one of the panel of three judges that tried Eichmann:

&quot;The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the
deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of
confidence in the false information that they were being transferred
to Kenyermeze.

The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had
they not spread their false information through Jewish channels.

The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian
rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and
others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to
mislead the Jews.
They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help
of Jewish leaders.

The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local
leaders of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were
spreading such false information and did not protest.

Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were
persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'.

The trust of the Jews in the misleading information and their lack of
knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be
deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz led the victims to remain
quiescent in their ghettos. It seduced them into not resisting or
hampering the deportation orders.

Dozens of thousands of Jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few
dozen police. Yet even vigorous young Jews made no attemptt to
overpower these few guards and escape to nearby Rumania. No resistance
activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos.

And the Jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the
Jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities.

The same Jews who spread in Kluj and Nodvarod the false rumor of
Kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn
their own people against the misleading statements, the same Jewish
leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of
deportations...these same leaders did not join the people of their
community n their ride to Auschwitz, but were all included in the
Rescue train.

The Nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of
extermination permitted Rudolf Kastner and the members of the Jewish
Council in Budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends.
The Nazis did this as a means of making the local Jewish leaders, whom
they favoured, dependent on the Nazi regime, dependent on its good
will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. In short, the
Nazis succeeded in bringing the Jewish leaders into oollaboration with
the Nazis at the time of the catastrophe.

The Nazi chiefs knew that the Zionists were a most vital element in
Jewry and the most trusted by the Jews.

The Nazis drew a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto and other belligerent
ghettos. They learned that Jews were able to sell their lives very
expensively if honorably guided.

Eichmann did not want a second Warsaw. For this reason, the Nazis
exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the Jewish leaders.

The personality of Rudolph Kastner made him a convenient catspaw for
Eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their
task easier.

The question here is not, as stated by the Attorney General in his
summation, whether members of the Jewish Rescue Committee were or were
not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the S.S.
chiefs.

It is obvious that without such S.S. Nazi patronage the Jewish Rescue
Committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an
underground.

The question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the
Nazis interested in the existence of the Rescue Committee? Why did
the S.S. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the
Jewish Rescue Committee? Did the exterminators turn into rescuers?

The same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent Jews by
these German killers of Jews. Was the rescue of such Jews a part of
the extermination plan of the killers ?

The support given by the extermination leaders to Kastner's Rescue
Committee proves that indeed there was a place for Kastner and his
friends in their Final Solution for the Jews of Hungary - their total
annihilation.

The Nazi's patronage of Kastner, and their agreement to let him save
six hundred prominent Jews, were part of the plan to exterminate the
Jews.
Kastner was given a chance to add a few more to that number. The bait
attracted him. The opportunity of rescuing prominent people appealed
to him greatly. He considered the rescue of the most important Jews as
a great personal success and a success for Zionism. It was a success
that would also justify his conduct - his political negotiation with
Nazis and the Nazi patronage of his committee.

When Kastner received this present from the Nazis, Kastner sold his
soul to the German Satan. The sacrifice of the vital interests of the
majority of the Jews, in order to rescue the prominents, was the basic
element in the agreement between Kastner and the Nazis. This agreement
fixed the division of the nation into two unequal camps: a small
fragment of prominents, whom the Nazis promised Kastner to save, on
the one hand, and the great majority of Hungarian Jews whom the Nazis
designated for death, on the other hand.
An imperative condition for the rescue of the first camp by the Nazis
was that Kastner will not interfere in the action of the Nazis against
the other camp and will not hamper them in its extermination. Kastner
fulfilled this condition. He concentrated his efforts in the rescue of
the prominents and treated the camp of the doomed as if they had
already been wiped out from the book of the living.

One cannot estimate the damage caused by Kastner's collaboration and
put down the number of victims which it cost Hungarian Jews. These are
not only the thousands of Jews in Nodvarod or any other community in
the border area, Jews who could escape through the border, had the
chief of their rescue committee fulfilled his duty toward them.

All of Kastner's answers in his final testimony were a constant effort
to evade this truth.

Kastner has tried to escape through every crack he could find in the
wall of evidence. When one crack was sealed in his face, he drated
quickly to another.&quot;

(Judgement of Judge Benjamin Halevi, Criminal Case 124/53; Attorney
Generalv. Malchiel Greenwald, District Court, Jerusalem, June 22,
1955).

Judge Halevi reverts to the meeting of Kastner with the S.S. officers
Becher and Rudolf Hoess, commandant of Auschwitz at the time when the
'new line' of rescuing Jews was revealed by Hoess. He says:

&quot;From this gathering in Budapest, it is obvious that the 'new line'
stretched from Himmler to Hoess, from Jutner to Becher and Krumey.

According to Kastner, however, these Nazis were all active in rescuing
Jews.

This meeting of these important German guests in Budapest exposes the
'rescue' work of Becher in its true light. It reveals also the extent
of Kastner's involvement in the inner circle of the chief German war
criminals.

Just as the Nazi war criminals knew they needed an alibi and hoped to
achieve it by the rescue of a few Jews at the eleventh hour, so
Kastner also needed an alibi for himself.

Collaboration between the Jewish Agency Rescue Committee and the
Exterminators of the Jews was solidifed in Budapest and Vienna.
Kastner's duties were part and parcel of the genral duties of the S.S.

In addition to its Extermination Department and Looting Department,
the Nazi S.S. opened a Rescue Department headed by Kastner.

All these extermination, robbery and rescue activities of the S.S.
were coordinated under the management of Heinrich Himmler&quot;. (ibid)

Judge Halevi continues:

&quot;Kastner perjured himself knowingly in his testimony before this court
when he denied he had interceded in Becher's hehalf. Moreover, he
concealed the important fact that he interceded for Becher in the name
of the Jewish Agency and the Jewish World Congress.

As to the contents of Kastner's affidavit, it was enough for the
defense to prove Becher was a war criminal. It was up to the
prosecution to remove Becher from this status, if they wished to
negate the affidavit.

The Attorney General admitted in his summation that Becher was a war
criminal.

The lies in the contents of Kastner's affidavit, the lies in his
testimony concerning the document, and Kastner's knowing participation
in the activities of Nazi war criminals, and his participation in the
last minute fake rescue activities - all these combine to show one
overwhelming truth - that this affidavit was not given in good faith.

Kastner knew well, as he himself testified, that Becher had never
stood up against the stream of Jewish extermination, as Kastner has
declared in the affidavit.

The aims of Becher and his superior, Himmler, were not to save Jews
but to serve the Nazi regime with full compliance. These is not truth
and no good faith in Kastner's testimony, 'I never doubted for one
moment the good intention of good Becher'.

It is clear that the positive recommandation by Kastner, not only in
his own name but also in the name of the Jewish Agency and the Jewish
World Congress was of decisive importance for Becher. Kastner did not
exaggerate when he said that Becher was released by the Allies because
of his personal intervention. The lies in the affidavit of Kastner and
the contradictions and various pretexts, which were proven to be lies,
were sufficient to annul the value of his statements and to prove that
there was no good faith in his testimony in favor of this German war
criminal.
Kastner's affidavit in favor of Becher was a willfully false affidavit
given in favor of a war criminal to save him from trial and punishment
n Nuremberg.

Therefore, the defendant, Malchiel Greenwald, was correct in his
accusations against Rudolf Kastner in the first, second and fourth of
his statements.&quot; (ibid)

Judge Halevi's verdict found Malchiel Greenwald generally innocent of
libel against Kastner, but fined him one Israeli pound for the one
unproven accusation - that Kastner had actually collected money from
his Nazi partners for his aide to their slaughter program. The judge
also ordered the Government of Israel to pay Greenwald two hundred
Israeli pounds as court costs.

In fairness to Kastner it should me mentioned that as well as having
been unpaid, it was never established that he ever wore S.S. uniform.

Nevertheless, this verdict, and the evidence on which it was based,
completely establishes the truth of everything said on 3CR about the
matter.

If the story ended there, it would only prove conclusively that the
individual Kastner was a collaborator and the Israeli Government had
attempted to defend him, although facts brought out in the trial
pointed to much more than that.

But the story does not end there.

The Reaction
-------------
Public opinion in Israel was almost unanimous in demanding that
Kastner and his associates should be put on trial. Remember that up to
now it was Kastner's accuser who was on trial.

The Communist Party newspaper Kol Ha'am (Voice of the People) wrote:

&quot;All those whose relatives were butchered by the Germans in Hungary
know now clearly that Jewish hands helped the mass murder&quot; (23 June
1955)

In the authoritative Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz, the leading political
journalist, Dr. Moshe Keren wrote:

&quot;Kastner must be brought to trial as a Nazi collaborator. And at this
trial, Kastner should defend himself as a private citizen, and not be
defended by the Israeli Government...&quot; (14 July 1955).

*Haboker*, the pro-Government General Zionist party paper stated:
&quot;The public wants to know the real facts about Kastner, and not about
him alone. The only way to find out the truth is to put all the Rescue
Committee people on trial and give them a chance to offer their
defense.&quot; (23 June 1955)

But public opinion was not quite unanimous. The problem with bringing
Kastner and his associates to trial was that his associates were the
Government of Israel.

As the evening paper *Yedi'ot Aharonot* said:
&quot;If Kastner is brought to trial the entire government faces a total
political and national collapse - as a result of what such a trial may
disclose.&quot; (23 June 1955)

Accordingly, the Government of Israel did not put Kastner on trial,
instead it filed an appeal against the acquittal of Greenwald for
criminal libel.

As Dr. Karlebach wrote in Israel's largest evening newspaper,
*Ma'ariv*:
&quot;What is going on here? The Attorney General has to mobilize all the
government power, appear himself in court, to justify and defend
collaboration with Himmler! And in order to defend a quisling, the
government must drag through the streets one of the grimmest stories
of our history!

At 11 P.M. the verdict was given. At 11 A.M. next morning the
government announces the defense of Kastner will be renewed - an
appeal filed.
What exemplary expediency! Since when does this government possess
such lawyer-genius who can weigh in one night the legal chances of an
appeal on a detailed, complex verdict of three hundred pages?! (24
June 1955)

At the appeal hearings before the Supreme Court, the Attorney General
of Israel, Chaim Cohen, explained clearly why the Government of Israel
was defending Kastner so strongly:  &quot;The man Kastner does not stand
here as a private individual. He was a recognized representative,
official or non-official of the Jewish National Institutes in
Palestine and of the Zionist Executive; and I come here in this court
to defend the representative of our national institutions.&quot; (Hecht, p.
268)

The truth of this statement cannot be denied. Kastner's collaboration
was not that of an individual. It was the collaboration of the Zionist
leadership.

So far, it has only been established that the Government of Israel
continued to support a Nazi collaborator after the facts about his
collaboration had been conclusively established in an Israeli court.
But the story gets worse.

The Supreme Court of Israel unanimously found that Becher was indeed a
Nazi war criminal and that Kastner had without justification, and in
the name of the Jewish Agency, helped Becher to escape justice. On
this point Greenwald was acquitted of libel and Kastner was not 'fully
rehabilitated'.

The Supreme Court also accepted the FACTS established in the lower
court - that Kastner DELIBERATELY concealed the truth about Auschwitz
from the majority of Hungarian Jews in exchange for Nazi permission to
take a thousand or so to Palestine. Again, Kastner was far from being
'fully rehabilitated'.

The Majority Judgement
-------------------------
But now comes the really nasty bit. After unanimously acknowledging
these FACTS, the Supreme Court of Israel, by a majority of three to
two, found that Kastner's actions were MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE and
convicted Greenwald of criminal libel for calling this
'collaboration'.

In saying that 3CR broadcasts concealed the fact that Kastner had been
fully rehabilitated by the Israeli Supreme Court, Dr. Foster is
totally missing the point.

Kastner's actions only proved that HE was a Nazi collaborator. It is
the defense of these actions by the Government and Courts of Israel
that prove conclusively that ZIONISM approves of Nazi collaboration.

The majority of the Supreme Court of Israel did not REHABILITATE
Kastner.
They JOINED him.

Let us read from the majority judgement of Supreme Court Judge Shlomo
Chesin:

&quot;...What point was there in telling the people boarding the trains in
Kluj, people struck by fate and persecuted, as to what awaits them at
the end of their journey...Kastner spoke in detail of the situation,
saying, 'The Hungarian Jew was a branch which long ago dried up on the
tree'.
This vivid description coincides with the testimony of another witness
about the Hungarian Jews, 'This was a big Jewish community in Hungary,
without any ideological Jewish backbone' (Moshe Shweiger, a Kastner
aide in Budapest, protocol 465).

I fully agree with my friend, Judge Agranot, when he states that, 'The
Jews of Hungary, including those in the countryside, were not capable,
neither physically nor mentally, to carry out resistance operations
with force against the deportation scheme'...From this point of view
no rescue achievement could have resulted by disclosing the Auschwitz
news to the Jewish leaders there, and this...is a consideration which
one  can properly conclude that Kastner had in front of his eyes.

.And I take one more step. I am certain that the silence of Kastner
when he arrived in Kluj was premeditated and calculated and did not
result from his great dispair because of the helplessness of the
Jewish community.
Even then, I say, this is still not considered willful collaboration
and assistance in the extermination, because all the signs indicate
that Kastner's efforts were aimed at rescue and rescue on a big
scale...And towards the end I take one last step. In doing so I go
very far and say that even if Kastner ordered himself to keep silent
knowingly, in submission to the strong will of the Nazis, in order to
save a few Jews from Hell - this is still no proof that he stained his
hands by collaborating with the enemies of his people and carrying out
their plan to exterminate most of the Jewish community in Hungary.

Even if, through these activities of his - or rather, his omission -
the extermination became easier. And as to the moral issue, the
question is not whether a man is allowed to kill many in order to save
a few, or vice-versa. The question is altogether in another sphere and
should be defined as follows: A man is aware that a whole community is
awaiting its doom. He is allowed to make efforts to save a few,
although part of his efforts involve concealment of truth from the
many or should he disclose the truth to many though it is his best
opinion that this way everybody will perish. I think that the answer
is clear. What good will the blood of the few bring if everybody is to
perish?...As I said, I am not arguing with the basic factual findings
of the learned President of the Jewish District Court (Judge Halevi)
but it seems to me, with all due respect, that his findings do not, as
of necessity, demand the conclusion he has arrived at.
That is to say, collaboration on the part of Kastner in the
extermination of the Jews. And that they better coincide with bad
leadership both from a moral and public point of view...

In my opinion, one can say outright that if you find out that Kastner
collaborated with the enemy because he did not disclose to the people
who boarded the trains in Kluj that they were being led to
extermination, one has to put on trial today Danzig, Herman, Hanzi,
Brand, Revis and Marton, and many more leaders and half-leaders who
gagged themselves in an hour of crisis and did not inform others of
what was known to them and did not warn and did not cry out of the
coming danger....

Because of all this I cannot confirm the conclusion of the District
Court with regard to the accusation that Greenwald has thrown on
Kastner of collaboration with the Nazis in exterminating the Jewish
people in Hungary during the last war.&quot; (Hecht, ibid, pp.270-2)

n other words, the Court approved of Kastner's contempt for the
Hungarian Jews and could not allow him to be condemned for doing
exactly what many other Zionist leaders had half-leaders did -
concealing their knowledge of the Nazi extermination plans so that
Jews would board the trains to Auschwitz peacefully while their
Zionist 'leaders' boarded a different train for Palestine.

The Minority Judgement
--------------------------
It cannot be said that ALL top Zionists leaders actively approved of
Nazi collaboration in this way. Indeed the most precise answer to this
sickening judgement of Judge Chesin is provided in the minority
judgement of S&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The declaration of the learned Attorney General
therefore shrinks into Supreme Court Judge Moshe Silberg:

&quot;I do not say that he was the only man who possessed information among
the leaders. It is quite possible that somebody else as well does not
have a clear conscience with regards to this concealment. But we are
dealing here with the guilt of Kastner and we do not have to make
judgements on the guilt of others....

an opinion....'Kastner was convinced and believed that there was no
ray of hope for the Jews of Hungary, almost for none of them, and as
he, as a result of his personal dispair, did not disclose the secret
of the extermination in order not to endanger or frustrate the rescue
of the few - therefore he acted in good faith and should not be
accused of collaborating with the Nazis in expediting the
extermination of the Jews, even though, in fact, he brought about its
result.'

I am compelled to state that it is very difficult for me to conceive
such an intention. Is this good faith? Can a single man, even in
cooperation with some of his friends, yield to despair on behalf and
without the knowledge of 800,000 other people? This is, in my opinion,
the decisive consideration in the problem facing us. The charge
emanating from the testimony of the witnesses against Kastner is that
had they known of the Auschwitz secret, then thousands or tens of
thousands would have been able to save their lives by local, partial,
specific or indirect rescue operations like local revolts, resistance,
escapes, hidings, concealment of children with Gentiles, forging of
documents, ransom money, bribery, etc - and when this is the case and
when one deals with many hundreds of thousands, how does a human
being, a mortal, reject with complete certainty and with an extreme
'no' the efficiency of all the many and varied rescue ways? How can he
examine the tens of thousands of possibilities? Does he decide instead
of God? Indeed, he who can act with such a usurpation of the last hope
of hundreds of thousands is not entitled to claim good faith as his
defense. The penetrating question quo warrento is a good answer
to a claim of such good faith...

If the superintendent of a big hospital lets thousands of sick people
die so that he may devote himself to the sure rescue of one soul, he
will come out guilty, at least morally, even if it is proven that he
as an individual erroneously thought that there was no hope of saving
the other patients. He is a collaborator with the angel of death.

Either a complete atrophy of the soul or a blind involvement with
complete loss of senses and proportion in his small but personal
rescue operation could bring a man to such a gigantic, hazardous play.

And if all this is not enough to annul the claim of good faith which
was put before us on behalf of Kastner by the Attorney General, then
Kastner himself comes and annuls it altogether. Not only did he never
make this claim, but his own words prove the contrary. He writes in
his report to the Jewish Agency that the Committee sent emissaries to
many ghettos in the countryside and pleaded with them to organize
escapes and to refuse to board the trains. And though the story of
these pleadings is untrue, and the silence of Kastner in Kluj is
proven, the very uttering of these statements entirely contradicts the
claim that Kastner had concealed the news about the fate of the ghetto
inmates in good faith and only as a result of his complete despairing
of the chances of escaping or resisting the Germans. You can not claim
at the same time helplessness and activity.
Anyway, such a claim is not convincing...

We can sum up with three facts:
A. That the Nazis didn't want to have a great revolt - 'Second Warsaw'
- nor small revolts, and their passion was to have the extermination
machine working smoothly without resistance. This fact was known to
Kastner from the best source - from Eichmann himself - And he had
additional proofs of that when he witnessed all the illusionary and
misleading tactics which were being taken by the Nazis from the first
moment of occupation.

B. That the most efficient means to paralyze the resistance with - or
the escape of a victim is to conceal from him the plot of the coming
murder.
This fact is known to every man and one does not need any proof of
evidence for this.

C. That he, Kastner, in order to carry out the rescue plan for the few
prominents, fulfilled knowingly and without good faith the said desire
of the Nazis, thus expediting the work of exterminating the masses.

And also the rescue of Becher by Kastner...He who is capable of
rescuing this Becher from hanging proves that the atrocities of this
great war criminal were not so horryfying or despicable in his
eyes...I couldn't base the main guilt of Kastner on this fact had it
been alone, but when it is attached even from afar to the whole scene
of events it throws retroactive light on the whole affair and serves
as a dozen proofs of our conclusion.&quot; (Supreme Court Judge, Moshe
Silberg, 1957)

Conclusion
-----------
If that had been the majority judgement, one could say that whatever
their attitudes to the Arabs, and whatever their past behaviour might
have been under pressure, the Zionist leadership today did not
advocate collaboration with the Nazis.

One could then at least understand the complaints by Mr. Bloch,
President of the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies, about the
'dragging in of alleged episodes in the history of Jewish/Nazi
relationships'.

But Judge Silberg's judgement was that of a minority.

The Kastner case is therefore not an alleged episode in past history,
being 'dragged in' to discredit an opponent.

It is a continuing controversy in which the top Zionist leadership of
Israel stand indicted of continuing to publicly defend collaboration
with the Nazis in the extermination of Jews.

Despite the unanimous finding of the Supreme Court of Israel that Kurt
Becher was a major war criminal, the Jewish Agency (World Zionist
Organization) refused to withdraw the fraudulent certificate Kastner
gave on their behalf, which saved Becher from hanging, and allowed him
to remain a free man in West Germany, the head of several corporations
and with an estimated personal worth of $30 million.

Becher has even used his certification as a 'good' SS officer to give
evidence in support of his associates at other war crimes trials in
West Germany.

Since the prosecution, representing the Israeli Government agreed with
the Supreme Court that Becher was a major war criminal, one can only
presure that the Israeli Government did not want him put on trial for
fear of what might come out.

Likewise, none of Kastner's associates on the Zionist Relief and
Rescue Committee or his bosses in the Jewish Agency have ever been put
on trial as demanded by Israeli public opinion. Let alone the hundreds
of 'prominents' who helped Kastner to reassure the Hungarian Jews that
they were going to Kenyermeze and not Auschwitz, in exchange for
tickets on the one train that took them eventually to Palestine.

As for Kastner himself, he will cause no further embarassment to the
Zionist leadership with his undisputed claims that everything he did
was approved by the Jewish Agency (World Zionist Organization)
leadership in Palestine. He is, as Dr. Foster so delicately puts it,
'now dead'.

Or putting it less delicately, on 3 March 1957 he was shot by Zeer
Eckstein - immediately after the appeal hearings were concluded, and
before the judgement 'rehabilitating' him was delivered. Eckstein was
not a Hungarian avenger. He was a paid undercover agent of the Israeli
secret service.
(Hecht, ibid., p.208. Another 'fantastic allegation' no doubt; but
admitted in court during the murder trial).

Clearly this issue has a major indirect relevance to the Arab-Israeli
dispute. Apart from countering Israel's cynical use of the holocaust
as a propaganda weapon, it answers a very real concern that many
people have about the State of Israel and the Jews. This concern is
whether, if Jews had a State of their own during the holocaust many
more could have been saved, and whether this is not an essential
future consideration, at least as an insurance policy.

The facts of the Kastner case show that the very existence of the
Jewish Agency (World Zionist Organization) was an actual help to the
Nazis and that more could have been saved if the Zionist movement had
not existed.
Having a State that approves of actions like those of Kastner for an
insurance policy, is like using petrol for a fire extinguisher.

Zionism is not the answer to anti-semitism, but a cowardly proposal to
run away from it. The only answer to anti-semitism is to fight back.

We shall go on to prove this in detail.
