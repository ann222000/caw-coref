I'm really offended by that also.  I'm offended for all the brave men who
gave their lives in defense of our flag.  I'm *not* a conservative, but I am
still deeply offended.

Good, I'm glad to hear it. That's why I post this stuff. A lot of good

It doesn't matter if they call themselves liberal, conservative,
constitutionalist, libertarian, fascist, anarchist, or radical
religionist; all politicians look for loopholes that enable them to
enact their personal or paid for agendas with as little resistance as
possible.

Partisanship is the biggest problem in American government. Abolition of
the party system would be the best thing that ever happened to this country.

Having parties does not necessarily mean that blind partisanship is the
result, though, at present, that is pretty much what we have. This sorry
state of affairs is largely the result of corruption and self-interest
masquerading as liberality.

Sadly, too many of our citizens think of the Constitution only in terms
of the Bill of Rights, an accretion considered dangerously unnecessary
by the writers of the original Constitution. (History has proven them
correct.) The meaning of the original, unamended document was that any
power not specifically assigned to the federal government resided in the
people and only by consent of those people assigned to their individual
states. By enumerating all the rights mentioned in the first 10
amendments, the amenders unintentionally opened to discussion the extend
to which those rights were retained by individuals and the extent to
which the federal government might usurp or invent authority to enforce
them, putting what should local issues into the federal realm. The Ninth
amendment tries to undo the damage done by the other nine, but once
Pandora opened the box... The Ninth has too seldom been invoked to keep
the federal government out of our business.

Some amendments were or became necessary, such as those concerning
slavery and suffrage, but many, like most of the last eleven, are silly,
useless, or intrusive. In fact, the last important amendment was the 15th:

&quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied
or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race,
color, or previous condition of servitude.&quot;

At that, it would have been better, clearer, and more sensible if it had
ended right after the words &quot;by any State&quot;.

That would have made the 19th and 24th unnecessary. By enumeration of he
conditions of suffrage, the amendment allowed poll taxes, literacy
tests, and denied women the vote. It also would have been better if
Section 2 of the 15th had been struck:

&quot;The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate
legislation.&quot;

Leave the job of enforcement to the executive branch and findings of
guilt and determination of punishment to the judiciary. After all, those
are jobs assigned to those branches by the Constitution.

I could go on, but I've probably bored you enough, today.

&gt;&gt;by the writers of the original Constitution. (History has proven them
&gt;&gt;correct.)

&gt; I would disagree with this opinion.  History has proven your theory
&gt; dead wrong.  When the Amendments were passed, the BIll of Rights was
&gt; obviously seen as necessary to at least 2/3 of the elected
&gt; Representatives  of the People.  And for a very good reason.

&gt; In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson (who borrowed the phrase
&gt; from patriot Thomas Paine) wrote that all men are entitled to &quot;Life,
&gt; liberty and the pursuit of happiness;&quot;  this is the foundation upon
&gt; which our free nation is built.  Without this this freedom, we might
&gt; just as well have stayed under bondage to King George.

&gt; Unfortunately, throughout history there have been many who would like
&gt; to control the lives, limit the liberties,and stifle the pursuits of
&gt; others.  The original, imperfect Consitution did not build in
&gt; guarantees of those simple rights that Jefferson had voiced in the
&gt; Declaration, and so the Constitution had to be amended and the rights
&gt; of the citizens spelled out.  Otherwise, our freedom just becomes
&gt; subjective and subject to the whims of whoever happens to be in power.
&gt; Without the Jefferson's freedoms spelled out,  whichever political
&gt; party is dominant could easily stifle the speech and actions of those
&gt; who think or act differently, or who have a different opinion. Our
&gt; nation would easily revert to exactly the type of dictatorship that
&gt; the Declaraion and ensuing war released us from.

&gt; If all of America's political leaders were benevolent, benign,
&gt; purehearted and strict Constitutionalists, I agree that there would be
&gt; no need for the Bill of Rights.  But this is a fantasy.  Imagine what
&gt; George W. Bush would have done without the BOR to protect us; he went
&gt; as far as he could in revoking many liberties with his so-called
&gt; &quot;Patriot Act.&quot;   We might as well have crowned another King George.

&gt; I maintain, along with that 2/3 majority of Congress that passed the
&gt; Amendments, that it was very necessary to spell out the individual
&gt; rights and liberties implied in the body of the Constitution or there
&gt; would ultimately have been anarchy, a dictatorship -- or more likely a
&gt; Medieval-type feudal system in place by now in America.

&gt; Thanks God for the Bill of Rights.

&gt; IMO.
">

Yeah, what is it about people who think everyone else would be so much
better off and happier if they just did everything he told them to do
without question?  Even a good-hearted dictator is an evil thing!

You haven't bored me... yet. There are two parts of your post I would
disagree with:

- Leaving enforcement to the Executive branch. That branch's job is
enforcement &quot;of the law&quot;, as enacted by Congress. It's the Legislative
branch's (Congress) job to enforce the Constitution through legislation.

- Ending the 15th Amendment after &quot;by any State&quot;. Wouldn't such wording
grant the right to vote to convicted felons and current prisoners?

As an aside, I've often wondered if Terry Schiavo was legally permitted
to vote while incapacitated.

You miss the point, entirely. The original unamended Constitution put
everything, absolutely everything not explicitly referenced in the
document out of reach of the Federal government. All those inalienable
rights were unassailable.

This is utterly silly. I doubt you've actually read the Patriot Act or
are aware of what other war time Presidents have done without the
bothering with the consent of Congress. (Read &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;)
You're looking for bogeymen under your bed. You'd also probably be

States of America).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I maintain, along with that 2/3 majority of Congress
">

Let me point out that 500 years ago most people thought the world was
flat and that there are still people who think as they did. They watch
Rosie O'Donnell, believe that fire cannot melt steel, and Neil Armstrong
never walked on the moon. That the Constitutional Convention sometimes
got it wrong is not in question. They did. Compare the language of the
&quot;religion clause&quot; of the 1st Amendment as ratified with the language
proposed by Madison.

Madison:
&quot;The Civil Rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious
belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor
shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, nor on
any pretext infringed.&quot;

What was ratified:
&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&quot;

Most of the rancor regarding religious observance we've experienced was
the result of the convention taking Madison's clear statement of
government's non-involvement and replacing it with the above, which is
as unclear now as it was nearly 2 centuries ago.

The only worse amendment is section 1 of the 14th:

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State
wherein they reside. *No State shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;
nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the law*. (emphasis mine)

While seemingly good, obvious, and benign, it has been in reality the
basis for 150 years of power grabs by the Federal government,
particularly when given the tools provided by section 5:

&quot;The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation,
the provisions of this article.&quot;

Who gets to decide what is appropriate? Congress and Scotus! Talk about
a naked power grab: you reiterate the law of the land and then give
yourself the power to decide what the law means and the power to write
any new laws you want as long as you can come up with a lame rationales
to connect them to rights which the original document (The Constitution)
had already guaranteed via the &quot;unenumerated rights&quot; reiterated in the
equally unnecessary 9th amendment.

Don't even bother to get me started on the damage the 17th amendment has
done to the country.

BTW, do we have any programmers in the group who would like to explain
the dangers of tramp data? The dangers of the Bill or Rights is very
much like the dangers of tramp data.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if they call themselves liberal, conservative,
&gt;&gt;&gt; constitutionalist, libertarian, fascist, anarchist, or radical
&gt;&gt;&gt; religionist; all politicians look for loopholes that enable them to
&gt;&gt;&gt; enact their personal or paid for agendas with as little resistance as
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Partisanship is the biggest problem in American government. Abolition
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the party system would be the best thing that ever happened to
&gt;&gt;&gt; this country.

&gt;&gt; Having parties does not necessarily mean that blind partisanship is
&gt;&gt; the result, though, at present, that is pretty much what we have. This
&gt;&gt; sorry state of affairs is largely the result of corruption and
&gt;&gt; self-interest masquerading as liberality.

&gt;&gt; Sadly, too many of our citizens think of the Constitution only in
&gt;&gt; terms of the Bill of Rights, an accretion considered dangerously
&gt;&gt; unnecessary by the writers of the original Constitution. (History has
&gt;&gt; proven them correct.) The meaning of the original, unamended document
&gt;&gt; was that any power not specifically assigned to the federal government
&gt;&gt; resided in the people and only by consent of those people assigned to
&gt;&gt; their individual states. By enumerating all the rights mentioned in
&gt;&gt; the first 10 amendments, the amenders unintentionally opened to
&gt;&gt; discussion the extend to which those rights were retained by
&gt;&gt; individuals and the extent to which the federal government might usurp
&gt;&gt; or invent authority to enforce them, putting what should local issues
&gt;&gt; into the federal realm. The Ninth amendment tries to undo the damage
&gt;&gt; done by the other nine, but once Pandora opened the box... The Ninth
&gt;&gt; has too seldom been invoked to keep the federal government out of our
&gt;&gt; business.

&gt;&gt; Some amendments were or became necessary, such as those concerning
&gt;&gt; slavery and suffrage, but many, like most of the last eleven, are
&gt;&gt; silly, useless, or intrusive. In fact, the last important amendment
&gt;&gt; was the 15th:

&gt;&gt; &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be
&gt;&gt; denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of
&gt;&gt; race, color, or previous condition of servitude.&quot;

&gt;&gt; At that, it would have been better, clearer, and more sensible if it
&gt;&gt; had ended right after the words &quot;by any State&quot;.

&gt;&gt; That would have made the 19th and 24th unnecessary. By enumeration of
&gt;&gt; he conditions of suffrage, the amendment allowed poll taxes, literacy
&gt;&gt; tests, and denied women the vote. It also would have been better if
&gt;&gt; Section 2 of the 15th had been struck:

&gt;&gt; &quot;The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate
&gt;&gt; legislation.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Leave the job of enforcement to the executive branch and findings of
&gt;&gt; guilt and determination of punishment to the judiciary. After all,
&gt;&gt; those are jobs assigned to those branches by the Constitution.

&gt;&gt; I could go on, but I've probably bored you enough, today.

&gt; You haven't bored me... yet. There are two parts of your post I would
&gt; disagree with:

&gt; - Leaving enforcement to the Executive branch. That branch's job is
&gt; enforcement &quot;of the law&quot;, as enacted by Congress. It's the Legislative
&gt; branch's (Congress) job to enforce the Constitution through legislation.
">

No. The role of Congress is essentially the writing of laws as permitted
by the Constitution, i.e., setting the manner in which powers reserved
to the Federal government are to be executed (plus a few other duties
like budgeting, declaring war, etc). Guess who is responsible for
executing the laws and who is, particularly post Marbury v Madison,
responsible for determining both the meaning of the law (where it is
vague) and its constitutionality.

Nothing is perfect, but I would prefer to accept such a relatively
insignificant problem for the unassailable clarity of the simpler
statement. Real franchise for African-Americans and women would have
been achieved almost instantly rather than decades later. Besides, a
felon who has paid his price to society and who is now presumably a
productive member of society should have a fair say in the determination
of the common weal.

&gt; As an aside, I've often wondered if Terry Schiavo was legally permitted

As vote by proxy in government elections is not legal nor is power of
attorney for voting legal, she retained her franchise but obviously
lacked any modality to exercise it. As many in Congress demonstrate on
an almost daily basis, demonstrable higher brain function is not a
requirement for voting.

It's data that is passed through a chain of sub-routines and gets
progressively more f*cked up with each sub-routine it passes through.  If
sub-routines are used only to pass data to another sub-routine you need to
eliminate it.  Anything that muddies the original intent of a program is a
*BAD* thing and *BAD* programming (which is why I like straight ASP rather
than .NET where code has to be passed back and forth from libraries to data
sheets and back to web pages - all that can be done on the web page without
calling 3 other different files before it gets translated into html).

For clarity, you might add &quot;particularly data sent to sub-routines which
should not only not be able to alter the data, but which have no need to
access the data.&quot; I know this is what you meant by &quot;through,&quot; but others
might not.

Thanks,

The guys who taught me to program stressed the importance of creating
orderly, well defined data structures, limiting access to the processes
which actually needed the particular piece of data, and tightly
controlling the conditions under which the data might be altered.
Sometimes it was difficult to find room for all the semaphores back when
main memory was 64k and discs were 320K.

Yep, what I meant was there was no need for the data to be sent through a
sub-routine that does nothing but pass the data on to another sub-routine
and in the process, if not adding out and out errors, at the very least
exposing the data to possible error so it ends up at it's destination
corrupted and, of course, GIGO happens!  In programming, as in life, the
simpler the process the less chance of something f*cking it up.
