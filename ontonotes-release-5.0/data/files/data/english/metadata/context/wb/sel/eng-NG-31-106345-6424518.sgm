Complaint Department I bought some of those xpensive plum sized
"Strawberries." I tried a nice big red one. It had absoultely no taste
except for a slight citrus acid taste.
I thought I would do a test. I asked my wife to come to the kitchen but
not open her eyes. Took a little doing but she did it.
I persuaded her to taste something without peaking.
She couldn't tell what it what but thought it might be a plum.
That's the Globalist Corporate Farm for you. They engineer shippers so
they can still be saleable two or three weeks later, across the Country.
They look good but have no flavor, sugars, nothing. They just look like
something you might want to eat. It's the same thing with Tomatoes. You
can buy all sorts of "beefsteak" Tomatoes, that look good but you might
have to guess what you are eating if you couldn't see it.
They are virtually flavorless devoid of any acid, sugars that would
cause them to spoil if bruised, kept in the heat, or sit for more than a
month on a super mart's shelf.
This is the real junk food. Overpriced, paper mache tasting junk food.
How many have tasted a real Strawberry like you used to grow, in your
small garden??

That's why I planted my own little strawberry patch.  The berries
aren't fancy to look at and they're not very large, but man do they
taste good, no mistaking that strawberry exposion in your mouth.  Each

Talk about dumb! you defend the elimination of traditional agriculture.
You sheepisly accept whatever the Corporatist dish out to you. Can't do
anything about what the Corporate Farms dish out except not to buy it
but that is not good enough when they eliminate any alternatives: those
who can will raise their own or buy local good quality foods. Have you
tried to buy a good tomato from anyone John? You can't even find
anything but shippers, in most seed catalogs. I have one dependable
source for good tomato plants. Make no mistake that the Corporations are
about eliminating all competition from any size producer.  Just look a
the anti small producer Legislations and selective enforcements used ,
in the name of safety.Just look at the small Dairies or maybe a local
butcher. Whoops, you can't there aren't any left around your part of the
Country, I bet.

Of course, but then the thread is about fresh stuff.  If one can get
past the texture, frozen strawberries are quite tasty.  I don't
particularly care for the flaccid texture but sometimes when I'm
Jonesing in January for strawberries....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

I like freeze-dried berries a LOT better than frozen.  The texture
remains closer to the fresh product.  Of course, freeze-drying is a
bit challenging for the average person to do at home but the berries
are available on the market.  If you want a taste of 'em, get a box of
Special-K strawberry version, pick the berries out, hydrate them and
eat.  Good stuff.

Re high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).  I spent a couple of years working
for M&amp;M Mars as a process controls engineer.  I spent quite a bit of
time with the food technologists figuring out how to economically
manufacture the nifty new products they came up with. Or more usually,
demonstrating that the product wasn't financially viable (a real
shame, in many instances).

Mars and many other companies have done double-blind taste testing of
HFCS vs sucrose.  Invariably the test panel fails to differentiate
between the two when they don't know which is which.  Equally
invariably, when they DO know the difference they prefer sugar.  The
effects of mind-numbing media.  If HFCS didn't taste good then it
wouldn't be used as much as it is, regardless of cost benefits.

You don't get out much, do you?  Ever go to the local farmer's market?
Or the produce section of even Wal-Mart in season?  Our local
Wal-Marts, as do all of 'em, buy local produce (and strongly advertise
it) whenever it is available.  So do all the other stores but I picked
Wal-Mart because "everybody" likes to hate them so.

Ever get a seed catalog?  Heard the term "Heirloom"?  Those strains of
tomatoes and other veggies that your great-grandma grew before the
evil corporate ag conspiracy took over everything?  Even the
greasy-haired yuppies have discovered heirloom veggies.  Go to a Fresh
Market or other yuppy attraction and look at what prices they're
willing to pay.

Undoubtedly eggs from chickens that eat bugs and feces particles and
other such stuff taste better than chickens raised on chicken chow.
But that method of egg production isn't going to feed the country.
"Factory" egg production is a balance between cost and taste, as is
all other large scale food production.

Given that pay hasn't kept up with inflation in my lifetime and given
the overburdening regulations any business has to undergo these days,
that food has remained as cheap as it is, is a remarkable feat.

Let's take pork.  When I opened my first restaurant 12 years ago I was
paying about 66 cents a pound for boxed Boston Butt shoulders.  When I
closed my last one last year I was paying around 88 cents.  What has
inflation and income done in those intervening 11 years?

Not only has the price gone down in real dollars, the quality has gone
up.  12 years ago a box of meat would contain butts that ranged in
weight from a couple of pounds to 10 lbs or more.  The bone would be
highly variable in thickness and sometimes so thin that it would
crumble during the BBQing process.  A real pain in the *ss to have to
pick out.

Now the cuts are almost identical, the result of selective breeding
and factory farming.  The bone thickness is uniform, as is the fat
content.  One can easily and mindlessly process the cooked meat to
remove the ones and prepare for serving.

Now one might (probably correctly) argue that "the meat doesn't taste
as good as farm-raised pork).  I might worry about that if I were
eating (nearly) raw pork, as I do with a nice rare steak.  But after
roasting over a hickory fire for 12 hours and after applying my
special BBQ sauce, the basic taste of the raw meat doesn't matter a
whit.

Now I can afford and do buy USDA prime corn-fed Angus steaks
originated from farms that use herds that haven't had all the fat bred
out of 'em. I cook 'em just enough that a Band-aid and some CPR won't
put 'em back on the hoof and enjoy. But most folks either can't or
won't pay that sort of price.  For the factory worker who's making
half what his dad did in real dollars, those factory farm-raised
$1/pound pork chops mean the difference between enjoying meat and not
having any at all.

&gt;&gt; Gus?  No?  Then what are you bitching about?

&gt;&gt; Before those shippable breeds were developed, strawberries, tomatoes,
&gt;&gt; etc simply were not available around here except during the local
&gt;&gt; growing season which in the case of strawberries is about 3 weeks.
&gt;&gt; Outside those 3 weeks we are sh*t-outta-luck.

&gt;&gt; Like you, I have a choice.  I can (and do) buy locally grown produce
&gt;&gt; when it's in season.  And I mostly don't buy the mostly tasteless
&gt;&gt; imported stuff out of season. But apparently the taste is good enough
&gt;&gt; to enough people that the demand warrants the stores stocking them.

&gt; FWIW John, I'm with you.  I'll take a shippable Strawberry over none
&gt; any day.  Some are quite good, though not the same as a local berry
&gt; (if we ever get them).

&gt;&gt; Instead of bitching on the net and sounding like the dumb-*ss hick
&gt;&gt; that you are, why not just walk on by the display?  Unless you've
&gt;&gt; spent your life in a cave you knew that those things have practically
&gt;&gt; no taste so why'd you buy them?  How's that go?  &quot;Better to remain
&gt;&gt; silent and be thought a fool than to tap on your keyboard and remove
&gt;&gt; all doubt.&quot;
&gt; .
&gt; Because bitching is all they have to do for the day's entertainment.

good shoddy goods or bad produce. Instead of endorsing the sorry
products foisted in us we should all bitch. The squeaky whell get the

You have th right t o bitch. Everbody should bitch until it changes. The

what's the point of Gus bitching to us? *we* aren't the ones
foisting imported cheap food on him.
if Gus wants good food he's going to have to buy it from
local farmers *in season* &amp; he's going to pay more for it than
the imported flavorless crap at the supermarket. i'm sure
he'll be bitching even louder at the fair market prices that
local farmers need to charge in order to stay in business
though.

So true.  Gus is bitching because that's what weak-minded attention
seakers do.

I had the occasion to make the following post to another group. I
think it fits well in this thread:

Correct.  In fact, here's a place where one can play around with
inflation-adjusted prices

http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl

1975 was the earliest time I kept expense logs, when I started driving
long distance to work and back.  If I input 1975 and 50 cents (what I
was paying for a gallon of gas at the end of the year.), that comes
back as the present day price of $1.89.  Figure in the increase in
fuel tax which this calculation doesn't account for and the result is,
we're paying for gas today right at or maybe a little less than we
were in 1975.

What's really interesting is to go back to say, 1931 and input the
price of gas then, 19 cents ( http://www.tvhistory.tv/1946%20QF.htm ).
In today's dollars, $2.54!!  Youch!  Shows just how ignorant those old
pharts are when they so fondly reminisce about "cheap gas" "back
then".

Another revealing thing is how the price of milk changed.  Forty Nine
cents a gallon in 1931.  That's $6.56 a gallon in today's dollars!
Think about that the next time you feel the need to whine about
corporate agriculture.

This also starkly highlights the cost of regulations, especially
excessive environmental ones.  Relative to petroleum, dairy farming
has remained effectively unregulated.  Milk prices reflect the
unfettered economies of scale.  That gas has only managed to keep up
with the rate of inflation, IMO, reflects the "hidden" costs of
regulation.

And before someone jumps in to note that milk has had price supports
and price fixing, that is true but so has petroleum over the years.
Irrelevant to this comparison since both nowadays are on the free
market, as much as it can be free in this country.

Mr Neon?  Umm, no.  If you want to use my handle, that would be "Mr

posting replies.  Hmmmm.  Methinks yer lying.  BTW, talking about

Me, I'm just toying with you as a cat does a mouse before he kills it.
I know that it's not nice to make fun of the feeble minded but
sometimes I just can't help myself.  A character flaw I'm working on.

Like a cat, I'm getting a tad bit bored with the play so I'll let you

I was remembering northern Minnesota.  Not too many bears in that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Outside those 3 weeks we are sh*t-outta-luck.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Like you, I have a choice.  I can (and do) buy locally grown produce

Northern Wisconsin and Michigan's upper peninsula.

Black bear mothers are super aggressive when they have

yard several times a week during the summer. In spring,
hungry for calories, they tear down bird feeders and
destroy them.

Usually. That and a dollar will get you a cup of coffee.

People around here give them wide berth, along with the
rising gray wolf population (fresh off the endangered

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;the rest mercifully snipped&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've never quite understood why people make rants like this (well
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually I do - nothing to say but too ignorant to realize same).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did someone hold a gun to your head and make you buy those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; berries,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gus?  No?  Then what are you bitching about?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before those shippable breeds were developed, strawberries,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tomatoes,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc simply were not available around here except during the local
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; growing season which in the case of strawberries is about 3 weeks.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Outside those 3 weeks we are sh*t-outta-luck.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like you, I have a choice.  I can (and do) buy locally grown
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; produce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when it's in season.  And I mostly don't buy the mostly tasteless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imported stuff out of season. But apparently the taste is good
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enough
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to enough people that the demand warrants the stores stocking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FWIW John, I'm with you.  I'll take a shippable Strawberry over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; none any day.  Some are quite good, though not the same as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; local berry (if we ever get them).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead of bitching on the net and sounding like the dumb-*ss hick
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are, why not just walk on by the display?  Unless you've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spent your life in a cave you knew that those things have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no taste so why'd you buy them?  How's that go?  &quot;Better to remain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; silent and be thought a fool than to tap on your keyboard and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remove
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all doubt.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because bitching is all they have to do for the day's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entertainment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gus has every right to bitch.It used to be expected from everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that good shoddy goods or bad produce. Instead of endorsing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sorry products foisted in us we should all bitch. The squeaky
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whell get the grease.  There are no alternatives for most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consumers, no competition.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have th right t o bitch. Everbody should bitch until it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changes. The political and corporate types are the ones telling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you shouldn't bitch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course he has the &quot;right to bitch&quot;.  So what? He also has the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right to be an idiot.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you don't like the flavor of the strawberrys it would be rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; silly to buy them, huh?  I rather like them so have no problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; buying them whenever I find them not all bruised to hell (the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reason for the tougher varieties).  Bitching won't force them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be pulled from the shelves, no matter how much it pisses you off.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...because I'm buying them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't recall telling you couldn't. An idiot is someone that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trying to rationalize why, while the perp while he is slitting your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; throat.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm going to scream like hell. I don't guess anyone will hear you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't be surprised then, when everyone is laughing at you.  I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like broccoli, but I don't bitch at people buying it.  What a nutcase!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kind of a fun group, don't you think?

&gt;&gt; Sure.  It's something to do while recovering.  Sure beats daytime
&gt;&gt; television!  ;-)

&gt; But think of how much fun it would be to see someone standing in
&gt; the produce section of your favorite grocery store bitching at
&gt; the people who were putting it into their carts.  For even more
&gt; fun, try some of the suggestions here:

&gt; &gt;&gt;Around here don't do that if you're alone and is a windy
&gt; &gt;&gt;day or you'll never hear the bear approaching.

&gt; &gt; Sounds exciting!  Where is that?

&gt; Northern Wisconsin and Michigan's upper peninsula.

&gt; &gt; I was remembering northern Minnesota.  Not too many bears in that
&gt; &gt; particular area any more.

&gt; Black bear mothers are super aggressive when they have
&gt; their young with them. I find fresh bear scat in my
&gt; yard several times a week during the summer. In spring,
&gt; hungry for calories, they tear down bird feeders and
&gt; destroy them.

&gt;  &gt; What bears there are, are black bears and
&gt;  &gt; they are usually pretty timid.

&gt; Usually. That and a dollar will get you a cup of coffee.

&gt; &gt; But if I DID see one while berry picking, well......the

&gt;  &gt; bear can have'em!

&gt; People around here give them wide berth, along with the
&gt; rising gray wolf population (fresh off the endangered
&gt; species list.) The gummint is finally acknowledging we
&gt; may have cougars as well after a lot of reported
&gt; sightings.
">

That all sounds good to me!  I never said I wanted ALL the berries.  I
LIKE bears and wolves and cougars.  We have a lot fewer of them than
we do people.

Years ago my Dad was grouse hunting in Minnesota.  He was idly picking
raspberries and munching away, when he heard something nearby.  A
black bear was idly munching berries on the other side of the bushes,
some inadequate number of feet away.  Dad only had a shotgun, the bear
had no desire for problems.  They both just munched in opposite
directions.
Giving wild critters a wide berth is nearly always a good idea.

&gt; &gt; That's the Globalist Corporate Farm for you. They engineer shippers so
&gt; &gt; they can still be saleable two or three weeks later, across the Country.
&gt; &gt; They look good but have no flavor, sugars, nothing. They just look like
&gt; &gt; something you might want to eat. It's the same thing with Tomatoes. You
&gt; &gt; can buy all sorts of &quot;beefsteak&quot; Tomatoes, that look good but you might
&gt; &gt; have to guess what you are eating if you couldn't see it.
&gt; &gt; They are virtually flavorless devoid of any acid, sugars that would cause
&gt; &gt; them to spoil if bruised, kept in the heat, or sit for more than a month
&gt; &gt; on a super mart's shelf.
&gt; &gt; This is the real junk food. Overpriced, paper mache tasting junk food.
&gt; &gt; How many have tasted a real Strawberry like you used to grow, in your
&gt; &gt; small garden??

&gt; go to youtube an search for &quot;the future of food&quot;   7 parts; about 1 hr
&gt; total.
">

As time passes you will see this get worse, to where eventually
everything has the same bland taste.  The original stock will have
been lost in the shuffle and food as our ancestors knew it will be
history.  You may end up taking man made
pills of chemicals to keep you alive, A Zoombie you wi;ll then be. If
every one  just boycotted the produce counter for just one week you
would see Big Agri changing directions, Buy can goods and let the
fresh no taste produce rot on the counter is the answer.
Even home grown vegies are being hybridized to where they are becoming
tasteless also.. If I was a young farmer today I would start now to
build an old time produce farm as am sure it will be a gold mine , no
a diamond mine of the future.
