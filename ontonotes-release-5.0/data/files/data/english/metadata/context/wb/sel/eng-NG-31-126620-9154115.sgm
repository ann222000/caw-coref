The Best Bowl Of Oatmeal Ever
Recipe By: Gale Gand

Ingredients

2       cup     water
2       cup     milk
1       cup     Irish steel-cut oats
1       pinch   salt
For the topping:
1/2     cup     apple juice
1/2     cup     golden raisins or dried cherries
1/2     cup     heavy cream
1       teaspoons       brown sugar
1/8     teaspoons       cinnamon

Instructions

In a medium saucepan, bring the water and milk to a boil. Stir in the
steel-cut oats and salt and cook a few minutes to thicken. Reduce the
heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan bring the apple juice to a boil, add
the raisins, and cook a few minutes to help them plump. In a mixing
bowl, with a whip attachment combine the heavy cream, brown sugar,
and cinnamon and whip until stiff. Keep chilled.

Remove the cooked oatmeal from the heat and serve piping hot in
bowls. Sprinkle the plumped raisins on top of the oatmeal and spoon a
dollop of the brown sugar cinnamon whipped cream in the center and
serve.

Notes about the recipe: To cut some of the cooking time, soak the
oats in water overnight by bringing the water to a boil, turn off the
heat, and add the oats. Cover the pot and let sit over night. The
next morning cook on low heat 9 to 12 minutes stirring occasionally.
