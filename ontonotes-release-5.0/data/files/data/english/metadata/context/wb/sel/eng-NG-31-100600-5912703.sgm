Judas and Jesus  by Jean-Yves Leloup   © 2007    Inner Traditions  ISBN
1-59477-166-9  174 pages  Includes Appendices Paperback $14.95 (U.S.)

Monsieur Leloup is a French theologian and founder of the Institute of Other
Civilization Studies and the International College of Therapists.  In this
book he departs from his usual documentary-style to a more narrative-based
approached.  He uses many of his own translations from the Greek to support
his interpretations.

The author posits a difference between the "Divine" and "God" that was a
revelation to me.  I'm still not sure how I feel about this distinction -
the Divine is all that exists and "God" is a being who chooses.  Think about
that for a few minutes and see how you react to it.

The author explores, as well as any man can, the thought processes of Yeshua
(known as the Messiah).  He lays out thought trains and patterns which ring
true not only because they accord with orthodox interpretations of the
Gospels, but because they accord with the thoughts of honest and sincere
men.

Although this is a book which is aimed, obviously, at a Christian audience,
those of us with exposure to non-mainstream religions will find echoes of
Pagan thought in some parts of this book (e.g., "Do you know now that the
love you were seeking in outer experiences is within you, and that if you do
not find it within you, you will never find it outside you? [page 64]).
There are thought-provoking ideas scattered throughout this book.

For those people interested in exploring the "behind-the-scenes" of
religious thought, this book will be invaluable, for others - no so much.
It is well-written and interesting.  If the topic interests you, this book
is well worth the price.
