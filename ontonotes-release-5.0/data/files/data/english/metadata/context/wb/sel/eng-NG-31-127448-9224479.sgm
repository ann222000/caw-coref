From and panel discussion aired of Louisianna Public Television,
Louisianna gubernatorial candidate Bobby Jindal:

“Sure, and let’s talk about intelligent design. I’m a biology major.
That’s my degree. The reality is there are a lot of things that we don’t
understand. There’s no theory in science that could explain how, contrary
to the laws of entropy, you could create order out of chaos. There’s no
scientific theory that explains how you can create organic life out of
inorganic matter. I think we owe it to our children to teach them the
best possible modern scientific facts and theories. Teach them what
different theories are out there for the things that aren’t answerable by
science, that aren’t answered by science. Let them decide for themselves.
I don’t think we should be scared to do that. Personally, it certainly
makes sense to me that when you look at creation, you would believe in a
creator. Let’s not be afraid to teach our kids the very best science.”

Keep an eye on this guy:
http://www.judgewhite.com/origins/index.html

He is a big force in the La. Creationism movement.
I actually met him about 15 years ago, played tennis with him.
He has been pushing for creationism/ID in La. schools for years.

This is a list of &quot;Questions to ask your Biology teacher&quot; that Judge
White has on his website.

While most of it is easily answered creationist drivel, I am
interested in this bit at the bottom of the page:

&quot;When you ask these questions, beware. Aggressive evolutionists will
attempt to intimidate you, dismiss the questions, laugh at
them, claim that they're ridiculous, or say that you're basing it on
your faith. Stand your ground. This is not based on your faith.
These are common sense inquiries that anybody in an academically free
environment ought to pursue. They are not
unreasonable questions, even though that is what your adversary will
say. Or he will tell you that you really don't understand or
that you have to be more into science to grasp this, or it's too
complex a concept to explain. If it's too complex to explain, how
could anyone teach it?
The one you must never let evolutionists run away from is Einstein.
Naturalists in the evolutionist lobby do not allow anybody
to talk about intelligent design because they say it comes from faith.
It doesn't. There is a respectable school of science and
Einstein raised these questions. So why should they be stricken out of
inquiry?&quot;

What does Einstein have to do with ID?

The current creationist ID scam?  Nothing.  People on both sides of
the issue use Einstein as certain types of examples.  He may have
believed in some type of diety.  The reality probably is that Einstein
would be one of the last people to back the current Intelligent design
bogousity.  If there were something to really sink our teeth into it
would have been put forward by now.  The fact that the creationist ID
perps that ran the ID scam are now pushing a replacement scam that
doesn't even mention that ID ever existed should tell any thinking
human being that they are a long way from basing their ID assertions
on much more than faith.

There isn't much more that is needed to know how bogus ID is when the
guys that perpetrated the creationist scam aren't willing to back it
up when they have to put up or shut up.  Every single school board or
legislator that has fallen for the ID scam and wanted to teach ID has
had to face the fact that they have had the bait and switch run on
them.  All they get from the the ID perps is the replacement scam.
Just watch what happens to the next legislator or school board that
claims to want to teach ID.  It has happened to every single one of
them since Ohio in 2002.  The only ones that didn't drop the issue or
take the replacement scam was Dover and we all know what happened
there.  Compared to that, anything that they can make up about
Einstein would seem to be superfluous.  What they really need is
something that they can claim is teachable about ID instead of the
stupid obfuscation scam they are giving to any rube stupid enough to
have fallen for the creationist ID scam.

Right now, they are still trying to figure out what to do next. This
'teach the controversy' or 'make the teachers so uncomfortable' is
just a ploy to throw a monkey wrench into science education while they
wait for more right wing judges to get into the courts.

This appears to be one of those issues that our grandkids will still
be arguing about.

My first guess is that you are probably right in that they are
treating the newest scam as some interim type of thing (they seem to
have an infinite will to lie to themselves about this subject), but
the fact is that a lot of them had realized that ID was cooked years
before they had to run the bait and switch on the Ohio board.  They
were airing the legal implications of the &quot;teach the controversy&quot;
replacement scam back in 1999, and Ohio wasn't until 2002.  The newest
scam has been just a stop gap bandaid for at least 8 years, now.  The
saddest thing is that it is pretty much just a compilation of various
creationist obfuscation scams, but the only difference is that they
can no longer tell anyone why they are obfuscating.

About the saddest thing that they could do is blow smoke and not be
able to tell why they are blowing smoke, and that is exactly what they
are doing.  Sure, a lot of them still mess up and talk about
creationism and ID when they hawk the new scam, but the perps know
that they have to get a pristine batch of rubes to run the new scam or
it too will fail.  The last thing that they want is for the new scam
to be linked to the old ones, like ID was.

Their problem is that the same perps that ran the ID creationist scam
are running the new one.  It is even worse than linking Kenyon to the
scientific creationists and noting how they just swapped out
intelligent design for creationism in the book Pandas and People.  The
Discovery Institute used to claim that ID was their business, now they
are one of the major players in foisting off the replacement scam onto
unsuspecting rubes or dishonest collaborators.  No court or judge can
ignore that fact.  Judge Jones already put the writing on the wall and
mentioned the new scams in the Dover decision.  The new scam is just a
ploy.  If it had substance that would be one thing, but all the new
scam is, is a bandaid solution to the abject failure of all that has
come before.

The composition of the courts could change, but it would take a group
that would swallow their integrity in order to support their religious
convictions in order to pass on the current dishonest bogousity.  If
we do get a court with such a low level of integrity we will have more
problems than teaching creationist clap trap in the public schools.

No doubt about that.  Just look at scientific creationism.  Places
like AIG and the ICR still exist, and the creationist ID scam artists
at the Discovery Institute used to spend most of their time denying
that they were scientific creationists.  It turned out not to be so
funny for them that some of their number were found out to be
scientific creationists.

We just have to wait and see what the next generation of creationists
come up with.  Until a new &quot;pristine&quot; group appears that has no ties
to the past failures they are pretty much just marking time.  They can
blow a lot of smoke, but they can't do much more than that until the
current dishonest bunch fades away.  Heck, the ID scam artists ran a
dishonest bait and switch scam on their own supporters.  Why would an
honest court give them the time of day?

I'm not saying that blowing smoke can't do damage.  Their only goal at
this time seems to be to keep the kids as ignorant as possible.  The
only plans they seem to have is to intimidate teachers and confuse the
issue.  There is plenty to do to keep them from doing that, but you
don't see very many of the original ID perps claiming to be able to
teach ID anymore, do you?  Even Philip Johnson (the godfather of the
political ploy) has admitted that they don't have anything equivalent
to teach.

It is about like the game of smashing gophers that keep popping up.
The only amusing part of the whole fiasco is that currently it is the
ID perps that have to set the creationist rubes straight.  Every
school board or legislator that pops up and wants to teach ID has to
be hammered down, and the ID perps have to do it as quickly as
possible before more damage is done.  The rubes get whacked and then
offered the replacement scam in a classic bait and switch operation.
I doubt that any sane and competent person can deny that, that is what
is currently going on.  So why do these guys still have supporters?

This is a) not true and b) silly.

The vast majority of people can understand the concepts of evolution
quite well, if they bothered to learn them at all.  Most people who
fail to understand evolution do so because of an unwillingness to
learn about something that they object to for religious reasons, or
because they have been spoonfed a version of evolution that is a wrong-
headed strawman, apparently constructed for the very purpose of
deceiving them.

It is silly because the concepts that are within the grasp of a high
school student are not even necessary to understand evolution.  My 10
year old has a better grasp of evolution that most people. You don't
need math, you don't need biology, you don't need genetics.  You need
a pair of eyes and a willingness to explore the concepts of common
descent.  You only need those other things if you are going into more
depth: certainly at the college level, and I would *hope* at the high
school level.

No, they don't.  There are plenty of popular science books discussing
evolution that actually do do a pretty good job.  If you want to
understand some of the finer details then you probably will need a
fairly extensive education, but the basics of evolution can certainly
be grasped by &quot;ordinary people&quot; as long as the &quot;ordinary people&quot; make
some sort of effort to learn it.

Who has said otherwise?

You didn't get the above quote from anything that I wrote, but your
take on it is totally off base.  Who claims that the concept of
biological evolution is too difficult for students to grasp?  There
are certain religious factions that do not want their children exposed
to the concept, but that isn't the same thing.  There are teachers
that don't want to rock the boat so they down play the significance of
the concept, but that isn't the same thing either.

What you will see is creationists running their obfuscation scam that
are subjecting students to topics that they aren't equiped to
understand.  There are a lot of subjects that we don't have a good
handle on, yet, but to concentrate on those and not on what we already
know is just obfuscation.  If you check out the latest creationist
scam you will see what I am talking about.  To understand some of
these &quot;controversies&quot; you might have to have upper division biology
classes at some University.  High School biology classes can't afford
to go into topics in this detail.  Their basic purpose is preparing
the kids so that some of them will be able to handle the material when
they decide to take up the topic later in life, not to give them a
graduate student level of understanding of the subject.   These
students need a good grounding in the basics so that they can
understand more indepth analyses when they get to that level.

So, if something is too hard to understand (not true in this case, but
a debating point), then we should just lie to students? That makes a
later teacher's job much more difficult.
