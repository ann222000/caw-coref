We have indoor/outdoor cats, live in the woods. I am constantly amazed at
the cat haters who think all cats should be declawed and live indoors
because they are decimating our bird population. Our cats bring in maybe
three junkos a year. Fanatics have no sense of the natural order. Snakes,
hawks, automobiles, pesticides, and countless other factors kill birds too.
Those cat haters are probably the same folks that keep birds in cages and
marvel a &quot;nature.&quot; That's not nature.

There is a difference between cats that have access to country or wooded
areas, and cats that live in cities full of cars, animal mutilators etc. I
have never been opposed to cats going outdoors IF IT IS SAFE for them. But
you cannot tell me a cat is safe in a city full of cars, idiots that see
animals on the side of the road and aim for them, antifreeze in the gutter,
people that duct tape kittens to busy highways for kicks, people that shoot
cats with bows, people that eviscerate cats and hang them from fences. Are
people that keep their cats from these dangers cat haters? no they are
trying to protect their pets. Not all believe in keeping cats indoors to
protect birds, but to protect their cats. I never allow my cats outside and
in my contract I state that this cat should not be declawed. But when it
comes down to the family giving away the cat because it is clawing things
up, or having it declawed I have made the exception, because I know the cat
is in a wonderful home. If the new owners haven't tried other options I do
not okay the surgery and if I find out it is done I will confiscate the cat,
as my contract that they signed states that in writing.

"/> Cat haters? Naah, the inadequates who think all cats should be declawed
LOVE their cats. They tell us so constantly, even as they mutilate
them.

"/> There've been studies in the UK which show that cats have so little
impact on the bird population that this argument is a joke. What
decimates birds is modern farming techniques, pesticides etc.

"/> Don't think they're fanatics, just ill-informed.
