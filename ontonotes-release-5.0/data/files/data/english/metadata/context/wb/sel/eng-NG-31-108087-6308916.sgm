Pre-2004 H-D Sporster Question

Since H-D has added vibration isolation motor mounts for the
Sportster in 2004, frame no longer shakes.

How bad really is that vibration?

I'm thinking about possibly shooting for an earlier model
Sportster in the near future, seeing that these will most
likely depreciate more than the 2004+ models.

Is it something that is really fatiguing after say, 4 to 6
hours of riding?  Or is it something that sensitive people
complain about?

Or does one do some mitigation of it by weighting the handle
bar ends?

What are your thoughts?

Its probably not as bad as your Savage.  Its subjective, and depends on
what you are used to.  To a Goldwing rider it shakes alot.  To a large
single rider its nothing new.

I'd ask, but they don't like people with nym's like thumper.
Actually what I am referring to is how bad is the vibration on
an older style Sportster that does not have the vibration
isolation engine mounts.

I found a Sportster on craigslist that I thought was a bargain ~$3500.

I just went over to rmh and said that I was sportbike rider and knew nothing
about H-D's and did they think this was good deal.  One of the points they
made was the changes in the engine mounts in 2004.

But I didn't ask who the hell is Shirley and why is everyone always drinking
and buying rounds. :)

I still keep my eye out for Sportsters exactly because of the points you
made originally.

I have a 1996 Sportster 1200S.  I used to ride BSA's years ago and
even with my carpal tunnel I don't have a problem with the vibrations.

Course I don't death grip the bars and I changed to the heavy foam
grips, move may hands into different positions and even ride without
touching the bars allot.  When I do have my hands on the bars I leave
the fingers partially straight and control the bars by push pressure.
Learned to do that with the BSA's.  For an around town bike a
Sportster can be great.  For short road trips it's ok.  For longer
trips You might want a different seat and highway pegs so ya can move
about a bit.

I like mine!

My  2002 1200 C did vibrate a lot. To the point that the mirrors only showed
figure eights. after 40 minutes at 60-70 mph , your arms tingle for half an
hour. With drag bars and forward controls , you sit right on the tail bone.
The bike is what it is. a runabout and day tripper.. and it isnt what it
isnt

The only Sportster I've ever ridden is my nephew's.  I was talking to my
brother this morning so asked him the year.  It's a 1981 XLH 1000.  The
only vibration I noticed was in the footpegs, but it was strong enough I
was constantly checking my feet to make sure they weren't vibrating off.

&gt; 1.  Stand a nickel on edge on the gas tank.

1.  Enter the burn-out pit on a righteous-looking hog and, with the
hopped-up, loping engine popping, shaking and back-firing, place your
front wheel against the concrete barricade provided.
2.  Rev the motor upwards of 3-4000 RPM and hold it.
3.  Watch the looks on the faces of those around you...

Seems to me that's what turns on way more people.  ;)

Perhaps more appropriate... I went up to Luftmeister's shop a few
years ago. Matt Capri had his bike there - the turbocharged K100 -
that he rode 204mph at Lake Mirage. He was quite proud of the lack of
vibrations on that bike, but he didn't use the nickel test. He claimed
you could set a full glass of champaigne on the gas tank and it
wouldn't spill.

I'm lazy. I just leave the open bottle in the
champagne bucket at the restaurant and call a cab.
;^) Non-adult beverages get drank through a
elongated camel-back hose to the bottle in my
saddle bags. Gets rather annoying when windblast
takes the bite nipple off the hose.

History does not record anywhere at any time a
religion that has any rational basis. Religion is
a crutch for people not strong enough to stand up
to the unknown without help. But, like dandruff,
most people do have a religion and spend time and
money on it and seem to derive considerable
pleasure from fiddling with it.

I dunno about that.  Judging by the numbers attending rallies aimed at

IMHO, there's your problem, not following your instincts.  Unless
thrashed, Sportster for $3.5K US is a good price, IMHO.  Just think,
if you didn't like it after buying it, you could get what you paid
for and may be some more.

In New Mexico we occasionally see a "rural" special that belches

Back about 8 years ago I did advance.  Someone gave me a 25 MHz Dell
386SX laptop with 2 MB memory.  I upgraded it to 8 MB, 20 MB HD to
120 MB and put Windows 3.1 on it.  Used it for a number of years,
even did WordPerfect Presentation slides on it for training.

This reminds me, jest curious.  Do they have a bar where one can jump
on a bike set up on a dyno type treadmill, crank her up and watch the
pretty wide screen video with country side following their speed and
a fan blows their hair back?

Might be a hit up north.   :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How bad really is that vibration?

&gt; My  2002 1200 C did vibrate a lot. To the point that the mirrors
&gt; only showed figure eights. after 40 minutes at 60-70 mph , your
&gt; arms tingle for half an hour. With drag bars and forward controls
&gt; , you sit right on the tail bone. The bike is what it is. a
&gt; runabout and day tripper.. and it isnt what it isnt
">

That probably describes my riding style more.  I currently use my
bike back and forth to work and to friends/shops on weekends.  Once
in a while I head out.

I'm used to vibrating mirrors.  I bought a cheap set of long stem
mirrors on the Savage, so I could see past my shoulders.  At 70 MPH,
everything behind me is a blur.

You both have convinced me.  Next, sometime in the near future at the
right price, I'll need to tell my wife what followed me home.    :-)

You could be onto something profitable there!

&gt;&gt;&gt; I asked a similiar question over on
&gt;&gt;&gt; rec.motorcycles.harley. They gave me some good feedback.

&gt;&gt; I'd ask, but they don't like people with nym's like
&gt;&gt; thumper. Actually what I am referring to is how bad is the
&gt;&gt; vibration on an older style Sportster that does not have
&gt;&gt; the vibration isolation engine mounts.

&gt; I rode a '97 model for 40,000 miles. Loved every minute of
&gt; it! Yeah it vibrated, but not objectionally so...
">

You bring up an interesting point.  It looks like I will be
able to go a long way with an older, low mileage Sportster, it
doesn't have to be a 2004 or later.
