I attended closing night of Richard III outdoor at Peabody estate in
Mayslake, OakBrook, Illinois. It was pure pleasure, especially the
perfect weather. The play is staged on a hillside (we're up, the stage
is down, and there's a valley for groundlings). Action ensues at dark
(8:15).

The cast was okay, a few less standouts than usual, both in versions
I've seen of RIII and in the many other plays I've seen by First Folio
at this venue.

There was no Margaret this night (see prior HLAS discussions on
cutting Margaret by accessing 'Questions about Margaret' if you like
but the url is 3 lines long for me).

The Richard was good, dressed all in black and seeming very
uncomfortable with himself so he's got that right. His malady was not
a hunchback (the script does not demand a back anomaly) but his
posture brought on by such poor legs--he was like 1/2 pigeon-toed and
1/2 bow-legged. I suspect he achieved his uneven gait by wearing one
high heel (partial heightening). He was very mobile and always
suffering at it, except when his grand deviance satisfied him and he
crowed his many soliloquies. One thing he did that I've never seen a
Richard do is disrobe to the waist for his anointing as king. No
hunchback. (I felt he was hugely Pacino-inspired, not a bad thing.)

In the dagger scene with his nephew, York, when York gets Richard's
dagger in playacting, York also jumps on Gloucester's (Richard's) back
and rides him while he acts tortured. Good scene.

It dawned on me that Richard III seems like an episode of Survivor and
that Richard's lies and maneuvers were just the most successful,
that's all. He wasn't the best at anything else but the timed
mistruth.

+ + +

Here's a funny spot--I hope to properly translate it to you...

In Act II, scene I,
KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN ELIZABETH (hope they) are allying DORSET,
RIVERS, HASTINGS, GREY, and others with BUCKINGHAM and thus RICHARD.

Text reads:
BUCKINGHAM:
... When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile

(THIS is a Buckingham moment: he displays his insincerity to us.)

The nobles are standing in a line. Buckingham shakes each of their
hands, in order, saying these &quot;words&quot; to each lord ...AS THOUGH HE IS
PRONOUNCING THEIR NAMES...
&quot;deep&quot;
&quot;hollow&quot;
&quot;treacherous&quot;
and &quot;full of guile.&quot;

(Registered way high on the laugh-o-meter. Clever. Try it live if I
didn't explain it--he's making his first impression to them by
confusedly insulting them.)

+ + + + +
Well, here is a joke I just got this time out...

The malmsey butt is the wine vessel, in this usage a large vat...

When Richard is speaking with his mom (DUCHESS OF YORK) about (her
other son just killed) Clarence...

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

...then here comes Richard almost like Groucho Marks bumping sideways
right to left in that nya-nya-nya delivery...

GLOUCESTER: [Aside]
Amen; and make me die a good old man!
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
I marvel why her grace did leave it out.

He loosely mocks his mother, saying she can kiss Clarence's ass
goodbye. Cruel moment but there is oh-so-much worse coming.

+ + +

Costuming was just wrong at times, such as Clarence (1st in line to
the throne, I believe?) wearing a red shirt and yellow cape like a
pathetic superhero; that stole all his dignity long before the plot
got to do it.

Buckingham, like Richard, wore all black. He is more the villain than
I gave him discredit for. But what makes him evil (beside his costume
and snidery) is I think his ambition.

Many enjoyable little nuances and touches, such as Anne in modern high
heels, Richard in shades.

In Act III, scene vi, a stenographer with the cute eyeglasses shows up
--she is playing 'scrivener' here but with no lines. Okay.

The messengers always wore plain little gray/tan tunics and big white
headdresses. By the end of Act IV, when all the news hits Richard,
there are about seven of these bigheads total and it was just funny as
they menaced like paparazzi.

Thanks to the quiz three weeks back, I was ready for the &quot;Saddle up,
Surrey&quot; line. Never knew that that was his horse, the poor thing; I
hope brave fella was stolen and not slain or hurt.

Here is a very clever scene, and it ties in with my enquiry a while
back regarding the named and unnamed killers...

The killers wear the traditional henchman garb, the grim reaper look,
a huge hood with a dark cave-like slit for the face you never see.
Well, since the second set of killers are not seen, this staging
corrected that: When Richard is in his &quot;earnest prayer&quot; with the
bishops--THEY are the ones wearing the grim reaper garb instead of
their usual phony archbishop get-up. Believe me, this was chilling.

As king, Richard changes his shirt from black to deep purple.

GREATEST LINE
The most horrible (thus greatest) line, I think the most disgusting
line in all of Shakespeare is Richard's to Queen Elizabeth (Lady Grey)
justifying killing her two sons (Edward and Richard, Prince of York)
and then (planning on) impregnating their sister, her daughter
(Elizabeth who married Richmond instead and had a little baby later
known as Henry VIII)  in order to repay her, their mom, and it will
all be all right:

QUEEN ELIZABETH: But thou didst kill my children.

KING RICHARD III: But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

[Tough for gentle readers, like me, to sit through that!]

+ + + + +

Audio was not so great from up the hill, but they did accommodate the
vast space on the ground. Airplanes were above and not too noisy, but
damn if I didn't hear every fucking Harley Davidson within a 5 mile
radius.

$26, went with Elaine, had the mobile collapsible couch w/ the
entertainment center, lots of fruit and the guac and the tequila and
the synopses and the playbills and the sun going down and as much like
heaven as it gets.

&lt;&lt;Like the Arabian, the Syrian is hardy and frugal, able to survive
on
the poorest of nutrition. Built for the desert, it is uniquely
adapted
to the high temperatures of the climate, as well as the cold of the
night. They are spirited and hot, with a noble presence, and may be
gray or chestnut in color. Conformationally, they resemble their
Arabian cousins, with fine, chiseled head, lean body, arched neck,
and delicate limbs; however, they are generally considered to be
slightly less attractive.&gt;&gt;
.
&lt;&lt;The Barbary horse originated in northwestern Africa, in what is
now Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Historically Barbs have been
prized
for their endurance and quick bursts of speed. They were imported and
bred for racing and hunting throughout Europe. The pure Barb stands
approximately 15 hands high, with flat shoulders, low tail and
a &quot;ram shaped head&quot;. Able to carry large loads and subsist
on poor forage, they make ideal military mounts&gt;&gt;

&gt; .   And here receive we from David's son Harley
&gt; .   Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
&gt; .   The wretched, bloody, and usurping HOG,
&gt; .   That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines.
&gt; .
&gt; .              [aside]
&gt; .
&gt; .   He dreamt to-night the HOG had razed his helm:
&gt; .   To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
&gt; .   To fly the HOG before the HOG pursues,
&gt; .   Were to incense the HOG to follow us
&gt; .   And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
&gt; .   Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
&gt; .   And we will both together to the Tower,
&gt; .   Where, he shall see, the HOG will use us kindly.

Yes, VERy distracting sometimes, Art.

Here are other requests by Shakespeare's characters for ink and paper
(and light). It seems that no character can ever just get his own ink
and paper, they always ask someone else to bring it:

Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper
Romeo and Juliet: V, i

Ink and paper, Charmian
Antony and Cleopatra: I, v

Give me some ink and paper
Give me some ink and paper in my tent
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
King Richard III: V, iii

By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and light
Twelfth Night: IV, ii

Bid nestor bring me spices, ink and paper
Pericles, Prince of Tyre: III, i

I will fetch you light and paper and ink
Twelfth Night: IV, ii

Commoners like Shaksper &amp; William Holden had to get their own:

What, was your beaver easier than it was?

.    Twelfth Night Act 4, Scene 2
.
MALVOLIO.   By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and
.   light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:
.   it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
.   of letter did.

Clown.   Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
.   brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.

.  Antony and Cleopatra  Act 1, Scene 5
.
CLEOPATRA:  Get me ink and paper:
.   He shall have every day a several greeting,
.   Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
---------------------------------------
The Rape of Lucrece  Stanza 185

'Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen:
Yet save that labour, for I have them here.
What should I say? One of my husband's men
Bid thou be ready, by and by, to bear
A letter to my lord, my love, my dear;
Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;
The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.
---------------------------------------
.   King Richard III  Act 5, Scene 3
.
RICHMOND.   The weary sun hath made a golden set,
.   And by the bright track of his fiery car,
.   Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
.   Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
.   Give me some ink and paper in my tent
.   I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
.   Limit each leader to his several charge,
.   And part in just proportion our small strength.
.   *My Lord of Oxford* , you, Sir William Brandon,
.   And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
