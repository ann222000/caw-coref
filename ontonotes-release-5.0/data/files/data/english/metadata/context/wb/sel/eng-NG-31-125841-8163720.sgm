Seems like all the other stations have been redesigned around the
current R1/R1X logo, still it would probabyl have been £150K if they
didn't ...

What I've never understood is why does Radio 5 have to have the word
&quot;Live&quot; tagged on to it..? Does it mean that Radios 1-4 are dead..?

Load of balls. The &quot;BBC Radio&quot; bit on the left of each ball is completely
detached. It should be integrated into the balls.

Rather flat and boring as well, no depth but then thats modern thinking
for you shallow, superficial and simple for the weak of brain.

They have always gone for  homogeneous branding where a bit of
individuality would be better.

Remember the early days of BBC local radio were every station
had similar 'Radiophonic' sig tunes?

I *think* it was done to distinguish it from the earlier Radio 5
Children/Sport service which predated it.

What I've never understood, though, is why Radio 4 is (was) &quot;Radio 4

Probably for the same reason that R4 used to use the rather grand

Also, on new year's eve, in the dead air before Big Ben's first bong

Is it because there used to be the Welsh Home Service, Scottish Home
Service etc so the Home Service was considered to be English.  They are
trying to show that Radio 4 is a UK wide service though who knows what

Hi Ian,

The UK part was added after the frequency change of 1978 when Radio 4 moved
to long wave as it now also served Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
where previously it had only really served England, with Radios Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland providing a service for the nations. The UK was
dropped a number of years ago though, wasn't it?

because it was the successor to the Home Service which was not available

The Home service had been regional on MW (in metres), eg the North
Home Service received in Sheffield. As I recall BH used to distribute
Basic Home Service for regions to opt in or out of. Once it moved to
LW we all got the same, London that is. I guess Radio 4 gets the UK
bit added to point up that it is not regional any more.

Life was so easy then, my crystal set only received the North Home
Service on MW and the Light Programme on LW. Luxemburg had to wait
until I got a receiver with an acorn valve.

I understand, but I'm not entirely convinced.

I qualified for a 'perk' company car in the mid 1990s, but when I looked
carefully at the scheme the cash option was better. I know there were
some tax incentives when the BBC started to do it in the late 1980s and
that these had been reduced by the time it affected me, but even so, it
didn't do anything to help the culture of the organisation.
