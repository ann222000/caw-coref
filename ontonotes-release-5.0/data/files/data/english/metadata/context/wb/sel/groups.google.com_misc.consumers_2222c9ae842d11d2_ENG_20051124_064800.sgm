other people who each have the same card and might want to sell them.
The card has no expiration date and no fees. Its value can be
verified at any Best Buy store or at BestBuy.com or by calling
toll-free 888-716-7994. If you want to buy the card, reply to

"/> The most likely reason why a person might sell a Best Buy gift card
instead of using it at Best Buy is that they would rather have the
cash than something from Best Buy. Hope that clarifies it for you.

There's no risk of any kind of scam here. The card is in Best Buy's
database, and can be verified easily, online or by phone. The
automated verification announcement will include the exact balance on
the card. The person who buys the card can verify it before leaving
here with it. The card has a scratch off security code, which has not
been scratched yet. It's a fancy card design which is extremely hard
to counterfeit. Overall it's more secure than U.S. currency.

If someone wants to give smaller gift cards, simply take this one to
Best Buy and use it to buy the smaller ones. There are no taxes or
fees or expiration dates on any of the cards. The price of each at
Best Buy is its full face value. For example if you would rather have
12 $25 cards for $260, simply take this one to Best Buy and use it to
buy those 12. So you would be paying $21.67 per $25 card.

When you added that statement your &quot;fraud factor&quot; went up about 500%. It
went from a guy trying to move a card he didn't want, to a guy who's got a
racket going. Someone at Best Buy stealing for you? Maybe their LP

Lots of people are spending $300 at Best Buy today. Doesn't anyone
want $40 free? I really need that $260 ASAP. I would even agree to
go to Best Buy with you while you spend the $300, if that would help.

I'm selling the card in Orlando. The buyer would come to my place,
buy the card, verify it, then leave my place with the card in hand.

To verify it, there is a toll free number, or you can verify it on
Best Buy's website, or both. The verification gives you the exact
card balance, which is $300.

The card is brand new, the security code is not scratched off yet, and
Best Buy gift cards are very secure. People are just being silly
thinking this might be a scam. I just happen to need cash to pay
bills and don't happen to need anything at Best Buy right now. If I
didn't need cash I wouldn't sell the card, but just keep it till I
need it, which I probably will sometime in the next few months.

"/> I notice several things about you postings:

You have yet to answer the question about why &quot;several other people&quot; happen
to have the same card and might want to sell them.

You have spoken great lengths about the security of the card and that you
need the money. You have yet to explain how you happen to be in possesion
of such a card.

Many gift cards need to be activated at the a cash register when purchased
to be valid. Perhaps this is one.

How come your user name has a Washington state zipcode as part of it?

Sounds to me like there is an excellent possibility the cards are stolen
and not yet discovered as such by Best Buy.

Or are part of one of the many &quot;gift card spam mail schemes&quot; and are only
valid after completing another purchase or subscription.

responding to their posts, because, if their silly logic goes
unchallenged, someone who might actually want to buy the card, might
get confused, and decide not to reply. Most of the trolls are
probably bored children, but someone reading the thread might not be
aware of that.

The card is as good as gold. The only reason to believe it might have
any problem at all is that a number of bored children have been
posting stupid theories about why anyone would want to sell a $300
card for $260. They don't have enough experience with real life, to
understand that some people run out of money, and have to pay bills,
and that you can't pay bills with stuff from Best Buy.

what the commotion was, when the person started screaming and shouting

Besides that, I'm sure Best Buy doesn't allow outsiders to sell stuff
on their property.

And if you could read a little better, you would realize by now that
the person who buys this from me will verify it with Best Buy, via
their website and/or toll free number, at the time they buy it from
me. How could it be bogus if Best Buy verifies it? The same database
system that verifies it also authorizes it when you use it at Best
Buy.

Just like you can shop in a big store like Walmart, Kmart, Target,
etc., and verify how much you will pay, before you get to the cash
register, by using a price check scanner, located conveniently around
the store. You will know the price it gives is the price you pay,
because the same database system that gives you that price also
charges you that price at the cash register. That's the same thing
that happens when you verify a Best Buy gift card and then use it.

Go away moron troll.

You mean . . . you don't have fun playing with people? It's free
entertainment, and it's SO much better than the stuff you hav to pay
for. If you get into other kinds of entertainment, enjoy it; but allow
me to enjoy mine, too. Just have fun with life!

Ya know, I'm pretty cynical too, but you worry a lot about facts
not in evidence, or things already well-documented and clarified.

You *can* verify the value of Best Buy gift cards online and by
phone. It's certainly possible that a company gave them as
bonuses to employees and therefore the poster would know others
that have them too. It's not unusual around here, in any case,
for people to offer to sell gift cards for cash (but unless the
discount is substantial why bother?).

Since you're so interested, why don't you carry on your
negotiations via e-mail?

&gt; I notice several things about you postings:

&gt; You have yet to answer the question about why &quot;several other people&quot; happen
&gt; to have the same card and might want to sell them.

&gt; You have spoken great lengths about the security of the card and that you
&gt; need the money. You have yet to explain how you happen to be in possesion
&gt; of such a card.

&gt; Many gift cards need to be activated at the a cash register when purchased
&gt; to be valid. Perhaps this is one.

&gt; How come your user name has a Washington state zipcode as part of it?

&gt; Sounds to me like there is an excellent possibility the cards are stolen
&gt; and not yet discovered as such by Best Buy.

&gt; Or are part of one of the many &quot;gift card spam mail schemes&quot; and are only
&gt; valid after completing another purchase or subscription.

&gt; Caveat Emptor!!! (&quot;A fool and his money are soon parted&quot;)
