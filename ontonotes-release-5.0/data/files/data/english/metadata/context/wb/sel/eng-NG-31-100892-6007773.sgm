BACK IN THE U.S.A / GEORGIA ON MY MIND

Missed the runway, coming in to land at JFK
and I threw up in a paper bag

It was in September, on a black Tuesday
then everyone was waving flags

I'm back in the U.S. of A., Back in the U.S. of A, boy
Back in the U.S. of A. !!!

Things had changed so much, I hardly knew the place
A fearful public hid at home
Thugs even sabotaging the election race-
building empires, like the days of Rome

It might as well be the USSR, boy
To the Right, it had moved so far, boy
Back in the U.S., back in the U.S,
Back in the U.S. of A. !!!

I guess human beings just cannot seem to see the light
Man, I had a dreadful flight

Making war, their way to try to win the peace
Man, it was a deadly fight

Might as well be in the former USSR, boy
The President's behavior is slightly bizarre, boys

Back in the US, Back in the US,
Back in the U.S. of A. !!!

When you got Big Brother always listening in
then you know, at least, you're not alone

Now, I think the NSA is likely on the way
Honey, disconnect the phone

It might as well be the former USSR, boy
Even got an Intelligence "Czar", boys

Back in the U.S, Back in the U.S.,
Back in the U.S. of A !!!

Those Moscow boys are trying to come out,
but they're not allowed to parade-ADE-ADE-ADE
Those Georgia boys are a real knock-out
Someday will throw a grenade-ADE-ADE-ADE
-AID-AID-AID-AID-AID-AID-AID!

Cracking down on dissent, now
Lucky if adults can still consent, now

Back in the US of A...

You really can't go on this way, oppressing gays
Try adopting a more civil tone
They can pinch you in a very painful way
It best to leave the folks alone

Back in the US of A...

Our country loves to brag, boy
But Gitmo's like a gulag, boy

Back in the U.S, Back in the U.S.,
Back in the U.S. of A !!!

Turn the clocks back, honey, on Stone Mountain, way down South
Take me to the Neely Farm

Let me hear the Dixie banjos ringing out,
Burning crosses to keep warm

Now, I'm studying at Georgia Tech, boy
Goin' down the track to a train wreck, boy

Back in the U.S, Back in the U.S.,
Back in the U.S. of A !!!

That Georgia's always on my, my, my, my mind...

55. RealClearPolitics - Articles - Georgia -- On Moscow's Mind
Since the 1990s, Moscow has supported secessionists in Abkhazia
and South Ossetia, who wish to break free of Georgia and rejoin
Russia. Putin has lately met with the leaders of both regions

Not the one Hoagy Carmichael had in mind, either (which wasn't
written about the state anyway). Authorities in the Republic of
Georgia are reporting that a man was caught trying to sell a
small amount of Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU). That would be
what is also known as "weapons grade" uranium. The quantity was
only about 3.5 ounces, but the man reportedly said he had access
to a lot more where that came from.

"I would like to call attention to the
tornado which ripped Fort Valley apart
recently," Rev. Dees continued. "My
immediate reaction to the news of the
tornado was, "This is the voice of God."
The town of Fort Valley is harboring
Solomist.  Would one expect God to keep
silent when homosexuals are tolerated?
We remember what He did to Sodom
and Gomorrah."

Reverend Dees said he had been
advised by the Attorney General's
office of the State of Georgia that there
are State Laws against sodomy and
that under Georgia law, the District
Attorney is the prosecuting officer for
offenses against the state

On June 24, 1998, the Davis Besse nuclear power plant declared
an alert when a tornado touched down in its switchyard.
According to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, eleven
transmission towers near the plant were damaged by the tornado.

REACTOR TALKING POINTS

For Nuclear Regulatory Commission Public Meeting on
Rules for Extending Nuclear Power Reactor Licenses from 40 years
to 60 years
Tuesday July 8, 2003 - NRC meeting starts at 7:00
6:30 pm is a media reception - all welcome
DoubleTree-Atlanta Perimeter
--  6120 Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta

Dr. John Gofman called nuclear power "mass premeditated murder" ?
this is why:

NRC is in denial about the aging of reactors and Table B-1 NEEDS
to be reviewed and used as the basis to phase out reactors by
shortening reactor licenses to 25 years and not granting any new
ones! The Generic Aging Lessons Learned (GALL) process that is
used to verify the components like the reactor pressure vessel
and other fixed pieces of the reactor system was so decrepit and
senile that it completely missed / did not anticipate the
control rod drive mechanism cracking at Duke's Oconee reactors.
All three reactor units at Oconee (Owned by Duke on the Savannah
River Lake in SC) were re-licensed AND then the cracks were
found. NRC took action, and again stumbled blindly into another
near catastrophe - the corrosion at Davis Besse (near Toledo,
Ohio, owned by First Energy).

WASHINGTON, DC -- "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has fined
FirstEnergy Corp.'s nuclear operations unit $55,000 for a safety
culture-related incident five years ago. The agency also named
Georgia-based contractor Williams Power Corp. for violating
federal regulations.

In 1979, when the movie 'The China Syndrome' opened, the nuclear
industry, politicians and the media vilified Jane Fonda, saying
that the plot about a nuclear power accident could not happen.
Eleven days later a similar accident occured at the Three Mile
Island plant in Pennsylvania. No one apologized to her

In the last two years, members of religious minorities in
Georgia have been subjected to increasing violence and
harassment.

The government of Georgia has taken some steps to address the
attacks, but these appear to have been inadequate and
ineffective, giving rise to the impression that those who attack
or harass members of "non-traditional" faiths may do so with
impunity.

The UN Committee Against Torture has expressed concern regarding
"the failure of police to intervene and take appropriate action
despite the existence of legal tools to prevent and prosecute
acts of religious violence" and the lack of an effective and
independent mechanism for filing complaints.

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom wrote
October 4 to national security advisor Condolezza Rice and
Assistant Secretary of State A. Elizabeth Jones to urge that
President Bush raise the issue of religious violence

Commission on International Religious Freedom urges him to raise
the failure of the government of Georgia to address adequately
an alarming increase in religious violence.

I had hopes for better from you," wrote Frank to Condolezza Rice
on February 2.

"I was deeply troubled to learn that the U.S. government,
presumably at your direction, sided with some of the most
undemocratic, anti-human rights regimes in the world in voting
against consultative status for two international organizations,
solely on the grounds that they represent gay and lesbian people,"
Frank continued.
