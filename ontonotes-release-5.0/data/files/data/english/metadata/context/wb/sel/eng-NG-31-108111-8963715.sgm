And so very effective.

I suspected he had a flair for the dramatic from the photo you posted of
him greeting a visiter with a stuffed toy in his mouth.  The look in his eye
said it all.

He's good.

My Dalmatian, Jake, makes a huge point of pouting-laying down with his back
to me and sighing.  When it's a real issue, he'll go into another room and
grumble to himself in a stage whisper.  I have the hardest time not
laughing.

He is reading you like a book, that's for sure!

Those darned smart dogs!

I bet it still didn't work on his heartless, eeevil owner, and you still
left him all alone to guard the frickin' house anyways!

There's nothing to be done about it now -- he'll just sneak them when
you're not around.

He might be game enough to pose for you... When I put my reading glasses
on Queenie, she looks quite intellectual -- however, I have failed to
capture this with the camera.

We have a trip coming up to India, and my friends that will be watching the
dogs are asking us to make sure we are not here for Halloween.  There are
eeevil plans underfoot.

First, they wanted to dress Pan up to look like Dorothy:

Now, they're thinking Pan as Darth Vader and Khan as Princess Leia.

I just think we have to postpone our vacation until after Halloween.

Hey Terri, how's Carmine at doing requests?  I suspect he'll be able to
properly convey how we feel about that.

He can draw on his own recent disappointments -- method acting!

Note to self:  Do not leave Catherine in charge of the dogs around
Halloween.

Exactly.  Can you imagine how good he'd be with all the extra practice?
