The Parents Television Council's findings could prompt Congress to
crack down.

WASHINGTON -- -- Once home to wholesome fare such as &quot;The Waltons&quot; and
&quot;The Cosby Show,&quot; the early evening &quot;family hour&quot; has become just
another seedy destination on broadcast TV unfit for kids, according to
a study released Wednesday by a watchdog group that could fuel the
push for tougher regulation of the public airwaves.

Sex and violence during the early prime-time slot have increased
significantly during the last six years, the Parents Television
Council found. And although use of foul language has decreased,
stronger words are more plentiful and are bleeped out in a way that
enables children to easily fill in the blanks.

&quot;There is no longer a family hour,&quot; said Timothy Winter, the group's
president. &quot;For people who grew up watching &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; or &quot;The
Wonderful World of Disney&quot; . . . those days are gone.&quot;

For years, broadcasters voluntarily reserved the time slot from 8 p.m.
to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday -- and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday --
for programs suitable for children. But the family hour began changing
25 years ago when the National Assn. of Broadcasters' code of conduct
was struck down because of antitrust concerns.

Winter hopes his group's findings will pressure networks to clean up
their early evening programs.

&quot;This is the perfect opportunity to look squarely at the facts, step
up and say, 'We've gone awry and we should restore it,' &quot; Winter said
of the family hour.

Yes, censorship from the government is always preferable to self-policing.
You can't really expect parents to control what their kids watch on TV,
can you?  If you are easily offended by strong language, you may not want
to read these upcoming sentences:  Fuckwit assholes like YOU are much more
of a problem than all the &quot;sex and violence&quot; the TV broadcasters could
ever produce.  Turn off your mother-fucking TV if you don't like what is
on!  Why are you so afraid of being in control of your own life?

No, thank the conservatives who worship money and who will sell
anything to the highest bidder.  It has been the conservatives
who have sold the airwaves and who have given free rein to the
corporate interests, valuing money above &quot;decency&quot;.

Once again you push the Big Lie, blaming others for your own complete
lack of morals.
