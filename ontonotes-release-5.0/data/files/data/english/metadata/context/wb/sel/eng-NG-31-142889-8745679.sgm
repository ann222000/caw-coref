Joseph Chambers presents the argument that Benny Hinn, upon his claims of
talking to &quot;dead saints&quot; is actually claiming to be engaging in necromany,
an occultic practice condemned by the Bible. Hinn also claims to have
physically seen God on multiple occasions. However does the Bible teach that
we can ever physically see God? If so, when and under what circumstances?
Some points to consider when encountering the claims of Benny Hinn.

May God bless,

Benny Hinn and Necromancy (Talking to the Dead)
by Joseph R. Chambers

The following excerpts from a message by Benny Hinn are quite revealing as
to the direction of the Charismatic insanity. Benny Hinn is clearly their
leading star and much of the church world seems oblivious of his Biblical
departure. Necromancy is communication with the dead and is absolutely
forbidden by Holy Scripture. Moses stated, &quot;There shall not be found among
you [any one] that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire,
[or] that useth divination, [or] an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a
witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a
necromancer.&quot; (Deuteronomy 18:10-11).

Isaiah added a clear warning that we are to seek our God by seeking His law
and His testimony and if we seek any other source or spirit it is because
there is no light in us. Listen to Isaiah, &quot;And when they shall say unto
you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep,
and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to
the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to
this word, [it is] because [there is] no light in them.&quot; (Isaiah 8:19-20).

Look at these statements made by Mr. Hinn at the Blaisdale Arena, Honolulu,
HI, on February 28, 1997.

&quot;I've know moments of such anointings, it's really hard for me to describe
those moments. I've known moments when I've not only felt the presence of
God, I've smelled the presence of God. I did this morning right here. And
others around me smelled the fragrance of frankincense. In Detroit,
Michigan, so great was the presence of God, the entire building filled up
with a mist and we began to breathe in and smell it, frankincense, presence
of the Lord. Steve Brock, you smelled it with me and Ron . . . I've seen the
presence of God. I've not only felt it. I've not only smelled it. I've seen
it with my own eyes.&quot;

&quot;He's more real to me than my own children. Do you know something? that is
difficult for me to explain I'm just gonna tell you. Whenever I talk to Him,
I see Him. I can tell you what He wears, I can tell you what color He has
on. I've seen that so many times. I'm, I'm talking about regular. When I
talk to the Lord at times I see Him wearing a, a, a, often most times I'd
see Him blue, beautiful, almost like a silkish-looking garment. And under it
would be white garment. A white and a scarlet garment. I've seen Him at
times when just pure white altogether. You say, 'When do you see Him?' I don't
know, I just see Him. And often when I see Him, I know whether He is pleased
with me or displeased with me. There's been times when I see Him with a
smile. Other times I've seen Him with a very serious look. Other times I
couldn't really tell it's almost like a mist around His face I couldn't
tell. I don't understand why He allows me to see that. But I do. And He
speaks to me so clearly. He tells me to say things and do things and pray
even for things. You know, I ask Him questions that most people probably don't
ask Him. Example, I said, 'Lord, show my my future. Actually, I had a
vision. I saw myself as an old man with white hair and I had a dark suit on
with stripes, and my girls . . . thirties, old thirties, and they had
beautiful curly hair. They looked like Dino's wife. What's her name? Dino's
wife? Gary's sister? Sharon. I said, 'Lord, how long will I live?' He told
me. He said, 'Sixty-nine. If you take care of yourself, seventy-three.' So I
want to buy a treadmill. I've asked Him these kind of things. I've asked him
things about people.&quot;

&quot;This is recently. I'm not talking about a long time ago. He was about six
feet two. Old man. Had a beard. White-like Norvelles jacket. Glistening
white beard. His face was somewhat thin. But, very bold! Eyes - crystal
blue. He had on a white garment; whiter than my shirt could ever get. On his
head was a shawl, like a, like a covering. He looked like a priest. Every
part of him glistened like crystal. And I spoke out and I said, 'Lord, who
is this man I see?' I know you may, you may think I lost my mind, but the
Lord said, 'Elijah, the prophet!' I never heard the Lord say that to me you
know when that happened? That happened days before the anointing on my life
doubled. Literally, the ministries' anointing doubled after that. I've never
shared this, I've been scared people are going to think he's gone crazy!
And, it happened twice! Two nights; one and the next day. And right after
that, the anointing on this ministry doubled. Now, I don't understand why
the Lord allowed me to see that. I've not just seen angels; I've seen
saints. Can I tell you? This might even shock you a little more. The Lord
gave me a vision of Kathryn Kuhlman sitting with what seemed to be a group
of people . . . and every one of them seemed to be urging me to pray. Now, I
know this sounds crazy, but it's all right. I don't mind crazy because I
liked what I saw . . . I was in prayer at uh, least hours . . . At least
fifty to seventy of them sitting in a group, and they were saying to me,
'Pray! Ask God to give you a healing ministry that will touch the world! And
suddenly, I heard Kathryn's voice and suddenly there she was its crystal
clear. And she in her beautiful smile, she said, 'Ask! We're waiting for you
to ask! We're praying with you to ask!' And the vision disappeared. And
suddenly I said, 'Lord!' And I asked. A week later the anointing hit my
life. I believe the saints in Heaven urge us to pray. Urge us to do it! Do
you know why I believe it? It's in the Bible! You say, 'Show it to me.'
Jesus saw Moses and Elijah who came to talk to Him about His passion on the
cross! Ladies and gentlemen, there is way more than what you know about God!
And the reason I'm telling you all of this? The Lord said to me only a few
days ago. He said, 'You're about to come to a new level. Get ready!' And I'm
already feeling the rumblings in the heavenlies. Somebody is about to talk
to me again. Something is about to happen again. I don't know what it is. I'm
so excited, I feel butterflies in my tummy. I feel something. I've had three
prophets lately, absolutely, people that know the voice of God that have
said to me, 'You're about to walk into a new inheritance in the spirit.' I
don't know what it is, when it is, but it's coming. And tonight, the Lord is
putting it upon my heart to pray for you that you should walk into a new
inheritance in the Holy Ghost.&quot; (Excerpted from message presented at the
Blaisdale Arena, Honolulu, HI, 2/28/97).

Notice that he stated clearly that he had seen saints (&quot;dead saints&quot;) and
that they talked to him, gave him instructions, and told him they were
praying for him. This is clearly necromancy or communication with the dead.
He went further to state that his necromancy was Biblically supported by
Jesus Christ's experience on the Mount of Transfiguration when Moses and
Elijah talked to the Lord.

Watch carefully men such as Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Kenneth Hagin, and
Paul Crouch, etc. Men in error always continue to descend into deeper and
deeper error. It's the natural evolution of evil and Satan's kingdom. The
whole theory of evolution is a satanic contrast of God's truth and
revelation. Truth is progressive and uplifting, while evolution is
regressive and destructive.

Benny and his wife BOTH are an abomination to Christianity.

I think this article is a little &quot;out there&quot;.  Not that I'm defending
Hinn, Copeland, Crouch, et al - but that I think that Hinn's merely a
master showman and doesn't seriously believe his schtick.  If he
*really* believed he was talking to the dead, that would be one thing,
but seriously, I think he is a master manipulator, nothing more.  He
works very hard at making his followers believe that he believes his
act, but does he believe what he sells?

I don't believe for one minute that he does.

&gt; &gt; liked what I saw . . . I was in prayer at uh, least hours . . . At least
&gt; &gt; fifty to seventy of them sitting in a group, and they were saying to me,
&gt; &gt; 'Pray! Ask God to give you a healing ministry that will touch the world! And
&gt; &gt; suddenly, I heard Kathryn's voice and suddenly there she was its crystal
&gt; &gt; clear. And she in her beautiful smile, she said, 'Ask! We're waiting for you
&gt; &gt; to ask! We're praying with you to ask!' And the vision disappeared. And
&gt; &gt; suddenly I said, 'Lord!' And I asked. A week later the anointing hit my
&gt; &gt; life. I believe the saints in Heaven urge us to pray. Urge us to do it! Do
&gt; &gt; you know why I believe it? It's in the Bible! You say, 'Show it to me.'
&gt; &gt; Jesus saw Moses and Elijah who came to talk to Him about His passion on the
&gt; &gt; cross! Ladies and gentlemen, there is way more than what you know about God!
&gt; &gt; And the reason I'm telling you all of this? The Lord said to me only a few
&gt; &gt; days ago. He said, 'You're about to come to a new level. Get ready!' And I'm
&gt; &gt; already feeling the rumblings in the heavenlies. Somebody is about to talk
&gt; &gt; to me again. Something is about to happen again. I don't know what it is. I'm
&gt; &gt; so excited, I feel butterflies in my tummy. I feel something. I've had three
&gt; &gt; prophets lately, absolutely, people that know the voice of God that have
&gt; &gt; said to me, 'You're about to walk into a new inheritance in the spirit.' I
&gt; &gt; don't know what it is, when it is, but it's coming. And tonight, the Lord is
&gt; &gt; putting it upon my heart to pray for you that you should walk into a new
&gt; &gt; inheritance in the Holy Ghost.&quot; (Excerpted from message presented at the
&gt; &gt; Blaisdale Arena, Honolulu, HI, 2/28/97).

&gt; &gt; Notice that he stated clearly that he had seen saints (&quot;dead saints&quot;) and
&gt; &gt; that they talked to him, gave him instructions, and told him they were
&gt; &gt; praying for him. This is clearly necromancy or communication with the dead.
&gt; &gt; He went further to state that his necromancy was Biblically supported by
&gt; &gt; Jesus Christ's experience on the Mount of Transfiguration when Moses and
&gt; &gt; Elijah talked to the Lord.

&gt; &gt; Watch carefully men such as Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Kenneth Hagin, and
&gt; &gt; Paul Crouch, etc. Men in error always continue to descend into deeper and
&gt; &gt; deeper error. It's the natural evolution of evil and Satan's kingdom. The
&gt; &gt; whole theory of evolution is a satanic contrast of God's truth and
&gt; &gt; revelation. Truth is progressive and uplifting, while evolution is
&gt; &gt; regressive and destructive.

&gt; I think this article is a little &quot;out there&quot;.  Not that I'm defending
&gt; Hinn, Copeland, Crouch, et al - but that I think that Hinn's merely a
&gt; master showman and doesn't seriously believe his schtick.  If he
&gt; *really* believed he was talking to the dead, that would be one thing,
&gt; but seriously, I think he is a master manipulator, nothing more.  He
&gt; works very hard at making his followers believe that he believes his
&gt; act, but does he believe what he sells?

&gt; I don't believe for one minute that he does.

&gt;&gt; Benny Hinn and Necromancy (Talking to the Dead)
&gt;&gt; by Joseph R. Chambers

&gt;&gt; The following excerpts from a message by Benny Hinn are quite revealing as
&gt;&gt; to the direction of the Charismatic insanity. Benny Hinn is clearly their
&gt;&gt; leading star and much of the church world seems oblivious of his Biblical
&gt;&gt; departure. Necromancy is communication with the dead and is absolutely
&gt;&gt; forbidden by Holy Scripture. Moses stated, &quot;There shall not be found among
&gt;&gt; you [any one] that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire,
&gt;&gt; [or] that useth divination, [or] an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a
&gt;&gt; witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a
&gt;&gt; necromancer.&quot; (Deuteronomy 18:10-11).

&gt;&gt; Isaiah added a clear warning that we are to seek our God by seeking His law
&gt;&gt; and His testimony and if we seek any other source or spirit it is because
&gt;&gt; there is no light in us. Listen to Isaiah, &quot;And when they shall say unto
&gt;&gt; you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep,
&gt;&gt; and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to
&gt;&gt; the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to
&gt;&gt; this word, [it is] because [there is] no light in them.&quot; (Isaiah 8:19-20).

&gt;&gt; Look at these statements made by Mr. Hinn at the Blaisdale Arena, Honolulu,
&gt;&gt; HI, on February 28, 1997.

&gt;&gt; &quot;I've know moments of such anointings, it's really hard for me to describe
&gt;&gt; those moments. I've known moments when I've not only felt the presence of
&gt;&gt; God, I've smelled the presence of God. I did this morning right here. And
&gt;&gt; others around me smelled the fragrance of frankincense. In Detroit,
&gt;&gt; Michigan, so great was the presence of God, the entire building filled up
&gt;&gt; with a mist and we began to breathe in and smell it, frankincense, presence
&gt;&gt; of the Lord. Steve Brock, you smelled it with me and Ron . . . I've seen the
&gt;&gt; presence of God. I've not only felt it. I've not only smelled it. I've seen
&gt;&gt; it with my own eyes.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &quot;He's more real to me than my own children. Do you know something? that is
&gt;&gt; difficult for me to explain I'm just gonna tell you. Whenever I talk to Him,
&gt;&gt; I see Him. I can tell you what He wears, I can tell you what color He has
&gt;&gt; on. I've seen that so many times. I'm, I'm talking about regular. When I
&gt;&gt; talk to the Lord at times I see Him wearing a, a, a, often most times I'd
&gt;&gt; see Him blue, beautiful, almost like a silkish-looking garment. And under it
&gt;&gt; would be white garment. A white and a scarlet garment. I've seen Him at
&gt;&gt; times when just pure white altogether. You say, 'When do you see Him?' I don't
&gt;&gt; know, I just see Him. And often when I see Him, I know whether He is pleased
&gt;&gt; with me or displeased with me. There's been times when I see Him with a
&gt;&gt; smile. Other times I've seen Him with a very serious look. Other times I
&gt;&gt; couldn't really tell it's almost like a mist around His face I couldn't
&gt;&gt; tell. I don't understand why He allows me to see that. But I do. And He
&gt;&gt; speaks to me so clearly. He tells me to say things and do things and pray
&gt;&gt; even for things. You know, I ask Him questions that most people probably don't
&gt;&gt; ask Him. Example, I said, 'Lord, show my my future. Actually, I had a
&gt;&gt; vision. I saw myself as an old man with white hair and I had a dark suit on
&gt;&gt; with stripes, and my girls . . . thirties, old thirties, and they had
&gt;&gt; beautiful curly hair. They looked like Dino's wife. What's her name? Dino's
&gt;&gt; wife? Gary's sister? Sharon. I said, 'Lord, how long will I live?' He told
&gt;&gt; me. He said, 'Sixty-nine. If you take care of yourself, seventy-three.' So I
&gt;&gt; want to buy a treadmill. I've asked Him these kind of things. I've asked him
&gt;&gt; things about people.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &quot;This is recently. I'm not talking about a long time ago. He was about six
&gt;&gt; feet two. Old man. Had a beard. White-like Norvelles jacket. Glistening
&gt;&gt; white beard. His face was somewhat thin. But, very bold! Eyes - crystal
&gt;&gt; blue. He had on a white garment; whiter than my shirt could ever get. On his
&gt;&gt; head was a shawl, like a, like a covering. He looked like a priest. Every
&gt;&gt; part of him glistened like crystal. And I spoke out and I said, 'Lord, who
&gt;&gt; is this man I see?' I know you may, you may think I lost my mind, but the
&gt;&gt; Lord said, 'Elijah, the prophet!' I never heard the Lord say that to me you
&gt;&gt; know when that happened? That happened days before the anointing on my life
&gt;&gt; doubled. Literally, the ministries' anointing doubled after that. I've never
&gt;&gt; shared this, I've been scared people are going to think he's gone crazy!
&gt;&gt; And, it happened twice! Two nights; one and the next day. And right after
&gt;&gt; that, the anointing on this ministry doubled. Now, I don't understand why
&gt;&gt; the Lord allowed me to see that. I've not just seen angels; I've seen
&gt;&gt; saints. Can I tell you? This might even shock you a little more. The Lord
&gt;&gt; gave me a vision of Kathryn Kuhlman sitting with what seemed to be a group
&gt;&gt; of people . . . and every one of them seemed to be urging me to pray. Now, I
&gt;&gt; know this sounds crazy, but it's all right. I don't mind crazy because I
&gt;&gt; liked what I saw . . . I was in prayer at uh, least hours . . . At least
&gt;&gt; fifty to seventy of them sitting in a group, and they were saying to me,

I remember when a news organization (ABC I think) followed up on several of
Hinn's &quot;healings&quot; and found a 0% success rate. There are some Christian
organizations that did followups as well and found none of Hinn's healings
ever were truly healed. He's also made several claims in public that he's
raised people from the dead but never clarifies where, when or to whom this
happened intentionally making it impossible for verification. The man is a
proven false teacher, a heretic and a con artist using God as his platform
to deceive.

Exactly, Carl.
He uses paid 'victims' and in fact, if a terminally ill person
requests healing, that person is turned away. There was quite an
uproar over that some time ago, but alas, he is still preaching,
falsely teaching, and leeching.....

Well it is very difficult to pick up a bundle of logs with two arm when
you only have one.

I remember a black boy aged about twelve on the show with his father
standing behind him with a hand on each of his shoulders.  the black boy
was recounting in a very embarrassed and uncomfortable way way how he
lost the use of his arm and that god gave it back to him. [Perhaps the
boy was baulking at telling lies]

I could see his father tightening his grip on his shoulders and I
imagine, muttering under his breath &quot;Mess this one up boy and you are in
for a hard time; we need that cheque from Benny&quot;

And what is all this pushing the forehead of the performer so he or she
falls back into the arms of Benny's henchmen?  Don't tell me this is not
reheased beforehand !  Anyone have a clue what it is supposed to show or
mean?

&gt; Exactly, Carl.
&gt; He uses paid 'victims' and in fact, if a terminally ill person
&gt; requests healing, that person is turned away. There was quite an
&gt; uproar over that some time ago, but alas, he is still preaching,
&gt; falsely teaching, and leeching.....

On his frequent visits to The Philippines he has an audience of around twenty
thousand.
The human brainb is a strange thing - trouble is it will end up killing us all.

I understand he travels the world in his private jet.  Can he sleep nights?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Joseph Chambers presents the argument that Benny Hinn, upon his claims of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;talking to &quot;dead saints&quot; is actually claiming to be engaging in necromany,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;an occultic practice condemned by the Bible. Hinn also claims to have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;physically seen God on multiple occasions. However does the Bible teach that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;we can ever physically see God? If so, when and under what circumstances?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Some points to consider when encountering the claims of Benny Hinn.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Benny and his wife BOTH are an abomination to Christianity.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; He also claimed that &quot;Jesus will stand onstage with me!&quot; to his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; audience......... strangely enough, that hasn't occurred yet!!!!!! :o)

&gt;&gt; &gt;I wouldn't mind my bank balance being a couple of million behind his bank
&gt;&gt; &gt;balance!

&gt;&gt; &gt;What was it in the bible some primitive wrote about a rich man nt getting to
&gt;&gt; &gt;heaven,
&gt;&gt; &gt;something to do with the eye of a needle !

&gt;&gt; Yep --
&gt;&gt; Mat 19:24  And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go
&gt;&gt; through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the
&gt;&gt; kingdom of God.

&gt;&gt; But as for money, I'd rather earn mine honestly than swindle people.

&gt;On that I totally agree.

Exactly, Bob.
The performances onstage are laughable sometimes, but I find I can
only watch that 'show' for a maximum of 3 to 5 minutes. I laugh at
first, but then I feel strong anger coming over me like a black
cloud.... he's so phony, the stench comes through the TV, so to speak!
I have to turn to another channel to get rid of that anger I ALWAYS
get whenever Hinn is on.

The people he's paying to let on they're healed are just as guilty,
IMO.

Anyone who could fall for a phony baloney performance like that needs
their head examined!

Have you seen him hissssssssssssssss  like a snake yet?
It's so ridiculous.
One performance I was watching. Hinn let on he was being 'slain in
the Spirit'. of course, his flunkies caught him as he 'collapsed'!
He was letting on he was 'speaking in tongues' - all the while holding
the blasted mike to his mouth !!!!
What a performance. But still, the audience were waving their hands
in the air, shouting Hallelujah, Praise the Lord, etc...... Mass
hysteria is all I can put those audiences down to.

Oh yes, Bob- nothing but the best for dear Benny, you know!!!!!1

ALL at his audiences' expense, no doubt... but still they fall for his

Live I've said so many times before, even a fish wouldn't get into

&gt;    Perhaps the preacher was just reading a portion of the Bible he

&gt; of the people in the congregation hadn't read that passage lately, and
&gt; he felt-- for whatever reason-- that it might be a good thing to bring
&gt; up.

&gt;  We ARE allowed to believe as we see fit.

&gt;  What YOU are doing-- no matter how you choose to dress it up -- it's
&gt; called &quot;persecution.&quot;

&gt;  Do you ridicule Jews openly?  Do you ridicule Muslims openly?
&gt;  Likely not.
&gt;   The Jews have an organization that actively prosecutes and monitors
&gt; people who point fingers at them and snicker.

&gt;  I bet money you would not OPENLY ridicule Muslims.  There are likely
&gt; enough &quot;hit squads&quot; out there that your days would be numbered.

&gt; So why do you ridicule Christians OPENLY?

&gt;   You're a COWARD who doesn't have any CLASS, and you don't fear
&gt; retribution because the Christians you are aware of aren't threatening
&gt; to retaliate.

&gt;  In short, you have chosen what you believe are &quot;easy targets.&quot;

&gt; The people he's paying to let on they're healed are just as guilty,

&gt; Anyone who could fall for a phony baloney performance like that needs
&gt; their head examined!

&gt; Have you seen him hissssssssssssssss  like a snake yet?
&gt;  It's so ridiculous.
&gt;  One performance I was watching. Hinn let on he was being 'slain in
&gt; the Spirit'. of course, his flunkies caught him as he 'collapsed'!
&gt; He was letting on he was 'speaking in tongues' - all the while holding
&gt; the blasted mike to his mouth !!!!
&gt;  What a performance. But still, the audience were waving their hands
&gt; in the air, shouting Hallelujah, Praise the Lord, etc...... Mass
&gt; hysteria is all I can put those audiences down to.

Yes, and why do some of us crave for this.  Maybe a qualified shrink out
there can let us in on the secret ?

I kinda thought so - but when he said he was a non-believer of all
manmade gods, I wondered.

In america it has reached the stage of being akin to a pop concert -
entertainment pure and simple.

A shrink once claimed that all living things are motivated purely by
'gratification'. In the basic form, say for the Tape Worm -food and sex.

But how many things we humans do can be classified under that self same
heading?

Gathering together to 'sing the praises of an imaginary god' is surely one
of 'em

Cheers

Bob
