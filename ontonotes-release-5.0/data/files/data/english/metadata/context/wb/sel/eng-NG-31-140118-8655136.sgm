This is the worst kind of corporate welfare imaginable.

I wish I could get the government to require that people purchase products
from my business.  Maybe I haven't donated enough to her campaign?

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070917/ap_on_el_pr/clinton_health_care

&quot;Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is unveiling a
sweeping health care proposal Monday that would require everyone to carry
health insurance and offer federal subsidies to help reduce the cost of
coverage.&quot;

You do know this is just the plan Mitt Romney saddled Massachusetts
with, right? You do know that, right? I mean, it's the actual plan you
dislike, not the person proposing, right?

Halliburton receives payment for services rendered.  You could argue that
they're overpaid (and I would agree with you), but the situation isn't even

David, I've been reading your posts and examining your arguments and
logic, and I have to say that I agree with you: A single payer, not for
profit health care system is the only answer. That and your point that
campaign finance reform and lobbying restrictions are sorely needed.

and the greater good could not be advocating a system that leaves 45
people without access to health care.

If you don't already then you are in the minority. Bush has handed out
more actual corporate welfare than any president in history.

Still waiting for an actual example that actually supports your original
claim. So far all you've provided are empty statements lacking any

There are alternatives to *insurance* that you can use.

http://www.cnicnet.com/

&quot;There are four ways to accomplish financial responsibility:
1. Coverage by a motor vehicle or automobile liability insurance policy;
2. A cash deposit of $35,000 with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV);
3. A certificate of self-insurance issued by DMV to owners of fleets of more than 25 vehicles; or
4. A surety bond for $35,000 obtained from an insurance company licensed to do business in California.

The way I read CA law, some form of insurance against
liability is required.  Maybe you meant that it didn't have
to come from an insurance company per se, but could be
covered in some other way, such as a cash deposit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So you think requiring you carry car insurance is corporate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; welfare?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You don't have to *specifically* carry car insurance - at least
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not in CA.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be interested in a cite to a source for the proposition that CA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does not require the registered owner of a motor vehicle to carry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liability insurance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I just did at 6:17 AM post to this thread.

&gt;&gt; The way I read CA law, some form of insurance against liability is
&gt;&gt; required.  Maybe you meant that it didn't have to come from an
&gt;&gt; insurance company per se, but could be covered in some other way,
&gt;&gt; such as a cash deposit.

&gt; Yes.

&gt; A &quot;chioce&quot; far outside the ability for the average Californian to
&gt; consider.
">

Oddly though, it seems that Hillary's plan would allow a similar
alternative to buying health coverage from a traditional insurer. But we
won't expect Goldberg to acknowledge that.

So I suggest that the next time someone hits your car, you tell them
that you will pay for all damages because you don't think they should

Medicare is voluntary, although there is an element of
coercion in that if you don't sign up the first year you are
eligible it costs you more to sign up each succeeding year
you wait.
