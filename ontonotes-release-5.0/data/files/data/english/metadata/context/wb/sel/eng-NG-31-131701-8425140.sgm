VENICE, Italy - Bill Murray says he was just dropping people after a
party when he was stopped in downtown Stockholm driving a golf cart.

The police &quot;asked me to come over and they assumed that I was drunk and
I explained to them that I was a golfer,&quot; Murray told reporters Monday
at the Venice Film Festival, where he appeared before the premiere of
his new film &quot;The Darjeeling Limited,&quot; which also stars Adrien Brody,
Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson.

The star of 1980's &quot;Caddyshack&quot; said he was in Stockholm last month to
play in a pro-am golf tournament, and hitched a ride to a post-event
party in a golf cart. When no one wanted to drive home, he volunteered.

&quot;I ended up stopping and dropping people off on the way like a bus. I
had about six people in the thing and I dropped them off one at a time.

He said police called him over as he was dropping the last couple off
at a 7-Eleven, adding &quot;I didn't know they had 7-Elevens in Stockholm.&quot;

Swedish police took a blood test after the actor refused a breath test.
He could face drunken driving charges.

It's not illegal to drive a golf cart through downtown Stockholm, just unsual.

Peace,

*heh*  Go Bill!

I happened to flip by Showtime yesterday morning just as &quot;Meatballs&quot; was
starting.  While not as funny as &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (few are, in my book) it
still makes me laugh a lot whenever I watch it.

Stripes IS great.  I love Bill Murray.  Ever since he sang &quot;Star Wars&quot;
as the lounge singer in SNL.
I even liked Lost In Translation, but really liked The Life Aquatic.
(Weird that Owen Wilson tried to off himself...)
