Hi All,

There is a long discussion ongoing in rec.aviation.piloting about what
causes lift on a plane.  You can read from the link below.  Please
note that about 80% of the post are mostly ad hominem attacks and
should be ignored.  There are some small bits of real discussion.

http://groups.google.com/group/rec.aviation.piloting/browse_frm/threa...

I am an electrical engineer with experience in analag design and
software, with math and physics background that you would expect of an
electrical engineer.

There are many points made in the discussion, but I would like to
focus on one in particular for the sake of progress.

There are people in the pilot's group, who think that lift on a wing
is analyzed as such:

1. There is air on outside of top of wing that is pushing down, but
reduced because of aerodynamics.
2. The *inside* of the wing contains air pushing up against the
underside of top of wing .
3. Let us ignore that the same air inside the wing pushes down on the
overside of bottom part of wing.
3. The difference in pressure against the underside of the top wing on
the inside of wing and top of wing on outside, is what gives plane
lift.

Note that they ignore the pressure inside the wing that pushes
downward on the wing.

I am trying to convince them that, if there is air on the inside of
the wing, it pushes against all sides of the inside of the wing,
including both top underside and bottom overside, and thereby
nullifying any effect it would have on the wing. Lift is caused by a
difference in pressure between the underside of the bottom of the
wing, and the overside of the top of the wing.

I count 8-9 people in the group who are utterly convinced that I am
inept at physics, mathematics, etc.

Note that some of these people have been flying aircraft for years,
even decades, while I am still a student pilot.

Comments from anyone who knows physics welcome.

Heh. I know the argument. I think it's broken out here (sci.physics)
many times.

(a) It's the Bernoulli effect due to the shape of the
wing cross-section, the way we were all taught as kids.

(b) No, it's just the angle of attack.

I'm no expert, but I heard enough in similar arguments here
to convince me that the angle-of-attack people are right and
the shape of the wing has more to do with controlling
turbulence.

You can consider that last just a definition of lift. You
won't get lift unless the upward forces are stronger than
then downward forces.

A wing doesn't need to be hollow to fly.

As I said, I lean toward the angle-of-attack arguments now. Take
a flat rectangle, tilt it into the wind. The wind blows against the
front which is also the bottom, not the back/top. So the
forces are on the bottom.

Why does that translate into lift? I forget the exact arguments
but from first principles if the effect is to change the direction
of the incoming air molecules, then by conservation of
momentum that translates into equal and opposite change
of momentum of the surface, i.e. pressure with an upward
component.

Thanks Randy,

But before we talk about what causes lift on the plane, we should
clear up the basic physics 1st.  Note that what I have described above
has nothing to do with airplanes really.

If you read carefully, the premise of what they are saying is that, if
you have, for example, a sealed jar with air in it, you are permitted
to consider the air on the _inside_ of the jar, pushing up on the lid
as contributing to a force to lift the jar off the ground, but you are
not allowed to consider the air on the _inside_ of the jar, pushing
down on the jar un the upper surface of the bottom of the jar.

Ref: http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae627.cfm

Question:
If an airplane wing provides lift (an airfoil), how does a plane fly
upside down?

Asked by: Lee Hathcox

Answer:
The same way that your hand gets pulled upwards if you stick it out the
car window and tilt it. The lift of an airfoil is determined by two
things - the shape of the wing, and it's angle of attack. Angle of
attack is the angle between the flat surface of the wing, and the
oncoming air stream. So when I roll the airplane upside down... if I
push the stick forward, that pushes the nose of the plane towards the
sky, and increases my angle of attack, even though I'm upside down. So,
the shape of the wing doesn't change, and it pulls me down, but the
angle of attack I control, and I can make it push me up. So when the
lift from angle of attack in the up direction, exceeds the lift from
the shape of the wing, in the down direction, you can balance the force
of gravity acting on the plane. You can see the influence of angle of
attack, because even if your hand isn't shaped like a wing, you can see
how the angle and the force of the air push it in whichever direction
you choose.

The essential feature of an airfoil is that it twists the flow of air as it
passes (or as the airfoil passes through still air, which is equivalent, and
that's how it works in airplanes).  The air is accelerated downward, and this
engenders an equal and opposite force that is lift.

So how does a wing produce lift?  By twisting air downwards, creating a
downwash.  Accelerating a mass of air downwards tends to accelerate the wing
upwards, and there's your lift.

The theory gets more complicated when you try to explain exactly how and why
airfoils twist an airflow.  Just looking at a flat board with a positive angle
of attack, you'd think that it would twist the air, and that's exactly what it
does.  But the devil is in the details.

Fortunately, aviators don't have to know or care about the details.  All they
need to know is that a wing with a positive angle of attack (and below the
stall angle) will generate lift.

Lift, like so many other phenomena in physics, can be analyzed and explained
in a number of different, equally valid ways, depending on one's point of
view.  All analyses and explanations converge on the same reality.  Of course,
some explanations of lift are just plain incorrect, and unfortunately a few of
them are quite widespread.

Nobody's saying you're inept at anything; just arrogant about your
assumptions, and wrong, and quite possibly dishonest about your identity.

Taking on the science of NASA, for example, challenges the kind of people
who put men on the moon, shuttle aircraft into space and back, and robots on
Mars.  What I'm saying is, they've proven their ability to do math and
physics.  You're talking about two pieces of paper on a table or whatever,
admitting you don't fully understand aerodynamics, and then challenging the
kind of people who did research using SR-71 blackbirds and spacecraft.

...in a pilots' forum.  What in hell kind of response did you possibly

&gt;&gt; front which is also the bottom, not the back/top. So the
&gt;&gt; forces are on the bottom.

&gt; The essential feature of an airfoil is that it twists the flow of air
&gt; as it passes (or as the airfoil passes through still air, which is
&gt; equivalent, and that's how it works in airplanes).  The air is
&gt; accelerated downward, and this engenders an equal and opposite force
&gt; that is lift.

&gt; So how does a wing produce lift?  By twisting air downwards, creating
&gt; a downwash.  Accelerating a mass of air downwards tends to accelerate
&gt; the wing upwards, and there's your lift.

&gt; The theory gets more complicated when you try to explain exactly how
&gt; and why airfoils twist an airflow.  Just looking at a flat board with
&gt; a positive angle of attack, you'd think that it would twist the air,
&gt; and that's exactly what it does.  But the devil is in the details.

&gt; Fortunately, aviators don't have to know or care about the details.
&gt; All they need to know is that a wing with a positive angle of attack
&gt; (and below the stall angle) will generate lift.

&gt; Lift, like so many other phenomena in physics, can be analyzed and
&gt; explained in a number of different, equally valid ways, depending on
&gt; one's point of view.  All analyses and explanations converge on the
&gt; same reality.  Of course, some explanations of lift are just plain
&gt; incorrect, and unfortunately a few of them are quite widespread.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's just AOA.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There are people in the pilot's group, who think that lift on a wing
&gt; &gt; &gt; is analyzed as such:

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. There is air on outside of top of wing that is pushing down, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; reduced because of aerodynamics.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. The *inside* of the wing contains air pushing up against the
&gt; &gt; &gt; underside of top of wing .

&gt; &gt; Er... that's a new one. OK, I haven't heard this argument
&gt; &gt; then.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Let us ignore that the same air inside the wing pushes down on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; overside of bottom part of wing.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The difference in pressure against the underside of the top wing on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the inside of wing and top of wing on outside, is what gives plane
&gt; &gt; &gt; lift.

&gt; &gt; You can consider that last just a definition of lift. You
&gt; &gt; won't get lift unless the upward forces are stronger than
&gt; &gt; then downward forces.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that they ignore the pressure inside the wing that pushes
&gt; &gt; &gt; downward on the wing.

&gt; &gt; A wing doesn't need to be hollow to fly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am trying to convince them that, if there is air on the inside of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the wing, it pushes against all sides of the inside of the wing,
&gt; &gt; &gt; including both top underside and bottom overside, and thereby
&gt; &gt; &gt; nullifying any effect it would have on the wing. Lift is caused by a
&gt; &gt; &gt; difference in pressure between the underside of the bottom of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; wing, and the overside of the top of the wing.

&gt; Thanks Randy,

&gt; But before we talk about what causes lift on the plane, we should
&gt; clear up the basic physics 1st.  Note that what I have described above
&gt; has nothing to do with airplanes really.

&gt; If you read carefully, the premise of what they are saying is that, if
&gt; you have, for example, a sealed jar with air in it, you are permitted
&gt; to consider the air on the _inside_ of the jar, pushing up on the lid
&gt; as contributing to a force to lift the jar off the ground, but you are
&gt; not allowed to consider the air on the _inside_ of the jar, pushing
&gt; down on the jar un the upper surface of the bottom of the jar.
">

Sure, there's air pressure inside a sealed jar, but:

(1) Sealed jars sitting on tables don't spontaneously start
flying, and

(2) Conservation of momentum (for every action there's
an equal and opposite reaction) says that you can't push
up from the inside. You'll create a counter force pushing
down.

(3) Solid things fly in wind also.

Probably true, in large part anyway. Just consider that aerobatics
pilots can fly their planes upside-down over considerable distances.
If Bernoulli were the sole factor this couldn't happen.

&gt; &gt; I count 8-9 people in the group who are utterly convinced that I am
&gt; &gt; inept at physics, mathematics, etc.

&gt; &gt; Note that some of these people have been flying aircraft for years,
&gt; &gt; even decades, while I am still a student pilot.

&gt; &gt; Comments from anyone who knows physics welcome.

&gt; As I said, I lean toward the angle-of-attack arguments now. Take
&gt; a flat rectangle, tilt it into the wind. The wind blows against the
&gt; front which is also the bottom, not the back/top. So the
&gt; forces are on the bottom.

&gt; Why does that translate into lift? I forget the exact arguments
&gt; but from first principles if the effect is to change the direction
&gt; of the incoming air molecules, then by conservation of
&gt; momentum that translates into equal and opposite change
&gt; of momentum of the surface, i.e. pressure with an upward
&gt; component.
