Hello all...

For those who are interested in DBF manager.... Just take a look at:
http://www.rayonline.com/jrinfo/index.htm

Written in CAVO28 SP1 and ClassMate 209...

See journalist comment at DBF's coming back...
http://3d2f.com/smartreviews/0-387-cmvodbx32-dbf-s-coming-back-read.s...

It may be worth a try...

Journalist? &lt;g&gt; Didn't see any 'journalists' name on the page, just a
reasonably pointed editorial from the author of the product being
recommended. However you can't seriously consider DBF for web based
applications like this. SQL Express, which is quite tiny and totally web
service friendly, would do a ton better job than DBFs. Full blown SQL
Server would be much better, given you have total and native http
access, self threading, priority management and all sorts of things
built in that DBF doesn't have.

My post was 00:10 and your answer was 00:29. Obviously in 19 minutes, your
have made up your mind about the DBF world..
Even if didn't try my software...

I know SQL is the future... But do you know that almost half of the world is
still on DBF...

This is my market...  ( and I'm the best in it )

I won't even challenge you...

But you would be surprised how many developers that used &quot;export to
CSV,Delimited,DBF&quot; to understand how there sql stuff works...

My attitude for the future is very definitely SQL.
I do not see any rational use for DBF in this environment.

DBF users are familiar with to manage and edit their SQL tables and

it looks really good. !

Because i want to evaluate the product it´s _very_ annoying that there´s a
10 secs delay each time cmxVODBX is started. Why the delay, when the product
is protected by a 30 days shareware licence ???

Another point: How can i disable the annoying Dialog box that always asks if
i want to associate .DBF to cmxVODBX ?  When i say no, the dialog pops up
again each time cmxVODBX is started. Why not simply add a option to the
&quot;Default Options&quot; dialog where i would be able to associate the DBF type
later?

I don't really understand this debate about SQL and DBF.  We have been
using MS SQL for many years with C# applications, alongside DBFCDX
with VO applications.  In the real world, you can't make such
simplistic technological judgements, because many people with legacy
systems are called &quot;customers&quot;.

Over the decades, we have used dBase and dbAssist for DBF
administration.  We now use CmVodbx32, which does everything that we
need.

Jean Raymond may be engaged in self promotion, but so what?  CmVodbx32
is a very useful, and cheap, tool for anyone using DBF files.  I don't
see why some people feel the need to urinate on other's efforts.

Martin.

No-one is urinating on anyone. And why resort to such crass
descriptions?

I still have a range of DBF based products so I am still a user but that
doesn't mean that we should promote DBF as a 'next generation' DBMS
product. We shouldn't. And it is seriously wrong to promote DBFs as a
web styled solution. There is just no scalability, durability or
reliability.

DBF's days are over and all VO'ers should be looking to replace them
quickly. Especially if they want to go Dot Net. Doubly especially if
there is to be any web based interaction with them.

But my sarcasm was directed at the thought that an independent
'journalist' wrote up the piece for J-R. I think we can all see through
that one &lt;g&gt;.

I have to disagree with you (again &lt;g&gt;). For us, there is no
environment where DBFCDX has been proven more reliable than on a
couple of websites run with our VO programs. On the server based
systems I have had numerous problems, things which should't be
possible, etc. On the website litteraly none, and we are talking here
about websites with a lot of database transactions and visitors.

Mind, I am not telling that when you start now, you should or should
not choose for DBF. But I've seen far more problems with other's
.Net/SQL websites (just a week ago I got a nice .Net screen on the SDN
website telling that some DotNetNuke  buffer file was full)  than we
have seen on our DBFCDX websites.

Hello Marcos,

Unfortunately I have to disappoint you. We manage the dbf ON the
webserver, not from a remote connection. In other words, it's a cavo
.exe + dbfcdx.

I understood that what you (and we) want should be possible with the
latest Advantage DB server. As soon as I have all on line on my 2.8SP1
it's next to investigate. If that works I'll post a message

Been there, done that... ADS is an excellent product, both for local

Dick,

To continue this discussion effectively now requires participants to
state their bona fides and thoroughly describe the environment they
employ. For instance, if you are talking about a VO web server on your
own controlled website, that is one thing. Deploying the website to a
public ISP is another. Then we need to talk about transactional volume.
1000 transactions a day is trivial and gee, a csv file could work as a
database &lt;g&gt;. 1000 transactions a minute is another thing altogether.

So I am quite happy with the concept of a DBF working in a specific
range of scenarios but not as a general, web-based platform database.
Not ever. SQL is much cleaner, easier to use and already comes with the
connectivity and support tools to make this work. It is also properly
scalable and is supported by most ISPs the world over. And once you
throw Dot Net into the mix, well honestly, SQL access is just as native
as DBF access is for VO.

My theory is to use the right tools for the right job and to stop making
square pegs fit into round holes.

snip[ DBF's days are over and all VO'ers should be looking to replace

I would have agreed with U a few years ago we are going great guns
with DBF and we have 14 / 17 / 25 users and all running Terminals
services and network issues we had with Domain/Peer to are gone. Craig
Dawson has 400 users using TS just on one project and works fantastic.

We web we and data interchange we use a lot of DBF/FPT for data
manipulation and stored for lots of jobs.

We switch are lot a SQL systems when we change them to DBF/FPT.. and
it has never been an issue and it runs faster and the data is lot
smaller.

For webusers it is all SQL and has been for 8-9 years now.

We are experienced with several SQL types and use products that
deliver without being  painted into the concept there is only ONE way.
It is simply nonsense in the real world.

Use cmVODBX32 all the time for data merging and conversion, importing
and customer support when required.  Excellent product and Jean
Raymond is always adding new and improved features.

Phil,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

But this was the nature of the discussion. Web based apps. Http etc. So
that means we are in agreeance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

But a TS solution is just that - technically and mechanically a local
solution. Same goes for VPN. What you are doing here is using the fact
that modern processors and DSL lines with reasonable bandwidth just give
us a little more longevity for our legacy systems.

If you really do have 400+ users then a SQL solution could offer much
more in the way of features and stability. Just think full text search
for instance. Thinks alerts and triggers next...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I got lost in the grammar here &lt;g&gt; but I suspect you are saying that you
use DBF behind the web app for local storage. I have no problem with
that except that if you already have a SQL engine available, it may as
well be used for everything.

400 users, yep that's about right (a little over now though) via a Citrix
farm and they are wanting to deploy my app out to a total of 800 users. That
sort of gets me worried about things though. Most here seem to be saying
that SQL should be used but if it aint broken why fix it. We have over 115
databases all being opened concurrently and so far bugger all problems. Full
text search through fast text search is a snap and really is super fast -
users love it.

I know that scalability will be an issue at some stage but have not seemed
to have hit the limit yet.

Also, SQL for that many users brings licensing costs into play. With DBF/CDX
there are none - with SQL there are ????

&gt; Phil,

&gt;&gt; For webusers it is all SQL and has been for 8-9 years now.

&gt; But this was the nature of the discussion. Web based apps. Http etc. So
&gt; that means we are in agreeance.

&gt;&gt; I would have agreed with U a few years ago we are going great guns
&gt;&gt; with DBF and we have 14 / 17 / 25 users and all running Terminals

&gt; But a TS solution is just that - technically and mechanically a local
&gt; solution. Same goes for VPN. What you are doing here is using the fact
&gt; that modern processors and DSL lines with reasonable bandwidth just give
&gt; us a little more longevity for our legacy systems.

&gt; If you really do have 400+ users then a SQL solution could offer much more
&gt; in the way of features and stability. Just think full text search for
&gt; instance. Thinks alerts and triggers next...

&gt;&gt; We web we and data interchange we use a lot of DBF/FPT for data
&gt;&gt; manipulation and stored for lots of jobs.

&gt; I got lost in the grammar here &lt;g&gt; but I suspect you are saying that you
&gt; use DBF behind the web app for local storage. I have no problem with that
&gt; except that if you already have a SQL engine available, it may as well be
&gt; used for everything.

&gt; Geoff

&gt;&gt; We switch are lot a SQL systems when we change them to DBF/FPT.. and
&gt;&gt; it has never been an issue and it runs faster and the data is lot
&gt;&gt; smaller.

&gt;&gt; We are experienced with several SQL types and use products that
&gt;&gt; deliver without being  painted into the concept there is only ONE way.
&gt;&gt; It is simply nonsense in the real world.

Hi Craig.

Your app may be working fine and may (even with 800 users) continue to
work fine but DBF index management and data corruption is a very real
threat. SQL has no such issues. None at all. Never. However, with 400+
users there are things you could offer and do that are just so much
superior on SQL.

I guess you haven't thought about OLAP cubes, for instance.

By the way, FTS for DBF just isn't the same as full text search in SQL
&lt;g&gt;. This is like comparing a 10yr old nag with a racing car. It is more
of a case that you aren't using certain features because you and your
clients probably don't know they exist. I'm not trying to be cute...
there are real measures to be gained. The other thing is processes like
complete rebalances and grouped reports are just milliseconds instead of
minutes (or even hours). You have features like automatic alert
management (to SMS or email), automatic (built in) backup scheduling,
backup whilst users are online and active, triggered events. Once you
are big enough to have 800 users you are big enough to start to maximise
a return from SQL Server.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I know that scalability will be an issue at some stage but have not seemed
&gt; to have hit the limit yet.
">

So why wait to hit the limit and then be forced to act by virtue of a
disaster? Why not plan an orderly migration now before things get to big
and delicate? You 'know' its an issue so plan now...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, SQL for that many users brings licensing costs into play. With DBF/CDX
&gt; there are none - with SQL there are ????
">

Actually, you could do it with one web server licence (about $8K I think
- once off, no annual fees) which allows unlimited connections. For a
company supporting 800 users I would think that this would be a trivial
cost. It is going to cost more to fix the potential disaster looming
&lt;g&gt;. This is roughly $10 per user. Is that too much?

With smaller user bases you could get away with a simple 'standard'
license with 5 users and a service broker to control connection pooling.
This would cost $1400 approx. Bugger all in most company scenarios. With
less than 20 concurrent users you could even use the free version of SQL
Express but in a web based scenario I favour a proper license. We have a
club based solution going in which 450 clubs across Australia will
connect online once a day or so and cause a replication up and back
between their free server and our internet enabled server. That is a
standard license and is all we need because we can queue the connection
requests.

DBFs may be free but what price for certain security and connectivity?

Geoff

Richard.

ADS is more expensive on all scenarios than MS SQL Server so why would
you pick it over SQL?. The only difference is that I would expect a few
days to a week of coding mods to go SQL as opposed to probably one day
to go ADS (on say a 300,000 line app).

The issue for me is that if someone really has 1000's of concurrent
users (and I doubt that any DBF system is supporting that in reality)
then you are missing out on some serious technology support and features
that DBF cannot give you.

The horse and cart worked. Still does. But taxis and trucks seem to have
taken over. There was a reason. DBF is a horse and cart solution. Start
investigating SQL...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

We are talking web connectivity. Presumably to a web site et al. TS will
be there no matter what the technology behind the app and the user is
effectively a local user to the TS server. Not a web connected one. When
you have a legacy app, remote users (in a genuine http sense) and a
website all wanting access to the same data source, it is just a world
easier to do this on a SQL RDBMS backend whether it be DB2, Oracle or
MS. We still use rdp to access various sites and will continue to do so
but that is a different technology for a different use.

Actually I said that first but you are free to echo me &lt;g&gt;. In which
case, if you know it all as you claim, you will be fully aware of the
advantages of SQL and the reason why over 99% of the business world by
volume and number use some form of SQL RDBMS for their data and
warehousing solutions. There must be a reason DBF continues to decline
in usage.

It has less to with FREE...  Geez Postgres is free and mySQL can be
Free and you have some cripple MSSQL version for FREE.

Its about it does the job and it isnt broken so why fix it.
I sadi before I doubt I would write a new major system using DBF's but
that depends what it is doing. For multi users to a specific size I
have no issues with DBF and corruption. Indexes from time to time do
though.. and a good design deals with this.

Your issue about SQL 'never being corrupted' is crap.  Took a MSSQL
system where its own tools could not fix the corruption.

Every thing brakes when the right circumstance happen and when your
writing to harddrive, power by electricity you have no control when
either of these may fail. You even have damn virus software
intercepting data and defragmentors and Scandisk all capable of doing
damage if they failed in an unsual manner.

If there was no MS SQL or SQL corruption why is the internet full of
tools to recover from corruption ?

Once the DBF fan now the SQL fan and nothing worse than evangelists

But this was half of your measure and I wasn't just addressing that. I
was addressing the governance issues around the choice of DBF in what
seems to be a critical environment. When your 800+ user system breaks
because it was DBF, what do you say to the owner? Err... sorry, we were
waiting for a failure before costing you any more money. It wasn't broke
before...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Because you are living on borrowed time. And it will break when you and
your credibility can afford it least. If DBF is so stable for high end
systems tell me why companies shell out 1000's for RDBMS? Are they being
hoodwinked?

I certainly appreciate Geoff's comments and it is really only in the last
few months that I have been seriously considering the move over to SQL from
DBF.
One major issue is that all the existing reports will need to be re-written
and that is a huge task in itself. Another is that our 5 user systems are
only $275 ($55 per user) and adding an extra $1400 is mostly unworkable for
clients so SQL Express would have to be the go. Of course the larger sites
it would not be a problem.

From all here who have gone through the process, what would be the best way
to go through the &quot;transition&quot; from DBF to SQL?

Give me a call some time if you like. Maybe we can give you some heads

Can't be the pipe. Even in Holland they finally voted for non smoking

We are about to investigate ADS too. It's features of the latest

Sorry, I answered to the wrong message. Yes, I do belive it works, but
we have to balance client costs versus our time to work with SQL or

&gt; I still have a range of DBF based products so I am still a user but that

&gt; product. We shouldn't. And it is seriously wrong to promote DBFs as a
&gt; web styled solution. There is just no scalability, durability or
&gt; reliability.

&gt; DBF's days are over and all VO'ers should be looking to replace them
&gt; quickly. Especially if they want to go Dot Net. Doubly especially if
&gt; there is to be any web based interaction with them.

&gt; But my sarcasm was directed at the thought that an independent

&gt; that one &lt;g&gt;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My attitude for the future is very definitely SQL.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not see any rational use for DBF in this environment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know SQL is the future... But do you know that almost half of the world is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still on DBF...

&gt; &gt; &gt; I do. Therein lies an opportunity for VO'ers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Conversion!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But you would be surprised how many developers that used &quot;export to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CSV,Delimited,DBF&quot; to understand how there sql stuff works...

&gt; &gt; &gt; But that only points to limited minds. There is absolutely no need to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; this when such good tools come with SQL Express to pull apart a table
&gt; &gt; &gt; and column, nuts and bolts. Even my SQL Master has all the tools that
&gt; &gt; &gt; DBF users are familiar with to manage and edit their SQL tables and
&gt; &gt; &gt; columns.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Journalist? &lt;g&gt; Didn't see any 'journalists' name on the page, just a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reasonably pointed editorial from the author of the product being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. However you can't seriously consider DBF for web based
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; applications like this. SQL Express, which is quite tiny and totally web
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; service friendly, would do a ton better job than DBFs. Full blown SQL

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self threading, priority management and all sorts of things built in that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DBF doesn't have.

&gt; &gt; I don't really understand this debate about SQL and DBF.  We have been
&gt; &gt; using MS SQL for many years with C# applications, alongside DBFCDX
&gt; &gt; with VO applications.  In the real world, you can't make such
&gt; &gt; simplistic technological judgements, because many people with legacy
&gt; &gt; systems are called &quot;customers&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Over the decades, we have used dBase and dbAssist for DBF
&gt; &gt; administration.  We now use CmVodbx32, which does everything that we
&gt; &gt; need.

&gt; &gt; Jean Raymond may be engaged in self promotion, but so what?  CmVodbx32
&gt; &gt; is a very useful, and cheap, tool for anyone using DBF files.  I don't
&gt; &gt; see why some people feel the need to urinate on other's efforts.

Hi Geoff

My reaction to your comments about cmVodbx32 was that Jean Raymond has
produced a very good tool, which many people find very useful, and he
was only engaging in some product promotion.  He is correct in that
DBF will be around for many years to come.

However, if nothing else, your comments have once again opened up the
great DBF / SQL debate, so I'll throw in my contribution&lt;g&gt;.

DBF has been around for over 30 years, during which time it has been
adopted as the de facto standard for many applications.  During its
lifetime, many other databases have come and gone.

Why throw away decades of experience gained in a technology just for
the sake of change?  Some people will always advocate change, but
there should be only two real considerations; the demands of the
marketplace and economics.

Although SQL had been around in various forms for several years, it
didn't really become viable for most developers until Microsoft
released SQL Server 2000 and the bugs in MS Server 2000 had been
ironed out.  On that basis, it's newer than DBF, but that's no
guarantee of its longevity.

For example, what about object oriented data?  Jasmine may have been
way ahead of its time, especially as most developers were finding it
hard enough to come to terms with object oriented programming, let
alone object oriented data, but this could still be the future.

We began developing VO / DBFCDX web based intranet and extranet
business applications for customers in 1998, and most of our work
since has been web based rather than GUI.

We opted to go down the .Net / MS SQL / C# path about four years ago.
This was partly because of the need to comply with the requirements of
corporate customers, partly to keep up to date with technology, and
partly in the belief that SQL would be needed for scalability and
remote database access.

We have since backed off from using SQL for smaller Internet
applications.  We have not gone back to DBF, but we have gone for XML
instead.  Yes, more complex C# programs, but you only have to develop
the wrapper once.  It also fits in with Ajax, which we use
extensively.

Web services and the like also allow you to operate databases remotely
from the applications, and with high speed web connections, speed is
not an issue.

It's just a matter of horses for courses.  If the customer requires
that SQL be used, then so be it, but if we're not constrained in this
way, then we go for the solution that gives us the lowest overall cost
of ownership, which is currently SQL or XML with C#, or DBF with VO.

One factor in this debate is confidence in the SQL supplier.  With
DBF, you have direct access to the tables, so you can control all of
the relationships, the locking, conflict resolution, etc.  While SQL
takes care of all this for you, and does much more besides, it does
mean that it's encapsulated, so you have to place more reliance on the
SQL supplier.

For this reason, we would never entertain using anything other than MS
SQL, which obviously has a direct bearing on the economic argument.

While we're at it, why don't we throw Vulcan into the mix?  It may
still have some way to go, but from what we have seen, it's an
excellent route from VO / DBF to DotNet / DBF, especially when you can
mix and match C# and converted VO code.

Martin.

My issue is (and you kind of seem to support it) that SQL and MS in
particular has matured to the point where it is the most viable choice
to move forward with. The DBF, for a multi-user and multi-protocol
operating environment is not scalable and it takes clever tricks to make
it work when clever tricks are just not necessary with SQL.

I agree that web services can extend the operational nature of DBF and I
will demonstrate this to our user group very soon. But I will also
demonstrate how much easier and faster it is with SQL.

And I acknowledged this too. I have apps in DBF that will continue for
some time in DBF but I am seeking to convert them to SQL when I can
afford it.

No, it isn't for the sake of 'change', it is for the sake of improved
stability, seriously improved performance and a vastly richer feature
set. SQL and Reporting and Notification services open up just so much
more natively within SQL than we've ever been able to code for. It is a
new world.

No, I think its longevity is assured. Just ask Oracle?

Hmmmm... Jasmine was the biggest waste of marketing resources I ever
saw. And as a technology, it was obsolete before it started. Perhaps
things might change in 10 years but as of now, the concept of object
storage just doesn't hold commercial water anywhere. And Jasmine morphed
into the Unicenter engine and seems to have died a slow death.
