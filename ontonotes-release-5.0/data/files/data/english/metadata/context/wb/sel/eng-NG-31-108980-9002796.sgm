Do you want to work hard, sweat, come home tired and still find you do
not have enough money to pay the bills? OR...

Do you want to learn about a new way to make money, one that will make
you $100 a day or more, every day, while you literally sit around like
a BUM? You want to sit around on your bum and make money. It will take
you to the next level of bum marketing, so you become an instant
success, and walk away with profits.

BUM MARKETING: WHAT IS IT?

OK. Most people are willing to work a little. I promise if you pay
attention and put just a little effort into what I am about to teach
you, then you will successfully learn how to earn extra income while
sitting on your bum.

Hence the name, &quot;Bum Marketing.&quot; Another more commonly used term is
affiliate marketing. The key here is bum marketing is an easier way to
make money than affiliate marketing.

You see, most people get into affiliate marketing and do not have a
clue what they get into. They do not know how to make a good
impression. They do not know how to promote and advertise the products
or services they sell.
Because of this, they give up too early, and they do not make any
money.

With Bum Marketing, you can learn to affiliate market great products
without much effort and make money, so you do not sit around, scratch
your head and wonder what went wrong. There are a few secrets of bum
marketing you need to know before we get started, so let's start with
those.

Two Secrets To Bum Marketing

There are two secrets everyone has to know before they can succeed as
a bum marketer.

What are these secrets? Ok, first, most people do not realize you do
not have to do everything right the first time you try to be
successful as a bum marketer.

You do not have to be perfect. The people making millions of dollars
do a lot of things right, but they are still not perfect. Most people
however, think unless they have a perfect system in place, they have
no chance of making money, and this simply is not true.

So listen up.

It's OK If You Do Not Get It Right The First Time... Anyone can make bum
marketing work well for them if they are willing to put a little time
and effort into it. Just a little, we are not talking about 40 hours
each week here. That is why bum marketing is such a great concept.
You can flub it up and still make money.

You can know nothing about bum marketing or Internet marketing and
still make more money then many of the &quot;so-called&quot; guru's of
marketing. This is why I am such a fan of bum marketing and why I have
my family and friends into bum marketing too.

What IS Bum Marketing Again?

Bum Marketing Defined

Bum marketing is everything you think it is if you rely on the title
alone to define marketing. It is a way to make money marketing by
doing virtually nothing.

When done correctly, it is an excellent way to make money. The
question is this: &quot;How is Bum Marketing any different?&quot;

I'll tell you. People just getting into the field of marketing are not
always ideal for affiliate marketing. Many believe they can make money
on the Web simply and easily, but this isn't always true. So what do
you do?

You need to start creating a steady and regular flow of money so you
can learn more about affiliate marketing, and then consider it a
full-time hobby.

How you do that is through the Bum Marketing program. Here is how it
works, in a very simplified way:

1. You write an article on a topic that has a lot of potential in a
niche market. What you want is that article listed in Google or with
other popular search engines.

2. Wait for a buyer to read your article, and hopefully you had
the sense to place a link (embedded affiliate link) into your article,
so the reader clicks through.

3. You make money.
Some describe it in terms of article marketing, because it works in
much the same way. You write articles, embed your affiliate links in
them and wait for things to happen. For Bum Marketing to work however,
you have to follow some important principles.

Key Concepts

There are a few secrets to Bum Marketing. First, you can't simply
write an article about ANYTHING. You have to find a hot niche market.
You also want to find keyword phrases to accompany that market, ones
that do not have too much competition, because if they do you will
have a harder time getting people to click through your links.

When you find your niche, your keyword phrases, you write (or hire
someone to write) great articles, SEO optimize it and submit it.

The people making money using Bum Marketing are the ones selecting
profitable keywords and connecting with people interested in buying
whatever it is they promote or sell. Whether it's your own product or
an affiliate product, it all works the same way.

Here is a key idea you have to realize to win. Bum Marketing does not
cost you a penny. How many marketing programs and gurus show you how
to make money without telling you that you have to spend tons of money
in the process? You guessed it, zero.

Here is how it works again. Remember, this is simple stuff folks. You
submit your articles, with terrific keywords, to search engines, with
links embedded into them, from great affiliate programs.

Then you wait for savvy marketers to pick up your articles and post
them, so their traffic clicks through and you get paid your affiliate
income.

So why read a whole book about it? Well, it is a little more
complicated than it may first seem. We make
it seem like it is easy, and it is. But, there is a lot more to bum
marketing than first meets the eye. So, before you go a step further,
you have to get a proper
education on bum marketing.
