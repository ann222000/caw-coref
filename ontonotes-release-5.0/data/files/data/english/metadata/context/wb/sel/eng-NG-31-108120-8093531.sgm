Back in &quot;the day&quot;, they used to make a special polarizer for sports
photography.  It was is NOT to be confused with the current circular
polarizer, but it was a filter with the actually polarization on the
filter was circular.  Therefore, you did not rotate it (because
rotating a circle keeps the orientation the same).  It was used for
sports so that you could polarize the light and cut glare, but didn't
need to keep re-orienting it when either you moved the camera or the
end of the lens rotated when you zoomed/changed focus.  It was pretty
nifty.

Has anyone seen one recently.  I'd like to pick one up but can't find
them anywhere, anymore.

The only way a polarizer like that could cut out glare would be if you
used it with a flash that also had a circular polarizer on it. And since
circular polarization changes from left hand to right and right to left
when bouncing off a shiny surface you would use the same handed polarizer.

But just by itself a circular polarizer, that passes either right hand
or left hand light, will not reduce glare.  You can get this kind of
filter but simply mounted a conventional circular polarizer with the
wrong side pointed towards the lens.

I've never heard of such a filter, but I suppose it could be of some use if
you only need to affect the top and bottom of the image, i.e. the sky and
the foreground grass, and don't care about the centre region or the edges.

I would have thought it would be difficult to make such a thing though,
since the long chain molecules which do the polarising, instead of simply
being straightened and aligned by stretching the plastic, would need
somehow to be made to form a circular shape. The implications of this are
you'd have to make each piece of polaroid separately, you couldn't simply
stamp them out of a big sheet, so they'd presumably be very expensive.
Are you sure these filters really worked in the way you  describe?

Yeah, I had one.  As you said, it worked well on the sky (particularly
in the center of the frame).  It would also cut glare from vertical
surfaces to the left and right.  I'm not sure what, if anything, it
did in the middle of the image because it was, after all, a sports
item so the image that you were shooting was in the middle of the
image.

Back in &quot;the day&quot; it was needed because when you zoomed or changed
focus, most lenses twisted the ends so the polarizer would shift
orientation.    For sports you didn't have time to adjust the
polarizer.

I'm sorry, but your description doesn't seem to make sense.  The light
coming from normal scenes like those in sports is not circularly
polarized, so a &quot;circular polarizing filter&quot; or filter designed to
remove cilcularly polarized light wouldn't do anything. The exception
would be artificial lighting that is circulalrly polarized, but that
would require a lot of effort and expense; I've never heard of it being
done.

Since most scenes are illuminated from above on average, the linear
polarization present in reflected light will be tend be horizontal in
direction. That is, the E-vector of the vibration of the light waves
will be more dominant in the horizontal direction. So if you set a
linear polaroid filter with its direction vertical (crossed with
horzontally-polarized light), it will tend to always work to some
amount, though it may not be much. That is how polarized sunglasses are
usually set up.  Road glare is usually horizontally polarized. I have
left polaroid filters fixed in that direction when I'm doing a lot of
fast shooting and didn't want to be bothered optimizing it for each
shot. However, if the filter rotates while the lens focuses, no polaroid
filter will do you good unless you set it or by chance.

That people use circular polarizers is irrelevant from the standpoint of
the effect on the light entering the filter, the effect that counts. A
cilcular polarizer consists of a linear polarizer, which does the
required filtering, followed by a quarter-wave retarder, which converts
the linearly-polarized light to circularly-polarized light, which
behaves better inside a camera with internal reflections.

What happened to it?  Somewhere in the course of 25 years, a half-
dozen moves, and 2 kids, it seems to have disappeared.  Funny how that
happened.  If I had it, I'd know who made it.

The pictures didn't look particularly different than any other
picture.  If they did, it wouldn't have been a good polarizer.  Since
it was generally used to darken the sky, that was about the only
effect.

Geez.  I thought this was a simple yes/no answer.  I guess it is &quot;no&quot;,
that no one has seen one recently (say within the last decade or two).

There was other equipment from back when the dinosaurs roamed the
earth that you don't see much of anymore either.  In some ways it
quite bad, because you really had to learn what you were doing, learn
timing, learn metering etc. when you were shooting on film and your
metering was all manual.

Sorry for the loose terminology. I should have said &quot;do anything you

You are not missing anything. Those filters are the standard ones for
removing linearly polarized light. You can get two basic types: one just
is a simple linear polarizer, and the other first does the linear
polarization for the effect that you want and then converts that
linearally-polarized light into circularly-polarized light. The effect
on the scene being photographed is identical for both types, and the
rotation angles of the filters must be set for the desired effect. The
circular filter is used for cameras with internatl reflections that
could potentially interact with linerally polarized light and perhaps
throw off light metering. On straight-through cameras, like many P&amp;S
ones, there is no need for the circular variety.

I still don't understand the principle behind that filter you used to have.

The only Google references to the phrase &quot;sports polarizer&quot; are to this

I'm confused too. I read it as he was looking for a polarizer that
darkened the sky but didn't need to be rotated to maintain the effect.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Austin, I think *you* need to read the op more carefully.  It *isn't*
&gt; &gt;&gt; a 'circular' polariser (as we know it), that Pat has described.

&gt; &gt;It seems to me that he /did/ describe a circular polariser, and then
&gt; &gt;added &quot;It is NOT to be confused with the current circular
&gt; &gt;polarizer&quot;.  So he's trying to find something that is functionally
&gt; &gt;identical to a circular polariser, yet is somehow different in a way
&gt; &gt;that he doesn't seem to be able to explain.  Or am I missing something?

&gt; I recall, way back when, that some special-effects polarizers were made by
&gt; carefully cutting thin wedge shapes of the polarizing material and then
&gt; reassembling them into other configurations to see what they would do.
&gt; Eventually they became used as novelty weather-man's TV icons on their
&gt; weather-map boards during B&amp;W TV days. Where the weather-map was illuminated
&gt; with a rotating polarized light and their sun and rain markers would &quot;move&quot; in
&gt; bands of brightness as the rotating polarized light hit them. The sun icon
&gt; slowly rotating in a star-burst pattern, or concentric waves from center to
&gt; edge, or the rain icon would slowly move in a downward slant in bands of light
&gt; and dark. Or the H and L pressure area markers would have all their little
&gt; triangles or semi-circles have waves of light and dark pass through them in the
&gt; direction that front was moving. (Or conversely a slowly rotating polarizer was
&gt; in front of the TV camera's lens instead of a studio-light, I know not which,
&gt; both would work, I only figured out how they were doing it at the time by
&gt; observation.)

&gt; If linear polarizing material was cut into narrow wedges with the plane of
&gt; polarization either perpendicular to or in line with the length of the wedge,
&gt; and then assembled of thin pie-slices so that (for all intents and purposes) the
&gt; polarization was in a concentric orientation, or in a ray-burst configuration,
&gt; then rotating that polarizer would not change its overall effect. If it was
&gt; constructed to have the polarization planes in a concentric orientation then the
&gt; part above the horizon would indeed darken the sky some. In total though, all
&gt; light entering the lens would cancel out the polarizing effect for anything in
&gt; the center. Because that light would pass through all parts of all the
&gt; polarizing planes. Only things nearer the edges of the FOV would be affected.

&gt; Perhaps this is how it was done and the type of device you are refering to? If
&gt; it is not available you could obtain some sheet polarizing material
&gt; ( www.sciplus.comoffers some at times) and manufacture one for yourself using
&gt; the above mentioned method. I'm not sure how good you could get with an x-acto
&gt; blade and carefully mounting the thin wedges between glass so that it appeared
&gt; nearly seamless, but if I was pressed to recreate that kind of thing I'd give it
&gt; a good try.

&gt; Do you recall at all if you could see some very fine lines radiating from the
&gt; center of that polarizer? If so, that would reveal how this was done.
">

I don't remember if you could see the lines or not.  I'm starting to
believe it was, as you said, some sort of novelty thing.

It did, however, act as you described.  It darkened the sky away from
the center of the image.  It never really cut much glare near the
center because you didn't have much glare there to start with.  That
was usually the person you were photographing.  I never used it on
NASCAR or something where the object itself would be glaring, so I
don't know what it would do.

I have no idea how they made/make polarizing material, so I can't help
you there but I don't remember any obvious lines on it.

Here's a though that I am just pulling out of the air.  Look at a $20
bill and look at the micro printing.  They can print really small when
they want to.  Could it have been printed in a circular pattern or
spiral pattern?

Darn, I wish I still had it.  It must be worth a fortune on eBay.

Believe it or not, it worked pretty good.  It wasn't as good as a
&quot;regular&quot; polarizer, but you never had to adjust the orientation.  In
fact, the only way to adjust it was to move the entire camera.

Grossly oversimplifying, a polarizer is a bit like a set of louvers on a
vent.  Light waves aligned the direction of the blades get through,
light waves that run into the blades get blocked.

Now, instead of using parallel linear blades, make your louvers out of
concentric tubing.  No matter what the rotation of this filter, it has
the same effect.

(No physics flames, please.  Like I said, grossly oversimplifying.)

I recall reading about this sort of filter many years ago, never saw one
in person.

I'm thinking the same thing.
A polarizer that works equaly well without being rotated doesn't make
much sense.
Possibly a graduated ND filter, graqduated towards the center?

Grossly oversimplyfying, your concentric tube thingy wouldn't work at
all to produce circular polarization or any polarization. It could
produce a great deal of diffraction. You are absolutely right about one
thing. No matter how you rotate it, what it does won't change.

I think a better description would be to take the louvers, cut them in
half, and arrange them in a star shape.  Any horizontally-polarized
light to the sides of the FOV would be passed; to the top and bottom it
would be blocked.

I can see the thing being a design and construction nightmare, but I can
understand where it could be useful in some instances.

&gt;&gt; Backwards.  It would only admit circularly polarized light, blocking

&gt; Sorry for the loose terminology. I should have said &quot;do anything you

&gt; all scenes no light would get through, since virtually none of the light

Any electromagnetic wave can be described as a superposition of left and
right handed circularly polarized light.  For most natural light you
will have the same amount of left and right handed light.

Note you can also electromagnetic wave can also be described as a
superposition of vertical and horizontal polarized light, you are just
choosing different basis functions.
