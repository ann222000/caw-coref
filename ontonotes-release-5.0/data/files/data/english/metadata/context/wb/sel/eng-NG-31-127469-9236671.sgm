&quot;Nemo Me Impune!&quot; If any of you people can read Latin, you can tell
the others what this means. And as for the finger pointing which has
gone on in this NG against myself and several others, Edgar Allen Poe
had this to say about such pointing out of others supposed &quot;defects.&quot;

&quot;A poltroon charges his foe, by instinct, with precisely that vice or
meanness which the pricking of the poltroon's conscience, assures him
would furnish the most stable and therefore the most terrible ground
of accusation against himself.&quot;

The more you keep calling others liar for no reason, the more of a
liar you are yourself. The more you keep hurling epithets at another
you dislike, the more you will become the basis of such epithets
yourself. The more you point out other people's faults, the more
faults YOU actually have.

Sigmund Freud said it as well. When you point a finger at a person,
three of those fingers point back at you! You are pointing out faults
which you hate WITHIN YOURSELF.

I keep being told I am a drunkard, druggie and a wife abuser by the
idiots and poltroons on this NG. What does that make them I wonder? Or
need I wonder?

As for my reading and writing capabilities. Why would a poltroon who
thinks I cannot read his missives, keep writing missives to me? Why
would a person who judges me insane, keep trying to talk to me at all?
For the same reasons he talks to Mark all the time. Because he himself
is insane and incapable of reading, or writing anything but lies and
invectives. It is his insanity which keeps him here and keeps him
posting, because his life is an empty shell.

A certain poltroon on this board seems to think for instance that all
English words have only one meaning. He does not know the difference
between something WRIT large, or a Holy Writ, or a Learned Writ, or a
Legal Writ! he seems to think the word &quot;writ&quot; ONLY refers to something
legal, as in &quot;writ of habeus corpus.&quot; He is unable to wrap his
tiny,narrow mind around the idea that the word writ has several
variant meanings. And cannot understand that when I asked him about
his &quot;learned writ&quot; of telling someone to &quot;go fuck themselves with an
axe,&quot; that I was being sarcastic. For his writ was neither writ, nor
learned. And yet he claims to be a well read, intelligent individual.
Still he cannot use the correct grammatical capitilization for self
&quot;I&quot; but must constantly use the diminutive &quot;i&quot; this is because he has
no self esteem and is illiterate in English. He is illiterate not in
that he cannot read or write but in that he cannot conceive of any
word he reads of having more to say than what he first looked up in
some dictionary. He contantly makes spelling errors and cannot tell
when others are misspelling words on purpose as a joke! He constantly
makes grammatical errors and then tries to edit everyone else's works!
And this he does at the expense of this group. he wants to be an
editorm and thinks people who write for a living are somehow thieves
and murderers! He is never himself on topic and meanwhile rails at
others for being off topic! This, in Poe's words, is the essence of
such an illiterate and insulting poltroon.

This poltroon on our board also insists that when I say he is not as
smart as HE thinks HE is, that I somehow wrote; &quot;I think he is smart.&quot;
This word twisting is another thing he accuses others of doing to him!
The other thing he likes to do is accuse me and others who have been
on this board for years, as being trolls who came here only to disrupt
the board! And what has the poltroon done here? He came here and
immediately began disrupting the board making a nuisance of himself,
flaming people for no reason, calling them liars, starting fights,
picking on newbies calling every one of them a sock-puppet, and
basically just sitting on this NG like some croaking, gutless
scavanger bird who will NOT SHUT UP, even though even his own friends
get tired of hearing his dross! This is the essence of what an
internet troll is and does. And he has also plagiarized several people
here, including myself, repeating things which were written here long
ago about other people who do not even concern him. He is not only
then a troll himself, but a very unoriginal, uninspired one.
Everything he has ever said or done to other people HE HIMSELF IS. And
he knows it. He even told us he was &quot;driven to it!&quot; Well when a person
is driven to do insane things for no reason, he must then be himself,
driven insane.

I on the other hand have reasons for doing what I do. I have fought on
this board for years for my right and the other poster's rights of
Free Speech and Assembly without intrusive flames from nameless and
anonymous trolls and poltroons. For that I have been slammed from one
end of this NG to the other. And after they slammed me they claim I am
paranoid! Well another famous author once wrote: &quot;Just because I am
paranoid, does not mean someone isn't chasing me!&quot;

I am also dead set against Mark Earnest's weird ideas and I see them
as a &quot;come on&quot; for his very vain attempts to garner some innocent
person to become his willing disciple. He makes a mockery of all
religion and everything angelic and by his OWN ADMISSION is a
pedophile. I will complain about him again and again as long as he
haunts this board with his worthless trash about hsi so-called
&quot;angels.&quot; But for now I intend to leave his idle posts unmarred,
except when I think he has once again contradicted himself and his
ideology and is now trying to tell us a whole different story. His
first story was outrageous and evil enough.

And I fight with WORDS (not viruses and email attacks and prank calls,
etc. etc) against the several other know-it-alls and self proclaimed
&quot;teachers&quot; and &quot;masters&quot; here who cannot show one document, website or
even authentic, original post that might give us some idea that they
are who or what they claim to be! My whole life story is on my
website. I have written books and published papers and articles in
many different venues. When you Google David St. Albans, you get some
information. Even information as to how I came by my name. They choose
to say I &quot;invented&quot; a nom de plume and therefore cannot be trusted.
Well I invite you to Google their names. You will find nothing. And I
guess they are NOT who they say they are at all.

These others, these lying and abusive trolls who finger point not only
at me but even each other, have NOTHING to offer anyone in the way of
an original thought or belief. No one will ever know who they are or
what they have ever done. But they will come here and slander and
libel anyone they dislike under the guise of being &quot;right&quot; and
&quot;righteous.&quot; Well there is being righteous and then there is being a
self-righteous prick.

One claims to be a Gnostic for instance, but doesn't even abide by the
first principles of that Philosophy. And certainly NOT ONE OF THESE
TROLLS, ever does anything considerate of or commensurate with their
high blown moral values and belief systems! They continually back
bite, cajole, pester and even use their computers to cause harm to
others, while at the same time covering their tracks with their finger
pointing! And believe me I have to name no name whatsoever and still
they will find this post and attack it as if I had spoken their names
outloud! Well if they know who they are, then they know exactly what
they are doing. So if karmic retribution exists, it will alight upon
THEIR shoulders soon enough. And if not, well, they will finally
simply impune and insult the wrong person in their lives and someone
will be playing their nemesis.

Meanwhile, Nemo Me Impune!

Therefore, you of all people should apply this to your own past
behavior and get down on both knees and apologize to the entire
group.

Until you do that, my guess is that you will use the above &quot;new tool&quot;
of yours as an excuse to perform exactly the opposite of its intent;
i.e. continue on a more frequent basis to point out faults in others,
or otherwise misconstrue their purpose.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sigmund Freud said it as well. When you point a finger at a person,

Since you call them idiots and poltroons, it makes you an idiot and
a poltroon. It hasn't any bearing whatsoever on what they present to
the group as a fact. Since you yourself have written that you are a
&quot;druggie&quot;, then for someone else to say this is nothing more than
presenting a fact.

So, as suspected, it looks like your intent is to misconstrue the
intent of the afore-mentioned authors and abuse their ideas as
a new tool.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As for my reading and writing capabilities. Why would a poltroon who
&gt; thinks I cannot read his missives, keep writing missives to me?
">

Hopefully someday you will learn to read, so offering you the
opportunity to do so is of no harm whatsoever. For you to call someone
a poltroon simply because they give you the opportunity to learn
shows only that you are yourself a poltroon. Did you forget the
actual intent of the example you first gave?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why would a person who judges me insane, keep trying to talk to me at all?
">

You should be grateful for such a kind act since a person that does
so doesn't charge you one red cent. That sort of thing usually costs
a pretty penny as you probably know, and is probably on par with
attorney fees (i.e. expensive).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Ahhh, so your post up to this point really hadn't any sort of honest
intention whatsoever, and you had a particular person that you wanted
to &quot;point out&quot; as someone whom in your opinion shares your own faults.
Well, the sad fact is that according to Poe and Freud, this not only
means that you know that you are insane, incapable of reading or writing,
a liar and abuser, but you hate these characteristics about yourself.
As you have demonstrated countless times, you haven't any desire whatsoever
to improve yourself and eliminate any of these characteristics from your
persona. But that isn't anything that anyone in this group OWES you a
cure for, either.

So basically you are proving me correct, you intend to abuse the idea
presented by Poe and Freud with your own misconstruction. How boring,
Putputputpus, you must think like Mark does, that people are too stupid
to see through to your intent.

There are some problems with your theories, regardless that your basis
is already undermined:

1) You cannot find any proof of your statement that anyone has posted
to this group, &quot;go fuck themselves with an axe&quot;

One is enough, since you won't bother to go prove me correct.

I scanned below and it looks pretty much like you are just going off
in tangents with your new found abuse tool even though you didn't
get the drift in the first place. In other words, it looks like your
usual long and boring, long-winded bullshit that isn't based on any
facts other than what you have misconstrued.

I usually let you point out your own faults. By the way, notice how I

No it makes them idiots and poltroons because what they and YOU do is

yourselves on the back for being insulting poltroons. I tell it like
it is. You tell it like you would like it to be. There is a
difference. You are an anoymous character who wants to be treated like
a literate, intelligent person, who in fact treats no one else as a
literate or intelligent person. You tell me all the time I cannot
read. Then you WRITE to me! When I answer what you write, you tell me
I cannot read it. Well that is about as idiotic a premise for a

so banal and overdone that you appear as a half-baked internet flake.

No this is where your lies begin. I wrote that I took certain drugs to

Again you repeat a lie over and over thinking this is going to work

It's an INSULT, a flame. You wanted to start a flame war here after
you saw how things were in the archives. YOur thought is I am an easy

you think you won't lose that. But you will.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The harm is in your intent ot do harm. You still haven't learned that

think what you say is what you mean. When actually it is what you
INTEND that is what you mean. You intend to be cruel, obnoxiuous and
toxic. You hope to conquer an enemy by abuse and lying. You lied about
Mark. You lied about me. You lied about many people here, then went
off your nut about other people lying. Perhaps you did not understand

You still are not &quot;getting it.&quot; You seem unable to read for context. I
wrote an original post about people like yourself who point accusing
fingers because at the end of the day, they are what they accuse
others of being. Now you are misusing MY post to uphold YOUR version

really use my words against me and be thought clever or even right.
YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR OWN WORDS. The hilarious thing here is I pushed
your magic button! You haven't stopped writing yet, trying vainly to
best someone who already bested you. It's over, Rrock, you are a
poltroon, a liar and a con-man, an idiot and an illiterate or should I

insults.

I'm done with you Rrock. You've proved you're the idiot and poltroon I

&gt;&gt;&gt;you dislike, the more you will become the basis of such epithets
&gt;&gt;&gt;yourself. The more you point out other people's faults, the more
&gt;&gt;&gt;faults YOU actually have.

&gt;&gt;Therefore, you of all people should apply this to your own past
&gt;&gt;behavior and get down on both knees and apologize to the entire
&gt;&gt;group.

&gt; And who are you? A major nobody. Why would I apologize to a troll who
&gt; came here specifically to make trouble for those of us who were here
&gt; years before you got here? Youmay apologize to me. You have offended
&gt; me personally by lying about me and slandering me on line for a few
&gt; years now. Everything you got from me, you ASKED for.
">

Oh please, keep pretending that i am the only person to whom you have
been offensive. There isn't a single solitary person that has ever
posted to this group and interacted with you that you haven't offended.
Asked for.... LOLOLOL. You're such a paranoiac.

&gt; I usually let you point out your own faults. By the way, notice how I

Exactly where was it i mentioned you were talking about me? See how
that works? Regardless of to whom you referred, the example you used
plainly and logically point out exactly what i mentioned and according
to YOUR OWN words. Again, you are textbook paranoiac.

&gt;&gt;Since you call them idiots and poltroons, it makes you an idiot and

&gt; No it makes them idiots and poltroons because what they and YOU do is

&gt; gain some sort of notariety on an obscure NG.

Oh now you want to tell me what i want, too. I suppose this is supposed
to give credence to your being a prophet, right? lolol

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You tell me all the time I cannot
&gt; read.
">

Well, okay, that is a little unfair. You can read at about a 2nd
grade level or so. But the problem isn't in your vocabulary. The
problem is in your comprehension. Were you not a paranoid then
perhaps you wouldn't add words, add meanings, add extra letters
to various words, leave words out, leave out meanings, and so
forth.

But besides just telling you, i try to help you with it all of the
time. You as a paranoid, though, cannot and will not see that. All
you can ever think is that no matter what somebody says about you,
even if it's true, is that they are out to make you look bad. Well,
here's some news for you. There isn't a goddamned thing i could
ever say that would make you look worse than you do on your own.
And who the fuck could give a rat's ass whether you look bad or
not except for yourself. The ONLY REASON that it is important to
you is because you are trying to sell your big-ego routine to dupe
some poor dolt into buying your book, or joining one of your various
cults, and they CERTAINLY won't be doing that if they notice that
you can't even read, twist peoples' words around, and can't even
understand simple logic.

So, what is more important to you? Continuing your bullshit act is
more important to you than actually improving yourself. So tell me,
just why anyone should give two shits to the wind about anything
that you have to say? You're as bad as or worse than Mark in lying
to yourself and thinking that nobody else in the world can see
right through you.

Now will that ever stop me from offering you help with your reading?
nope. It's not my fault that you constantly bite the hands that feed
you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then you WRITE to me! When I answer what you write, you tell me
&gt; I cannot read it.

I don't tell you that you cannot read it, i tell you that you need
to learn to read. That means get real, get better, try harder, and
ACTUALLY READ what is being said to you instead of INTERPRETING it
with your paranoia filter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well that is about as idiotic a premise for a
&gt; discussion as anyone has ever come up with. And your repetitions are
&gt; so banal and overdone that you appear as a half-baked internet flake.
&gt; But that's all an anonymous troll is really. So I am just telling the
&gt; truth about folks like you.

To whom, me? LOLOLOLOLOL

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;It hasn't any bearing whatsoever on what they present to
&gt;&gt;the group as a fact. Since you yourself have written that you are a
&gt;&gt;&quot;druggie&quot;, then for someone else to say this is nothing more than
&gt;&gt;presenting a fact.

&gt; No this is where your lies begin. I wrote that I took certain drugs to
&gt; expand my consciousness thirty five years ago. You say I am a druggie
&gt; today. This is simply a lie on your part. A fabrication. As is all of
&gt; your &quot;stuff.&quot; What I am saying here is your penchant for calling
&gt; someone a druggie probably comes from your own drug addled,
&gt; meaningless life.
">

So you're a self admitted druggie. What do you want, a cookie?
Do you think you can erase your history? Do you think that your
mind expanding didn't affect your mind? You took the risk of
playing with fire, you got bit, oh well, too bad, so fucking sad,
so why come crying to me about it? YOU decided to become a druggie.
*I* didn't make that decision for you, nor did i have any part in
its making.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;So, as suspected, it looks like your intent is to misconstrue the
&gt;&gt;intent of the afore-mentioned authors and abuse their ideas as
&gt;&gt;a new tool.

&gt; It looks as though your intent...well it either is my intent or it is
&gt; not. What it looks like to you is moot. I am telling people what I
&gt; think of your so-called &quot;authors.&quot; Poltroons and idiots is what they
&gt; are, and one can SEE it by just glancing at your &quot;works of literature&quot;
&gt; Mr. Author.
">

You see there? Had you the ability to read, you would realize you are
calling Poe and Freud &quot;Poltroons and idiots&quot;. Now i really couldn't
give a rat's ass what your opinion of them are, but these are the
authors on whom YOU decided to base your opinion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Try to get the sarcasm. You are not an author because you

&gt; That's o.k. because I am going to make you swallow your own hook.

Well if that's your intent, i can already see that i am correct,
you will never change, you learned nothing from the authors Poe

&gt;&gt;&gt;As for my reading and writing capabilities. Why would a poltroon who
&gt;&gt;&gt;thinks I cannot read his missives, keep writing missives to me?

&gt;&gt;Hopefully someday you will learn to read,

&gt; Again you repeat a lie over and over thinking this is going to work
&gt; for you. I learned to read and write long before you were born. I was
&gt; here writing long before you got out of your diapers, if you are even
&gt; out of them yet. You telling me I will hopefully learn to read one day
&gt; is like me telling you hopefully you will get out of diapers one day.
&gt; It's an INSULT, a flame. You wanted to start a flame war here after
&gt; you saw how things were in the archives. YOur thought is I am an easy
&gt; target because all you have to do is repeat stupid insults over and

&gt; posts and largest amount of attention. You are so stupid though that
&gt; you think you won't lose that. But you will.

&gt;&gt;so offering you the
&gt;&gt;opportunity to do so is of no harm whatsoever.

&gt; The harm is in your intent ot do harm. You still haven't learned that
&gt; lesson yet. You still are a literalist when it comes to posting. You
&gt; think what you say is what you mean. When actually it is what you
&gt; INTEND that is what you mean. You intend to be cruel, obnoxiuous and

&gt; No this is where your lies begin. I wrote that I took certain drugs to
&gt; expand my consciousness thirty five years ago. You say I am a druggie
&gt; today. This is simply a lie on your part. A fabrication. As is all of
&gt; your &quot;stuff.&quot; What I am saying here is your penchant for calling
&gt; someone a druggie probably comes from your own drug addled,
&gt; meaningless life.

&gt;&gt;So, as suspected, it looks like your intent is to misconstrue the
&gt;&gt;intent of the afore-mentioned authors and abuse their ideas as
&gt;&gt;a new tool.

&gt; It looks as though your intent...well it either is my intent or it is
&gt; not. What it looks like to you is moot. I am telling people what I
&gt; think of your so-called &quot;authors.&quot; Poltroons and idiots is what they
&gt; are, and one can SEE it by just glancing at your &quot;works of literature&quot;
&gt; Mr. Author. Try to get the sarcasm. You are not an author because you
&gt; plagiarized a bunch of old posts from this group and rewrite them
&gt; under a pseudonym! I highly doubt your real name is Rrock. No one
&gt; knows who you are. and no one cares. You are baiting me right now.
&gt; That's o.k. because I am going to make you swallow your own hook.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As for my reading and writing capabilities. Why would a poltroon who
&gt;&gt;&gt;thinks I cannot read his missives, keep writing missives to me?

&gt;&gt;Hopefully someday you will learn to read,

&gt; Again you repeat a lie over and over thinking this is going to work
&gt; for you. I learned to read and write long before you were born. I was
&gt; here writing long before you got out of your diapers, if you are even
&gt; out of them yet. You telling me I will hopefully learn to read one day
&gt; is like me telling you hopefully you will get out of diapers one day.
&gt; It's an INSULT, a flame. You wanted to start a flame war here after
&gt; you saw how things were in the archives. YOur thought is I am an easy
&gt; target because all you have to do is repeat stupid insults over and
&gt; over again to get a &quot;rise&quot; out of me. In fact Rrock, I am your best
&gt; friend here, because out of all the people I give you the largest
&gt; posts and largest amount of attention. You are so stupid though that
&gt; you think you won't lose that. But you will.

&gt;&gt;so offering you the
&gt;&gt;opportunity to do so is of no harm whatsoever.

&gt; The harm is in your intent ot do harm. You still haven't learned that
&gt; lesson yet. You still are a literalist when it comes to posting. You
&gt; think what you say is what you mean. When actually it is what you
&gt; INTEND that is what you mean. You intend to be cruel, obnoxiuous and
&gt; toxic. You hope to conquer an enemy by abuse and lying. You lied about
&gt; Mark. You lied about me. You lied about many people here, then went
&gt; off your nut about other people lying. Perhaps you did not understand
&gt; Poes commentary. You are AFRAID that what you are telling people they
&gt; are is ACTUALLY WHAT YOU ARE.

&gt;&gt;For you to call someone
&gt;&gt;a poltroon simply because they give you the opportunity to learn
&gt;&gt;shows only that you are yourself a poltroon. Did you forget the
&gt;&gt;actual intent of the example you first gave?

&gt; You still are not &quot;getting it.&quot; You seem unable to read for context. I
&gt; wrote an original post about people like yourself who point accusing
&gt; fingers because at the end of the day, they are what they accuse
&gt; others of being. Now you are misusing MY post to uphold YOUR version
&gt; of MY idea to use against me. Interesting but negated by the fact that
&gt; as a literary foe, you are as impotent as a castrated bull. You can't
&gt; really use my words against me and be thought clever or even right.
&gt; YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR OWN WORDS. The hilarious thing here is I pushed
&gt; your magic button! You haven't stopped writing yet, trying vainly to
&gt; best someone who already bested you. It's over, Rrock, you are a
&gt; poltroon, a liar and a con-man, an idiot and an illiterate or should I
&gt; say &quot;anti-literate&quot; cur. You have NEVER contrived your own flames and
&gt; insults.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would a person who judges me insane, keep trying to talk to me at
&gt;&gt;&gt;all?

&gt; I'm done with you Rrock. You've proved you're the idiot and poltroon I
&gt; was writing about. So when you point at Mark or Me or Art or anyone
&gt; else, just remember, we know what you are. And we know how bad you are
&gt; at your chosen profession! LOL!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;gone on in this NG against myself and several others, Edgar Allen Poe
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;had this to say about such pointing out of others supposed &quot;defects.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;A poltroon charges his foe, by instinct, with precisely that vice or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;meanness which the pricking of the poltroon's conscience, assures him
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;would furnish the most stable and therefore the most terrible ground
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of accusation against himself.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The more you keep calling others liar for no reason, the more of a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;liar you are yourself. The more you keep hurling epithets at another
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;you dislike, the more you will become the basis of such epithets
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;yourself. The more you point out other people's faults, the more
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;faults YOU actually have.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Therefore, you of all people should apply this to your own past
&gt; &gt;&gt;behavior and get down on both knees and apologize to the entire
&gt; &gt;&gt;group.

&gt; &gt; And who are you? A major nobody. Why would I apologize to a troll who
&gt; &gt; came here specifically to make trouble for those of us who were here
&gt; &gt; years before you got here? Youmay apologize to me. You have offended
&gt; &gt; me personally by lying about me and slandering me on line for a few
&gt; &gt; years now. Everything you got from me, you ASKED for.

&gt; Oh please, keep pretending that i am the only person to whom you have
&gt; been offensive. There isn't a single solitary person that has ever
&gt; posted to this group and interacted with you that you haven't offended.
&gt; Asked for.... LOLOLOL. You're such a paranoiac.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Until you do that, my guess is that you will use the above &quot;new tool&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;of yours as an excuse to perform exactly the opposite of its intent;
&gt; &gt;&gt;i.e. continue on a more frequent basis to point out faults in others,
&gt; &gt;&gt;or otherwise misconstrue their purpose.

&gt; &gt; I usually let you point out your own faults. By the way, notice how I
&gt; &gt; told everyone some poltroon like you would show up, telling everyone I
&gt; &gt; was talking about YOU! So therefore you must be the troll and poltroon
&gt; &gt; of which I was speaking.

&gt; Exactly where was it i mentioned you were talking about me? See how
&gt; that works? Regardless of to whom you referred, the example you used
&gt; plainly and logically point out exactly what i mentioned and according
&gt; to YOUR OWN words. Again, you are textbook paranoiac.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sigmund Freud said it as well. When you point a finger at a person,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;three of those fingers point back at you! You are pointing out faults
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;which you hate WITHIN YOURSELF.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I keep being told I am a drunkard, druggie and a wife abuser by the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;idiots and poltroons on this NG. What does that make them I wonder? Or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;need I wonder?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Since you call them idiots and poltroons, it makes you an idiot and
&gt; &gt;&gt;a poltroon.

&gt; &gt; No it makes them idiots and poltroons because what they and YOU do is
&gt; &gt; tell lies and make up tales about people you do not know, trying to
&gt; &gt; gain some sort of notariety on an obscure NG.

&gt; Ahhh, so NOW you say it is me. See how easy it is to prove to everyone
&gt; that you are a liar?  Don't say that *I* proved it, you prove it
&gt; yourself.

&gt; &gt; All you do is pat
&gt; &gt; yourselves on the back for being insulting poltroons. I tell it like
&gt; &gt; it is. You tell it like you would like it to be. There is a
&gt; &gt; difference.

&gt; (*yawn*) so this whole thread is just another &quot;bait&quot; thread of you
&gt; looking for sympathy.

&gt; &gt; You are an anoymous character who wants to be treated like
&gt; &gt; a literate, intelligent person, who in fact treats no one else as a
&gt; &gt; literate or intelligent person.

&gt; Oh now you want to tell me what i want, too. I suppose this is supposed
&gt; to give credence to your being a prophet, right? lolol

&gt; &gt; You tell me all the time I cannot
&gt; &gt; read.

&gt; Well, okay, that is a little unfair. You can read at about a 2nd
&gt; grade level or so. But the problem isn't in your vocabulary. The
&gt; problem is in your comprehension. Were you not a paranoid then
&gt; perhaps you wouldn't add words, add meanings, add extra letters
&gt; to various words, leave words out, leave out meanings, and so
&gt; forth.

&gt; But besides just telling you, i try to help you with it all of the
&gt; time. You as a paranoid, though, cannot and will not see that. All
&gt; you can ever think is that no matter what somebody says about you,
&gt; even if it's true, is that they are out to make you look bad. Well,
&gt; here's some news for you. There isn't a goddamned thing i could
&gt; ever say that would make you look worse than you do on your own.
&gt; And who the fuck could give a rat's ass whether you look bad or
&gt; not except for yourself. The ONLY REASON that it is important to
&gt; you is because you are trying to sell your big-ego routine to dupe
&gt; some poor dolt into buying your book, or joining one of your various
&gt; cults, and they CERTAINLY won't be doing that if they notice that
&gt; you can't even read, twist peoples' words around, and can't even
&gt; understand simple logic.

&gt; So, what is more important to you? Continuing your bullshit act is
&gt; more important to you than actually improving yourself. So tell me,
&gt; just why anyone should give two shits to the wind about anything
&gt; that you have to say? You're as bad as or worse than Mark in lying
&gt; to yourself and thinking that nobody else in the world can see
&gt; right through you.

&gt; Now will that ever stop me from offering you help with your reading?
&gt; nope. It's not my fault that you constantly bite the hands that feed
&gt; you.

&gt; &gt; Then you WRITE to me! When I answer what you write, you tell me
&gt; &gt; I cannot read it.

&gt; I don't tell you that you cannot read it, i tell you that you need
&gt; to learn to read. That means get real, get better, try harder, and
&gt; ACTUALLY READ what is being said to you instead of INTERPRETING it
&gt; with your paranoia filter.

&gt; &gt; Well that is about as idiotic a premise for a
&gt; &gt; discussion as anyone has ever come up with. And your repetitions are
&gt; &gt; so banal and overdone that you appear as a half-baked internet flake.
&gt; &gt; But that's all an anonymous troll is really. So I am just telling the
&gt; &gt; truth about folks like you.

&gt; To whom, me? LOLOLOLOLOL

&gt; &gt;&gt;It hasn't any bearing whatsoever on what they present to
&gt; &gt;&gt;the group as a fact. Since you yourself have written that you are a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;druggie&quot;, then for someone else to say this is nothing more than
&gt; &gt;&gt;presenting a fact.

&gt; &gt; No this is where your lies begin. I wrote that I took certain drugs to
&gt; &gt; expand my consciousness thirty five years ago. You say I am a druggie
&gt; &gt; today. This is simply a lie on your part. A fabrication. As is all of
&gt; &gt; your &quot;stuff.&quot; What I am saying here is your penchant for calling
&gt; &gt; someone a druggie probably comes from your own drug addled,
&gt; &gt; meaningless life.

&gt; So you're a self admitted druggie. What do you want, a cookie?
&gt; Do you think you can erase your history? Do you think that your
&gt; mind expanding didn't affect your mind? You took the risk of
&gt; playing with fire, you got bit, oh well, too bad, so fucking sad,
&gt; so why come crying to me about it? YOU decided to become a druggie.
&gt; *I* didn't make that decision for you, nor did i have any part in
&gt; its making.

&gt; &gt;&gt;So, as suspected, it looks like your intent is to misconstrue the
&gt; &gt;&gt;intent of the afore-mentioned authors and abuse their ideas as
&gt; &gt;&gt;a new tool.

&gt; &gt; It looks as though your intent...well it either is my intent or it is

&gt; &gt; Mr. Author.

&gt; You see there? Had you the ability to read, you would realize you are
&gt; calling Poe and Freud &quot;Poltroons and idiots&quot;. Now i really couldn't
&gt; give a rat's ass what your opinion of them are, but these are the
&gt; authors on whom YOU decided to base your opinion.

&gt; &gt; Try to get the sarcasm. You are not an author because you
&gt; &gt; plagiarized a bunch of old posts from this group and rewrite them
&gt; &gt; under a pseudonym! I highly doubt your real name is Rrock. No one
&gt; &gt; knows who you are. and no one cares. You are baiting me right now.
&gt; &gt; That's o.k. because I am going to make you swallow your own hook.

&gt; Well if that's your intent, i can already see that i am correct,
&gt; you will never change, you learned nothing from the authors Poe
&gt; and Freud, you will probably continue to use your misconception
&gt; of the base idea they were writing about, etc.

&gt; next

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;As for my reading and writing capabilities. Why would a poltroon who
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;thinks I cannot read his missives, keep writing missives to me?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Hopefully someday you will learn to read,

&gt; &gt;&gt;Since you call them idiots and poltroons, it makes you an idiot and
&gt; &gt;&gt;a poltroon.

&gt; &gt; No it makes them idiots and poltroons because what they and YOU do is
&gt; &gt; tell lies and make up tales about people you do not know, trying to
&gt; &gt; gain some sort of notariety on an obscure NG. All you do is pat
&gt; &gt; yourselves on the back for being insulting poltroons. I tell it like
&gt; &gt; it is. You tell it like you would like it to be. There is a
&gt; &gt; difference. You are an anoymous character who wants to be treated like
&gt; &gt; a literate, intelligent person, who in fact treats no one else as a
&gt; &gt; literate or intelligent person. You tell me all the time I cannot
&gt; &gt; read. Then you WRITE to me! When I answer what you write, you tell me
&gt; &gt; I cannot read it. Well that is about as idiotic a premise for a
&gt; &gt; discussion as anyone has ever come up with. And your repetitions are
&gt; &gt; so banal and overdone that you appear as a half-baked internet flake.
&gt; &gt; But that's all an anonymous troll is really. So I am just telling the
&gt; &gt; truth about folks like you.

&gt; &gt;&gt;It hasn't any bearing whatsoever on what they present to
&gt; &gt;&gt;the group as a fact. Since you yourself have written that you are a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;druggie&quot;, then for someone else to say this is nothing more than
&gt; &gt;&gt;presenting a fact.

&gt; &gt; No this is where your lies begin. I wrote that I took certain drugs to
&gt; &gt; expand my consciousness thirty five years ago. You say I am a druggie
&gt; &gt; today. This is simply a lie on your part. A fabrication. As is all of
&gt; &gt; your &quot;stuff.&quot; What I am saying here is your penchant for calling
&gt; &gt; someone a druggie probably comes from your own drug addled,
&gt; &gt; meaningless life.

&gt; &gt;&gt;So, as suspected, it looks like your intent is to misconstrue the
&gt; &gt;&gt;intent of the afore-mentioned authors and abuse their ideas as
&gt; &gt;&gt;a new tool.

&gt; &gt; It looks as though your intent...well it either is my intent or it is
&gt; &gt; not. What it looks like to you is moot. I am telling people what I
&gt; &gt; think of your so-called &quot;authors.&quot; Poltroons and idiots is what they
&gt; &gt; are, and one can SEE it by just glancing at your &quot;works of literature&quot;
&gt; &gt; Mr. Author. Try to get the sarcasm. You are not an author because you
&gt; &gt; plagiarized a bunch of old posts from this group and rewrite them
&gt; &gt; under a pseudonym! I highly doubt your real name is Rrock. No one
&gt; &gt; knows who you are. and no one cares. You are baiting me right now.
&gt; &gt; That's o.k. because I am going to make you swallow your own hook.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;As for my reading and writing capabilities. Why would a poltroon who
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;thinks I cannot read his missives, keep writing missives to me?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Hopefully someday you will learn to read,

&gt; &gt; Again you repeat a lie over and over thinking this is going to work
&gt; &gt; for you. I learned to read and write long before you were born. I was
&gt; &gt; here writing long before you got out of your diapers, if you are even
&gt; &gt; out of them yet. You telling me I will hopefully learn to read one day
&gt; &gt; is like me telling you hopefully you will get out of diapers one day.
&gt; &gt; It's an INSULT, a flame. You wanted to start a flame war here after
&gt; &gt; you saw how things were in the archives. YOur thought is I am an easy
&gt; &gt; target because all you have to do is repeat stupid insults over and
&gt; &gt; over again to get a &quot;rise&quot; out of me. In fact Rrock, I am your best
&gt; &gt; friend here, because out of all the people I give you the largest
&gt; &gt; posts and largest amount of attention. You are so stupid though that
&gt; &gt; you think you won't lose that. But you will.

&gt; &gt;&gt;so offering you the
&gt; &gt;&gt;opportunity to do so is of no harm whatsoever.

&gt; &gt; The harm is in your intent ot do harm. You still haven't learned that
&gt; &gt; lesson yet. You still are a literalist when it comes to posting. You
&gt; &gt; think what you say is what you mean. When actually it is what you
&gt; &gt; INTEND that is what you mean. You intend to be cruel, obnoxiuous and
&gt; &gt; toxic. You hope to conquer an enemy by abuse and lying. You lied about
&gt; &gt; Mark. You lied about me. You lied about many people here, then went
&gt; &gt; off your nut about other people lying. Perhaps you did not understand
&gt; &gt; Poes commentary. You are AFRAID that what you are telling people they
&gt; &gt; are is ACTUALLY WHAT YOU ARE.

&gt; &gt;&gt;For you to call someone
&gt; &gt;&gt;a poltroon simply because they give you the opportunity to learn
&gt; &gt;&gt;shows only that you are yourself a poltroon. Did you forget the
&gt; &gt;&gt;actual intent of the example you first gave?

&gt; &gt; You still are not &quot;getting it.&quot; You seem unable to read for context. I
&gt; &gt; wrote an original post about people like yourself who point accusing
&gt; &gt; fingers because at the end of the day, they are what they accuse
&gt; &gt; others of being. Now you are misusing MY post to uphold YOUR version
&gt; &gt; of MY idea to use against me. Interesting but negated by the fact that
&gt; &gt; as a literary foe, you are as impotent as a castrated bull. You can't
&gt; &gt; really use my words against me and be thought clever or even right.
&gt; &gt; YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR OWN WORDS. The hilarious thing here is I pushed
&gt; &gt; your magic button! You haven't stopped writing yet, trying vainly to
&gt; &gt; best someone who already bested you. It's over, Rrock, you are a
&gt; &gt; poltroon, a liar and a con-man, an idiot and an illiterate or should I
&gt; &gt; say &quot;anti-literate&quot; cur. You have NEVER contrived your own flames and
&gt; &gt; insults.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Why would a person who judges me insane, keep trying to talk to me at
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;all?

&gt; &gt; I'm done with you Rrock. You've proved you're the idiot and poltroon I
&gt; &gt; was writing about. So when you point at Mark or Me or Art or anyone
&gt; &gt; else, just remember, we know what you are. And we know how bad you are
&gt; &gt; at your chosen profession! LOL!

It doesn't really matter, though. The guy is sick in the head.
Let's see now, just over the past month or two since you've
been reading the group he:

1) Has declared he's a prophet
2) Claimed he taught Jesus and John
3) Decided that proof is unnecessary for anything (especially in your
case)
4) Has been trying to get people interested in sex with teenagers
5) Demonstrated he can't read (a few hundred times)
6) Demonstrated he hasn't any knowledge of markets and economics
7) Admitted once again that he's a druggie
8) Has left the group a few times (blaming it on the trolls)
9) Has been masturbating to Mark Earnest's posts
10) Claimed he was God.

Well, sock-puppet or not. I don't speak latin either, but it is a fun
language to play around with at times and a truly powerful mean to an end,
so to speak.

Nemo Me Impune... ? Isn't there something missing in this sentence? Like
&quot;lacessit&quot; as in &quot;Nemo me impune lacessit&quot;? Btw.. something to add to the
phraze. It is the Latin motto of the Order of the Thistle, the Scottish
chivalrous order. It translates into English as: No-one provokes me with
impunity. It also appears on the Scottish royal arms, and is the motto of
the Royal Scots and Black Watch regiments of the British Army.

Now, wasn't that informative?! In any case, one have to love the internet
and Google at times. Now, over to something entirely else, yet it actually
fits right in...

Midnight.

Mourning cries resound,
You are overcome with dread

When the clock begins to sound
Cold, thick fingers of mist
Touches you lightly.

That would be, &quot;Nemo me impune lacessit&quot;.  You don't actually speak
Latin, and you are unfamiliar with this quotation, or you wouldn't
have omitted this vital word.

Quidquid latine dictum sit altum viditur. - Everything said in Latin
sounds profound (actually, &quot;sounds elevated&quot;, but let's not get
picky).

Te audire no possum. Musa sapientum fixa est in aure. - I can't hear
you, I have a banana in my ear.

What you were trying to say was, &quot;No one provokes (or attacks) me with
impunity&quot;.
