Now that I'm retiring within the next few months, I'd like to finally
devote more time to my photography and really learn how to use a good
camera.  I presently have a Panasonic FZ7, but would like to step up to
a DSLR.

I'm somewhat familiar with film SLR's, having used one many years ago,
but never getting into all of its features (due to lack of time).  I
have my eye on the Nikon DSLR's and am asking for opinions on which
model might suit me best, between the D40, D40x, and the D80.

I was at Circuit City today, scouting these models out, and I see that
the D40 and D40x are physically a bit smaller than the D80.  I'm not
sure if the LCD is the same on all 3, but I really liked the layout and
LCD of the D80.

Most of my photos would be outdoors -- nature, wildlife, landscape and
some sports.  I like that the D40 has DOF preview, which (I think) the
other two models don't have.

One thing that I'm not clear about is whether or not any of these
cameras have image stabilization.  Also -- is the Auto Focus in the lens
on all three models -- or in the body?

I expect that the included 18-135 zoom lens, would fit my needs well, at
least at first.

Any thoughts on which of these models to choose?  And any
recommendations on where to get it at the best price?  (Online or
Brick-and-Mortar -- It doesn't matter to me.)

Thanks!

Sorry, you are wrong.  The D80 is the only one of these which has DOF
preview.
I must tell you though that despite over 50 years of trying, I still have a
hard time
telling much from this feature.  The view through the viewfinder darkens so
much
that I can't tell about DOF.

Image stabilization is implemented in the lens.
Auto focus is implemented in the body.

As for which one - well it boils down to what you want to do.
The D40 has fewer megapixels, but what it does have will work for sizes up
to 11x17.

The choice between the D40X and the D80 depends on how you value the various
small differences between the two.

Online, the best place to get one is B&amp;H Photovideo in New York.  They may
be
a little higher, but they deliver the merchandise.   Local stores in my area
will match
the B&amp;H retail price, but the sales tax can be more than the shipping cost.

Sorry, I can't comment on the18-135 zoom.  My 18-70 lens is quite good.
Since I
already own an 85mm f1.8 and an 180mm f2.8, there is little need for me to
get
a 18-135 lens.

i think you mean the d80 has dof preview; the d40/d40x do not.

nikon has image stabilization in the lens and not the body.  the
55-200vr is very affordable (about $250).

the d80 has a focus motor and can focus with any nikon (or third party)
autofocus lens.  the d40/d40x omits the motor in the camera (one reason
it is smaller) and therefore it will only autofocus with nikon afs and
sigma hsm lenses (there's over 40 from which to choose).  if you expect
to get some of the older non-afs lenses, the d80 would be a better
choice, otherwise you probably won't notice it with the new lenses.

depends whether you need the additional features that the d80 has
versus the d40/d40x.  and it is tough to beat the price of the d40.

b&amp;h photo in new york has competitive prices and excellent service. you
might be able to beat their price by a little but you risk getting a
sleazy merchant.

That is correct. The D40[x] is the smallest and lightest dSLR. Which
depending on your preferences can be an advantage or disadvantage. I never
could get my fingers sorted on the D40[x] and opted for the larger D80.

The separate status LCD on the D80 is certainly a very nice feature.

The D80 definitately has DOF preview. I would assume the D40x does, too,
considering that it's basically the same model as the D40, just with a
larger sensor and very few other modifications.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One thing that I'm not clear about is whether or not any of these
&gt; cameras have image stabilization.
">

No, Nikon decided to put the image stabilization in the lenses, which is
more expensive (you need the stabilization in each lens) but more effective,
too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also -- is the Auto Focus in the
&gt; lens on all three models -- or in the body?
">

Wrong question (and a matter of heated arguments).
The D40[x] DOES NOT have an autofocus motor, therefore lenses without
buildin autofocus motor must be focussed manually. Only AF-S lenses will
auto-focus on a D40[x]. Caveat: many people claim that manual focussing with
the D40[x] is a pain because of the small viewfinder which doesn't have any
of the old-fashioned aides like split screen or microprisms.

The D80 DOES have a buildin autofocus motor, therefore AF as well as AF-S
lenses can be used in full auto-focus mode.

Note: On the one hand AF-S becomes more and more the standard, even for
third-party lenses. On the other hand high-end lenses, in particular primes,
are not available as AF-S at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I expect that the included 18-135 zoom lens, would fit my needs well,
&gt; at least at first.
">

Probably. It is not top of the line, but for a kit lens certainly more than
adequate. There are much worse lenses out there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Any thoughts on which of these models to choose?  And any
">

Matter of your very own preference. If you are thinking about moving up
sometime to more lenses and more serious photography then the D80 offers
more flexibility and options.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Before you order online I highly recommend to check
http://www.resellerratings.com . There are some real horse peddlers out
there, e.g. http://www.resellerratings.com/store/Broadway_Photo
My favourite store is B&amp;H ( http://www.bhphotovideo.com/ ). More expensive
than the scum bags, but still good prices with excellent service.

You are correct, Jim.  I mis-typed and meant to type &quot;D80&quot;.

It seems that everyone recommends B&amp;H.  I'll check them out.

How can an evf viewfinder show ANY dof effects as it is just a

No, it is more like you should know more.

What you see through the viewfinder is the depth of field with the lens wide
open.  This is rarely what I care about.
When you stop the lens down to the taking aperature, the view through the
finder must darken.  At this point, it
is most difficult to judge depth of field.   This practice has been the case
since single lens reflex cameras were introduced
in the 30s (or earlier).

Since the LCD on the P&amp;S cameras never darkens, it can only be showing
whatever the depth of field is at full aperature.
Thus, while it may show some depth of field, it is not what people need to
judge depth of field.

Better than an optical viewfinder if it uses digital zoom.

That would only be true if it wasn't a digital image LCD but an
optical viewfinder. For example, some when controlling the aperture
will show the DoF at that aperture and the brightness you'd get at
whatever shutter speed was necessary, unlike an optical viewfinder
which is limited to real time brightness.
