LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Saturated fat does not affect blood cholesterol
Uffe Ravnskov
Magle Stora Kyrkogata 9
S-22350 Lund
Sweden

Dear Sir:

The most striking observation from the study by Krauss et al (1) is the
finding that a diet rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) results in a lower
or a steady state concentration of total and LDL cholesterol and an
increase in the concentration of HDL cholesterol, regardless of whether the
diet has a reduced energy content. Similar effects on blood lipids have
been observed in 4 weight-reducing trials with high intakes of SFAs
(2-5)(Table 1) and in many similar trials with unrestricted intakes of
SFAs.

[Table 1 goes here. I don’t have enough technical know-how to copy it from
the paper. It is a summary of the above references 2-5 presenting data
showing the lack of cholesterol elevation brought about by dietary
saturated fat in doses of up to 50 percent of calories consumed.]

In 1973, Reiser (6) questioned the effects of SFA intake on serum
cholesterol. In a thorough review of the relevant experiments, he noted
several methodologic and interpretational errors. The most important errors
are probably the attribution of differences between SFAs and
polyunsaturated fatty acids to the former, when the effect could have been
due to the latter, and the use of vegetable oils saturated by hydrogenation
instead of natural SFAs.

A possible reason why the effects were more pronounced before weight
reduction than after weight reduction in the study by Krauss et al was the
difference in metabolism between the normal-weight and overweight subjects.
Cornier et al (7) recently found that total and LDL-cholesterol
concentrations decreased more with a low-carbohydrate than with a low-fat,
calorie-restricted diet. Interestingly, the overweight subjects with
reduced insulin sensitivity, but not those with normal insulin sensitivity,
had an increase in cholesterol with the low-fat diet but a decrease with
the low-carbohydrate diet. In both groups, the changes in lipids were more
beneficial with a low-carbohydrate diet than with a low-fat diet.
Therefore, the different lipid responses before and after weight reduction
in the study by Krauss et al may have been because the loss of weight may
have improved the participants’ insulin sensitivity and thus their lipid
response.

Because the main reason for restricting the intake of SFAs in all official
guidelines is to change blood lipids, demonizing these nutrients seems
inappropriate. In his editorial, Katan (8) claims that high intakes of
unsaturated fatty acids reduce the risk of heart attacks, but his evidence
is based on a meta-analysis that had ignored 4 unsuccessful trials (9). Two
meta-analyses of all controlled clinical trials in which the only
intervention was a change in dietary fats found no effect on coronary or
total mortality (10).

I've been working on this topic for several years now.  What most of
the critics of the "lipid hypothesis" don't discuss is the role of
oxidation, which would actually support their arguments.  For example,
there are studies of peoples who all have "high cholesterol" and eat
diets rich in saturated fatty acids (coconut products) but have no CHD
problems.  Why?  Because cholesterol around 200-200 is good, so long as
it is not oxidized.  You can read all about this, along with citations
from the relevant evidence, at my free site:

You can ask me questions in the forums there, if you have any.

Enrico:

If you take a look at most of the kinds of studies you are referencing,
you will realize how outright silly they are.  There is actually a
literature devoted entirely to pointing out the problems with such
studies.  On my free site, I examine many such studies, and point out
why they are so flawed.  Moreover, if saturated fatty acids are so
"bad," why do Asians on coconut rich diets have so little of the
"diseases" that "saturated fat" is supposed to cause?  I agree that
lard is bad news, but it's only 40% saturated fatty acids, so whoever
is calling lard a "saturated fat" should probably be ignored right at
the outset.

I did a decent search. Most of the time, when journals refer to the CHD risk
from saturated fats, either the author is just making an assertion or he is
citing an old study. When you manage to get your hands on the study, you
find it doesn't serve as support for the assertion.

I'm beginning to think that the anti-fat and anti-saturated fat stances came
from nothing more than simplistic early observations that plaque contains
fats.

These plaques are actually richer in unsaturated than saturated fatty
acids, so that claim never had any merit to begin with, but remember,
the "shell game" many of these "experts" are playing involves how they
define "saturated fat."  Lard, at 40% saturated fatty acids, should not
be called a "saturated fat."  Anyone who does should be confronted with
the basic, undeniable fact, but of course when you do this, their
secretaries say that they are "in a meeting."

The other thing is that they don't take cooking techniques into
account, nor the other constituents of the fat in question.  Coconut
oil has not cholesterol, so if you cook with it, you can't oxidize
cholesterol.  With lard, there is cholesterol present.  Also, as I
point out on that link to my site, if you look at common recipes, you
find that many "vegetarian" dishes are actually higher in saturated
fatty acid content than beef and pork dishes.

It is the use of refined and highly unsaturated oil, as well as the
cooked animal products that represent the biggest health threats in the
modern Western dietary context (assuming you don't consume things like
aspartame).  In my nutrition forum, there is a thread called something
like "How PUFAs cause heart disease."  I suggest those interested in
this topic read that as well.

Well, in the document you cite,  the discussion about the evidence from
actual studies that modified the saturated fat consumption and looked at
changes in heart disease rates says there is little evidence (few studies)
and then cites two. In one, the researchers didn't yet know about trans-fat,
and in their attempt to replace sat fat with unsaturated fats, they sharply
reduced their intake of trans-fats. They found heart disease decreased and
attributed it to decreased sat-fat...

In the second study, reduction of fat overall produced no change in heart
disease rates. This is interpreted as being too short a study to reveal the
reduction in heart disease rates that would have occurred...

You don't think we need additional evidence?!

Sure, the abstract is as follows:
"Optimal Diets for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease
Frank B. Hu, MD, PhD; Walter C. Willett, MD, DrPH

JAMA. 2002;288:2569-2578.

Context  Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of
mortality in industrialized countries and is rapidly becoming a primary
cause of death worldwide. Thus, identification of the dietary changes
that most effectively prevent CHD is critical.

Objective  To review metabolic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial
evidence regarding diet and CHD prevention.

Data Sources and Study Selection  We searched MEDLINE through May 2002
for epidemiologic and clinical investigations of major dietary factors
(fat, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acids, trans-fatty acids,
carbohydrates, glycemic index, fiber, folate, specific foods, and
dietary patterns) and CHD. We selected 147 original investigations and
reviews of metabolic studies, epidemiologic studies, and dietary
intervention trials of diet and CHD.

Data Extraction  Data were examined for relevance and quality and
extracted by 1 of the authors.

Data Synthesis  Compelling evidence from metabolic studies, prospective
cohort studies, and clinical trials in the past several decades
indicates that at least 3 dietary strategies are effective in
preventing CHD: substitute nonhydrogenated unsaturated fats for
saturated and trans-fats; increase consumption of omega-3 fatty acids
from fish, fish oil supplements, or plant sources; and consume a diet
high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains and low in refined
grain products. However, simply lowering the percentage of energy from
total fat in the diet is unlikely to improve lipid profile or reduce
CHD incidence. Many issues remain unsettled, including the optimal
amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, the optimal
balance between omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fats, the amount
and sources of protein, and the effects of individual phytochemicals,
antioxidant vitamins, and minerals.

Conclusions  Substantial evidence indicates that diets using
nonhydrogenated unsaturated fats as the predominant form of dietary
fat, whole grains as the main form of carbohydrates, an abundance of
fruits and vegetables, and adequate omega-3 fatty acids can offer
significant protection against CHD. Such diets, together with regular
physical activity, avoidance of smoking, and maintenance of a healthy
body weight, may prevent the majority of cardiovascular disease in
Western populations.

Anyway, I think you also need epidemiological evidence.

That evidence is always going to be somewhat wanting since it is
difficult to monitor what people eat over a long period of time.

Animal studies are much better controlled and given more definite
results.

Thanks for the Abstract! But it's another review, so I still can't see any
"smoking gun"!
Can you also access to the full text? What references do they provide as
"compelling evidence" for the sat fats - CHD link? Do they state a risk
ratio? Is it a strong or weak association? I gather that official
recommendations "allow" about 10 percent calories from sat fats, thus they
must not be "all that bad", so to speak. :)

Besides, that review says "saturated and trans-fats". According to a FDA
committee paper (2004), trans fats are way more adverse than sat fats with
respect to CHD (and not just that).

| With respect to Question 3, Dr. Rimm pointed out that intervention
| studies show that trans fatty acid intake increases LDL or LDL/HDL ratio
| - risk factors of CHD - in a dose-dependent manner by about two to
| three-fold that of saturated fatty acids.  With observational studies,
| the risks associated with a 1 percent increment in trans fatty acid is
| about three to four times that observed for a 1 percent increase in
| saturated fatty acid.  In the interventional studies, that magnitude of
| change is unlikely to have a measurable biological effect, at least in
| the short term.  Additionally, Dr. Rimm stated that when looking at
| diabetes research, it seems that there is an impact for trans fatty
| acids and not for saturated fat.  Insulin sensitivity research suggests
| that there is an adverse effect for trans fatty acids and not
| necessarily for saturated fat.  With regard to inflammatory markers,
| there are a number of biological studies, some observational and some
| experimental, that would suggest that trans fatty acids are very
| different from saturated fat.  Within the range of 1 to 6 percent of
| energy of trans fatty acids, there is a very big difference in the
| impact of trans fatty acids compared to saturated fat on measurable
| biological effects (lipids).  Dr. Lichtenstein pointed out that at low
| levels of intake of trans fatty acids, e.g., at one and two
| percent of energy, there seems to be little difference in the effect of
| trans fatty acids versus saturated fatty acids on risk of CHD.  She
| indicated that in intervention studies there is less of an effect than
| seen in observational studies.  So, in the interventional studies that
| magnitude of change is unlikely to have a measurable biological effect,
| at least in the short term.
|
| Dr. Krinsky added that, as stated in earlier discussion, at higher
| intake levels, a marked difference between trans fatty acids and
| saturated fatty acids is observed, with trans fatty acids being more
| adverse with respect to CHD.
|
| Dr. Rimm pointed out that trans fatty acids are different than saturated
| fat, and trans fatty acids will be quantitatively listed on the label.
| He indicated that consumers need to be aware that at very low intake
| levels of trans fatty acids intake, the impact on blood lipids is not
| different than saturated fat; however, at higher intake levels, the
| impact of trans fatty acids is more adverse than saturated fat.  Dr.
| Mayne suggested that there is a continuum when looking at effects of
| trans fatty acids versus saturated fat, i.e., the difference is more
| magnified as intake levels increase, keeping in mind that datapoints are
| lacking.

One study did that, but the results weren't significant. The problem is
that diets don't vary that significantly in the lipid profile.

I looked at the Oslo study, but it was a long time ago and they

So are many diseases. Anyway, I just meant it is a review article, not the
direct source. They tell us that others saw a smoking gun, so to speak.

According to Jim, though

What about the Strong Heart Study (2006) on abut 3,000 Native Americans?
They do say that "Total fat, saturated fatty acid, and monounsaturated
fatty acid intake were strong predictors of CHD mortality in American
Indians aged 47-59 y, independent of other established CHD risk factors."

Study.

BACKGROUND: The results of previous studies on the association between
dietary fat intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence are
inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the
association between dietary fat intake and CHD incidence in American
Indians in the Strong Heart Study. DESIGN: A total of 2938 participants
aged 47-79 y and free of CHD at the second examination (1993-1995) were
examined and followed for CHD, nonfatal CHD, and fatal CHD events to 31
December 2002. Dietary intake was assessed by using a 24-h diet recall and
was calculated as percentages of energy. RESULTS: Participants were
followed for a mean (+/-SD) of 7.2 +/- 2.3 y. During follow-up, 436
incident CHD cases (298 nonfatal CHD and 138 fatal CHD events) were
ascertained. Participants aged 47-59 y in the highest quartile of intake of
total fat, saturated fatty acids, or monounsaturated fatty acids had higher
CHD mortality than did those in the lowest quartile [hazard ratio (95% CI):
3.57 (1.21, 10.49), 5.17 (1.64, 16.36), and 3.43 (1.17, 10.04),
respectively] after confounders were controlled for. These associations
were not observed for those aged 60-79 y. CONCLUSIONS: Total fat, saturated
fatty acid, and monounsaturated fatty acid intake were strong predictors of
CHD mortality in American Indians aged 47-59 y, independent of other
established CHD risk factors. It may be prudent for American Indians to
reduce their fat intake early in life to reduce the risk of dying from CHD.

That's not what dietary recommendations say. They do not say: try to keep
it as low as possible. They say: *high* intakes may be risky.

While statistical significance is important, don't get too carried
away without reading all the data. Clinical significance sometimes
trumps findings that aren't statistically significant.  (And sometimes
studies showing a statistically significant result have no clinical

First, your statement makes no sense: things exist. Stat sig is more
about relationships between events that may or may not be related.

That does not justify, nor is it meant to, claiming that an anecdote
is all that is needed. An anecdote DOES provide evidence of a
potential relationship, albeit weak evidence.

On the one hand, a statistically significant finding can be clinically
irrelevant--that's easy to understand.

On the other, a finding of no statistical significance may mean a
number of things. If it is near the really arbitrary p &lt; 0.05 level,
it may be faulty data entry. It may be the analysis was wrong or data
collected incorrectly or incompletely. It may mean that the study was
not adequately powered (e.g., not enough people enrolled) to establish
statistical significance. And so on.

Well, indeed. However, our great store of knowledge often suffers
significant gaps, especially when pharma companies routinely suppress
or fail to publish negative data, a routine activity.

Science is thus thwarted. And worse, lives can be injured or destroyed
simply to satisfy the bottom line.

Well, for example, a statistically significant benefit of a new statin
drug may be true, but an older, off-patent version may be just as
effective, possibly less toxic and much less costly. So clinically, it
is not a significant finding.

Or counseled individuals using significant lifestyle changes in terms
of exercise and diet may have much greater reduction in cardiovascular
risk than using drugs, rending such a finding even less clinically
important.
