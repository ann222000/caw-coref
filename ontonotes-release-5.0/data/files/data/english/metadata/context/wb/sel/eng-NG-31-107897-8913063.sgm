10.0 CD Players, CDs, Turntables, and LPs

10.1 What should I listen for when evaluating a turntable or CD player?
For tape decks and turntables, beware first of speed variations
(wow and flutter). A good check for this is Richard Strauss'
&quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; (aka: The Theme From 2001), which has
a long, low, sustained organ note that comes in well before the
main theme starts, and is held through the first movement.
Concentrate on that. Make sure it doesn't wobble or warble.
There's also a good bit at the beginning of Pink Floyd's
&quot;The Wall&quot;, but it doesn't go on as long, so you've got less
time to think about it. Tape decks are prone to losing
high-frequency notes, so pick something you like which has lots
of treble, and make sure it is clear.

The sound of a turntable is largely bound up in the kind of
cartridge mounted on it. Make sure to listen to a table with
a cartridge similar to what you're buying, and not one in a
different price bracket. If possible, audition the turntable
with the same arm and cartridge, so that you will experience
potential cartridge/arm interactions, too. Most cartridges
work better with one arm than another. Treat the
tonearm/cartridge pair as a system, rather than independent
parts.

For CD players, try some piano music. See if the high notes
sound tinny. Also, try something which has some soft parts,
not the same as turning the volume down. Distortion for CD
players (as for other devices) is measured at a high output,
but in fact in CD players (unlike others) it's likely to be
worse in soft passages of music. Most classical recordings
contain a suitable soft passage. Most rock music won't.

Distortion in CD players, if you want to call it that, is
a function of the granulation noise, or time-delay pre-echo that
can come out of the filtering. To listen for this, use material
that is rich in high-order harmonics, such as brass music.
Unfortunately, you can't reliably predict how a CD player
will sound by looking at specifications, features, or the
technology it uses. If you want to know how a player will
sound, you MUST listen to it.

10.2 Are some discs better than others?
Some recordings are better than others. Some artists are better
than others. Some recording engineers are better than others.
Some microphones are better than others. Some music is better
than others.

Ignoring that, there is some difference between discs. Some
of the very earliest discs were badly made and deteriorated
with time. The technical problems that caused those problems
have been solved.

Some &quot;gold&quot; discs are available which are advertised to have
better life and quality than common &quot;aluminum&quot; discs. These
sell for an extra US $15 or more per disc over the cost of the
same music on a common disc. Studies have shown that there is
an advantage to glass-encased, gold platters for archiving
computer data that is not error tolerant and will need to be
stored for many tens of years. I have yet to see a similar
comparison which justified any extra effort for storing audio
recordings for 50 years. Part of the reason for this is that
audio recordings contain error correction codes, allowing a
CD player to perfectly reconstruct minor flaws. Another reason
is that CD players can effectively reconstruct badly damaged
audio data, even if some data is completely missing.

Some discs seem to have pinholes in the aluminum, which are
visible when the disc is held up to a strong light. However,
these discs play fine and last very well, so the effect of these
pinholes is probably nil. Some have performed studies counting
errors on various discs with various players. They found that,
in general, the error count was consistent from one player to
another. Also, in general, most discs have a low, consistent
error rate which is perfectly correctable using the redundant
data stored on the disc. This study did find that one group of
discs had a higher error rate than all of the rest. This group
was the promotional discs, also called &quot;music samplers&quot; given
away by music companies to introduce you to their family of
artists and performers. Despite these higher error counts,
these discs still played fine.

If there is no abusive handling involved, I have rarely heard of
a disc that degraded with time. Of the few that have existed,
they tended to be from one of the bad batches mentioned earlier.

There is no doubt that some discs are mastered better than
others. Some are badly mixed. Some are so badly recorded that
there is noticeable clipping. Some are made from damaged master
recordings. CD technology is no guarantee of good music or of a
good recording.

10.3 Are CDs better than LPs?
Some excellent recordings are mastered digitally, and sound
great on LPs. This suggests that there is nothing inherently
bad about digital.

Some find that LPs sound better than CDs. Advocates of LPs
claim that the digital to analog (D/A) converter in home CD
players isn't up to the quality of the information on the disc.
They also claim that the analog electronics in a home CD player
can be poor.

Some believe that CDs do not sound like LPs because the CD does
not have the frequency response errors, the distortion, or the
stereo separation problems of LPs.

In general, though, there are good and bad CD players, just as
there are good and bad turntables, cartridges, and tone arms.
Any ultimate comparison would require ultimate equipment, which
is unaffordable. In moderately priced systems, there will be
some signal damage from the turntable system and some signal
damage from the CD player.

LP lovers often learn the nuances of cartridge selection, record
care, and even turntable and tonearm adjustment. They have
found that the turntable will sound different if the arm height
is adjusted, if the cartridge angles are changed, and if the
tonearm wire is moved. CDs do not offer as many avenues for the
home experimenter.

However, Audio Amateur Magazine has published modification
projects for CD players; particularly for Magnavox 560 and
similar European players. Audio Magazine has also published
such articles.

10.4 What turntable should I buy?
Despite improvements in motor technology, most great turntables
use belt drive. Rubber roller (idler) drive sounds the worst.

Select a turntable with a very heavy platter for the least wow
and flutter. Give the platter a rap with your knuckle. It
should not &quot;ring&quot; like a cymbal. It should feel and sound dead.

Also look for a turntable that has good isolation from base
to stylus. With the amp on and the turntable selected, but
with the turntable motor off, put an old record on the
turntable, lower the stylus onto the record, and then tap
the edge of the base. Not too hard, you don't want to send
the arm flying. At worst, you will hear a quick 'thump'
followed by silence through the speakers; if you're lucky,
you'll hear nothing at all. If the sound continues beyond a
quick 'thump', the mechanical isolation is not great, and you
should look at some other make. When you perform this test,
be sure to unplug the turntable power cord.

If the turntable has a tonearm, try to evaluate the arm,
too. A good arm should be adjustable in height. A good arm
should allow cartridge adjustments. A good arm will be very
rigid and have no bearing play. A good arm should accommodate
a wide range of cartridges. Despite this, some arms work
better with high compliance cartridges, while others are
at their best with low compliance. Ask.

Turntables by Denon, Dual, Linn, Michell, Oracle, Pro-Ject,
Rega, Sota, Thorens, and VPI are recommended. If you want a
turntable on a budget, consider the NAD 5120 at approx. $160.

10.5 What phono cartridge should I buy for my older turntable?
The $40 Grado Prestige Black is a great value for any home user.
However, some users comment that it can pick up hum from some
turntables.  For the purist, there are many other choices, both
moving coil and moving magnet. Each sounds slightly different,
and has its individual strengths. Moving Magnet (MM)
cartridges tend to have higher output than Moving Coil (MC)
cartridges, with exception. Low Output Moving Coil cartridges
require unusual preamplification. Check with a dealer before
buying one.

10.6 Will phono cartridges still be around ten years from now?
Ten years ago, I wrote that cartridges will become scarce.  I was
wrong.  Today, many manufacturers to make many common, good, and
audiophile cartridges, including well respected makers like Grado,
Ortofon, Rega, Shure, and Sumiko.

10.7 Will LPs still be around ten years from now?
There is a strong movement of collectors and purists who will
keep their collections and buy good used discs. Count on these
people to keep the used disc market hot for 25 years longer.

As for new music, less is being pressed today than 20 years
ago. Many popular artists are being released on LP in parts
of Europe, but availability is dependent on country. One
person said that many new LPs are available in Spain.

LP sales have increased recently in Japan and in the UK. Polydor
is now re-releasing older recordings on vinyl, and will continue
to press them as long as it is profitable. Likewise, there are
several re-releasing projects in Japan. Some are for Jazz
collectors and others are for pure analog as well as classical
music lovers. They are selling the LPs by subscription, with
shipments every 2 or 3 months. Each release includes about 20
titles. Japan has released over 100 LPs this way last year.

10.8 What about CD green pens?
In a nutshell, save your money.

A CD player &quot;reads&quot; information on the disc with a laser light
beam. Some believe that if you put a green

11.0 Amplifiers
Note: A receiver contains an amplifier, so the following
questions apply to both receivers and amplifiers. In the
following text, &quot;amp&quot; and &quot;amplifier&quot; are used synonymously.

11.1 What is Biamping? Biwiring?
Most speakers are connected to an amplifier by one pair
of terminals on each speaker. Within these speakers, a
crossover distributes the signal (modified appropriately)
to each of the drivers in the speaker.

Some speakers are set up to be either biwired or biamped. A
much smaller number allows triwiring and triamping. The same
principles apply but use three sets of wires or three amplifiers
instead of two. Most speakers that support biamping/biwiring
have two pairs of terminals and some mechanism for shorting
the two pairs together when used in the normal way. This
mechanism is most likely a switch or a bus bar. To help
the descriptions below, I will refer to these two pairs as
LO and HI (because normally one pair connects to the woofer
and the other pair connects to the tweeter/midrange).

Biwiring means that a speaker is driven by two pairs of wires
from the same amplifier output. One cable pair connects HI to
the amp, and the other cable pair connects LO to the same amp
output that you connected the HI cable to. Biwiring is
controversial; some folks hear a difference, some do not. One
plausible explanation for this involves magnetic induction of
noise in the relatively low current HI cable from the high
current signal in the LO cable. Accordingly, Vandersteen
recommends the two cable pairs for a channel be separated by at
least a few inches. In any case, the effect appears to be small.

Biamping means that the two pairs of terminals on a speaker are
connected to distinct amplifier outputs. Assuming you have two
stereo amplifiers, you have two choices: either an amp per
channel, or an amp per driver. For the amp per channel, you
connect each terminal pair to a different channel on the amp
(for example, the left output connects to HI and the right side
to LO). In the other configuration, one amp connects to the LO
terminals, and the other amp is connected to the HI terminals.

The point of biamping is that most of the power required to
drive the speakers is used for low frequencies. Biamping allows
you to use amps specialized for each of these uses, such
as a big solid-state amplifier for the LO drivers and higher
quality (but lower power) amp for the higher frequencies.
When you have two identical stereo amps, some folks
recommend distributing the low-frequency load by using an amp
per channel. In any case, whenever you use two different
amplifiers, be careful to match levels between them.

Biamping also allows you to use high-quality electronic
crossovers and drive the speaker's drivers (the voice coils)
directly, without the series resistance and non-linear
inductance of a passive crossover. Biamping which uses the
speaker's crossover is therefore much less desirable. Replacing
a good speaker's crossover with an electronic crossover has
advantages, but involves some very critical tradeoffs and tuning
which is best left to those well-equipped or experienced.

See also section 16.0 below, on wire and connectors in general.

11.2 Can amplifier X drive 2 ohm or 4 ohm speakers? How do I raise the
impedance of a speaker from (say) 4 ohms to 8 ohms?

Most amplifiers can drive load impedances that are too high or
too low by a factor of perhaps two, since they will be designed to
cope with speaker impedances changing with frequency by that much
or more, but you lose safety margin, so keep the volume down.
Driving too low a load impedance increases the current in the
output transistors at a time when the voltage across them
is high, so extra heat is a risk as well as extra current.

The distortion will almost certainly be higher, but the point
at which the transistors burn out may not coincide with the
distortion getting significantly worse.  Unless you are an
electronics engineer and open the box, measure the heatsinks,
and do the calculations, you can't tell if it is safe just
by listening.

Also, amplifiers with transformer output stages (most tube amps)
can be damaged with too HIGH an output impedance, e.g. an open
circuit.

If the manufacturer recommends a range of impedances it is safest
to abide by that.

You can raise the impedance of a speaker by a few different
methods. However, each has drawbacks. If your amplifier won't
drive your speakers, AND you are sure that the problem is that
the speakers are too low impedance, you might try one of these
techniques.

A)      Add a 4 ohm resistor in series with the speaker.
This requires a high power resistor, because the
resistor will dissipate as much power as the speaker.
Doing this will almost always hurt sound quality, too.
This is caused, in part, by the fact that speakers do
not have constant resistance with frequency. See 11.3
for more information on this.

B)      Use a matching transformer. There are speaker matching
transformers which can change from 4 ohm to 8 ohm, but
a high quality transformer like this can cost as much
as a common receiver. Also, even the best transformer
will add some slight frequency response and dynamic
range errors.

C)      Use two identical speakers in series. If you have two
4 ohm speakers which are the same make and model, you
can wire them in series and make an equivalent speaker
with 8 ohm impedance. The sound from that &quot;new speaker&quot;
will not be as precisely localized as it would from one
speaker, so your stereo image may be hurt. Also, it
requires that you buy twice as many speakers as you
might have bought otherwise. However, this technique
has one side benefit. Two speakers can handle twice the
power of one.

11.3 How do I drive more than two speakers with one stereo amplifier?
One amp can drive many speakers. However, there are two limits
to this practice. The first is that you can overheat or damage
an amplifier if you drive too low of an impedance to loud
listening levels. Avoid loading any amplifier with a lower
impedance than recommended. Adding two speakers to one amp
output loads that output with half the impedance of one speaker.
(See also 11.2 above)

The second is that with tube amplifiers, which are uncommon
in today's common system, it is important that the speaker
impedance and the amplifier output impedance be well matched.

When driving two or more speakers from one amp output, always
wire them in parallel, rather than series. Series connection,
while safe in terms of impedance levels, can hurt sound quality
by raising the impedance that the speakers themselves see.
Also, when different speakers are wired in series, amplifier
voltage will divide between the speakers unevenly, because
different speakers have different impedance-versus-frequency
characteristics.

Many amplifiers have connectors for two pairs of speakers. In
general, these amplifiers also have a speaker selector switch.
Most amplifiers connect speakers in parallel when both are
selected, although some less expensive ones will wire the
speakers in series. It is common for these amplifiers to require
8 ohm speakers only, because the amplifier is built to drive
either 4 or 8 ohms, and two sets of 8 ohm speakers in parallel
loads the amplifier like one set of 4 ohm speakers. It is
almost always safe to connect one set of 4 ohm speakers to
an amplifier with two sets of outputs, provided that you
NEVER use the second terminals for any other speakers.

11.4 How big an amplifier do I need?
Unfortunately, amplifier power ratings and speaker power ratings
are almost always misleading. Sometimes, they are factually
wrong. Speaker ratings are almost useless in evaluating needs.

To start with, sound pressure, measured in dB, often stated as
dB SPL, is a function of the log of the acoustic &quot;sound&quot; power.
Further, human hearing is less sensitive to differences in power
than the log transfer function would imply.  This means that the
perceived difference between a 50 watt amplifier and a 100 watt
amplifier, all else equal, is very small! One columnist said
that a 250 watt amplifier puts out twice the perceived
loudness of a 25 watt amplifier, but quantitative statements
about perception should always be treated with caution.
That statement came from Electronics Now Magazine, Jan 1994,
Page 87, Larry Klein's &quot;Audio Update&quot; Column, which is also
good reading on the subject of required amplifier power.

There is a wide variation in the &quot;efficiency&quot; and &quot;sensitivity&quot;
of the various speakers available. I have seen good speakers
with under 80 dB per watt efficiency and have also seen good
speakers with over 96 dB per watt efficiency, measured one meter
from the speaker. This difference of 16 dB represents a factor
of 40 difference in power requirement!

So the first step in determining amplifier requirements is to
estimate relative speaker efficiency. Other factors include how
loud you will want to listen, how large your room is, and how
many speakers you will drive with one amplifier. This
information will give you a rough starting point. For an
example, a typical home speaker will produce 88 dB at 1 watt.
In an average room, a person with average tastes will be happy
with this speaker and a good 20 watt per channel amplifier.
Someone who listens to loud music or wants very clean
reproduction of the dynamics of music will want more power.
Someone with less efficient speakers or a large room will also
want more power.

Past that point, you will have to use your ears. As with all
other decisions, your best bet is to get some candidates, borrow
them from a friendly dealer, take them home, and listen to them
at your normal and

12.0 Speakers:

12.1 What should I listen to when evaluating speakers?
The most important thing is to listen to recordings that
you *know*. Any good salesman will play you recordings
that highlight that particular speaker. Do not be embarrassed
about bringing a stack of CDs with you to the hi-fi shop.

Do not spend your valuable listening time switching between a
dozen pairs every 3 seconds. If you are shopping at a quality
store, the dealer will, from the description of your room, your
size requirements, your musical tastes, and your budget, be able
to show you a couple of pairs that will be close to what you
want. Spend several minutes listening to each. When you think
you're close, don't be embarrassed about spending half an hour
or more listening to the speakers. You're going to have them in
your home for a lot longer, and many speakers will cause
&quot;listening fatigue&quot; after a short time. Make sure you really
like them before you hand over money.

One thing to try is well recorded &quot;Spoken Word&quot; records; most
people have a very good ability to tell when a speaking voice
sounds unnatural, even if they've never heard the person
speaking live. If you play an acoustic instrument, find
something that features that instrument solo, or in a small
group; make sure it really sounds like it should. Almost
everyone has heard a live piano. Piano can be very revealing.

Blues, jazz, folk, or 'easy listening' music with simple
instruments and a female vocalist is also revealing. Well done
female singing voices provide a very good test of a system's
response. Try something simple and soft, which will let you
hear any noises coming from the system; and something complex,
with lots of instruments all happening at once, to make sure the
system doesn't go muddy when things get complicated. And, of
course, try a few of your favorites, and see if you like what
happens with them.

If a sales person suggests some music to listen to, the odds are
that it isn't the most revealing. Sales people tend to suggest
things which sound great. Anything you own and like is good,
because you know it and are happy to listen to it carefully. No
matter how good the recording, if you don't like Opera, you
won't listen to it as carefully as your favorite, scratchy,
1940's rhythm and blues.

Most important is to listen to something you are familiar with.
Even if a recording is flawed (and what ones aren't?), how is it
different from your normal setup? Some of the most important
differences are &quot;Gee, I never heard that instrument before!&quot;

12.2 What should I listen for when evaluating speakers?
When comparing two speakers side-by-side, doing an AB
comparison, be extremely careful to match the levels before
evaluating. A slight level difference can make one speaker
sound better, even though the difference may not be perceived
as a level difference. Some claim that you will be influenced
by a difference of less than 1/2 dB!

First and foremost, the sound should be natural. If you listen
to vocals, close your eyes and try to picture someone singing in
the same room with you. Does it sound realistic? Likewise with
instruments. You selected recordings of instruments that you
like and have heard live. Do they sound like what you remember
them sounding like live?

Your very first impression should be something like &quot;what nice
sound&quot;. If your initial gut reaction is &quot;gosh, what a lot of
detail&quot;, the system is likely to be heavy in the treble (often
interpreted by beginners as &quot;more detailed&quot;) and you'll probably
find that annoying after a while. If your first reaction is
&quot;hey, what powerful bass&quot;, then the system is probably
bass-heavy, rather than ideal. The most common mistake for
beginners is to buy a system with REALLY powerful bass, because
it sounds &quot;impressive&quot; at first. After a while, though, you'll
get tired of being thumped on the head by your music.

Not to say that good bass and treble aren't important. But your
first realization should be that the music is all there, and
that it comes together as good music, without one particular
part trying to dominate it. Sit back and listen to it for a
bit. You should be able to pick out the individual instruments
if you want. They shouldn't force themselves on you, and you
should also be able to hear the music as a single piece, the sum
of its parts, without feeling like each of the instruments is
trying to grab your attention away from the others.

You should check how things sound with the amp turned up, and
also with it turned down to a fairly low volume level. Some
speakers which sound very nice at low levels begin to sound
confused, like they can't cope, when turned up. On the other
hand, some sound nice loud, but sound thin and bodiless when you
turn them down a bit. With the spoken word or female vocalist,
listen for &quot;sibilance&quot;, a pronounced 'hiss' at the end of 's'
and 'z' sounds. It shouldn't be there. Most planar speakers
just can't play very loud. Whatever you hear, do some
auditioning at the maximum volume you anticipate ever wanting.

It is acceptable and sometimes desirable to switch the stereo to
mono to evaluate naturalness. Mono is a good test of both the
room and the speakers. The image should be rock-solid dead
center, and not move with signal or level. If it isn't perfect
mono, it will be nearly impossible to create a good stereo.

A speaker in a large box is capable of producing low frequencies
at higher volumes with more efficiency than a small box, but
that doesn't mean that a small box can't have great bass, it
just won't be as efficient and can't play as loud.

Good speakers can &quot;recreate a natural stereo sound stage&quot;,
placing some instruments to the left of the left speaker, some
sounds in the middle, and some to the right of the right
speaker. Poorer speakers make it harder to localize voices.

12.3 Why use a subwoofer? Will it help? One or two?
One reason to get a subwoofer is to add bass to a feeble system.
A second reason is to move the lowest frequencies to a separate
driver, and thereby reduce a particular kind of distortion
caused by the nonlinear mixing of different sounds, called
&quot;intermodulation distortion&quot;. A third is to increase the power
handling ability of the system and the overall reliability. All
are valid reasons, but it isn't so simple.

To improve the sound of a good speaker system, a subwoofer must
&quot;integrate smoothly&quot; into the system, extending the bass without
causing peaks or dips. Many subwoofers have a crossover that
goes between your amp and your main speaker which sends the lows
to the subwoofer and sends the higher frequency signals to the
main speakers. This may damage the perfect sound of a good
system, it may sound similar, or it may sound better.

Most good small speaker systems have a bass peak at resonance,
which attempts to compensate for the absence of lower bass.
Like it or not, this is the only way to make a small system
sound realistic. If the small system is done well, the
improvement you will get from a subwoofer will be small, but
still real and, to many, significant.

Correctly done, a good subwoofer will enhance the sound of a
good small-box system. Done wrong or haphazardly, anything is
possible. Even a fine large speaker system might benefit from
careful addition of a subwoofer. However, the better the
original system, the more likely it will be that a modest
subwoofer will do more harm than good.

Low frequencies travel less directionally than high frequencies,
so many people say that only one subwoofer is required for good
sound. This is true to some extent, but not completely true.

There are a few reasons for getting two subwoofers. Some feel
that you need two subwoofers to accurately reproduce the stereo
image, no matter how little low-frequency stereo information
there is. Others feel that two subwoofers are much easier to
set up in a room, less likely to excite standing waves in the
room, and give smoother sound.

A third reason is that two subwoofers can produce twice the
sound of one. Finally, even though subwoofers produce very low
frequency sound and very low frequency sound is non-directional,
subwoofers also have output at 100 Hz, and sound at 100 Hz is
directional, so two subwoofers will give a slightly better
stereo image than one. Assuming, of course, that the two are
separated by at least two feet.

Finally, even though original source signals rarely contain any
music with stereo components below 50Hz, there may be some noise
component with low-frequency out-of-phase noise. This unusual
noise might add a sense of space to a recording if it is
reproduced by a system in which the woofers are very far apart.

It is still true that a single good subwoofer, correctly added
to a system will help the sound but two will probably help more.

12.4 How do you connect a subwoofer to a stereo?
Many subwoofers contain their own amplifier and crossover.
For these, take the preamp output and feed it into the subwoofer
amp input and also into the main amplifier.

For other subwoofers, just run them in parallel with your main
speakers, or combine them into your system with your own bass
amplifier and crossover.

Some A/V receivers contain a splitter specifically for use with
subwoofers. If you have one of these, you will either want a
separate amplifier for your subwoofer or an amplified subwoofer.

Consult the manual which comes with the subwoofer.

12.5 What do I need for surround sound?
&quot;Surround Sound&quot; has referred to a number of different products
over the years. Many mass-fi receivers have &quot;Surround Sound&quot;
buttons that do little more than muck up the imaging.

In recent years the term
