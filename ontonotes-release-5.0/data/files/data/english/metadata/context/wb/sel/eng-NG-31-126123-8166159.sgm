&gt;I done had enough of his silly jibber jabber.

&gt; His whole neighborhood is nothing but

&gt; I stood on top of a hill and attacked
&gt; via 82 radio controlled geetars, all fully
&gt; loaded with the latest in air to ground
&gt; firepower. I contacted the local mounties,
&gt; and they still considered him missing at this
&gt; time. But I've heard it on good authority from his
&gt; pimp, that he may well have survived this attack.
&gt; Some witnesses report seeing him nearby at a
&gt; convenience store buying some love wax and sex

&gt; I saved an audio clip of the attack which I found
&gt; on one of the local news stations when I got back
&gt; home.

&gt; One news story gave a short description of the
&gt; events..

&gt; &quot;AP. A local man is missing this morning after
&gt; being attacked by a crazed maniac from Texas.
&gt; Scott Lifshine, aka nuckler worrier, is still missing
&gt; after an apparent attack from numerous flying
&gt; guitars. A witness reported hearing a man approach
&gt; the location, and yell, Hey Nuckler Worrier! I'm
&gt; calling you out boy!
&gt; There was no response from the house the man
&gt; stood in front of, and he then left the location
&gt; and went to a local park which has a hill overlooking
&gt; the surrounding neighborhood.
&gt; A large van then arrived carrying a huge assortment
&gt; of flying radio controlled guitars. The man then proceded
&gt; to launch all of the devices, except for two which he
&gt; held in each arm. All of the radio controlled guitars
&gt; were loaded with air to ground missiles, which
&gt; were controlled by the man holding the two guitars
&gt; in each arm. A witness heard him yell, &quot;Well, take this
&gt; you silly @#$%!!! After that all hell broke loose.
&gt; Guitars were flying through the air like a swarm of
&gt; locusts, obliterating anything in their paths.
&gt; Mr. Lifshines complete neighborhood was utterly
&gt; destroyed. The witnesses tried to detain the attacker,
&gt; but were thwarted as he got back into the van and quickly
&gt; sped away. The only clue was a Texas license plate
&gt; on the van. The witnesses were not able to read the plate
&gt; though, as they were blinded for a short time by the lightning
&gt; bolts that kept emanating from the two guitars the deranged
&gt; man was holding.

Dude-that sounded nothing like the Nuclear Warrior Theme Song, and that's
where it's at these days.
