A puzzling sort of whats it- polished brass, measures 2 1/2&quot;x 1 1/2&quot;x1
3//4&quot;. A chain for carrying, a lid for closing, jump rings for
attaching something to- but why the expanding feature? One of those
things you find in the bottom of an box lot. Anyone know what it was
for? I thought some kind of evening bag but why would you need to
change the size?

"/> Hi Janice,

You are correct this item was used as a top to a bag, the reason it expands
is so you can get your hand in and all the other misc. items woman carry in
their bags. Very popular late 19thC early 20thC, very often the body of the
bag would be decorated, as you say, with needlework.

Mike

I think it is the lid for an evening bag. Fabric or beaded material would have
been attached to the rings and the expansion feature would allow one to get at
comb, lipstick and mad money. StT

beaded the bag in 1920 when she was expecting my Mother.

"/> Sorry Janice, it is at my mother's about a three days drive away from me. As I
can remember it is about 6 to 7 inches long, made of black, I would think heavy
silk, fabric, covered with black sead beads strung in loops so it kind of
shimmies when it moves. ( a lot like the flappers my grandmother said she was)
