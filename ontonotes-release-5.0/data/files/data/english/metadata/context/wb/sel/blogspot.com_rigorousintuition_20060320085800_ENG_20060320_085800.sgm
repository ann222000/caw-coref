They ask me if I feel remorse and I answer, Why of course:

There's so much more I could have done if they'd let me - Nick Cave

There's a lot I want to say about a number of things, but I can't
seem to find those words until I scream some others.

Have you read the Iraqi police report of last week's little Helter
Skelter outside Tikrit? From Knight Ridder :

At 230 of 15/3/2006, according to the telegram (report) of the Ishaqi
police directorate, American forces used helicopters to drop troops on
the house of Faiz Harat Khalaf situated in the Abu Sifa village of the
Ishaqi district. The American forces gathered the family members in one
room and executed 11 people, including 5 children, 4 women and 2 men,
then they bombed the house, burned three vehicles and killed their
animals (map coordinates 098702).

They were:

Turkiya Muhammed Ali, 75 years

Faiza Harat Khalaf, 30 years

Faiz Harat Khalaf, 28 years

Um Ahmad, 23 years

Sumaya Abdulrazak, 22 years

Aziz Khalil Jarmoot, 22 years

Hawra Harat Khalaf, 5 years

Asma Yousef Maruf, 5 years

Osama Yousef Maruf, 3 years

Aisha Harat Khalaf, 3 years

Husam Harat Khalaf, 6 months

(Signed)

Staff Colonel Fadhil Muhammed Khalaf

Assistant Chief of the Joint Coordination Center

3/16/2006

Three years into this atrocity circus, and the already pathetic
annual demonstrations against the war are shrinking and growing quieter.
Understandably so. As I've said, we're habituating to it. Meanwhile, the
vicarious revolutionaries were in the theatres getting a fix of
serotonin from V for Vendetta . "When are they going to ban the movie?"
I've actually read, as though anything that keeps our asses fixed to
upholstered seats were a threat to those who stake claim to both the
streets and our behinds. Winning the weekend box office does not a
revolution make.

Husam Harat Khalaf, 6 months . She probably had a tooth or two coming
in. She must have been wailing as the strangers shouted foreign words to
her family and pointed those shiny black things, and at the noise that
they made. Unless she was the first.

If all we can do is feel bad , and think we've accomplished something
by having been moved , then perhaps we deserve to be judged with Husam's
murderers. Because then we're scavenging the losses of others and making
them our own, garlanding ourselves in tragedy, building an anti-war
sentiment upon how upsetting it is to us. In that event, we won't be
seeking justice, we'll just be looking to feel better . And the illusion
of action will be more satisfying than its ambiguous reality.

Information warriors . Jesus Christ, how precious of us.

Empire is more than an entity, it's a meme. Thus, defeating one
empire only encourages the other wannabes. Defeat all empires, defeat
the impulse for empire, show everyone that the very IDEA of Empire is
unsustainable, reckless, wasteful, STUPID.

The Empire never ended.

However, since many many people in business suits and ties believe
very much in Empire, and indirectly control the actions of many many
people in green and blue suits with lots and lots of those noisy black
shiny things, you'll probably have a very hard time convincing them.
Because intrinistically, it's all about the movements of little pieces
of green paper, and ensuring that the majority of those notes make it
back into the same old hands.

Shoot them, and you're giving them an excuse to get worse. I say mess
up their game so they can't play the old way and win anymore: then the
guys and girls in blue and green suits get to point the noisy black
things where they should be when they screw around. I think they might
enjoy a chance to do that.

some people's part "simply" so that they will feel better. The desire to
feel better means empathy is being experienced, and we can use as much

i'm starting to get sick of that question: how do we fight them? i
mean its obvious how you do it. but then what ever that thing is, you
suddenly feel completely usesless and neutered. and we then say 'oh, not
now...just a little bit longer until the rest of the country catches
on'....

the truth is they won't all just SNAP and wake up. it has NEVER
happened that way. i bet you a solid block of 80 million people in this
country are cheering for the unjust and mindless slaughter of iran now.
many people are predicting the invasion of iran will happen in a week
and a half. and the sad thing is, i don't think they're wrong. and boy
that will entrench us now. 3 countries in 5 years.

i don't know if you know this but in 1933 hitler became dictator of
germany after the reichstag caught on fire, blamed the communists for
attempting a coup d'etat.

from Wikipedia:

'Adolf Hitler had been named chancellor of Germany and invited by
President von Hindenburg to lead a coalition government only four weeks
previously, on January 30, 1933. Hitler's government urged von
Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag and to call elections for March 5.

On the evening of February 27, 1933 -- six days before the
parliamentary election -- fire broke out in the Reichstag chambers.
While the exact circumstances of the fire remain unclear to this day,
what is clear is that Hitler and his supporters quickly capitalized on
the fire as a means by which to speed their consolidation of power.
Seizing on the burning of the Reichstag building as the opening salvo in
a communist uprising, the Nazis were able to throw millions of Germans
into a convulsion of fear at the threat of Communist terror.'

it was 12 years later that it all finally ended in 1945.

2001-2012

its now 2006, lets look 6 years into Nazi rule:

on march 15th 1939, German troops occupy the remaining part of
Bohemia and Moravia; Czechoslovakia ceases to exist; beginning
hostilities leading to WWII

"Our strategy should be not only to confront empire, but to lay siege

robbed your store/raped your sister/broke your window/killed your dad -

I picture you, Jeff, up there in Canada, mostly removed and unrelated

shame. Unless, of course, it's the human family (and not just the

The virus is fascism.

We agree.

As an American, my apology is trite. I do not know where redemption
can be found.

"If you could return to 1933 and kill Hitler," said the hypothetical
question I heard as a kid, "Would you?"

Of course.

Who shall I eliminate now?

Unlike anyone else I know, I foresee a military coup in the U.S. The
Neo-Fascists need a new boogeyman, a Hillary Clinton Presidency, so they
can regain pure victim status.

And they'll swoop in and burn the Reichstag for real, with all the
Democrats inside.

And they'll pin the blame on 2 "Al Qaeda Sympathizers" who
"infiltrated" the USAF.

And they'll say the perpetrators were "inspired" by "V Is For
Vendetta," found on their video iPod along with Kanye West.

What can I do?

Try to find others like me?

But they're only here, at this blog, and on the Net.

Do you know anyone in your personal lives who shares an anti-fascist
concern?

Who thinks about it as much as you do?

"Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

The best lack all convictions, while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity. "

Willam Butler Yeats,

"The Second Coming," 1920

Something tells me

we all underestimate

what intense lengths

the Neo-Fascists will go to.

And what they will achieve.

A Second Great Depression.

A Global War.

The Restoration of Slavery.

A World Police State Apparatus.

Bush's ridiculous-yet-telltale denial of "Human-Animal Hybrids."

Experiments that Nazis couldn't dream of.

The virus is fascism,

and nobody believes it's real.

I believe that it is impossible to discuss this issue IN DEPTH,
without examining "the unmatched power of the Israel Lobby" and its
relationship with the majority of prominent Christian evangelicals here
in the U.S.

The authors of America's "Clean Break" into this new world of
unwarranted vengeance and perpetual suffering (Richard Perle, James
Colbert, Charles Fairbanks, Jr., Douglas Feith, Robert Loewenberg, David
Wurmser, and Meyrav Wurmser) and the Christian Coalition's subservient
support are inextricably linked to this country's seemingly
inexhaustible thirst for chronic hegemony, at the expense of her own
citizens rights.

Please refer to the excellent article by John Mearsheimer and Stephen
Walt appropriately entitled "The Israel Lobby".

and i'm just a talker. of course we have examples of organizers in
Gandhi, MLK, Jefferson & Jackson, etc., as well as those who meet up to
go to Seattle, Porto Allegre, Naderites, the Punjab Tenants
Association... All accross the spectrum there are progressive elements
with a ghostly presence in our shared institutions. Now more than ever
they are waiting for your help to make strong alliances that will
integrate the vast majority of people in the "center" who know
something's wrong and desperately need leadership. most shockingly of
all, libertarians and traditional conservatives are ripe to join this
coalition, a historical opportunity that must be taken and directed
toward the ecological question. don't wait for people to already agree
with you, just remember the most important point: now most people know
that what TV says we think isn't really what we think. the future is an
open question that can only be answered with praxis. Don't get

Anonymous 3:21,

I find it kind of funny that you would respond to my question on how
to fight the Empire with references to a blog run by a blogmaster who
wants to lay waste to everyone who disagrees with him. I've read that
PopOcculture space before and was totally turned off by the demeanor of
the kid who runs it. I picture him being a high school nerd who gets
beat up by jocks on a daily basis and has created his own "Empire" where
he can be all powerful. That's why I hang out here instead of there.
Rigorous Intuition it ain't.

I understand what we can do in our own small ways, but the Empire
seems to have a life of its own. I think I remember from Roman history
something about the sheer enormity of the bureaucracy that kept the
Empire clunking along. Perhaps we have this here, too.

But, as a student of history it seems like life in the US appears
more like Egypt's Old Kingdom than Rome...

A war with Iran can't happen, m'ijos. We've gotta get off our asses
for that one.

Saludos, Hildita

We hear your frustration, JW. But don't blame the film for the U.S.
policy. Please don't blame a film which shows the media in their true
light (as a propaganda arm of the state)for the omissions in reporting
of the real-world news media.

You could have attacked 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' on similar grounds. Mass
movements don't begin overnight. Look at the curve on Bush's popularity:
it's taken a long time to bring it down to 33% (a number certainly
imbued with semiotic significance, right?--sorry, an aside): if the film
helps to serve up an anti-state, pro-individualist message, then why
attack it? What would peace marches accomplish today that massive
world-wide marches didn't accomplish just before the war began?

Perhaps what is needed, ultimately, is a Gramscian march through the
ranks, where decent people infiltrate elite institutions and begin the
slow process of reversing decades of incursions on civil liberties. Of
course, it'll never happen: elite institutions are very effective at
weeding out the decent.

And to JudasDisney. Nice name. We like Yeats, too, but actually, a
lot of people I know are talking about the Bill of Rights, impeachment,
and the trajectory of American democracy.

What is the opposite of "Empire"?

About James Blunt (his name is unforgettable, is it not?)

His hit song, "Your Beautiful" is cheesy and way too earnest, but the
video is hypnotic. He sings while looking like Tom Cruise, emptying his
pockets, then disrobes, turns and jumps, lemming-like, over a snowy
cliff into a British ocean (he can do his own stunts cause he's an elite
royal soilder, like Prince Harry)

He was on Oprah, making all the ladies misty, last week.

Ya, blue-blooded Royal Mounted elite warriors are cool too.

He stayed while recording his album and being schooled in sensative
rock dude manners

at Carrie Fisher mans in LA.

"The virus is fascism,

and nobody believes it's real."

Good post but I would argue that fascism and crypto fascism really
are distinct (the latter having IMHO, only existed in a significant
sense for 200 years tops). After a blunt attempt by the big news outlets
to sully the notion of democracy and actively promote American fascism
(~1920-1940), they found it wasn't really that easy to sell servitude
over perceived self-determination. The difference, and this is the point
I wanted to make, is in to which groups they appeal. The fascist
putzches (sp?) of the 20s-30s appealed to a fairly broad swath of its
elite, openly saying, "this democracy thing is messy and innefficient,
those huddled masses never use it anyway, and when they DO, boy do they
make a mess of things". Crypto fascists on the other hand must and do
take on the trappings of "the common man", while personally actually
accomplishing nothing but parasitism. Bush, in other words is the
archetypal crypto-fascist.

By way of answering the question posed, I would say we should look
(yes this is going to be gradual)

at the Dubai deal failure and the failure of the loosening of FCC
restriction. We should look at the Dubai deal, avoid anyone invlolved in
both sides of the whole deal and avoid them and all of their advice.
Then we should remember the FCC deal and try to create similar successes
while always being vigilant against infliltration by Ramsey Clark or any
other those people who were on the "right side" of the Dubai issue.

I also think that better understanding the intellectual origins of
fascism and crypto fascism, not all of which is malevolent. Indeed I
would rather live under an enlightened, benevolent fascist regime than
under a real democracy. Problem is benevolent fascist regimes dont come
around much and they never stay benevolent. I am a big fan of
Nietzsche's criticisms of democracy... his solutions? Not so much. I
will soon undertake to read a goodly portion of Hegel's important works
as he is the fascist most studied and lauded by heavily educated people.
The one most closely tied to the Bushies and intentional obfuscation
fascism for the "good" of everyone, is Strauss, who Ive actually only
read excerpted bits of, but who sounds much less compassionate or
enlightened than Nietzsche who thought non-violence and democracy were
evil crutches that undermined our developement as a species. When you
look at Americans who don't visit this or any political blogs and yet
think they are well educated members of a well educated, unimpeachibly
moral society, well maybe democracy has had some downsides, insofar as
it ever existed.

Its also interesting/important to view the ideological continuity
from Nietzsche to Freud to hitler, each becoming less insightful, more
manipulative and more disdainful of humanity on the whole.
Interestingly, probably the most prominent big fan of Nietzsche is Kurt
Vonnegut. Harrison Bergeron, the short story is a good succinct
summation of the dangers of democracy. Frighteningly, by the time
Showtime brought it to the screen, it was expanded from 2-3 pages to a
full script and had added explicitely crypto-fascist elements. I think
that the relationship between short story and script are brilliant
metaphors for the differences between basic and crypto fascism. Here's
very breif summation of short story and movie plot.

Short story: in the future, no one can be smart or good at anything
because its antidemocratic and are punished/handicapped for acheiving in
any area.

Movie: In the future there will be a mass unemployment which will
cause massive rioting proving the failure of democracy. This will lead
to the aforementioned handicapping, but in Showtimes version they
explicitly portray a "show" government of handicapped everymen while the
country is really run by a hugely talented and morally pretty strong
group of politico-scientists in some Utopian retreat. Similar to V, its
significance can be read in 2 ways: It ends on a bittersweet highnote of
children actually resisting the handicaps, so it could be said to be an
indictment of hidden powers. On the other hand it normalizes the notion,
creates what really is a pretty nice nation to live under them in, and
in the end all that these kids are really aspiring to is to join the
politico-scientists, hardly as reassuring an interpretation. In any case
the nature of the changes is, probably a lower class lower profile of
Huxley or Orwell.

Well, if you read this far, thanks. I also liked the idea of a
company owned by a significant portion of Americans not acting
vicariously through the govt. A couple provisions in its charter could
and should set limits on how few people own what amount of it and that
they be at least modestly geographically dispersed. But if anyone were
to setup such a system, I'd gladly buy in.

Cheers,

Daniel

Expect nothing to happen because of the peace movement, or the left,

I came across a few comments today. Before posting them let me
suggest to you that you cannot possibly underestimate how sodden the
American Dream is and with that how utterly contrived is the American
Way of Life. Now what that has produced is artifact people who are
thoroughly dispirited, atomized and all in all ineffectual. Caricature
nation. These Peace Marches do at times seem to have a festival like
atmosphere about them. We are permanently mediated so feel little for
our own circumstances let alone empathetic for our brothers and sisters
in Mesopotamia.

Where is the fire and soul in the Anti-War movement? Perhaps its been
doused by ipods, cellphones and assassinations.

Now three quotes from people I don't know:

"As a US AID Refugee Advisor in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, I saw these
atrocities on a regular bases. GI's carried photos about in plastic
pouches of atrocities they'd committed and posed for. One of the most
popular was a GI holding a servered head by the hair in either hand with
a lit cigarette in either hand. It was the smug smile on the GI's face
that was most disconcerting.

Then there were the barbacue runs. Napalm drops on defenseless
villages. Burning everyone alive. Oh, we Americans are a nice people.
Giving candy to children and then shooting them."

And This:

"I am absolutely outraged at the killing of these children. In
England, for such a crime by a civilian, natural life sentence would be
mandatory. If you are a member of the armed services, you can do what
you like, I have heard testimony from a former national services member
that shootings of civilian household members in Northern Ireland,
including children, went unreported and unpunished, these incidents
never having come under any form of proper legal scrutiny due to 'd'
notice enforcement (complete ban on publication). In regard to this,
please refer to the draconian nature of the English influence over
Northern Ireland as elucidated in a book called 'A Fatal Shore'. What
sickens me most is the utter cowardice of the British and American
people to physically march on their respective houses of representatives
and take these criminals and insist on genuine court proceedings to
imprison them (at the very least, but execution is too soft an option
for these evil souls). Churchill had the tanks on the streets in London
many years ago against a popular uprising. A human wave approach on the
houses of representatives, without armaments, nonviolent, to physically
oust these so called representatives, and the subsequent and inevitable
totalitarian military response would easily demonstrate that these
'leaders' are prepared to kill majority representatives of their own
electorate in order to maintain 'government for the benefit of the
government and not for the people'. Surely some troops and police could
be appealed to, and turn against their masters.

'Demonstrations', 'petitions', and the like are impotent and futile
orchestrations often designed by agents provocateurs (I have had this
confirmed by a senior official in the British establishment) for the
dual purposes only of satisfying a vague public concern that 'someone'
is doing something', and that such efforts are entirely ineffectual.
Such a small sacrifice resulting from more sincere approaches would
surely then serve to wake up the people that we are now in the grip of a
primarily parasitic influence. The members of government involved are
not truly bothered about the 'horrific' losses of life they daily
publish in their newspapers to create a screen of ink to whip up
hysteria over extremely localised, daily killings in domestic incidents,
killings by released mental patients etc., they only desire to bombard
the mental faculties of the electorate with information which is
entirely irrelevant to them, till their attention span and critical
faculties are uselessly expended and entirely exhausted, so that no one
even dreams of searching out sites on the internet concerning birth
defects in children resulting from depleted uranium. Just imagine some
politician scattering depleted uranium in America or England near
children and those who are about to procreate, and, witnessing the
horrendous birth defects and fatal cancers produced by their actions,
with repeat effects anticipated for another 4.6 billion years. Then,
say, we are bringing freedom and democracy. Of course, if you are the
government, it is ok, and we are physically scared to do anything, (been
beaten up by the police recently?) but if it were to be an individual
perpetrating these inconceivably sadistic, extremely distressing and
horrific acts whilst not being 'authorised' as a government employee, he
would of course be sentenced to natural (whole) life sentence in a top
security mental hospital like Broadmoor, or Rampton, and be utterly torn
to pieces for decades in the national media. Just what is the fear we
feel that disables us from coordinating together to remove these
criminally insane psychopaths from power? Let us look deep inside
ourselves. Perhaps it was the damage from thiomersal in our
vaccinations, the fluoride in our water and toothpaste, or maybe the
aspartame in our cola, or the TV and media propaganda hypnosis? Why are
we all dying spiritually?. Is is time for a little more than just
chanting and walking on demos? Think about it please."

And this:

" To the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Africa, South America and many more, whose peoples endured sufferring
from exploitations of coveted resources, and tests of weapons/tactics of
mass destruction, I, as an American, do deeply and sincerely apologize
for what has been done. I promise that I shall do all in my power to end
these atrocities, bring the criminals and liars to justice, and to see
that reparations are made.

In 1968, as my brother and I were enlisting in the Marines, my father
told us of an old warriors saying...

"Shed no tears for the fallen soldier, for if you come to kill, you
must be ready and willing to die should that be your fate." He then
brought out that old flag that draped the coffin of his brother, a
Marine, killed in WWII in the Pacific. He told us that we represent the
people of America and to carry ourselves in a manner of respect so that
the sacrifice of his brother and so many more like him would not be
dishonored.

The "great statesman" Henry Kissinger revealed a most sinister aspect
of American foreign policy when he said...

"Depopulation of third world countries should be a highest priority,
as the US economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals,
especially from undeveloped countries.

Kissinger also said, in the presence of General Alexander Haig, that
"Military men are DUMB, STUPID ANIMALS, to be used as pawns for US
foreign policy."

The oil consumption of the US military is as much as the entire
country of Greece. When the oil stops, so does the military. The
military Industrial Complex knows this and is trying to secure the
worlds oil supply as it is essential to their goal of FULL SPECTRUM
DOMINANCE.

If those who profit from war and the misery of others spent their
money for peace this could be a better world for all people.

Thank you."

I see several things that need to be done -- always assuming
favorable conditions, of course:

1) We need to stop thinking of ourselves as outsiders. Protest
marches don't cut it. They both put you at the mercy of the media and
solidify your outsider status. We need to get rid of 60's-style thinking
and remind ourselves that we are not in any sense unAmerican. We are the
real Americans -- the defenders of democracy and constitutional rights.

2) Assuming the Bush administration implodes Nixon-style, the right
is going to be most dangerous in the years immediately following. The
period from 1976 to 1979 is when the right got its act back together
after Watergate -- and in far more dangerous form than before. That's
when the wingnuts, the conscienceless Young Republicans, and the Dr.
Strangelove types took over the Republican Party. Almost every problem
we have today is rooted in the events and coalitions of those years.

3) But in the long run, what we need more than anything is for money
to be invested in the future of a democratic alternative. Ever since the
early 70's, the right has been pouring money into their think-tanks and
other institutions.

Not only that -- they've regularly sought out promising youngsters
and brought them aboard. Jack Abramoff and pals were taken into the
Council on National Policy through its youth movement when they were
just out of college, and were given well-funded organizations to run.
Groups like the Intercollegiate Studies Institute and Morton Blackwell's
Leadership Institute are still at it today.

The left has never done that. Young lefties either starve or sell
out. They have no other options.

(Forgive me, by the way, for using the terms "right" and "left." They
may be apt for the 1970-2000 period, but I understand they're quickly
becoming obsolete. Accept them as stand-ins for whatever new division is
in the process of emerging.)

The question of money is not an easy one to answer, because the
neo-left can clearly not afford to be indebted to the Soros's of this
world the way the late 20th century right was to Joseph Coors, Richard
Mellon Scaife, or Reverend Moon. The money might be obtainable in a
grassroots sort of way -- but then who would be trusted with investing
it, especially in individuals and institutions which might not pay off
for many years?

The problem should be solvable -- it is, after all, a subset of the
same problem our society faces as a whole: How do we ensure that both
government and private funds will be invested wisely, and with an eye to
long-term benefit rather than short-term profits? But the answer won't
necessarily be either simple or obvious.

So fight the bastards all you like. At this point we have no
alternatives. But keep in mind that the real problem facing us is: What
do we do after we win?

In the book of life, committing atrocities on civilian men, women and
children makes you a Fourth Reich Nazi and sanctioned serial killer.
Torturing people and killing children makes you a 2-legged piece-of-shit
in my book, who deserves the full, unfettered wrath of God and the
masses upon him. There's no nobility in sadism and sickness, there's
also no support nor excuse for demons who prey on the helpless.

Just remember one thing that the blood-lusting, unrepentant
psychopaths who are plying their trade in terror-democracy abroad will
be coming back here to our quiet little communities. Bringing their
practised brands of savagery and sado-murder with them, they've made

"Anonymous said..."

I'm about to agree wildly with "anonymous"'s post. But please, pick
any name just for reference. So I can refer to which "anonymous" I'm
referring to.

Henceforth, "anonymous," I'll dub thee "MintyFresh."

"Anonymous" MintyFresh writes astutely:

"I see several things that need to be done -- always assuming
favorable conditions, of course:

1) We need to stop thinking of ourselves as outsiders. Protest
marches don't cut it. They both put you at the mercy of the media and
solidify your outsider status. We need to get rid of 60's-style thinking
and remind ourselves that we are not in any sense unAmerican. We are the
real Americans -- the defenders of democracy and constitutional rights."

Bravo.

"2) Assuming the Bush administration implodes Nixon-style, the right
is going to be most dangerous in the years immediately following. The
period from 1976 to 1979 is when the right got its act back together
after Watergate -- and in far more dangerous form than before. That's
when the wingnuts, the conscienceless Young Republicans, and the Dr.
Strangelove types took over the Republican Party. Almost every problem
we have today is rooted in the events and coalitions of those years."

Goddamn double-bravo. U.S. Democrats seemed to believe "the KKK was
done" after the 60s, "COINTELPRO was done" after the Church Committee,
"Watergate was done" after Nixon resigned, and "Reaganism was done"
after Clinton was elected.

The fault lies with the "irrational exuberance" Democrats, or
perhaps, the Vichy Democrats -- because perhaps the Democrats are
infiltrated.

The "No Conspiracies" crowd can't all be sincere, in the face of
Enron, Worldcom, Adelphia, Tyco, and the biggest "conspiracy theory" of
all, that "Al Qaeda" was responsible for 9/11.

Yes, the Right is going to be exceedingly dangerous after they're
impeached or imploded.

Think Tom DeLay's going to fade quietly?

Think Karl Rove's finished if he's imprisoned?

Think the salivating Christianist Right (they're not Christians,
they're Christian-ists who follow an identity-based ideology that's
divorced from What Jesus Would Do) are ever going to be satiated? Ever?

Think there won't be another 9/11?

We won't get another 9/11 with a Republican in office . Because this
would taint their "We Keep You Safe" Brownshirt Track Record.

When a non-Republican holds office, preferably a cartoon Democrat
like Hillary who can be easily intimidated & serve as a Boogeyman,
that's when the next 9/11 will be served-up.

Probably with a "Gloria Arroyo Moment" thrown into the mix, to make
Hillary look like an "authoritarian" crying wolf about shadowy coup
phantom menaces.

"...the right is going to be most dangerous in the years immediately
following..."

Bravo.

"3) But in the long run, what we need more than anything is for money
to be invested in the future of a democratic alternative..."

Here's where I disagree. Yes, think tanks are needed. Before that,
however, we've got bigger imminent problems:

"Young lefties either starve or sell out. They have no other
options."

Not completely true: we were offered Howard Dean. Among others. And
his movement was an insurgency that was mysteriously assassinated,
without obvious fingerprints.

I watched it unfold, recognized what was happening, and not even Dean
supporters would admit the obvious: he was taken down in a very
co-ordinated effort (that I don't have time or space to get into here).

Likewise, the recent "assassination" of Paul Hackett in Ohio. Even
Paul Hackett says he was betrayed by the DLC Leadership that told him to
back-off.

The Democratic Party is infiltrated or at least has a Vichy wing
which wants very much to cooperate with Neocon Fascism as a Kabuki
Opposition Party.

Look at Argentina 1976 for what's going to happen in the U.S.

"So fight the bastards all you like. At this point we have no
alternatives. But keep in mind that the real problem facing us is: What
do we do after we win?"

No, we do have alternatives. "What do we do after we win" is the
least of our problems: We have plenty of vision, including the visionary
neglected/murdered past, including the brilliance of Social Security,
which lasted 70 years without a hitch. FDR's Economic Bill of Rights is
a starter point for "vision."

"What do we do after we win" is not a question that Bolivians are
asking of themselves, for example.

"What do we do after we win" is not a question that Venezuelans are
asking of themselves. Nor campesinos.

No, the problem is this:

Among us are wolves in sheep's clothing who want to dismantle the New
Deal, the social safety net, any social contract between individuals,
and restore a slave labor underclass.

Among us are those who wish to "Starve The Beast" until there can be
no such thing as "Government."

Among us are True Anarchists, not of the Utopian Left but of the
Dystopian Plutocratic Theocratic Right.

If you don't believe in government, then you cannot govern. You do
not govern.

That is what we have. That is what Democrats, and even much of the
Left, refuse to acknowledge.

World War 2 never ended. "What we do after we win" is bear witness to
the Fascist Impulse in humanity, and sacrifice everything to restore and
enshrine Checks & Balances.

This is what the Bolivians & Venezuelans are doing. Without needing
to ask themselves about it.

"What can we do to fight the Empire?" Checks & Balances. Across the
board. No exceptions, no excuses. And the biggest Check & Balance is
just what we're all doing here: Bearing Witness.

But even here: guard against the COINTELPRO/Mockingbird track record.
Because the False Witness worms are eternally busy.

"In that event, we won't be seeking justice, we'll just be looking to
feel better. And the illusion of action will be more satisfying than its
ambiguous reality."

That's why them Yankee boys don't have a draft.

Anyone appealing to the concept of American democracy is just dumb.
America was designed to be considerably less democratic than the British
system and it still is despite determined efforts by Thatcher and Blair.

All you have to do is select both presidential candidates and in the
USA that is spectacularly easy in a money driven electoral system, same
with the actual election and that's forgetting Diebold.

In addition , Americans are very poorly educated compared with more
advanced societies.

The criminal justice system is satanic, if they'll accept that,
they'll sanction any form of atrocity against foreigners.

smoke is coming from your nostrils and flames are appearing around the
edges of your eyes.

"Making the world a better place" -McDonalds ad.

The democrats eventually cave because we all create empire when we
fill up our tank, buy a computer, and sadly enough, get some bananas
down at the A & P.

Most of us lefties harbor artistic aspirations, so after paying the
rent and doing the dishes we are not organizing change or resistance
anymore, we are making Art. Not so the mind-meld righties. Breakfast
strategy sessions start the day.

How to change this place. Change how you spend money. Stop making Art
and organize.

I feel powerless in terms of facing the murderous conquistador
culture of ours. My family wants "nice" things. I'm tired at the end of

too.

Information is a necessary but not sufficient element to create a
proper analysis of our situation. Facts are context dependent, therefore
only a new context or framework for understanding will change the
relative values of various facts. Our current context has shaped the
general psyche to defer to authority for many centuries now. We are
cultural adolescents, frozen by the threats of rapacious paternal
figures.

Realize, we only grow up when we go beyond rote and reactive
responses towards integrating new elements into our psyche. Thus the
only 'doing' going on, is effort designed to help transition society
from adolescence to young adulthood. We gots to move out of the house
and learn to pay our own bills.

Also,hope and despair are melodramatically paralyzing responses that
tend to defer responsibility from oneself. Cheerio.

The old saying goes: if a tree falls in the woods and nothing is
there to perceive it, then the tree did not fall. Well then, as
information warriors we are witnessing a massive clear-cutting. This
puts an ax in our hands too - we instantly assume co-responsibility for
this reality. Not implication, but responsibility. We are implicated if
we bury the hatchet, wield it irresponsibly, or forget what we have
witnessed. We fall as the trees.

The protagonist of Albert Camus' "The Fall" is walking alone one
foggy night along a bridge over the river Seine. He passes a distraught
woman gazing out over the river. A few moments later, he hears her
scream and the splash. The woman has jumped. He is witness. What on
Earth should he do? Risk his own life to save her, or keep on walking,
hoping that no one has seen his evasion. The man, a respected judge,
walks on and tries to forget. But it does not forget him.

Anonymous 6:29... rather than "Beautiful", take a look at the clip
for "Goodbye my Lover". Have a look at the lyrics: basically a sick
obsessive.

In that light, the lyrics for "Beautiful" can then be seen as the
underlying vapid, callow idealistic view of 'love' that drives the
obsessive.

You can see the same development in Lennon's writing - from "If I
catch you talking to that boy again" in "You can't do that" to "I would
rather see you dead little girl, than to be with another man" in "Run
for your life".

Eventually, the idealism gets slapped down, and this leads to a
psychotic over-reaction.

YoungFox - a good take on how the mainstream is used to drown
dissent... although you have to admit that most of the useless eaters
are a priori capable of dissent anyhow.

Here in France we have had bourgeois students (middle class uni
students) rioting as a result of a change to employment law that is of
little consequence - these same kiddies had better things to do when the
rape of Iraq was being contemplated, and now that Iran is in the
crosshairs they would rather bleat about something that only affects
them (the change to the law makes it easier to fire layabouts)

Just goes to show - folks will only 'arc up' against something when
it is in their interests to do so. And as Jeff said, it is deplorable
when people are demanding change simply in order to 'feel better' -
rather than because of the belief that the policy is morally wrong to
begin with. "Make my pain go away" rather than "Don't do that to those
poor Iraqis".

Cheerio for now,

First off... Thank you, Jeff, for doing what you're doing. It's rare
to find someone writing on the fringe, or rather, as you put it, in the
depths, that doesn't devolve into hysterical ranting. Keeping a cool
head (or a cool hand at the keyboard at any rate) is difficult when
dealing with the issues you tackle.

As to what we can do... We need to wake up. Turn off your TV
immediately, and never turn it on again. Stop buying things that you
don't TRULY need. Put the culture on the ground and back away slowly.

What has us all paralized, unable to take action against the Empire,
is that we're all complicit. We watch as the atrocities pile up and do
nothing, because we know that to reject them is to reject what it takes
to maintain our lifestyle. It is a FACT that pursuing the 'American
Dream' REQUIRES someone to suffer the 'American Nightmare'. We all need
to WAKE UP!

Sorry for the double-up on the previous comment - I got a Blogger
error and resubmitted the comment.

Angry Anonymous: the problem with getting angry is that it can make
you look like a looney.

The public has been habituated to the idea that anyone who shows
obvious passion is slightly unhinged.

Think of the difference between Howard Dean's "Woo Hoo", and the smug
certainty of the fixed psychotic glazed expressions of Bill Kristol or
Richard Perle.

I know which one to be scared of - and it's not the guy doin' the
hollerin'.

But The Masses are not capable of that level of discernment - if
someone talks to them like they are 4 years old, their primitive 'seek
nurture' drives kick in and they follow (particularly once they have
been given something to be scared of).

Mine is an unpopular view, but I think we can learn a lot from the
Nazis. After all, Hitler actually wrote in Mein Kampf that it was his
INTENTION to suborn democracy. To use the machinery of democracy to gain
power, and then effectively to abandon the democratic principles once
power had been attained. It was all laid out in black and white
(Goebells write something similar in "Angriff"). From there, they did
exactly what they said they would do.

And so it ought to be with 'us' (the Remnant, for want of a better
term). We ought to use the machinery of 'democracy' against itself
(democracy is a false dawn in any case - only RANDOMOCRACY has any hope
of generating a non-warlike nation-state).

Problem is, the current farce that paints itself as democracy is
effectively two branches of one Party, who exchange control roughly once
every decade - with the tacit agreement that both parties will unite
whenever necessary to prevent the rise of any third party.

But one day, we will recognise that the only stable non-tyrannical
political structure is where political officeholders are selected at
random from among the population.

At bottom though, the initial point is that getting mad doesn't help.

It leads one to make bad tactical decisions (a good boxer - in fact
ANY good fighter - never gets mad).

I am in an internet cafe in Rue Soufflot in Paris - a hundred yards
from the Sorbonne. Outside there are riot police, and a horde of young
ANGRY students. What do you think those kiddies will achieve?

In another two days the government will have enough evidence to start
to make the public-relations counterstrike against them... "look at
these thankless hooligans, burning cars and so on. These people are not
interested in negotiation" they will say... and the Herd will believe
the government, and the initiative will be lost.

Cheerio,

Test results are in; the cancer is malignant. Now a Decision must be
made.

There are two paths which can lead to the restoration of health.
There is the bloody path wherein the patient goes under the knife to
exorcize the tumor(s) and then there is the non-invasive path wherein
the size of the tumor is slowly reduced via targeted procedures.

So the body (politic) must decide what course of treatment to pursue
because to continute to do nothing virtually guarantees the patient (and
those near him) will die and agonizing death.

Invasive procedure...

We know where the malignant cells are located... They are in the
halls of the Necon New World Order Collectivist Council on Foriegn
Relations. There are roughly 1000 of them to our billions. For the body
to live, they must go.

The Non-invasive procedure...

For this to work the people must first restore the integrity of the
vote. As long as election results can be rigged, they will be and thethe
non invasive technique cannot work. (at least) The last two elections
were stolen via massive voter fraud occuring mostly that the CFR
controlled diebold (diablo devil) central tabulators. We the people must
demand that fair and accurate accounting of the vote happens everwhere
everytime. Only then can we deal with the roughly 80 billion braindead
sychophantic supporters of the New World Necon Fascist order plans for
global domination.

The doc says its decision time people. Do we live or do we die?
What's the patient' treatment plan to be?

Just the energy put into these posts is encouraging.

No, we don't need uniformity in response to this, but unity will
help.

The problem is that THEY control the executive, the legislature and
soon they will completely control the courts. THEY control the military
and the resources of the large corporations and educational
institutions.

What do we have? Our minds. Our hope.

I wish all prgressives of all ages would get themselves into law
programs, business schools and economics programs and learn how the
society operates from the inside out and redirect resources towards the
ends that are enriching to the nation. The whole system needs to be
turned upside down and inside out.

Everyone has something they can do - learn to farm, quit your
corporate job, boycott certain products. Kill your TV!!

For me I have to quit my corporate job, but I have to be smart about
it. I need to arrange health insurance and figure out how to pay my
rent. It can be done.

There is a *next step* each individual needs to take - everyone needs
to figure out what that is and do it.

Just a quick note:

Konrad Heiden, Hitler's antiNazi biogrpaher, documented the plan for
a 2000 year Anglo-American-Nordic Reich uniting, as was Hitler's plan,
wall street, corporate fascism and fascist idealogy.

This was documented in 1935 in the book "A History of National
Socialism"

He also documents further what we are up against now in the 1945 "Der
Fuehrer"

Both are essential to understand what is happening now and since the
Bushes were backing Hitler in 1935 we all know what this means with
respect to what is in store for us.

This is a truly frightening article Jeff.

I propse we spread it around the net with its source and hopefully it
will be like My Lai in terms off how it affects the US consciousness.

Simply awful.

We have to educate ourselves

GT,

The stupid kids are biting the hand that may potentially feed them. I
understand the change in policy is in supposed to foster employability
(is that a word...?) among those rioting. And yes they could be using
that angst to foster a more useful end in other places. But oh well so
it goes.

BTW the Empire will crumble, just give it a little bit more time.

You're not going to like this, but it must be said: Americans are
not, nor have they ever been,intellectuals. Yes, they are full of common
sense and are clever but, historically, have always been suspicious of
and perjorative towards the well educated. That being said, can one
wonder how it came to pass that we lost our republic and disintigrated
into a democracy?

And, yet, you ask (and what's more, expect an answer to) what "we're
going to do?" First, stop believing all the propaganda Hollywood has
been spoon feeding you all of your lives that your are great and then
take a real, slow look around at your fellow citizens. Most folks would
really prefer that someone else would continue doing their thinking for
them and let them sink back down into their lazyboys (apt name) and
swill their beer and smoke their American dreams of endless sports days
on cable TV.

We are exactly where we deserve to be - this nation is too immature,
arrogant, and intellectual undeveloped to be anywhere else. Only this
time, there is no new frontier to escape into wherein to hone those fine
cowboy/farmer skills. Yes, we are now a two-class system: the smart and
the stupid - and smart always trumps stupid every time.

Still need more proof?

15 Iraqi civilians murdered in cold blood by U.S. Marines, 3 of them
terrified children. Check out the story and ABC News video here:

http://www.abcnews.go.com/WNT/IraqCoverage/story?id=1743981&amp;page=1

Serial killers in uniform and coldly planned and executed genocide by
any other name. Assholes like this will be coming back as Blackwater
rent-a-thugs, cops, mercenaries, black-Ops stooges, prison guards,
detention camp guards, that crazy neighbor down the street, freelance
hit-men and Captain Snap who follows his programming to go on a
synthetic terror shooting spree.

I've a feeling that this is the rule and far from the exception.
There's a special place in Hell for scum like these, and there's no
place among civilized people for serial predators. I feel sick to my
stomach that these Reichsland stormtroopers dare to define themselves as
Americans, much less human beings.

The contempt you put into your last line about "information warriors"
is telling. Next time go to a protest march like I did in San Francisco.
The physical exercise is good for you and it's healing to be in a group
of like-minded people who don't need to be convinced about the horror
that is currently taking place thanks to our demented leadership.

Anyway, you're doing awesome work as an "information warrior" so
don't put yourself down for one second, dude.

*WARNING*

Here is a link to graphic images of the children who were murdered by
stormtroopers with the "Coalition of the Killing".

http://www.chris-floyd.com/march/

Please be advised that these images are intensely heartbreaking,
sickening and infuriating. This is the handiwork of sadistic, monsters
who have all paid their fares to go straight to Hell. Those responsible
should have their pictures circulated worldwide, and if their fecal
forms should ever float back to our shores, they should be forced to
register and have their communities alerted to their presence.

Their heroes welcome should be a jail cell, and their medals should
be copper-jacketed. I am so sick of the blood-soaked America credit card
being trotted around the world ringing up genocide and horror in the
American people's name.

Jeff wailed: "Information warriors. Jesus Christ, how precious of
us."

Did ya ever think that the myth of democracy, the myth that all we
need to do is get together, is yet another great lie? Let's get real -
the empire has always existed, it existed during the 60's, during the
30's, a thousand years ago, as long as human history goes (because
empire INVENTED history) It is a story that the story tellers tell, and
we, the powerless, we basically watch the narrative. Even the apparent
victories of the "people" (American revolution, etc.) appear to have
been planned long ago by the story tellers. So can we stop flagellating
ourselves because we aren't living the story of our choosing? Do you
suppose that Romans felt guilty because their Emperer/God just invaded
yet another country?

Not that there aren't times when we ARE actually given a small part
to play, and then, well, we occasionally rise to the role, but come on,
people act like this world is all of our making, right now. Well, it
isn't. It's been a long time coming, and we have our bit parts, but it's
going to play out, with or without our blessing.

Americans spend a considerable amount hunting down information on the
military's involvement in Iraqi cities, eventually becoming more
informed than the government itself on the day to day events in the
country.

Nigil 'Incubator' Jones -

You're exactly right - on all points.

The bourgeois kiddies are arguing their own interests - those in
charge of the protests are wannabe-union-leaders and future politicians
(remember that Phoney B-Liar was also a student politician).

Furthermore, the CPE ("Contrat Premiere Embauche") is likely to
INcrease the employment of 'banlieue' (outer suburban, poor, coloured)
kids, and INcrease the rate at which University graduates get laid off.

At present, in France the employment path goes something like this:

You are initially hired on a 'CDD' ( contrat de duration determiné -
fixed-term contract) for six months.

At the end of six months, the employer can sack you or make you
permanent (put you on a 'CDI' a contrat de duration indeterminé -
long-term contract).

Once you are 'CDI', you are almost impossible to get rid of.

If the employer sacks you at the end of the CDD, he cannot employ
another person in the same role unless that person is a CDI.

Anyhow... that's the bare bones, and this is not the forum for
discussion of French labour law. But frankly the Uni kiddies are up in
arms because THEY are the kids that the current system favours, an they
stand to face a longer,. sterner test once they finish university.

Of course their leaders are interested only in the 'spectacle' -
doing things that show their political masters that they will one day be
fit to run for political office (it's the same with student politicians
the world over).

more interesingly, your view on the death of the Evil Empire (make no
mitake - the US in now the Evil Empire.... it imprisons its own at rates
far in excess of the Soviet Union during the Gulag... it stifles
dissent... its political system is rotten and corrup... and it commits
war crimes daily.)

I actually forecast (in late 2000 or early 2001) that the US would be
three (or four) separate countries before the middle of this century.
One big attack would do it (I was thinking a nuke probably planted by
the 'Mooj'), because the resultant militarist flailing would drive an
already-credit-driven economy over the edge of the abyss.

I can't say it has been FUN watching it happen in real time, but it
has certainly been interesting.

Cheerio,

GT

create the perfect article to shock the system so hard people begin to
move to fight.

information warriors...not a war with bullets but with information to

If it will a 'provocation' to 'justify' the next invasion of a Middle
Eastern nation, what form will that 'provocation' take?

And if the US invades Iran/Syria/Jordan/Lebanon/wherever, how will
that be possible without new troops, perhaps 250,000 or more?

Things may get interesting for the young. Watch out for the
reactivation of your local Selective Service board.
