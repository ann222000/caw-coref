National 50.5             Labour 31.

But still politicians like Cullen fail to recognize the mood of the
public, he claims the results would have been different were they not
taken prior to Labours orchestrated personal attack on Key and his
family.

Those attacks sickened everyone I know, especially now that this
hypocritical debacle with the Government owned Air New Zealand has
surfaced over it transporting Australian troops to the Iraqi war zone,
no matter how much Labour pretends its innocence.

It is far more likely that had the public been privy to the facts
prior to the poll, and the public been privy to the hate and hysteria
exercised by Labours Ministers in their gang attack on the Keys, that
Labour would have slumped much further .

Labour seems to see this mob type mugging it indulged in, as something
clever and commendable.

Well in a school yard for wayward children, perhaps, but for
supposedly mature responsible adults, well thanks for letting us all
see the true face of todays Labour.

Agreed Harvey,however,I think National will win by default only because
people clearly going by the polls want change due to Clark and Labour`s
gaffes,that's the upside and we are going to get a change,the downside is
that National will give us the same old same old,.nothing much will
change.While we have this ridiculous situation when minor parties have the
sway due to elections being so close, Winston Peters with his NZ First,the
Maori,the awful Greens etc.can often decide who is running the country and
can have their little agendas and  introduce policies like anti smacking
bills etc.the polls will change somewhat by election day,polls always
do,remember what happened to Bolger a few years back,he called an election
on the strength when the polls
was in his favour by 12 points, he was defeated. hence Bolger's famous
statement,&quot;bugger the polls&quot;Cullen have already hinted at tax cuts next year
and you know how fickle the public are when bribed,the polls therefore is
going to be a lot closer than now. and that means the minor parties will
become king makers again.

Bit of a bugger giving those well suntanned the vote is it not ?.

Yep, fat tax cuts next year, the nats will not be able to cut them
further, unless they take their American advisors advice, and tax

Whats wrong with the low income paying 30% and the rich paying 17%.
The rich would still be paying more tax.

The fat tax cuts will be set for Labour by their Chinese advisor's,
who will decide the levels and duration, but I'm sure the Communists
will advise Labour to set the implementation date to early in 1009,
subject to Labour being re-elected.

Then of course due to those terribly convenient &quot;unforeseen
circumstances&quot; Labour can delay such measures to some more opportune
time in the future.

You see that is the problem we face, the Americans back National, the
Chinese back Labour, what everyone needs to decide is which regime
works closest to our way of life and freedoms, and which backer offers
the freedoms most in line with our Western style culture.

&gt; &gt; your question regarding
&gt; &gt; National politicians, is this a prelude to advising us that you are a
&gt; &gt; constant visitor to the Clark residence, and a party confidant as well,

&gt; And I had no agenda in asking about whether or not you personally knew any
&gt; politicians - I was merely inquiring as to your reason for so constantly
&gt; attacking the Labour Party and its politicians.

&gt; BTW, I note you have not commented about the political allegiances of your
&gt; friends. Would I be correct in stating that all your friends and
&gt; confidants are at *least* National Party, or even further extreme?

&gt; &gt; well bully for you !!!., but who cares.

&gt; Who cares? Certainly not me. I was not commenting on whether or not I
&gt; personally know any politicians - Labour, National, or otherwise.

&gt; I was inquiring the extent of the diversity of opinions amongst your
&gt; friends, or at least amongst those to whom you confidentially confide your
&gt; personal political opinions.

&gt; I note that you have not addressed the primary point of my post!

&gt; Let me ask the question once more to you:

&gt; Do you count as a close personal friend, and actually willingly socialise
&gt; with, anybody whose political views are such that they are at least a
&gt; staunch National voter, if not further to the extreme right?

&gt; Please answer the question directly, and not make an ad hominem attack.

&gt;&gt; contribute to NZ society, instead leech off it. We might
&gt;&gt; actually have some rich business men like Steve Tindel who have
&gt;&gt; earned their money however looking at heiresses like the Nobilo
&gt;&gt; idiot makes you realise they do nothing to deserve having money
&gt;&gt; beyond chance....

&gt; Bitter twisted little twerp that you are. Your *envy* is showing
&gt; yet again.

&gt; Why you think it is any of *your* business how much money anyone
&gt; has and what they should be spending it on and what they should
&gt; be taxed only points to your envy and loathing of successful
&gt; people.

Blinkered idiot....

I said Steve Tindle as an example of someone who has probably earned
it...as opposed to someone who was born to it and seems to be wasting it....

and no it does not...there is no envy on my part....and I dont care how
much others have so you are totally wrong in your assumptions of my
character...butthen from you I am not surprised...

I can  and indeed do admire the Steve Tindle's of this world and wish
them well....the drug seller and addict that is the Nobilo heiress I
have no time for.

regards

&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me ask the question once more to you:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you count as a close personal friend, and actually willingly
&gt;&gt;&gt; socialise with, anybody whose political views are such that they are at
&gt;&gt;&gt; least a staunch National voter, if not further to the extreme right?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please answer the question directly, and not make an ad hominem attack.

&gt;&gt; Where do you get this overblown feeling of self importance from, why on
&gt;&gt; earth do you feel that any poster here should be required to divulge
&gt;&gt; information concerning personal friendships, and/or business, political
&gt;&gt; contacts, just to satisfy the misplaced curiosity of one Johny Walker.

&gt; I note that you again have avoided answering a very simple and straight
&gt; forward question that relates to how representative a sample your statement
&gt; &quot;everybody I know&quot; would encompass.

&gt; You were not asked to divulge any names - merely whether or not your
&gt; circle of close friends encompassed anybody at all whose political views
&gt; were not pro National Party, or even further extreme to the right.

&gt; Your lack of an answer can only be construed that you do not, and
&gt; therefore your sample is not representative of the population at large.

&gt; Meanwhile, please learn how to address the point being discussed rather
&gt; than turning everything into personal point-scoring ad hominim attacks!

Since your arguments are based on strawman tactics and faulty logic you
deserve all the abuse you get you pathetic little dweeb.

Oh and btw they sickened more than just who he knew. Me for starters, and
I've voted Labour more times than National.

&gt; &gt;From a Dom Post article, &quot;Labour support crumbles&quot;.

&gt; National 50.5             Labour 31.

&gt; But still politicians like Cullen fail to recognize the mood of the
&gt; public, he claims the results would have been different were they not
&gt; taken prior to Labours orchestrated personal attack on Key and his
&gt; family.

I suspect next year's election could be very important. We could well be
looking at having our first MMP government that doesn't need to form a
coalition to govern.

If National  wins enough of the vote to rule alone and does a good job, it
will prove just stupid the switch to MMP was.
