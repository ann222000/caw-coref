'Junk science' vs. real thing in autism trial

Article Launched:07/28/2007 03:04:09 AM PDT

THE AUTISM omnibus trial has ended not with a bang but a whimper. The
trial, brought by 5,000 families seeking financial compensation
because they believe that vaccines cause autism, showed the world what
most of us in the medical community already know: There is no such
link, nor has there ever been.
The closing statement for the government, which was defending against
the claims of the first of 5,000 families (that their children had
developed autism due to routine childhood vaccines), summed up the
difference between the plaintiffs' side and their own. While each side
had science to support their arguments, the plaintiffs' science, as
demonstrated by the quality of the studies and of the witnesses who
testified on their behalf, was &quot;junk science.&quot;

That is, the experiments that allowed the scientists to collect their
data and analyze it were sloppy, as was their analysis.

However, that closing statement missed the point: The
vaccine-equals-autism myth stopped being about science a long time
ago. What's it's really been about are personal agendas,
misinformation and their effects on families who have autistic
children.

Those agendas start with the father of the vaccine theory -- Dr.
Andrew Wakefield. Dr. Wakefield was a practicing gastroenterologist
and researcher in Britain when, in 1998, he discovered a potential
link between the Measles Mumps Rubella Vaccine (MMR) and autism.

His study included just 12 kids but created a stir. What we didn't
know at the time about Dr. Wakefield was that his research was full of
hidden agendas.

For one, his study was funded by those seeking to sue vaccine
manufacturers. Second, Wakefield himself had filed a patent for a
replacement MMR vaccine a year before his study was published.
Finally, nobody has been able to replicate Wakefield's results, and
the thinking now is that they were most likely due to common
experimental error (technically, a false positive due to the
oversensitivity of PCR).

Wakefield's paper was later retracted due to these conflicts of
interest and questions about the quality of his work. Subsequent
studies containing hundreds of thousands of kids verified the safety
of the MMR vaccine.

But anti-vaccine advocates aren't the only ones who have erred. In
2000, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened
a meeting to look at the use of mercury-based preservatives in
vaccines.

This meeting was due in part to a 1997 law that required the Food and
Drug Administration to look at the use of mercury in biological
materials like vaccines and other medications.

In addition, in 1999, mercury-based preservatives were removed from
vaccines based on a government recommendation.

The meeting was held in part to be compliant with the law, but the way
the meeting was held looked suspicious to many. For example, it was
held away from the CDC, in a secluded location, and included
government officials, academics, and, to the delight of conspiracy
theorists, representatives of the pharmaceutical industry.

Excluded were autism advocates or other doubters of vaccine safety. In
addition, there was a delay in the release of the meeting's
transcript, which for some reason was worded as &quot;embargoing&quot; of the
transcript.

The location, participants and transcript delay led to a flurry of
conspiracy theories that were picked up by environmental lawyer Robert
F. Kennedy Jr. He published pieces in Rolling Stone and Salon.com
accusing the government of covering up the truth about vaccines and
autism, adding fuel to an already emotional fire.

Again, study after study looked at the safety of thimerosal (the
mercury-based preservative) and found absolutely no link between the
two.

Critics accused Kennedy of taking statements out of context and
implying the meeting and its outcome were &quot;secret&quot; and to be
&quot;embargoed&quot; from public consumption.

While the best, unbiased, objective evidence has failed to demonstrate
a link between thimerosal and autism, there is one study that is
frequently cited by anti-vaccine groups, written by the father-and-son
team of Mark and David Geier. In 2003, the Geiers looked at trends in
autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders following the removal of
thimerosal from most vaccines, and concluded that they had been a
downward trend.

That's a startling finding, whatever side of this debate you subscribe
to.

But let's look more closely: First, the Geiers do more than research
together. Mark Geier is a physician who runs Genetic Centers of
America, a company he founded, and specializes in autistic clients.

His work, which he charges quite a bit of money for, includes
providing controversial therapies like chelation of heavy metals and
injecting autistic kids with a drug called lupron, which halts the
progression of puberty.

David Geier is Mark's father and runs a legal consulting business in
which he routinely acts as an expert witness in vaccine injury trials.
This &quot;study&quot; has been deemed questionable by many for both its
internal validity (how the data was measured and interpreted) as well
as its motives.

Is there any better way to spell conflict of interest than a father
and son &quot;medical-legal&quot; team publishing studies that support their own
work and then using those studies and &quot;evidence&quot; in a court of law?

With all of these strikes against it, how could such a study get
published?

Medical journals come in two types: those in which studies submitted
for publication are reviewed by a body of your peers, and those that
are not, allowing dubious work to slip by.

The Geiers published this study, as well as all of their other
studies, in the latter type of journal.
