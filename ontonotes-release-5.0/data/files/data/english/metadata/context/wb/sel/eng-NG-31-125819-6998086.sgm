A long shot, but...

My Cruzbike was nicked this evening at around 20:00 from outside a house in
Maiden Erlegh, Reading.  It's very distinctive, a front wheel drive
recumbent just like this...

http://www.cruzbike.com/sofrider.html

...mine had a seatpost rack with panniers and  very bright LED lights.  I
think it's the only prodcuction Cruzbike in the country, being imported from
Oz via the USA.  I was just getting to like it too.  I suspect local scrotes
have trashed it and dumped it in the lake, but in case anyone should see it,
I'm on zkeit ... @zneonicaz.co.uk without the zeds.

Cheers

This was last Monday.  On Wednesday, I received an email from a denizen of
this group saying that it had been seen opposite Reading station at around
19:00 on Tuesday.   The security staff at the station confirmed this and
said that it was played about with for maybe an hour by a couple of 'violent
looking druggies'.

I've been round the area several times since on my old treader.  I doubt
that the 'druggies' nicked it directly, it was about three miles away, and
they would have been noticed.   More likely they bought or took it from kids
who'd nicked it.  The station staff said that bikes are stolen from the
station every day, so I wonder if mine was to be added to the day's haul for
collection and transportation - it seems unlikely that 'druggies' would have
any real use for it other than for cash.

Anyway, thanks to my informant, and if anyone sees a Cruzbike Sofrider
anywhere, it's very likely stolen - please report it and let me know.

Thanks
