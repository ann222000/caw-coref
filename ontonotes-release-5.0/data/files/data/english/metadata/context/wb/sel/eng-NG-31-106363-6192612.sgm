Hello all!
I'm sure this has been brought up many times before, but I was hoping
for some advice.  First some background:  my baby girl is 5 weeks old
and was 5lb 11oz at birth (not preemie -- 39 weeks gestation, just
small, but perfectly healthy).  We had a HORRIBLE time breastfeeding
the first couple of weeks, and she dropped down to 5 lbs.  Since then,
she has gained consistently at the rate of 1/2 oz per day (which is on
the very bottom of the "acceptable" range according to the
pediatrician).  He wants me to try supplementing with formula.  I want
to avoid that at all costs.  What would you all do?  Thanks for any
advice!

Usually, supplementing is shooting yourself in the foot. The more you
supplement, the less she'll nurse,the less you produce, the more you
have to supplement. I'd think - and I'm not a pedi - as long as she is
gaining weight she's ok. btw, dropping weight in the first weeks is
normal. We were a special situation (DD was IV fed for a week, tube fed
for the second week), but she didn't regain her birthweight until 3 wks
old, and gained very slowly once I started Breastfeeding directly (the
tube feeds were EBM). The nurses at the NICU were harassing me a bit
about the slow weight gain and insisting they at least tube-feed (ie
force feed) to make up the difference. Fortunately the neonatalogist
sided with the LC and me and insisted we keep on BF. Now, by 3 weeks
she *was* gaining reasonable amounts and doing well, your situation
does sound a bit different.

I gather BF is going well now? How long does she feed on each side? DO
you let her nurse until she's done on each side or do you switch sides
after a certain number of minutes? Could it be she's not nursing long
enough and only getting foremilk rather than hindmilk? DD only nursed
on one side per session, and in that first week I'd have to encourage
her to nurse more, even though the nurses also said I should switch
sides after X# minutes.

Have you pumped? You can consider pumping after each feed, then give
her that via syringe or bottle (if BF is well established now). That
way your supply isn't adversely affected, but you're topping her off
for awhile and see if that makes a difference (I also did that with DD
for the first week or so).

I had a baby who consistently gained at the very bottom of the
acceptable range and chose not supplement.  He is now a normal 5 year
old.  Since your baby is gaining within the normal range, you don't
have an immediate emergency and don't "have" to supplement right now.
However, you probably would be happier to have her gaining faster.
Since she is within the normal range you have time to try various
methods to increase her weight gain without supplementing.  If her
weight gain drops and you do need to supplement, you may be able to
pump and use you own milk, avoiding bottles and formula.

What is her nursing pattern like?  Is she getting at least 10-12
nursings in 24 hours?  Is she a fast feeder, slow feeder, sleepy feeder
etc?

Do you feel like she is running out of milk and would take more if it
were available?

She could still need work on her latch.  You may want to get that
checked.  If her latch is OK, switch nursing, back and forth from side
to side each time she slows down can help her get more milk and
increase your supply.  Breast compression (squeezing your breast) when
she slows down can help too.  You may want to try herbs or Mother's
Milk tea.  Kellymom has good information on herbs.
http://kellymom.com/herbal/milksupply/index.html

Does she seem to fill up quickly and not want more?  Does she have lots
of gas?

She could be filling up with air.  More frequent burping and/or
symethicone drops might help?

Don't supplement.  Just nurse until baby is full
or asleep.  Don't time the session, just nurse.  ;)

Up to a ten percent drop in weight at first is considered normal, so
that would be about 9 oz. for a 5 lb. 11 oz. baby. She lost just *two*
ounces more than that ... not such a hideous thing. (Two of my three
babies lost more than 10% without having any problem, but they were
biggish babies to begin with, plus they lost most of the weight almost
immediately, and I think their birthweights may have been inflated due
to retained water from my being on an IV for a long time before they
were born.) Yes, half an ounce a day is at the bottom of the range, but
heck, she's not a large person, and she *is* into the normal range
despite your rough start. I don't see a reason to panic yet, if she's
acting normal, pooping and peeing well, and all that. What's her
feeding behavior like -- is she nursing for decent lengths of time,
latching well, not going too long between feeds? I wouldn't be
surprised if she started gaining a bit faster soon.

Some people do breast compression to try to get more hindmilk into the
baby. Maybe someone who knows more about it can post.

sorry, it's at the bottom of acceptable, not below the acceptable range, so
exactly why does he want you to supplement with formula? Even if it was
below the acceptable range the first solution would not be to supplement
(unless it was an urgent health issue), I'd recommend a visit to a lacation
consultant, just to check your latch and everything is ok. Given she was
small, that's probably just her constitution so she's not going to be
putting on as much, that amount is going to be a similar percentage of her
body weight gained than a larger baby that gains an ounce, her stomach is
going to be smaller, so in some ways her acceptable range should be adjusted
and she's probably middle of that range.

Hello,

Helen S. mentioned trying breast compressions.  These can be very
effective for "supplementing" baby with your milk as she breastfeeds.
Assuming she is nursing well now, and you are not in pain when she
sucks; all you do is move your hand back towards your chest (not
towards her mouth).  You compress the breast while the baby is actively
sucking, then relax when she pauses.  There is a good description of
breast compressions on Jack Newman's section of
Breastfeedingonline.com.  What you are are doing is simply moving more
milk towards the baby than she can get herself with each suck.  It's a
very simple, efficient way to "supplement."

Good luck,
Rachel

Hmm.  Do you feel like she is weak or lazy?  One of mine was weak and lazy
and while my supply was fine, he wasn't very good at getting full until he
was a little stronger.  If she is strong, alert, active, healthy looking,
plenty of diapers, etc she's probably just small.   I could tell my weaker
baby wasn't getting as much, but then I had nursed two previously and he is
a twin so I had another stronger baby to compare to in real time :)

If you think she may need to get a little stronger she is old enough to
introduce a bottle.  If you decide to go that route, my advice would be to
pump some milk...nurse her until she is full, and then have someone else
give her a couple ounces from a bottle.   I'd do that maybe twice a day.
Pump while someone else gives her the bottle.  You aren't likely to get much
milk then but don't worry about that, it is just to signal your body.  You
may need to pump each morning to get those ounces.  If she refuses the milk,
she is getting full at the breast.  If she is drinking it down just continue
on like that for a couple weeks and she'll slowly get stronger and better at
the breast.  Cut out the one bottle, and then cut out the next a few days
later.

I was able to eliminate all the bottles and he was/is fine.

If you do feel this is the problem for your baby then the last thing you
want to do is introduce a bottle, babies like this are much more suspetible
to developing problems with switching between breast and bottle. I've also
had a baby with a weak suck, but I didn't notice as he was my first, we
didn't really have a problem until I introduced first a pacifier, then a
bottle, after that it took weeks of pumping after every single feed and even
then we didn't quite make it through without some supplementation, though
those were more related to my health issues than the early problems. Breast
compression is a very good way to assist a baby with a weaker suck, use your
thumb and forefinger, thumb on top of the breast, cupping it an massage down
towards the nipple, you can actually apply quite a lot of pressure, the aim
is to get to the deep tissues and really make sure that the breast is
emptied during a feed.

Thanks for all the advice!  In answer to some of your questions,
breastfeeding is going much better now (I've had my mom, who
successfully bf'd 3 babies, sit with me many times to watch her latch,
etc.), and I let Sara feed on each side until she gets too sleepy
(10-15 mins per side).  If she still acts hungry, I let her go back on
the first breast for a few more minues.

I also have been pumping some, and offering her that after a couple of
feedings a day, and she always takes 1-2 more oz when I offer, so that
makes me think she leaves hungry sometimes -- even after 45 minutes.
One thing of note is that she doesn't eat 10-12 times a day, maybe more
like 8.  She typically sleeps for 2-3 hours every time before waking up
to eat.  Her diapers are definitely good, and she has long alert
periods where she's perfectly content, so it's not like she's crying
all the time or anything.

You could try offering the breast at other times and seeing if she will have a
go.  Eight feeds a day is a bit low, and more frequent feeds will build
supply, so it is worth trying.

Switching breasts while feeding isn't necessary, btw.  My elder boy always
fell asleep within 10-15 mins of latching on, so we never got to the second
breast.  This was probably a good thing as I had oversupply.

Switching breasts isn't necessary if you have oversupply and your baby
is growing well.  If you want to increase your baby's milk intake and
increase your milk supply, then switching breasts is a very good idea.

I would definitely recommend continuing to switch breasts, if a baby has
fallen asleep and you feel they need to eat more, it's a very good way of
acheiving that. If they are asleep because they are full, then they probably
just won't take the other breast and like Chookie, if you have oversupply,
if they really do need to have more to eat, you want to get them back onto
the original breast.

when you offer a bottle, it stimulates a different part of the mouth and
most babies will automatically take some milk, even if they are full, there
was some research that came up with bottle fed babies being overfed by about
an ounce per feed because of this. You may consider not offering the bottle
at all, but still pumping for the stimulations, at 5 weeks old and not a
perfect breastfeeder, she is a prime candidate for nipple confusion or
bottle preference.

I agree that if you supplement your milk will be less.  Just continue
to breastfeed and allow her to grow and her appetite to grow also.
Also make sure that you are drinking  at least 10 - 8 ounce glasses of
water daily.  You may just not be making enough milk.  I had to learn
that on my own.  You must keep your body fully hydrated.  It makes a
huge differenc.

Huh, we must have gotten lucky then.  I figured that the risk was quite low
for a 5 week old but I'm glad you spoke up!

I did do the breast compression to.  It was also kind of fortunate that he
was a twin because when I tandemed the stronger baby stimulated the let down
for him.

It is hard to make them eat more often when they want to sleep but maybe
worth a try.  I had mixed results with that.  I think he got a better feed
in if I left him alone for 3hrs instead of trying for every 2.  If possible
I would have your mom or someone else give the bottle.   As she matures and
becomes more awake and alert I'd try to start eliminating them.  I think I
started eliminating them around 8 weeks.  It was odvious he no longer needed
them because he didn't always finish them.   I also never increased the
amount.  If he seemed more hungry I made him nurse more ;-)

You are doing a fantastic job!!

I just read your above post, you say you stopped bottles at 8 weeks. I think
it was actually beyond that point where they became an issue and I was never
giving them as a supplement at the end of a breastfeed, but as an
alternative to a breastfeed, my reason for saying to stop them is in part
what I do see as a longer term risk of bottle preference due to it being

at the end of a feed they have had enough, if their tummy isn't quite as
full as it absolutely could be, they will just request more slightly sooner
and if they are still rooting and trying to get more food, use the third
breast, i.e. the first one again (I think the OP said she was doing this
anyway), topping up with a bottle almost reinforces there laziness. I'm also
pretty convinced that the bottle definitely doesn't improve their suck,
which leaves the possibility that it's harming it and ideally you'd like
that suck to improve, my DS's never did, even as a toddler on 1 feed a day,
it was an hour long feed.

With having twins, you did the right thing for your situation, though I
suspect you would have been at high risk of problems if you hadn't phased
out the top ups. Was there actually a gap where he didn't receive any
bottles? Did his suck improve? I remember when he was a newborn, he sounded
like a clone of my DS with his breastfeeding habits, they were similar
gestation as well (37+4), I'm not sure whether my DS's weak such was a
result of his being a 37 weeker, or his size (5lb13oz, IUGR rather than just
small), or just one of those things, DD didn't help in the detective work by
being both later and bigger!

That is a legitamate concern.   That is why I always made sure someone else

I do agree completely with this.  I stopped the top offs as soon as I felt

No.  I just stopped the top off's and he recieved a 3ounce bottle at least 5

Don't know.  Ben was 7lbs11oz and Brock was 8lbs9oz.  I did top off Brock

I seriously find that 36 and 37 weekers have MUCH more trouble
breastfeeding than 35 and 38+ weekers do.  I have no idea why, but it's
something I've noticed from when I first started my Midwifery training
in 2001. There are rarely any exceptions, but of course I only see them
for the first 5 days.

this is exactly what my midwife told me, she phrased it as 36 weekers are
stupid, 35 weekers are smart!

the info about 37 weekers seems to be less known, though interestingly my DS
had no problems in the first 6-8 weeks, it seemed that despite his weak suck
the milk came out with such force that he consumed plenty of milk, it was as
the hormone control reduced and supply and demand took over that we had
problems and so began weeks of feeding 1hr45mins in every 2hrs as it took
him that long to get a full tummy. Feeding was never fast with him!

Wow. I'd be wondering if there was some difference in how the cases are
handled, if they get different levels of nursing care or whatever (but
I suppose you aren't talking about just one hospital?). I know there
was one woman here years ago who had a baby at (I think) 36 weeks, who
was big and healthy and got treated essentially as a full-term baby, so
that she didn't get at all the kind of support she would usually have
done with a premie. I think that may well have had something to do with
the problems her baby had breastfeeding. Of course this is all my
interpretation in hindsight, and I can't be sure of having the story
quite straight any longer.

&gt; Thanks for all the advice!  In answer to some of your questions,
&gt; breastfeeding is going much better now (I've had my mom, who
&gt; successfully bf'd 3 babies, sit with me many times to watch her latch,
&gt; etc.), and I let Sara feed on each side until she gets too sleepy
&gt; (10-15 mins per side).  If she still acts hungry, I let her go back on
&gt; the first breast for a few more minues.

&gt; I also have been pumping some, and offering her that after a couple of
&gt; feedings a day, and she always takes 1-2 more oz when I offer, so that
&gt; makes me think she leaves hungry sometimes -- even after 45 minutes.
&gt; One thing of note is that she doesn't eat 10-12 times a day, maybe more
&gt; like 8.  She typically sleeps for 2-3 hours every time before waking up
&gt; to eat.  Her diapers are definitely good, and she has long alert
&gt; periods where she's perfectly content, so it's not like she's crying
&gt; all the time or anything.

Then I'd ignore the pedi. If she's happy and growing, try not to stress too
much.

Yes, this is from the 3 different hospitals I have worked at.  I think
if a 36 weeker is of a normal size, they are left to demand feed, but
all feeds are watched (with mother's permission) regardless of
gestation.  If the 36 weeker is on the small size, they are on 3 hourly
feeds, usually.  If they are not feeding well, then they would get EBM
via syringe, cup or finger feed.  If they are not able to do even this,
they would be in SCN getting tube fed.  I guess all infants are treated
the same from birth, breastfeeding-wise, and just observed for any
problems and go from there.

some hospitals will automatically treat 36 weeks as a preemie, others will
do if under a certain weight and a few actually look at what they are seeing
and treat accordingly.

For me, this came up in the context of planning a homebirth, I felt that
once past the stage where there was a high chance of immediate help needed
with breathing, I would continue with homebirth plans, I didn't discuss this
with my midwife until around 35 weeks and she felt that if I had the baby in
week 35, I would have a good chance of remaining at home through the first
week or so after the birth, but with a 36 weeker that would actually be
harder. I seem to recall that Donna Metler's little girl was quite big and
treated as term, though was somewhere in week 35, but ended up losing a lot
of weight and probably wasn't being observed closely enough for her
gestation. My particular reasons for avoiding the hospital was not so much
that I felt there was no need, but that I felt that routine interventions,
such as insisting feeds be of a certain volume were potentially harmful and
that they might have insisted on tube feeds rather than waiting and seeing
if tube feeds were necessary. I feel that a lot of hospitals are not
treating near term babies as they deserve, for example, they won't be
priorites for receiving donor breast milk, yet they often won't give mum the
chance to express some and will supplement with formula too soon.

obviously my observations in my other post relate to British hospitals
mainly and this would not be normal standard in a British hospital, at 36
weeks, a bottle would almost certainly be offered before using a tube and in
many cases even before other methods. I feel that in the UK we are getting
there when it comes to well full term babies and breastfeeding, for more
premature infants it's also generally good though I suspect that more donor
breastmilk is needed and there is always need for extra lactation
specialists to help the mums with pumping, but for near term and sick full
term babies breastfeeding is seen as a bonus and the importance of making
care decisions right from the start that support it is diminished. I once
visited a friend about 16hrs after a c-section (after early attempts at
induction had stressed the baby) for obstetric choestasis, so the baby was
just on 37 weeks, she'd had a couple of dusky episodes early on and had been
whipped into scbu, complete monitoring, etc (I don't know whether that was
warranted or not, but no reason was ever found and she's been fine since),
when I spoke to the mum, she was obviously quite distressed, she'd had a
PPH, but she said no one had even mentioned breastfeeding to her and she had
no idea how the baby was being fed (I'm pretty sure it turned out to be
bottle not tube, and definitely formula). It's entirely possible that being
a less needy baby, they wouldn't have made it through without some formula
in those first few days, but equally things could have been handled so much
better. There also seemed to be significant delay in mum being allowed to
offer the breast, again for no strong reason, of course when it came to it
after, the bottles, baby had no idea what to do and the ended up using
nipple shields, discharged without any advice on how to continue, so she
continued using nipple shields, each feed took a long time and she felt she
couldn't breastfeed with nipple shields anywhere but home and stopped
feeding within a month. Baby had a very sickly first year, with multiple
colds etc. absolute classic for a formula fed baby attending daycare, mum's
postnatal depression worsened after stopping feeding, which is a known
connection, yet doctors etc. advised her that stopping breastfeeding would
help. All in all, not a good outcome, but it was pretty much clear that
something like that would happen with the first 16hrs of the babies life.
The sad thing is that that kind of story is not a one off where things went
wrong or guidelines were not followed, it's a normal story.

switch nursing is a well known method of increasing supply, basically the
opposite of the keeping the baby on a single breast for x hrs trick for
decreasing supply. If you are well tuned in to your baby and are responding
to feeding clues, it may not be possible to feed more often, which then
leaves switch nursing, you need to be careful to avoid foremilk hindmilk
inbalance, but if you are in a position of needing to increase supply, you
probably aren't going to have that problem!
