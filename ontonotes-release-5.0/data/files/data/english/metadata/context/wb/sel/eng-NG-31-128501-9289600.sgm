Hello All,
We started this site as a way for communication between teachers and
students.  We are having a problem with members just popping up on our
page without an invite.  How do we delete them so they are off of our
list.  We went into manage members and they are not showing?  Does
anyone know how to fix this problem? If so, it would be greatly
appreciated!! Thank you

Hello,
It's likely your group settings are on &quot;Anyone can post&quot;. Change them
in &quot;Only members can post&quot;.
On &quot;Anyone can post&quot; everybody around can post even without being a
member and showing up in the member list.
Regards
Aldo

Hi,
Aldo has given you the most likely solution but we have found when
a group member has, by mistake, used another of their addresses other
than the listed version, that it has in fact been delivered to
everyone. The only difference being it did not appear in the web site.
Our group is set as private and so this is a problem that may affect
public groups more. Perhaps it would not be a bad idea if  the address
of a message sent to the group was checked against the master list and
only forwarded on if  listed. Having you group name publicly known
could be a reason for spam coming into your group.

Reg, if I'm reading this correctly, you're saying that messages are
going to group members email inboxes but are not showing up on the web
site at Google Groups. If this is so, then this means that the spammer
has gleaned group members' email addresses and is sending their crap
to their personal email; which is something that hasn't got anything
to do with groups. The solution for those members would be to block
that address so they don't receive spam from them again. Being a
private group doesn't differentiate to make this scenario possible,
all messages to the group will show on the web site.

Hello Deena,
It does not necessarily mean that a spammer has gained access to
personal e-mail addresses but has gained access to the group address.
Simply by addressing a mail to the group gets it delivered to each and
every member.

You are quite right that being public or private makes no
difference to any protection you may have if the wrong person gets
hold of a group address. The only resource, as you suggest, would be
to block the address from which the junk comes.

Our group is a work based group and occasionally have the
situation where a member becomes a supervisor and no longer needs
membership of the group but may, conceivably, need to contact everyone
at some time about something. They are told that there is nothing to
stop them using the group address even though they are no longer
members and it will be delivered to each and every current member. The
differences being it will not show up in the website and the sender
will not receive a copy of the message.

I think it would be a help if the groups programme could be set so
that the address of a message received into the group could be
compared against the list of current members and if found not to be
listed then not forwarded on. Maybe this could be made an optional
choice.

Hello Reg,

All that you're telling depends on your group settings.
If in your group &quot;anybody can see the group content&quot; and &quot;anyone can
post&quot;, it's obvious you're receiving posts from spammers too. Even if
you're requiring an invitation request.....it's contradictory!
Begin to set the group to &quot;only members can see group content&quot; and
&quot;only members can post&quot;, you'll see things in a very different way. At
this point, you could also set the group to &quot;anyone can
join&quot;.....provided that &quot;new members
are moderated&quot;, you can easily control if the person who just joined
is a spammer or not.

By the way, this can also explain because you're believing to have a
lot of members, all automatically verified (do you recall our last
conversation?).
Truly, you're having just a few &quot;full&quot; members, who joined clicking on
the UNIQUE link of their invitation, because they had already a Google
group account!
The other ones aren't prompted to do quite a work, because they're
already able to see the group content, and/or to post.

My apologies if I'm wrong, and I didn't find your right group.....but
I don't think so. The matter is your group is anomalous and, sorry,
your advices can be misleading for other group owners.

My apologies again if I've been harsh.....but this needed to be said.

Regards
Aldo

I've just re-checked Aldo and we are set up as an unlisted group, only
members can see content and only members can post. We have had the
case on two occasions from the same person who also uses a business e-
mail address which is not listed in our group and on both occasions
the message was delivered to all members but did not appear on the
website. Perhaps the next time I need to send a message I will use an
unlisted address of my own to confirm what happens. Fingers crossed
but we are not getting junk mail but if our address was made public
then it is quite possible we would.

I think you have got me crossed up with someone else with regards your
paragraph that starts  &gt; By the way, this can also explain because
you're believing&lt;  all of our members are added by me, none by invite.

Hi,

My deepest apologies, you're fully right, I confused you with another
Reg...........it seemed so logical as an explanation why someone has
been able to post to members without appearing in group!
This is still a little mistery, then.....nevertheless, there should be
an explanation.....only, it's not so easy to find!
In conclusion, we must just accept as a fact what you said in:
http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Groups-Basics/msg/a8c7e1d215ced971
Good to know, in case the same would happen to other groups.

My best regards

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public groups more. Perhaps it would not be a bad idea if  the address
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a message sent to the group was checked against the master list and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only forwarded on if  listed. Having you group name publicly known
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a reason for spam coming into your group.

Hi Aldo,
Sounds a pretty reasonable mistake to make - one of those
things :-)
As I wrote before, the next message I send to the group will be from
an unlisted address just to see what happens.
Kind regards
Reg

&gt; Hi,

&gt; My deepest apologies, you're fully right, I confused you with another

&gt; This is still a little mistery, then.....nevertheless, there should be
&gt; an explanation.....only, it's not so easy to find!
&gt; In conclusion, we must just accept as a fact what you said in: http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Groups-Basics/msg/a8c7e1d215ced971
&gt; Good to know, in case the same would happen to other groups.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Reg,

&gt; &gt; &gt; All that you're telling depends on your group settings.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If in your group &quot;anybody can see the group content&quot; and &quot;anyone can
&gt; &gt; &gt; post&quot;, it's obvious you're receiving posts from spammers too. Even if
&gt; &gt; &gt; you're requiring an invitation request.....it's contradictory!
&gt; &gt; &gt; Begin to set the group to &quot;only members can see group content&quot; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;only members can post&quot;, you'll see things in a very different way. At
&gt; &gt; &gt; this point, you could also set the group to &quot;anyone can
&gt; &gt; &gt; join&quot;.....provided that &quot;new members
&gt; &gt; &gt; are moderated&quot;, you can easily control if the person who just joined
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a spammer or not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, this can also explain because you're believing to have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; lot of members, all automatically verified (do you recall our last
&gt; &gt; &gt; conversation?).
&gt; &gt; &gt; Truly, you're having just a few &quot;full&quot; members, who joined clicking on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the UNIQUE link of their invitation, because they had already a Google
&gt; &gt; &gt; group account!
&gt; &gt; &gt; The other ones aren't prompted to do quite a work, because they're
&gt; &gt; &gt; already able to see the group content, and/or to post.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My apologies if I'm wrong, and I didn't find your right group.....but
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think so. The matter is your group is anomalous and, sorry,
&gt; &gt; &gt; your advices can be misleading for other group owners.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My apologies again if I've been harsh.....but this needed to be said.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Deena,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      It does not necessarily mean that a spammer has gained access to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personal e-mail addresses but has gained access to the group address.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Simply by addressing a mail to the group gets it delivered to each and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every member.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     You are quite right that being public or private makes no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difference to any protection you may have if the wrong person gets
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hold of a group address. The only resource, as you suggest, would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to block the address from which the junk comes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Our group is a work based group and occasionally have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation where a member becomes a supervisor and no longer needs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; membership of the group but may, conceivably, need to contact everyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at some time about something. They are told that there is nothing to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stop them using the group address even though they are no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; members and it will be delivered to each and every current member. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differences being it will not show up in the website and the sender
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not receive a copy of the message.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it would be a help if the groups programme could be set so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the address of a message received into the group could be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compared against the list of current members and if found not to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listed then not forwarded on. Maybe this could be made an optional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; choice.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reg, if I'm reading this correctly, you're saying that messages are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to group members email inboxes but are not showing up on the web
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; site at Google Groups. If this is so, then this means that the spammer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has gleaned group members' email addresses and is sending their crap
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to their personal email; which is something that hasn't got anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do with groups. The solution for those members would be to block
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that address so they don't receive spam from them again. Being a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; private group doesn't differentiate to make this scenario possible,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all messages to the group will show on the web site.

The situation you describe that Aldo and Deena have tried to help you
with is difficult to accept as true without additional information.
The implications for all of us who run private groups is serious if
any of this is true, so permit me to be very skeptical of all of it.

Nowhere in this thread do you say that these e-mail messages going to
all members, which are not archived, come from or through the Google
Group, that is, they bear the Google Groups address. From what you
say, the messages seem not to come from the Group but rather from one
private email address, as Deena supposed, and so do I. The only
conclusion I can draw from that is that your entire membership list
has been copied by that person some time in the past. Also you do not
indicate whether or not your group is moderated and whether or not you
are the sole manager/list-owner. If it is moderated and non-subscribed
messages were actually were passing through Google Groups to your
Group, that would stop them in the message queue. You also do not say
if you have asked the person who has done this twice with an
unsubscribed e-mail address if he knows this is happening and why and
how he is doing it. He may have his email addresses linked in some
way. Or perhaps the e-mail addresses differ by a single character and
you have discovered a weakness in Google Group protocols. I'd read the
complete headers of those messages very carefully. It seems to me that
you should inquire of the purported sender.

In a group which is truly closed, as you say yours is, it should not
be possible for anyone, member or not, to used an e-mail address which
is not subscribed to the group to send mail through the group. If what
you say happened is possible, it should be happening in other groups.
In 4 years and many thousands of emails it has not happened once in my
group. This is the first account I have read of it happening in other
groups, which are larger and more active than mine. However, a message
sent with the spoofed e-mail address of a member will get as far as
the message moderation queue and on through to the members in an
unmoderated group.

Hi,
I apologise to each and everyone including Google for the wrong
information I have given.

The situation is as you thought and it does appear the particular
person addressed the message to me and put everyone else  as BCC.

Last night I sent a message from another of my own e-mail unlisted
addresses to the group and it was rejected.

It was in the early days of our Googlegroup experience and the message
came to me as if to the whole group followed soon by another saying
the help asked for was no longer needed as someone had responded. I
contacted the sender and asked if she wanted the new address entered
into the group - she was confused and told me she didn't understand
what had happened as she had followed the same course as before. There
is one message from her before that date through Googlegroups in the
archive. I have obviously remembered the gist of it all but not the
finer detail.

It has not been any intention of mine to mislead and I hope not to
have become the cause of any lasting confusion.
Kind regards
Reg
