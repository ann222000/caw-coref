I suppose this is as good a place as any to ask about a problem with my
mill.  I'm trying to motorize it, which means getting the handle off.  It
looks like a hole was drilled into the rod directly turning the roller, as
well as a hole drilled into the handle.  From what I can tell, two bolts
were screwed down to secure it.  The head diameter of the bolts allow them
to go all the way down to the bottom--I assume there's a special name for
them but I wouldn't know.

Of course the first one comes out, but the second doesn't.  Or I dunno
what's really happening since it's impossible to get a good view in down
there.  It was suggested I try an extractor tool; drill into the piece,
hammer that in, and I should be able to unscrew everything.  This didn't
work, and seems to have screwed up the holes enough that I think my only
solution is to just drill drill away until the handle separates.

Do any of you know if there's anything else that could be securing the
handle in?  At this point, I can clamp the roller's rod and then roughly
twist the handle around it 3/4 of the way.  It's flat on one side BTW,
which the handle is held in place by a completely round hole.  I don't know
what to do to get the thing off.

I have no idea, but telling the group what mill you have might help
others to give you a good answer.  ;)

In this case, probably not.  It's the mill that was sold through St.
Patrick's of Texas.  IIRC they got the design elsewhere with just one or
two tweaks.  They don't sell them anymore.  Given their service towards
homebrewers, I'd rather first get slammed over the Internet than try to
call them. :(  It's been awhile since they sold it and they've gotten out
of the brewing stuff so I doubt they know much about it anymore.

It's a double roller mill with adjustable fineness.  One roller is
controlled by the handle.

The "screws" are called set screws. They are designed so that they can
thread completely through the hub of the handle. They are normally driven
with an allen wrench and tighten by applying pressure onto the encircled
shaft.

Regarding the mill shaft - I sounds like the shaft has a flat cut into it so
that one of the set screws can lock into that area and prevent the handle
from turning on the shaft.

Thinking about what you have done so far - damage control is in order. I'd
suggest cutting the handle off by cutting slots parallel to the shaft 180
degrees from each other through the handle hub. I'd suggest using a Dremel
tool with a cut off wheel. It shouldn't take you but a few minutes. BTW -
wear safety glasses.
