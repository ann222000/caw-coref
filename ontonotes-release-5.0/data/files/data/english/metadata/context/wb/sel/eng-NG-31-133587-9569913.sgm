yea, i know the nerve of them  ... looks like we weren't the only ones ready to cash out at 35.00  (34.08 was the high today)... others are pulling the plug ... very annoying.  everyone should wait for us first !!!!

looking at the seasonality usually november is the high anyways.  usually it's been about middle of november.  AND usually its significantly higher than this time frame ... enough that it does merit holding for another few weeks ....

i've reattached yhoo1.gif (the initial seasonal analysis) ... pay particular attention the the light grey lines under the red line ... trace them and find where the &quot;highest peak&quot; is during this time of year (november/december).  this represents the closing prices normalized to this year.  mostly its coming out middle of november.  this strongly suggests we will be able to get the 35 (or possibly higher) ... not trying to be too much of a fat pig. haha ....

It looks fine, guess there's quite a few out there either...in at this
price and sick of being at a loss so they sold at break
even...or...decided to just not wait any longer...maybe they want to
cash to spend for Thsnksgiving and Christmas dinner, presents, etc or
putting it all on goog (lol). Now I  hope the ones still in are
waiting for 40 so we don't have this situation again when yhoo reaches
36.
