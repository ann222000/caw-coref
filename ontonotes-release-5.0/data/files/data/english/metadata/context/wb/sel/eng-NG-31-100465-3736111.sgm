Concerning All Hallows Eve &amp; The Possibilities In life

What turns the TRICK, you'll never know, you're on your way, you
long to go.

Time keeps turning into space, What A TREAT AT LOVER'S PLACE!

Greetings From Augustine's  Spiritual Goods

Miss Alice &amp; Rev. Frank Papa Doc

Believe it or not, the above is an obscure Halloween love chant. To use
it, all you have to do is fix your gaze upon the lover of your choice
and repeat the chant replacing the word 'Lover" with you own name.
Example:  if your name is Pablo you would chant. " What a Treat at
Pablo's Place!" So when you're at a party this Halloween season, go
for it!

Love energy runs high from now through December, especially the energy
that pulls back a man that has gone astray, left home and done run
away. Also note that the love planet Venus has moved into the hot fire
sign of Sagittarius. So gentlemen, the ladies are ready. Oh it's a
battle of the sexes out there! Some got to win and some got to lose.

Halloween, also called All Hallow's Eve, All Saint's Eve, and The
Day of The Dead (called All Soul's Day), that follows on November the
2nd is a time steeped in folk traditions from around the world. It is
believed that on All Hallow's Eve the spiritual veil that separates
the world of the living from the world of the dead is at its thinnest.
It is believed that the greatest amount of evil enters the Earth-bound
sphere at this time, and on this night the forces of evil gather along
with the new forces that will wreak havoc for the coming year.
Therefore, it is a good time to invoke the 7 Saints, the 7 African
Powers and Guardian Angels, especially St. Michael  for protection and
blessings in the coming year.

Many Spiritualists and Root Workers find this time advantageous for
conjuring the spirits and communicating with the dead. A good friend of
mine, now deceased, Reverend Prowl, always called it "The night of
peeking into the future," meaning that it was a good night for
divination, conjuring and contacting the spirits.  A time to get a look
at what your life will be in the future. The Reverend swore he won the
lottery on the numbers he conjured up one Halloween evening.  As I
said, some use this night effectively and work to set a tone for their
future prosperity and luck in life. A client of mine, a man who called
himself Sweet Stick, made it a point to drink champagne and have two
ladies on his arm on All Hallow's Eve. He said to me, "I swear it
Papa Doc, I could see it! I could see it! Woman all over, and a
fountain of Champagne." And indeed he did do well, until the wrath of
these woman came down upon his head for his cheating ways. This he did
not see.  So stand reminded that your wishes and desire should not take
advantage of someone else's soul.

This All Hallow's Eve takes place during the Dark of the Moon, which
makes it all the more sinister and forceful. This Dark Moon, also know
as the Witches Moon, is an excellent time to either lay down a hex on
someone or break yourself free of one that has been placed upon you. So
take advantage of this time to either perform a Protection Ritual to
break that hex, jinx or curse!  And if I dare say it, the Witches Moon
is a time to take care of that enemy!   If your taste lean more to
Spirit Contact the winds will be blowing open all the doors so do a
Conjure Ritual.  The use of a OUIJA BOARD, is in effect, nothing more
than a conjuring ritual. But don't forget the idea about setting a
positive tone for the future. Don't be like Sweet Stick, choose an
avenue you can walk on yourself and you will profit the most from it.
Therefore, All Hallow's Eve should be used as a good time to prepare
for a Happy New Year, a Fall Season of Love, Prosperity and Protection.
So don't think Evil, think about keeping it away from you.
