So the universe is currently ~14 billion years old.  Our galaxy has
been forging new stars continuously for most of that period, but the
current estimate is that there's only enough interstellar gas left for
another ~~10 billion years of star formation.  Let's be conservative
and double that.  This is the Stelliferous Era: the first 30-35
billion years of the universe.

Once star formation stops, the stars will start going out -- biggest
and brightest first, then gradually working down the main sequence.
So, ~5 billion years after the end of the Stelliferous Era, there
won't be any F or hotter stars left.  By ~~50 billion years after, the
last yellow dwarf will be winking out.  Call this the Reddening Era.
By the time the universe is ~~100 billion years old, all the bright
stars are gone.  What's left: red and orange dwarves and stellar
remnants.

We now enter onto the long, calm middle age of the universe.  Because
of convection, small stars live /much/ longer than big ones.  The
smallest red dwarves may last several trillion years.  So, the Red
Dwarf Era may last from around 100 billion AD to, let's say, 5
trillion.  In a sense, the first 100 billion years of the universe is
just a bright, energetic prologue, barely a fiftieth as long as the
next chapter.

This is an era in which not much happens, but that's not necessarily
bad.  The universe continues to expand, and distant galaxies and
quasars may gradually wink out of existence for us, but the Milky Way
should be stable over this time scale.  Eventually, dynamic relaxation
will cause most of the Milky Way to disintegrate into interstellar
space, while the rest will get eaten by the black hole at the center,
but that's going to take a few orders of magnitude more --
quadrillions or quintillions of years, not trillions.

This is a universe that's still reasonably hospitable to Life As We
Know It.  Chemical-based life should still be possible.  Red dwarves
aren't bright, but even a little star produces plenty of energy, so
there's plenty of power to support advanced civilizations doing
interesting things.  The Red Dwarf Milky Way could still include
billions of worlds of sunlight -- okay, red sunlight -- breathable
air, and running water, supporting species or cultures that think in
time scales of billions or tens of billions of years.  It could be the
long red afternoon of life in the universe.

Of course, everything comes to an end, and eventually even the dimmest
red dwarf will wink out.

Still... this seems like a potentially interesting setting.  Has
anyone ever done anything with it?

As far as writing and publishing stories in such a setting? Not that I know
of. Although I could easily be wrong; my knowledge is far from complete.
This seems like a question for rasfw.
As far as thinking about / discussing it, quite a bit. I've had the idea of
setting a story or two in the Long Dim Afternoon for a while, but I have
some trouble soming up with something really good (and within my skill to
write effectively) that can't be put closer in time. It's just Way Too Big
and Far Away to completely wrap your mind around. Or my mind, anyway.

&quot;Our Galaxy is now in the brief springtime of its life - a springtime
made glorious by such brilliant blue-white stars as Vega and Sirius,
and, on a more humble scale, our own Sun. Not until all these have
flamed through their incandescent youth, in a few fleeting billions of
years, will the real history of the universe begin.

It will be a history illuminated only by the reds and infrareds of
dully glowing stars that would be almost invisible to our eyes; yet
the somber hues of that all-but-eternal universe may be full of color
and beauty to whatever strange beings have adapted to it. They will
know that before them lie, not the millions of years in which we
measure the eras of geology, nor the billions of years which span the
past lives of the stars, but years to be counted literally in
trillions.

They will have time enough, in those endless aeons, to attempt all
things, and to gather all knowledge. They will not be like gods,
because no gods imagined by our minds have ever possessed the powers
they will command. But for all that, they may envy us, basking in the
bright afterglow of Creation; for we knew the universe when it was
young.&quot;

The afternoon may be even longer than you think, as the red dwarfs
will evolve into blue dwarfs, see:

M dwarfs: planet formation and long term evolution
F. C. Adams *, P. Bodenheimer 2, G. Laughlin 2
( http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112210517/
ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0)

Abstract
The first part of this paper discusses how planet formation proceeds
in the disks orbiting M dwarf stars. These environments are different
from those associated with solar-type stars in several ways: The
planet forming clock (set by orbits) runs slower, the disks are more
prone to evaporation, the supply of raw material is lower, the
snowline is closer in, and planetary systems are more easily
disrupted. Because of these considerations, red dwarfs are less likely
to harbor giant planets, but can readily produce smaller planets. The
second part of this paper describes stellar evolution calculations for
M dwarfs, which live far longer than the current age of the universe.
These diminutive stellar objects remain convective over most of their
lives, continue to burn hydrogen for trillions of years, and do not
experience red giant phases in their old age. Instead, red dwarfs turn
into blue dwarfs and finally white dwarfs. This work also shows (in
part) why larger stars become red giants.

&quot;Will&quot;?  You sure like to read certainty into individual papers.  This
is a new theory that the astrophysical community hasn't settled on, and
is untestable at this point anyway, since there won't be any exhausted
red dwarfs for trillions of years.

Two other thoughts occur.

One, it'll be a universe of dark skies.  Every star we see in the sky
is either a giant or, if a dwarf, early K or hotter.  Not a single red
dwarf is naked-eye visible.  Even eyes that see in infrared wouldn't
see red dwarves unless they were quite close -- less than a light year
away.  And the Milky Way itself would be invisible.  Dark skies.

Two, the radioactive elements that heat the interior of Earthlike
planets will have long since been exhausted, and there'll be no
supernovas to forge new ones.  So, planets may exist, but they won't
have volcanoes or plate tectonics.

What else?

To pick some nits:

(1)  There are plenty of long lived radioisotopes with halflives much
longer than those of the uranium, thorium, and potassium isotopes
that provide the bulk of Earth's heating.  Granted, these will likely
not provide enough heating to drive plate tectonics, at least on
a planet similar to Earth.  However, one can imagine systems where
the heating is provided gravitationally, for example by tidal heating
of a earth-sized moon around a gas giant orbiting close to a small star.

(2) Type-I supernovas will continue long into the future.  These occur
when a white dwarf accretes enough matter to drive it over the
limit at which it collapses.  Such events will continue to occur
as binary star systems that contain one or two such stars
have their orbits decay by emission of gravitational radiation.

(3) The significant isotope potassium-40 is not produced by
the R-process in core implosion supernovas, but by the S-process.
I imagine it would also be produced to some extent in type-I
SNs.

I like the term, but note that there was a significant period of time
during that &quot;era&quot; where there were no stars.

Where did you get the figure for how much time is left for new star
formation?  That sounds a bit short, though I don't have any hard
figures in front of me.

The usual spelling in astronomy is &quot;dwarfs,&quot; not &quot;dwarves,&quot; by the way.

Not that I'm aware of.

When I first read &quot;Time Without End,&quot; I thought about a far, far, _far_
future story about an entity composed of positronium atoms, itself
vastly larger than our current observable Universe, in a near-heat death
universe, essentially collecting and trading information with other such
informations about a running history of all the previous galaxies and
stars and worlds and civilizations that had existed in the Universe
during more exciting times.  Unfortunately, there's not much in the way
of plot to move around in there; it'd just be a storyteller reminiscing
about more exciting times.

A possible issue would be that, with the lack of new worlds to live on,
civilizations that rise and fall would have be rebuild on the ruins of
the older civilizations.  If this happens over trillions of years, one
may end up with situations where later civilizations -- especially when
they've been reborn on the ashes of countless past ones -- could make it
hard for later civilizations to be as productive as the previous ones.

It might be a case where you end up with mostly primitive civilizations
in a very, very dark universe.  Early theology would certainly be
changed by the suddenly simple sky to view.

There's also the notion that Elder Intelligences might prolong matters
by disassembling stars into objects too light to support fusion, then
reassemble them when the stars they're currently using burn out. Or,
Vingean fashion, surround present-day stars with solar panels that
would power antimatter factories as another way of saving up fuel for
the dark times.  In the end, though and of course, the cold and the
dark win.

True. For an observer in starfield like the disc around Sun, red
dwarfs would be invisible.

But what about a globular cluster? Sun happens to be far from all of
them - the two brightest, Omega Centauri and 47 Tucanae are dim
nebulae. But what would a present day globular cluster look like for
an observer inside? No main sequence stars hotter than G. A scattering
of red giants being the brightest. An even thinner scattering of new
planetary nebulae and Type I supernova remnants.

How numerous, in current globular clusters, are yellow, orange, red
and brown dwarfs? How much of the total mass is taken up by each? How
much of total luminosity?

In older globular clusters, yellow dwarfs would be gone. Red dwarfs
would remain. And remember that  globular clusters evaporate slowly -
the remaining stars would move even closer together. So, the red
dwarfs would be so near that they might still be visible.

Also, there are the core nd bulge of Milky Way, which even now is a
dense concentration of old stars and would get denser yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And the Milky Way itself would be invisible.

Disc, yes. But the black gas and dust clouds in Milky Way plane would
clear away, allowing better view of the dense and bright concentration
oforange and red dwarfs in the centre.

And on the gripping hand, there's the notion that really proper Elder
Intelligences ought to be able to make a new universe from scratch. Or, at
the very least, escape to another universe entirely without wasting its
energy trying to revive this one*, leaving the rest of us to wonder where
they mysteriously dissapeared to.

Dimmest.

Seriously.

61 Cygni is magnitude 5,21, absolute magnitude 7,49.

Next brighter star, Epsilon Indi, is magnitude 4,69, absolute
magnitude 6,89. Definitely brighter.

Next dimmer stars are Groombridge 1618, magnitude 6,59, absolute
magnitude 8,16, and the brightest red dwarf the M0 Lacaille 8760,

Yeah, but if R. Caldwell's hypothesis is right we don't get
that far as the expanding Universe has ripped everything apart
in 20 billion years or so and then it's every atom for itself,
literally. :-)

Of course, 1 billion years before that we get to have our own
private Milkyway universe since light from other galaxies can
no longer reach us. Until after a while gravity can not hold
our galaxy together any more after which things start getting
more interesting.

The Big Rip promises a much more dramatic end to our story
than some lousy heat death. :-)

&gt; So the universe is currently ~14 billion years old.  Our galaxy has
&gt; been forging new stars continuously for most of that period, but the
&gt; current estimate is that there's only enough interstellar gas left for
&gt; another ~~10 billion years of star formation.  Let's be conservative
&gt; and double that.  This is the Stelliferous Era: the first 30-35
&gt; billion years of the universe.

&gt; Once star formation stops, the stars will start going out -- biggest
&gt; and brightest first, then gradually working down the main sequence.
&gt; So, ~5 billion years after the end of the Stelliferous Era, there
&gt; won't be any F or hotter stars left.  By ~~50 billion years after, the
&gt; last yellow dwarf will be winking out.  Call this the Reddening Era.
&gt; By the time the universe is ~~100 billion years old, all the bright
&gt; stars are gone.  What's left: red and orange dwarves and stellar
&gt; remnants.

&gt; We now enter onto the long, calm middle age of the universe.  Because
&gt; of convection, small stars live /much/ longer than big ones.  The
&gt; smallest red dwarves may last several trillion years.  So, the Red
&gt; Dwarf Era may last from around 100 billion AD to, let's say, 5
&gt; trillion.  In a sense, the first 100 billion years of the universe is
&gt; just a bright, energetic prologue, barely a fiftieth as long as the
&gt; next chapter.

&gt; This is an era in which not much happens, but that's not necessarily
&gt; bad.  The universe continues to expand, and distant galaxies and
&gt; quasars may gradually wink out of existence for us, but the Milky Way
&gt; should be stable over this time scale.  Eventually, dynamic relaxation
&gt; will cause most of the Milky Way to disintegrate into interstellar
&gt; space, while the rest will get eaten by the black hole at the center,
&gt; but that's going to take a few orders of magnitude more --
&gt; quadrillions or quintillions of years, not trillions.

&gt; This is a universe that's still reasonably hospitable to Life As We
&gt; Know It.  Chemical-based life should still be possible.  Red dwarves
&gt; aren't bright, but even a little star produces plenty of energy, so
&gt; there's plenty of power to support advanced civilizations doing
&gt; interesting things.  The Red Dwarf Milky Way could still include
&gt; billions of worlds of sunlight -- okay, red sunlight -- breathable
&gt; air, and running water, supporting species or cultures that think in
&gt; time scales of billions or tens of billions of years.  It could be the
&gt; long red afternoon of life in the universe.

&gt; Of course, everything comes to an end, and eventually even the dimmest
&gt; red dwarf will wink out.

&gt; Still... this seems like a potentially interesting setting.  Has
&gt; anyone ever done anything with it?

The nearest I've ever read has been Olaf Stapledon's &quot;Star Maker&quot;, which
postulates a universe of Dyson Environments and later, the population of
the dead stars (white dwarfs) themselves, living on the barest minimum of
energy possible ... but since Star Maker isn't a novel per se, being
instead a protracted meditation on the purpose of life from a devout
agnostic's POV, I suppose it doesn't count.

Some of Stephen Baxter's Phase Space series - included in the book &quot;Time&quot;
and &quot;Phase Space&quot; - does deal with Deep Time.

Most of the other fin de universe novels and shorter fiction  I've read are
set Earth's eveningtide, which is still part of the bright morning of the
universe.

This part depends on the origin of internal heat.

Uranium and thorium become exhausted at a known timescale, and the
longer-lived isotopes like rhenium and rubidium do not have much

Consider the upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere.  That air has
a certain temperature; the molecules in it are moving at a variety
of speeds, with the average determined by the temperature, but there
is no upper limit.
(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzman_distribution )
Some miniscule fraction of those molecules will be travelling at speeds
greater than escape velocity.  Half of them will be travelling in a
direction away from the Earth rather than towards it.  These molecules
will either escape, or collide with another molecule--in which case,
do the whole exercise over again.  The result is a very very slow loss
of gas molecules.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Mars has lost most air and perhaps some water. Venus has lost all
&gt;water and not much air. How much is Earth losing? Can a habitable
&gt;planet keep air and water for really long timescales?
">

The lighter the gas molecule, the more likely it is to escape.  Earth
probably lost a lot of free hydrogen before it had an oxidizing atmosphere.
Helium is scarce for this reason; every alpha decay that has ever occured
on Earth has produced a helium atom, but none of them stick around very
long once released into the atmosphere.  A water molecule is much lighter
than a molecule of Oxygen, Nitrogen, or Carbon Dioxide.  Plus, if a water
molecule is temporarily broken up--at room temperature, some fraction of
water molecules will be separated into H+ and OH- ions--there is a chance
for the hydrogen atom to escape.  So, water goes away faster than other
gasses we consider air.  The larger the planet's escape velocity, the
harder it is for gasses to escape, and the cooler the planet's atmosphere
the fewer gas molecules will be moving at escape velocity--that is why
Earth has retained more volatiles than Mars and more water than Venus.
However, even in the case of Earth, gasses are constantly being added to
the atmosphere via geological activity, and constantly escapes into space.
The Earth has had more atmosphere at times in the past than it does now.
Dragonflies with 36&quot; wingspans could fly thanks to the greater air denisty,
and three foot long millipedes needed the higher oxygen concentration.

Tidal heating comes from the rotational and/or orbital kinetic energy
of the planet.  Most writers assume that planets of red dwarves will
be tidally locked from the get-go, probably because they have to be

energy from orbital motion doesn't sound compatible with long term

Doesn't seem very likely, as any system that can release energy through
tidal flexing will by its very nature be getting that energy from the
differential rotation of the planet around its star, resulting in its
rotation slowly coming to rest relative to the star.  Especially if
you're talking about a far-far-future story, all these sources of energy
will have long been exhausted and the particular planets will be
one-face to their star.  At that point you can't play anymore tidal games.

While that's true for the vast vast majority of solid bodies at that
point in time, there's nothing to say you can't have a &quot;cold start&quot; of
tidal effects very late in the game... it's just less and less likely
over time. As an exmaple, picture a moon in a distant retrograde orbit
around a planet, or a moon in a prograde orbit around a planet close
to the star. Over time those orbits will change, but sloooowly... in
the first case, body tides will walk the moon in towards the parent
planet, while in the second tides induced by the star on the planet
will start to walk the tidally-locked moon back toward the planet. In
either case, that means the moon's period will be changing, and if
that period comes into resonance with a second (or third) moon in the
system, you can evolve a system into an Io-like situation late in
life.

Likely? No, not in the least. But like blue stragglers, anything that
can happen, will, given enough time... and for this setting, the one
thing you have plenty of is time.

While I agree that this can happen in principle, I'm not sure I see it
is critical in practice except for rather small planets. From the
standpoint of water vapor, for instance, the exosphere temperature is
really not an isue at all - it's the temperature in the tropopause
that's important (if the vapor pressure of H2O is too low at the
tropopause, you can get it high enough in the atmosphere to
photoionize in UV and loose it via Jeans escape at the exosphere).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The problem with a simple Jeans escape solution here is the long
timescales... very long timescales, for a slight change in the escape
velocity / RMS velocity ratio. For Vesc/Vrms = 5, you've got roughly
10's of millions of years of atmosphere. For Vesc/Vrms = 6, that jumps
to billions, and for Vesc/Vrms = 7 or greater, the atmosphere will
last longer than even the red dwarf. Assuming pure Jeans escape,
anyway.

Evidence for this? Yes, I've seen some very old books based on this
thesis, and I've not been impressed, nor have I seen anything recent.
A dragonfly with a 36&quot; wingspan doesn't need higher-density air for
support (that's what the very large wings would be for), although it
very well may have needed a different way of moving them, and oxygen
supply may have been different... but that doesn't require a dense
atmophere. And there's some reasonable geochemical evidence that
simply says it's not so (oxidation state of the oceans, for instance,
not to mention mass balance). I need to look up the nitrogen ratios
for Mars again...

I guess I was looking at this from the standpoint of having a
habitable world, period... or more specificly, a habitable moon of a

of &quot;things written about&quot;, I'm not sure this is too much of a stretch.

OK, I can understand that. I thought we were heading towards a rather
marginal theory of some biophysicists that things like the Earth's
gravity had been significantly less in the distant past [1]. I agree
you can have variations on the order of 10%... but biologically that's
pretty trivial, as I can get that here on Earth, right now, just by
climbing a mountain (or at one time, descending into the
Mediterrainian basib during the salinity crisis).

Perhaps, except that most of them (not all of them) were aquatic.

You'd probably run better without getting out of breath. 30% O2 at a
little over 1.5 Atm is something humans can tolerate (and enjoy)
probably indefinately. You start having toxicity issues around a pO2
of 500 mb or so, and clinically 400 mb is considered safe
indefinately.

[1] Pennycuick, &quot;Newton Rules Biology&quot;, is an excellent, and tiny (108
pages including the references) biophysics book published in 1992.
It's a great intro to the subject, second perhaps to Vogel's book
&quot;Life's Devices&quot;, but more technical. However, he does assume that
since current biological theory implies a lower surface gravity for
Earth, everybody else (other biologists, geologist, etc.) must be
wrong.

Oh, I see.  I was thinking you were referring to interaction evolutions
that led to the release of usable tidal energy for the inhabitants of
some planetary civilization already in prolonged habitable zone (e.g.,
of a red dwarf).  In that case, it would be very rare, and also highly
detrimental to the civilizations involved.

After all, we were talking about tidal influences resulting in the
planets being stirred up with volcanism, plate tectonics, etc.,
regardless of whether the planet was actually in a habitable zone.

That's because of tidal interactions with the other large Galilean
moons, not from interactions with Jupiter.

And the energy for that tidal flexing has to come from somewhere --
again, the orbital energy of the objects themselves.  Over long enough
timescales, they'll rearrange into the lowest possible energy
configurations, where tidal interactions become minimized.

We've got a lot of time for both natural evolution and artificial

some form of coral-like organisms for rebuilding islands and continents

It occurs to me that perhaps an ocean world would be capable of
longer-term habitability than a silicate one, provided they can be made
habitable in the first place. Ocean currents would be driven directly by
sunlight and they can afford to lose a lot more hydrogen before it has a
significant effect.

I don't think that's the case. I asked about it with regard to the moons
of Jupiter once (Io and Europa at least get substantial internal heating
that way) and the answers I was given were:

The setup depends on having several large moons, so that each one's
orbit remains slightly noncircular due to disturbance by the others.

The energy comes not from the moon's potential energy but from Jupiter's
rotation; the moons actually move slowly outward in the process (same as
Earth's moon does).

It strikes me as intuitively plausible that a similar process could
operate with two or more planets close to a red dwarf, though I haven't
run the numbers.
