Most people don't know that there were actually 3 buildings which came
crashing down on the day of 9/11.

The third building, WTC 7, can be seen here

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7750532340306101329

There is no mention of this building in 911 Omission Report.

Can fire make a building come crashing down at free fall speed?

If you think it can, patent the idea and make billions in the
demolitions industry!

How do we know WTC 7 was demolished?

If WTC 7 collapsed in 6 seconds, and it takes 6 seconds to free fall
from the roof of WTC 7, then you got it - WTC 7 underwent a free fall.

This means as the each floor was falling straight to the ground it did
so without crashing into anything on the way. ONLY CONTROLLED
DEMOLITION CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT!

PROPOSITION 1:
It took a total of 6 seconds for the roof of WTC 7 to reach the
ground. This proposition is supported by the empirical,

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7750532340306101329
Collapse start time: 17 seconds
Collapse end time: 23 seconds
Total collapse time: 23-17 = 6 seconds

PROPOSITION 2:
A free fall from a height equal to the roof of WTC 7 would take 6
seconds. This proposition derives trivially through (Galilean)
kinematical considerations alone:

Displacement  = initial velocity * total time + 1/2 * acceleration *
total time^2

or

s = ut + 1/2at^2
where
s = 174 m (height of building)
u = 0 m/s (building was stationary prior to collapse)
a = 9.8 m/s^2  (since gravitational field strengh averages at
a constant)

Thus,
174 = 0 t + 1/2 9.8 t^2

Solving for t
t = sqrt( 2 * 174 / 9.8)
= 5.9590
~ 6 seconds

The reason we need to dismiss conspiracy theories of this sort is that
they are dependent upon an agency (in this case the Bush
administration) displaying remarkable discipline, secrecy &amp;
competence. The reality is that this administration has shown itself
to be spectacularly incompetent &amp; consistently failure-prone in every
undertaking it has applied itself to. How can one seriously believe
them to be able to accomplish any sort of minor task successfully,
much less something requiring as much skill as that necessary to
satisfy the demands of this fantasy 9/11 building theory?

when the Oklahoma Fed building came down workers/news found something
like 5 bombs  inside the building (while workers were trying to find
victims). It was big news for about a minute and huge conspiracy
theories came out through the internet.  It's pure speculation here
but i would not doubt that those bombs were built into the building in
case so that if some terrorist group moved in to take over the
building, there would be a sure way to protect what information was in
that building. If there were secrets in the building worth protecting,
what better way then to build in a self-destruct in case it was
needed?

I'd buy that theory long before one that says anyone from our own
government would purposefully kill someone from our own country for
little or now gain. That to me just doesn't make any since. If there
were money to be made then I'd buy into it but I can't see the money
trail.

I've had the fortune/misfortune to in close quarter with several high
ranking government people, aboard a sailboat for a good period of
time. I won't say who they were but the list included a Senator and a
Representative.  The one really huge thing I learned is that these
people have a job that puts them at the front edge of everything that
will happen in the future, business wise.   They are rich because they
see ALL the good ideas long before we know they are thoughts. They do
what they think will get them voted back in because they love being at
the front of it. That is how they get rich and not (or not often) by
being crooks. I'm not saying that some don't get real greedy but most
just don't need to do illegal stuff. They can become king rich just by
getting in on ground levels.

Having said that, I think that some would probably take a bribe at the
start when they needed some extra cash to take advantage of a good
deal....... they are just people. What would you do? (rhetorical
please)

As far as someone actually plotting to bring down huge buildings and
to kill that many people, ask  yourself why? If someone in our
government wanted to start a war for oil they could have done it a lot
easier by just letting a few freaks sneak by with machine-guns and
tear up a few sporting events, or better yet, find a few bombs in
schools without ever letting them go off, or taking out a few bridges
and then letting the food supply go desperately low before restoring
structure. You don't need to kill our economy, thousands of people and
some of the most expensive real-estate in the world while closing down
our entire stock market and mobilizing our entire military to do that.

I don't think the Bush administration had anything to do with any of
that. BUT if you were in the position to get rich while doing your
job, wouldn't you do that.... I think i would if I thought there was
no harm in it so why get mad because someone else was poised to do it.
Be jealous if you must but don't call it a conspiracy.

During live coverage of the aftermath on CNN, FBI agents appeared surprised
to find these bombs and made a point of holding them up for CNN cameramen
to capture on videotape. If they were known quantities designed by the
government for nefarious or clandestine purposes, FBI wouldn't have been
so eager to show them to the cameras.

I don't remember five. I remember definitely seeing three, and maybe four.

It hasn't been kept &quot;secret&quot;....  it's been censored from the media
by the War Powers.  The media is strictly censored during any
so-called 'time of war', and a massive propaganda campaign
of disinformation and censored information is also vital in *any*
so-called &quot;war&quot;.  Although we know there is really NO war, we
are living under the dictatorial conditions and results thereof.

In this case, we have to rely on the internet and on foreign sources,
sift through the intentional disinformation and kook sites, and search
for the science of the matter and balance the issues.  Once that
rather lengthy task is completed, it's rather difficult NOT to assess
that there are some *extremely* odd anomalies from that date.

Secrecy is NOT one of them.... these things have been out there
for one's consumption since the beginning of this charade, but one
has to meet two requisites:  1). Be willing to reasearch issues that
are unpleasant to admit;  2). Be willing to admit such atrocities could
actually occur.  If one doesn't meet those, they'll never know and do
not really care to know... thus life will one day catch them or their
children very much by surprise.

&quot;America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and
disinformed by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I
wouldn't even say corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that
the government doesn't want us to know.&quot;
-- Gore Vidal

&quot;A society whose citizens refuse to see and investigate the
facts, who refuse to believe that their government and their
media will routinely lie to them and fabricate a reality
contrary to verifiable facts, is a society that chooses and
deserves the Police State Dictatorship it's going to get.&quot;
-- Ian Williams Goddard

&quot;The biggest political joke in America is that we have a liberal press.
It's a joke taken seriously by a surprisingly large number of people...
The myth of the liberal press has served as a political weapon for
conservative and right-wing forces eager to discourage critical coverage
of government and corporate power ... Americans now have the worst
of both worlds: a press that, at best, parrots the pronouncements of the
powerful and, at worst, encourages people to be stupid with pseudo-news
that illuminates nothing but the bottom line.&quot;

I'm not willing to believe that Bush, Cheney et al plotted the 9/11 attacks.
It would require a huge, huge number of people, and all of them would have
to remain silent. Conspiracies that big don't work; someone always decides
to fink. The only conspiracies that work are small ones, say half a dozen
people at the outside. Even the 9/11 conspiracy almost blew, and if the FBI
had reacted properly to the Moussaoui arrest it would have blown.

What I *could* believe, if evidence in that direction showed up, is that the
administration received vague hints that something was coming, maybe
involving a plane hijacking, and cynically decided to let it happen in order
to grab the powers they have in fact grabbed since 9/11. *If* this was the
case, they probably figured on somebody hijacking a plane and holding the
passengers for ransom, after which we'd make a big show of refusing to
negotiate with the terrorists, then storm the plane a la Entebbe and come
off as heroes...while still ramming the Patriot Act through. Not exactly
unprecedented; Lyndon Johnson pulled something pretty similar with the Gulf
of Tonkin incident in 1964.

Peace,
Paul

It would have been more accurate to say &quot;There is no mention of this
building's destruction / collapse&quot;, but the original poster's point is
still valid.  The only references to 7 are always in connection with
the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) facility that was housed
there.

Quoting below from the Report,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;7 WTC, 284
">

&quot;The OEM's headquarters was located at 7 WTC. Some questioned locating
it both so close to a previous terrorist target and on the 23rd floor
of a building (difficult to access should elevators become
inoperable). There was no backup site.&quot;

(p. 284 also has an overhead drawing of the WTC buildings, which does
include 7).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  evacuation of, 305
">

&quot;After the South Tower was hit, OEM senior leadership decided to
remain in its 'bunker' and continue conducting operations, even though
all civilians had been evacuated from 7 WTC.  At approximately 9:30, a
senior OEM official ordered the evacuation of the fac ility, after a
Secret Service agent in 7 WTC advised him that additional commercial
planes were not accounted for.  Prior to its evacuation, no outside
agency liaisons had reached OEM. OEM field resp onders were stationed
in each tower's lobby, at the FDNY overall command post, and, at least
for some period of time, at the NYPD command post at Church and
Vesey.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  OEM headquarters in, 284, 293
">

(p. 284 - see above)

p. 293:

&quot;OEM Initial Response

By 8:48, officials in OEM headquarters on the 23rd floor of 7 WTC--
just to the north of the North Tower-- began to activate the Emergency
Operations Center by calling such agencies as the FDNY, NYPD,
Department of Health, and the Greater Hospital Association and
instructing them to send their designated representatives to the OEM.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; lets not show our bias too much here - there isn't an admin. in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; world
&gt;&gt;&gt; under the kind of media scrutiny that ours are under that could possibly
&gt;&gt;&gt; keep something like this a secret - regardless of party affiliation or
&gt;&gt;&gt; competency.

&gt;&gt; It hasn't been kept &quot;secret&quot;....  it's been censored from the media
&gt;&gt; by the War Powers.  The media is strictly censored during any
&gt;&gt; so-called 'time of war', and a massive propaganda campaign
&gt;&gt; of disinformation and censored information is also vital in *any*
&gt;&gt; so-called &quot;war&quot;.  Although we know there is really NO war, we
&gt;&gt; are living under the dictatorial conditions and results thereof.

&gt;&gt; In this case, we have to rely on the internet and on foreign sources,
&gt;&gt; sift through the intentional disinformation and kook sites, and search
&gt;&gt; for the science of the matter and balance the issues.  Once that
&gt;&gt; rather lengthy task is completed, it's rather difficult NOT to assess
&gt;&gt; that there are some *extremely* odd anomalies from that date.

&gt;&gt; Secrecy is NOT one of them.... these things have been out there
&gt;&gt; for one's consumption since the beginning of this charade, but one
&gt;&gt; has to meet two requisites:  1). Be willing to reasearch issues that
&gt;&gt; are unpleasant to admit;  2). Be willing to admit such atrocities could
&gt;&gt; actually occur.  If one doesn't meet those, they'll never know and do
&gt;&gt; not really care to know... thus life will one day catch them or their
&gt;&gt; children very much by surprise.

&gt;&gt;        &quot;America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and
&gt;&gt;        disinformed by their government. This is tragic but our media
&gt;&gt; is --  I
&gt;&gt;        wouldn't even say corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;        the government doesn't want us to know.&quot;
&gt;&gt;                                                -- Gore Vidal

&gt;&gt;        &quot;A society whose citizens refuse to see and investigate the
&gt;&gt;        facts, who refuse to believe that their government and their
&gt;&gt;        media will routinely lie to them and fabricate a reality
&gt;&gt;        contrary to verifiable facts, is a society that chooses and
&gt;&gt;        deserves the Police State Dictatorship it's going to get.&quot;
&gt;&gt;                                         -- Ian Williams Goddard

&gt;&gt;        &quot;The biggest political joke in America is that we have a liberal
&gt;&gt; press.
&gt;&gt;        It's a joke taken seriously by a surprisingly large number of
&gt;&gt; people...
&gt;&gt;        The myth of the liberal press has served as a political weapon for
&gt;&gt;        conservative and right-wing forces eager to discourage critical
&gt;&gt; coverage
&gt;&gt;        of government and corporate power ... Americans now have the worst
&gt;&gt;        of both worlds: a press that, at best, parrots the pronouncements
&gt;&gt; of the
&gt;&gt;        powerful and, at worst, encourages people to be stupid with
&gt;&gt; pseudo-news
&gt;&gt;        that illuminates nothing but the bottom line.&quot;
&gt;&gt;                                            -- Mark Hertzgaard

&gt;&gt;        &quot;It takes a lot of degeneration before a country falls into

One conspiracy theory I've seen since it happened suggests that there was
a LOT of evidence in the building that the FBI might have found embarrassing
if it ever got out. But I'm sticking to what I saw on CNN, live, just after

How true!

They start with the premise that there WAS a conspiracy, and then all their
&quot;theories&quot; follow from that premise.

What's even more interesting is trying to figure out WHY these people weave
these tall tales.  There must be a deep-seated human need to have simple,
understandable explanations for things.  Apparently, having someone to blame
calms down some deep-seated anxiety in them that can't live with knowing
that (a) shit happens, and (b) they are some really messed up people in the
world who believe it's their mission in life to kill other people for some
messed up conspiracy theory of their own (i.e., religion).

better. ALL politicians are smarter then anyone gives them credit. I
personally don't like any of them but I give them credit for being
smart. BTW, Bush in my oppinion is a lot smarter then either one of
us. I may not like what's going on but to say he's a moron is just
really lame. The man has more power then you could ever dream of,more
of everything then you could ever dream of for that matter and I'm not
picking on you. He's got it better then anyone reading this including
myself. (oh and 2 ivey leage degrees, fighter jets, - hell there are a
lot of things that shows he's smart)

Anyway, if you want to win a fight of any type, you should at least
face the war with enough thought and don't under estimate your foe.

I've no real opinion as__if this was an inside job___I could not be
that surprised. But I've heard the SEC was located in wtc7. Everything
involving current litigation against companies that had behaved like
Enron/World com was lost and no further attempt to reactivate those
legal proceedings have born any fruit. Makes you wonder.

My understanding on conspiracies is they are placed in the hope of
manipulating anyone who smells a rat where no rat should be. While
Bush and company are artful deceivers/dodgers we don't have the whole
truth. It won't be what we suspect___it will more than likely
disappoint.

Lies have to conform to possibilities to be believed. The truth does
not.

The thing is, knocking down the building is unlikely to *reliably*
destroy evidence. It doesn't even reliably kill people trapped in
the rubble! If there were things in that building that needed a

It helps if you have a complete crew standing by ready to finish the
demolition and immediately haul away and destroy all remnants.

I wonder how those two floors (out of 48) caught fire in Building 7, and then
amazingly caused it's complete and total, vertical collapse at 5:00 pm on
tha afternoon of  9/11 ?

Well I see why you think he's dumb. You're having a hard time keeping
up with what you said yourself!

Stick with me if you can. I am not defending the man. He is our
president and I support him the same as I did any other president. I
think they are all crooks or they would not be there in the first
place.

The ISSUE I was coming back on you for was that the man is not stupid.
You called him a moron. That is a person with an IQ of 70 or less.
That is simply not the case. He is smart. His record stands for him on
that. Clinton is smart. He's an attorney. Big freakin' deal if you
don't like them. That is more of a reason to admit they are smart and
start to get smarter!

The lamest thing you could do is to under estimate your opponent. You
worry me. Calling someone dumb when they are not is asking for a butt
whooping! the problem here is its asking my to get mine whooped along
with yours. If you don't like him then treat him as smart and do
something smarter that you think is right. Lay off the lame ass name
calling because it degrades you. If that is what your goal is then
fine but I would think there are better things to do if you believe in
a cause. If you are just talking through your ass like most people do
then its going to show in things like broken arguments and lack of
train of thought...... hmmmmm - Maybe you should go back and re-read
your posts.

This is simply not true. The structural architect of the WTC himself
has stated that the buildings behaved exactly as they were designed
to. They withstood fire at a given temperature exactly as they were
rated for, then they failed. The steel connections between the upright
structural members &amp; the floors were fire rated to last one hour at
the temperatures experienced by the burning jet fuel. They did, almost
to the minute. What was unforseeable is that no naturally occurring
fire in a building, i.e. one caused by accidental combustion of the
contents of the offices, could ever attain the temperature caused by
burning jet fuel. The components did exactly what was expected under
the circumstances &amp; failed in accordance with known structural
specifications. No mystery or conspiracy there.

It doesn't take much discipline to remain quiet if you receive threats on
