THE EXCELLENCE OF THE HOLY MONTH OF `RAMADHAN  &amp;  WHAT IS REAL
FAST /BENEFITS

Shaikh Sadooque relates from an authentic source that Imam Raza (A.S.)
related from his ancestors, who related it from Ameerul Momineen Ali
bin Abi Talib (A.S.) that latter said that one day, the Prophet of
Allah delIvered the following sermon to them:

'O' People! the Month of Allah (Ramazan has approached you with His
mercies and blessings. This is the month that is the best of all the
month in the estimation of Allah. Its days are best among the days;
its nights are best among the nights. Its hours are best among the
hours. This is a month in which you have been invited by Him. You have
been, in this month, selected as the recipients of the honours from
Allah, the Merciful.

In this holy month, when you breathe, it has the thawab (heavenly
reward) of'Tasbeeh) (The praise of Allah on rosary beeds), and your
sleep has the thawab of worship.

Your good deeds are accepted, in this month. So are your invocations.
Therefore, you must invoke your Lord in right earnest, with hearts
that are free from sins and evils, that Allah may bless you observe
fast, in this month, and to recite the Holy Quran.

Verily I the person, who may not receive the mercy and benevolence of
Allah in this month must be very very unfortunate having the end as
bad (in the Hereafter), While fasting, remember the hunger and thirst
of tomorrow in Qiyamat. Give alms to the poor and the needy, Pay
respects to your elders. Have pity on you youngers and be kind towards
your relatives and kinsmen. Guard your tongues against unworthy words,
and your eyes from such scenes that are not worth seeing (forbidden)
and your ears from such sounds that should no heard by you.

Be kind to orphans so that when your children become orphans they also
be treated with kindness. Do invoke that Allah may forgive your sins.
Do raiseyour hands at the time of Namaz (Prayers) as it is the best
time for asking His mefcy. When we invoke at such times, we are
answered by Him, when we call Him, He responds, and when we' ask for
anything it is accepted by Him.

O' People! you have made your conscience the slave of your desires,
make it free, by invoking Him for forgiveness Your back is breaking
under the heavy load of your sins, so prostrate before Him forlong
intervals and make it lighter.

Do understand it fully well that Allah has promised in the name of His
Majesty and Honour that He will not take to task such people who offer
Namaz in this month, and perform 'sajda' (prostration) and will guard
their bodies against the Fire of Hell, on the Day of Judgment.
O' People! if anybody amongst you arranges for the' Iftar' (food for
ending of fast at sunset) of any believer, then, Allah will give him
the reward as if he has set free a slave. He will forgive his minor
sins.

Then the companions of the Prophet (S.A.) submitted:&quot; But everybody
amongst us did not have the means to do so.&quot;
The Prophet told them: &quot;Keep yourself away from the fire of Hell, by
inviting for iftar, though it may consist of only half a date or
simply with water if you have nothing else. O' People! anybody who may
cultivate good manners, in this month will walk over the
'Sirat' (Bridge) in 'Qiyamat', though his feet may be shaking.

Anybody who make take light work from his servants. (Male or female),
in this month Allah will make easy his accounting on the Day of
Judgment.

Anybody who does not tease others, in this month, Allah will keep him
safe from His wrath in Qiyamat. Anybody, who respects and treats an
orphan with kindness in this month, Allah shall look at him with
dignity in Oiyamat. Anybody who treats well his kinsmen, in this
month, Allah will bestow His mercy on him in Qiyamat while anybody who
maltreats his kinsmen, in this month. Allah will keep him away from
His Mercy, in Qiyamat.

Whoever offers Sunnat (Recommended) prayers in this month Allah will
give him a certificate of freedom from Hell. Whosoever, offers one
'Wajib' Namaz in this month, for him the Angels will write the rewards
of 70 such prayers, that were offered by him in any other month.

Whosoever recites repeatedly 'Salaat-o-salaam' on me, Allah will keep
the scales of his deeds heavy, when in Qiyamat the scales of others
will be tending towards lightness, Whosoever recites, in this month,
only one 'ayat' (verse of the Holy Quran) he will be rewarded in a
manner as if he had recited the full Quran, in other months.

O' People! the Gates of Paradise remain opened in this month. Do
invoke that the gates may not be closed on you; while the Gates of the
Hell are closed, do invoke Allah that these gates may never be opened.

The Commander of the Faithful [ALl (A.S.)] said that he got up and
said, &quot;O' the Prophet of Allah (S.A.) What is the best deed in this
month?&quot; He (S.A.) replied,&quot; O' Abul Hasan! abstaining from the matters
forbidden by Allah, the Majestic, the Glorified, is the best deed in
this month. &quot;Then he (the Prophet) (S.A.) wept. Ali (A.S.) asked, &quot;O'
the Messenger of Allah! What makes you weep?&quot; He (S.A.) replied, &quot;O'
Ali (A.S.) I weep for what they will do with you in this month. As if
I am with you, and you are offering prayers to your Lord, when the
worst of the foregone, and those who are yet to come, a brother of the
person who slew the camel of Samood has come and gives you a (sword)
blow on your head, which reddens your beard.&quot; The Commander of the
Faithful said. Ali (A.S.) asked &quot;O' the Prophet of Allah, will that be
for the safety of my Faith&quot; He (S.A.) replied, &quot;Yes, it will be with
the safety of your Faith O' Ali (A.S.) whoever kills you has killed
me; whoever bears enmity to you is my enemy; whoever abuses you has
abused me; because, indeed you are to me like my own self; your soul
is from my soul; your nature is from my nature; Indeed Allah the
Holiest and the Greatest, created me and you too; He chose me and you
too; He selected me for Prophethood and selected you for Imamat;
whoever denies your Imamat, has denied my Prophethood. O' Ali (A.S.)
you are my successor, father of my children, my son-in-Iaw, and my
Khalifa over my (Ummat) people, both during my life and after my
death. Your order is my order, your 'No is my No.' I swear by Him who
made me the Prophet and made me the best of the people, indeed you are
the Proof of Allah for His creatures, His Trustee of His Secrets, and
the guardian of His slaves.
THE PHILOSOPHY OF FASTING IN THE MONTH OF RAMAZAN

Why Muslims follow a purely lunar calendar for fasting?

Normally the fast should not affect the daily avocations, and it
should not be a pretext for neglecting normal duties. Islam never
approves, much less demands, of keeping vigil during the whole night
and passing the following day in sleep and indolence. Fast means a
greater effort to perform all the usual duties and something else,
more prayers and more
charity, and all this in the absence of food and drink.
THE REASON WHY MUSLIMS FOLLOW A PURELY LUNAR CALENDAR IN THE MATTER OF
FASTING

Jews, Christians and Hindus have a solar year, either directly or a
lunar year with intercalation, so that the time of fasting always
falls in the same season. Muslims follow a purely lunar calendar, and
consequently their month of fasting. Ramazan. Rotates gradually in all
the seasons of the year.
SENSE OF FASTING (Spiritual aspects:)

Experience shows that a blind man has generally a stronger memory, and
certain of his senses are more developed them those of an ordinary man
who has sight. In other words, if certain faculties are not utilized.
They may strengthen some other faculties.
Similar is the relation between the body and the soul. In weakening
the body there is strengthening of the soul (spirit), even as the
pruning of the branches of a tree procures more flowers and more
fruit.

When an individual fasts, his conscience pricks him in the face of
evil deeds, and he is more able to resist temptations. Further, the
fast makes him think of God more, develops his inclination for
charity, makes him taste the sweetness of obedience to the Lord.
MATERIAL ASPECTS

Students learn for several months continuously, then they get a summer
vacation. Employees work for six days of the week, the seventh day
being a holiday for leisure and rest. Men expend mental and physical
energy the whole day, whereafter the repose of sleep renovates their
faculties for the next day. Even machines and tools require elaxation,
and we observe this for motor cars, aeroplanes, locomotives, etc, is
it, therefore, not reasonable to think that the stomach and the
digestive organs also require rest? In fact modern medicine has also
reached the same conclusion, and a large number of doctors in
Switzerland, Germany, etc., prescribe, for various chronic diseases,
forced hunger and thirst for longer or shorter periods according to
the exigencies of the sickness and the physical capacities of the sick
person.

They have also found that various glands secrete certain acids in the
stomach on account of hunger and thirst and that these acids kill many
a germ which produce different diseases. Statistics have also shown
that several digestive and other diseases are less abundant among
people who have the habit of fasting every year.

We know that man requires a change of climate, air and water from time
to time, Patients recovering from illness are sent away for
convalescence to a place other than their abitual living place. The
more fortunate among the Westerners pass a month of summer vacation
outside their home. In other words, it is necessary to change the
normal habits from time to time. This is also a kind of rest. We see,
for instance that cultivators use their fields alternately and give
'rest' to the soil. Continuity being harmful, Islam has forbidden
fasting during the whole year, even for those who want spiritual
benefits thereby. Experience has also shown that if one fasts forever,
it becomes a habit, and a second nature, and does not profit by it as
does he who fasts with intervals. In fact, if one fasts more than 40
days consecutively, it becomes a habit; and if one fasts for less than
a month it has not much effect.

To terminate this discussion, those who fast on medical prescription
or even under compulsion as a discipline, do get the material benefits
inherent in fasting; but there being no intention of a spiritual
search, they do not benefit thereby spirtually. Muslims fast with the
intention of complying with the command of Allah. They therefore have
its reward for their piety, while not losing the physical and
materials benefits of the fasting.

In short, from whichever point of view one may study the Muslim way of
fasting, it compares favourably with its counterparts in other
civilizations. In fact, if it is day in Switzerland it will be night
in America, and vice-versa. Every 1,000 miles East or West makes the
difference of about one hour.

The Prophet is reported to have said at breaking the fast: &quot;0' Allah
for You have I fasted, in you have I believed, and with You
nourishment do I break the fast. Accept it from me O' Lord!&quot;
THE FAST

Those people who have not a deep insight into human nature and do not
look at both the spiritual and material aspect often have the morbid
mental state to object to the injunctions of Religion. Among them are
those who pass taunting remarks against fasting. They say what sort of
worship is this to starve from morning till evening. If we think over
the philosophy of worship and understand in the light of the Quranic
verse that our existence is meant for worship and existence is based
on eating and drinking, therefore it also has a bearing on worship.
Then we shall realize that just as sometimes talking is worship and
some time keeping silence, in the same way some times eating will be
worship and some times abstaining from it. Both these aspects are some
times prescribed by the physical physician and some times by the
spiritual one, Accordingly Allah sent this message to us through the
spiritual Physician [Prophet Mohammad (S.A.)]

Fasting has been ordained to you as it was ordained to those before
you so that you guard yourself (against evil)

In this holy verse: -
(i) 'has been ordained' shows 'Fasting is incumbent'.
(ii) 'As it was ordained on those before you' indicates 'Fasting dates
back to the beginning of mankind'.
(iii) 'So that you may guard yourself against evil' means fasting will
make you pious.

Now if we consider over the different phases of piety, the advantages
of fasting will be clear. Man has three instincts:

(i) Quwwate Shahwania (Faculty of Lust) By this instinct a man
nourishes his body and produces children. If it exceeds its limit
concerning diet, it makes him greedy and gluttonous. It may make the
blood impure or a man may fall a permanent prey to dyspepsia and so
on. The excess of this very instinct in sexual sphere causes
many internal and external diseases which can not be enumerated here.

(ii) Quwwate Ghazabania (Faculty of a version and acquirement) : By
this a man seeks his advantages and wards off his disadvantages. If
this instinct is not kept within proper bounds, a man either becomes a
coward or quarrelsome. All these aspects are against 'piety' and to
end the obligation of fast with piety shows that the observer of fast
becomes pious, the natural conclusion of which is that his instincts
are moderate. Neither he is gluttonous nor quarrelsome. Accordingly
the Holy Prophet (S.A.) and the Infallible Imams (A.S.) have mentioned
these attributes of fasting.

The Holy Prophet (Mohammad) (S.A.)
The Commander of the Faithful [ALI (A.S.)] says that a party of the
Jews came to the Prophet (S.A.) The most learned among them put a few
questions.,one of which was: 'What is the good to your people in that
Allah has enjoined fast on them and that, too only for thirty days
(excluding nights) whereas the other people had to fast for more than
thirty days?'
The Prophet (S.A.) replied:-&quot;When Adam ate of that tree the fruit
remained ill his stomach for thirty days. So Allah enjoined upon his
progeny to remain hungry and thirsty for that period, and the
permission to eat in the night is Allah's grace. Adam also had to fast
for so many days and Allah enjoined those fasts upon my people.&quot;

Then the Prophet (S.A.) recited this verse:-
Fasting has been ordained to you as it was ordained to those before
you so that you may guard yourself against evil (and that too) for
counted days'.
The Jew savant said, Mohammad, You are right. Now tell me what is the
reward for a person who observes those fasts.&quot; The Prophet replied: &quot;
Allah will characterise the believer who keeps the fasts in Ramzan to
please Allah, with seven traits:
(i) If he has partaken of the forbidden food, it will be excreted
after being digested.
(ii) He will not be deprived of the mercy of Allah.
(iii) He will share the compensation of his father's (Adam) fault,
(iv)Allah will grant him relief in his agony of death.
(v) The observer of fast will not feel hungry and thirsty On the Day
of Judgment.
(vi)Allah will grant him deliverance from Hell fire on the day of
Resurrection.
(vii) He will satisfy him with the sacred diet of Paradise.

Commander of the Faithful (ALI) (A.S.)
There is a sermon in Nahjul Balagha, in which the Commander of the
Faithful has stated a few symbols of the obligations of the Religion
of the Prophet (S.A.) Among them is this reason of the obligation of
fasting : &quot;Fasting was enjoined so that the sincerity of the righteous
may come to light.&quot;

It is known that the righteous believes:
(i) Allah is our Creator and Lord.
(ii) He is Just and Wise.
(iii) He governs both our body and soul.
(iv)Any worship prescribed by Him for the two (body and soul) will be
justified.

It is evident that if there were no physical worship the four
aforesaid articles of Faith would remain concealed and the righteous
and the evil doer would not be differentiated. Allah has provided an
opportunity for the manifestation of these beliefs by enjoining the
bodily worship. Therefore those who observe fast and offer prayers
thereby demonstrate their beliefs which are inner states and
invisible. Fasting thoroughly tries the righteous and shows that the
observer of fast is humble. It reminds him of the hunger and thirst of
the destitute and he deals with them according to the Religion of
Mohammad (S.A.)
If his soul is more purified, his vision reaches upto Day of
Resurrection and is imbibed with the idea of hunger and thirst on that
day Fasting, therefore, is all the more sweet to him because the
'Sharey' (exponent of the religion) has said that to be hungry and
thirsty here, by the Order of Allah will save a person from the hunger
and thirst on the Day of Judgment.

IMAM JA'FAR SADIQ (A.S.) THE TRUTHFUL

When asked by Hisham, son of Hakam, about the philosophy of fasting he
replied that Allah enjoined Fasting so that the rich and the poor may
be equal. The rich never experience hunger that they may show mercy to
the poor. The rich provide everything for themselves because of their
wealth. Allah desired that His servants may be equal on this occasion
and the rich may also feel hunger and suffer pain. He, therefore,
enjoined fasting that the rich may be kind to the destitute and
merciful to the hungry.

IMAM RAZA {A.S.)

Mohammad, son of Senan, narrates that Imam Raza {A.S.) gave this
reason for fasting that the observer of fast may feel the pain {pangs)
of hunger and thirst, and prove himself meek, humble, worthy of
reward, hopeful and patient before Allah, and this trouble here may
remind him of the hardships of the Hereafter. By getting rid of the
evil desires a man's self learns a lesson in this world and expects
the blessing of the Hereafter. The observer of fast sees through the
circumstances of the needy and the destitute in this world as well as
in the Hereafter. (The people who starve during (fast) will be rich in
the Hereafter and those who do not observe fast and enjoy riches in
the world, will face poverty in the Hereafter. The observer of fast
finds out this subtle point.

These sayings of the Ma'soomeen (the Infallible) elucidate that the
evil desires are crushed in fasting. The temper becomes moderate. It
makes the rich attend to the poor for whom the Fasting Month (Ramazan)
and the other months make no difference in starvation. The rich become
humane and extend their helping hands towards the needy and the
destitute.

In view of these sayings how ridiculous is the conduct of an observer
of fast to pick up a quarrel with anyone during fasting. In the heart
of his hearts he is angry with Allah that He ordered him to be hungry
and thirsty, But being helpless before Him he is ready to avenge on
His slaves.

Fasting, however, cures the stomach. All the ancient and modern
physicians hold that most diseases are caused by the upset stomach
which is cured by starvation. The religion of Allah has fixed one
month in a year for fasting if a man fasts regularly, his stomach
becomes healthy for the whole year. If so much starvation does not
suffice for some stomachs, mustahabbi (optional) fasts have been
suggested at different times in the whole year.

The very fact that fasting is incumbent during Ramazan indicates that
the conduct of men during this month should be different from that in
the rest of the year. During the eleven months a man is free to eat
and drink whenever he likes, whereas in the month of Ramzan he is
forbidden to do so in the day time. People tell lies, back-bite,
gamble and do similar things. Religion forbids those things but they
do not nullify any worship. But if these sins are committed, during
the day of Ramazan, to the extent prohibited in fasting, the fast will
be null. Similarly people quarrel all the year round, but it is
strictly forbidden in fasting and sometimes this conduct nullifies the
fast.

In view of these things it is evident that the observer of fast is to
be pious and is to abstain from these things strictly while fasting
because they are against piety, and if piety is nullified the fast
will be null and void. In the light of the Quranic verse and the
aforesaid savings of the Masoomeen (A.S.) (the Infallibles) &quot;a Muslim
as the opportunity to mend
his character, purify his soul, eradicate the defects of hls
temperament and attain the temperance which is desired by Islam and
which is responsible for both the spiritual and physical health of
mankind. The moderation of the Quwwate Shahwania and Quwwate
Ghazabania effect the spiritual power: Reason controls these powers
and makes them to do those things which please Allah and which the
Quranic Verse 'so that you may guard yourself against evil, implies.

A lot can be written on this topic but a thinking person can clearly
grasp the ways and means mentioned in this article. As thinking is a
human cha racteristic and it is treated as worship, so the other
aspects of this topic are left to the readers so that they may reap
the benefit of the worship of thinking as well.

Fasting by Sayed Saeed Akhtar Rizvi
Real Fast
(&quot;O ye who believe&quot; Fasting is prescribed to you.....that ye may (learn)
self-restraint.............&quot;Qur'an; chapter-2:verse 183)
THE COMMAND for fasting in Ramadhan came in the first year of the
Hijra. The Holy Prophet delivered a lecture on the last Friday of the
preceding month, Sha'ban, in which he said:-&quot;O people! You are now
under the shadow of the month which has a night (Night of Qadr) which
is better than thousand months. It is the month of Ramadhan in which
fasting has been made compulsory by God. It is the month of patience;
and the reward of patience is paradise. It is the month of mutual
sympathy.

&quot;Whoever feeds a fasting brother at the time of breaking the
fast God will be as much pleased with him as though he would have
emancipated a slave, and it means that his sins of past would be
forgiven&quot;.

Somebody pleaded that not everybody was affluent enough to feed
others. The Holy Prophet said: &quot;Allah is generous enough to be pleased
with you even if you break the fast of Muslim brother with a morsel of
date or a cup of water if it is the only thing which you can offer&quot;.
God does not see the wealth offered but it is the feeling of the heart
only which counts. Then the Holy Prophet proceeded to say: &quot;Anybody
who makes the burden of his servants lighter in this month Allah will
make his sins lighter for him on the Day of Judgment&quot;.
The word 'Ramadhan' is derived from the root 'R-M-Dh', which indicate
'Heat' and 'Restlessness' . It is said that the name of the month
indicates the hardships which accompany a fast like thirst and a
comparative restlessness.
But the best explanation was given by the Holy Prophet himself, who
was the final authority on every thing. He said: &quot;Ramadhan burns the
sins and faults as fire burns the wood&quot;.
Imam Muhammad al-Baquir told one of his companions:

&quot;O Jabir! Whoever, during Ramadhan, fasts in days, stands for
prayers in parts of nights, controls his sexual desires and emotions,
puts rein on his tongue, keeps his eyes down, and does not injure the
feelings of others, will become as free from sin as he was the day he
was born&quot;. Jabir said: &quot;How tough are these conditions!&quot;

Fruit of Fasting

Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.The month of Ramadhan is the month of
God, (bringing) His blessing, mercy and forgiveness&quot;.

THE month of Ramadhan gives us a chance to start life afresh. Muslims
should make resolutions during this month, to act upon during the
year. This is the month when emotions remain under the control of
reason. Thoughts, in this month are not wild, feelings not hard.
Forgiveness, generosity and love of God through the love of His
creatures are infused in our soul. Naturally, it is the best time to
decide how are we going to live in the coming year. We should know
what do we want to achieve and how.
Why not start making your programme just now? And when you have
completed the list of your ambitions, here is a simple test to see how
much have you benefited from fasts of Ramadhan.
Do your resolutions include such items as helping the needy (not by
just handing out a few shillings, but by helping him to stand on his
own Legs)? Have you thought of showing more respect to the elders,
loving more tenderly those who are younger? Is there anything
concerning your neighbours and friends? Have you any inclination to
forgive your enemies? Have you resolved to live more honestly and more
sincerely? And above all, is there any room for God and His Prophet in
your thoughts and programmes?
If the answer is 'Yes', accept my congratulations; you are a real
Muslim; you know the meaning of the fast of Ramadhan.
If on the other hand, the answer is in negative, there is some need of
improvement in your faith. And if you really want your faith to be
more perfect time is never lost. Though the month of Ramadhan is
coming to its end very soon, you may still take its advantage. There
is no need to feel sorry for yourself. If you really want the love of
God it is yours for asking. It is the easiest goal to reach and the
most difficult. It all depends, not so much on the path, as on the
traveler. If your heart is pure, it is the easiest thing in the world,
if you want to put the love of God in a corrupted heart, it is just
impossible.
As is clear from the tradition of the Holy Prophet quoted above, this
month is the month of blessing, month of mercy and month of
forgiveness. If anybody wants these benefits, he should strive for it,
with more zeal and more sincerity in the remaining few days of this
holy month. If we spend our time in remembering God, praying for His
love, repenting for our sins, we can be sure that God will bless us
with His love and His mercy.
Spirit of Fast

&quot;O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you....... That ye may
(learn) self-restraint........Qur'an, 2:183

FAST like living things, has a body and a soul. The required
abstinence from food, water, sexual relations etc. Is the body of the
fast: &quot;piety&quot; is its soul. If we are not striving to refine our
character by fast, our will be a body without soul. Fast cleans our
body from impurities. Likewise, it must purify our hearts and minds
from all impure thoughts improper desires and undisciplined
sensations.
The Holy Prophet saw a woman, who was fasting on that day (not in
Ramadhan), abusing her girl-servant. The Prophet admonished her and
told her to break her fast. The woman protested: &quot;But I am fasting
today&quot;. The Holy Prophet said: &quot;But was not your fast broken by the
abuses you were hurling upon that poor girl?&quot;:

Imam Ja'far-e-Sadiq has said Your fast day should not be like
other ordinary days. When you fast, all your sense - eyes, ears,
tongue, hands and feet - must fast with you.&quot; How?

Eyes: Keep your eyes off unlawful things and objects; spend this most
precious gift of God in good cause and pious acts and read Qur'an and
Do'as.
Ears: Abstain from hearing unlawful gossip, lies, false statements,
music and obscene topics. Pay your attention towards sermons and
topics of learning etc.
Tongue: Do not tell lies or useless tales; do not spread rumours or,
damaging gossips about other persons; keep aloof from falsity. Use the
power of speech in spreading the word of God; in creating goodwill in
the society.
Hand: Do not inflict injury upon others by your actions; instead
strive to help them as far as you can.
Feet: Do not go towards forbidden places, like bars and cinemas. Do
not run between people creating a strife. Go towards those places,
where God is remembered; and your movements should be to bring people
together.
And above all, your heart and mind must be with you in fasting.
Because fast in its real sense, will not be complete unless your
thoughts, your emotions, your actions - in short, all aspects of our
life - become pure, clean and free from blemish.
Purpose of Fasting
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a. The month of Ramadhan) is the month of
repentance, month of forgiveness, month of reward:
The month of Ramadhan is called the &quot;month of God&quot; It strengthens the
relation between a man and his Creator. Think of a person abstaining
from necessities of life, like food and water (to say nothing of other
pleasures) 16 hours a day, for one month at a stretch; think again
that he does so not because of any external pressure, but by his own
free will; and remember that he expects no worldly reward and that his
only wish in fasting is to be nearer to Allah - and then you may
appreciate how strong is the relation between a Muslim and his Lord.
By fasting, a Muslim subjugates his worldly desires and strengthens
his spiritual powers. He learns a lesson most relevant to his
spiritual well-being; he comes to realize that nothing (not even his
body and soul) is his own. After this realization, he can appreciate
the freedom given to him by God in almost all walks of life during the
past eleven months.
He will know that he can never claim of that freedom of action as a
matter of right. It is just a grace of God for which he should ever
remain thankful to Him.
That appreciation will lead to gratitude, and that gratitude will show
itself in his behaviour and deeds all his life, making him a
trustworthy friend and a lovable companion.
As the month of Ramadhan prepares a Muslim to become a perfect man, it
is called &quot;the shield against the Hell&quot;. Also, the Holy Prophet said:
&quot;God says that fast is for me only and I Myself will give its reward&quot;.
Sincere Repentance
O ye who believe, turn to Allah with sincere repentance, in the hope
that your Lord will remove from you your sins and admit you to the
Heavens .........Qur'an, 66 : 8.THIS HOLY month of Ramadhan is generally
referred to as the month of Tauba' (repentance) . Repentance is the
best way to the Grace of Allah for a person who has sinned. Allah is
His infinite grace, forgives sins if the sinner repents sincerely. The
operative word is 'sincerely'.
To describe 'sincere repentance'. Imam Ja'fare Sadiq (A.S.)
said:&quot;Repenting and never committing that sin again&quot;
According to the 'Islamic belief, repentance uttered by tongue,
without a change of heart, is no repentance at all Repentance must
produce change in habit, honesty in dealings, fear and Love of Allah
in prayers, improvement in character, generosity in behaviour and
humility in nature.
Amir-ul-Mumeneen Ali (A.S.) described the characteristics of
repentance in the following word:

&quot;Repentance has six elements: A repentant must be really sorry
for what he had done: he must have firm determination not to do it
again; he must make amends for whatever wrongs he did to others; he
must fulfill all the obligations of religion which he had neglected
previously; he should fast long enough to melt away the flesh grown
from unclean and unlawful food; and he should feel the taste of
obedience to God, as he was previously enjoying the taste of sin&quot;.

When a man repents sincerely Allah makes him as clean as he was on the
day he was born. The Holy Prophet (S.A.) has said: &quot;One who repents
from sin is like the one who never committed any sin&quot;.
FASTING FOR FITNESS

Well-being: Aside from the spiritual value of fasting, there are
Physical rewards that come to you by your not eating for a short time.
These rewards are reaped not only by the over plump person, but by
anyone who fasts.
The general well-being of a person on a fast has been noted by
physicians. Many a doctor advises fasting for a patient tussling with
gout, heart disease, skin disorder, general intemperance to food and
drink, or excessive smoking.

Brain Benefit: Fasting is good for mental discipline, and it effects
spiritual uplift. The brain benefits greatly. If you are doing heavy
study, preparing for a speech, or otherwise engaging in deep
concentration, you do well to fast, Fasting sharpens your mind and
makes you alert and sensitive to mental effort. You concentrate more
readily if your stomach is empty and not drawing blood from the brain
to digest food.
Many a public speaker knows well that eating before speaking reduces
mental acuity and cuts down on the force of speech. They fast before
an important speech and eat later. They know the brain benefits by a
fast.

Digestive Distress Relieved: Other organs that are relieved by a fast
are the digestive organs. The stomach, liver pancreas, and intestines
often are overworked. When the digestion is given a vacation, eating
becomes a greater joy.

Rejuvenator and Skin Freshener: Fasting has been called a great
restorer of youth and prolonger of like. This idea stems from the fact
that people who fast acquire a clearer skin, a rosier tint to their
cheeks, and a more youthful complexion than they had before.

People troubled with skin disorders such as psoriasis, acne, or
recurrent skin infection are often advised by their physicians to
eliminate sweets and fats from their diet. How much better to
eliminate all foods for a time periodically, and let the skin pores
have a chance to cleans themselves and be free from the effects of too
many sweets and fats.

Boon to Smokers: For anyone trying to stop smoking or drinking, a fast
can be a boon to the body. By stopping tobacco, alcohol, and food
intake for a time, a person helps the body return to normal.
Once the body is &quot;Scrubbed clean&quot; inside, the smoker and drinker feels
so alive and alert that he does not have any desire to return to his
unwise habits.
A more nearly normal appetite follows a fast, and simple foods are
enjoyed with greater relish. Heavy use of candiments-pepper, spices
mustard, and catsup, is no longer needed to make. Food appetizing.

Rests Hearts: If you are a heart patient you will find that a fast
takes a load off your heart and your circulation. If you have been
short of breath, a fast improves your breathing and, by elimination of
salt and water from the body, reduces tissue edema. This condition may
make it Possible for you to sleep easier and with fewer pillows.

Side Effects: Some minor discomforts are noted at time during fasting.
The person who fast may be subject to headaches; if so, he needs the
fast. Other side effects of fasting, such as a feeling of weakness,
palpitation of the heart, and drowsiness late in the afternoon,
usually minor, disappear with a little rest.
