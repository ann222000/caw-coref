Any recomms. for a consumer/prosumer level
video editor (NOT just a converter) that can handle
*.ASF files, and ulitmately burn them onto DVD,
maybe even in HD format? Thanks!

Go to the web sites for Adobe, Sony Vegas, Ulead and take a look at the
features of each and see if asf is an import format they support. Then
d/l a trial and test it for yourself.
