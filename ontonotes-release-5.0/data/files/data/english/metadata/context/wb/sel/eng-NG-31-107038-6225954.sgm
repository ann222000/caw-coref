INFORMED CONSENT
----------------

Introduction
------------

The doctrine of informed consent is concerned with the failure of
medical
practitioners to adequately advise patients of the risks surrounding
any
proposed medical treatment. Such a failure denies the patient the
opportunity to make an informed decision about whether or not to accept
the
treatment. In this respect the medical practitioner has breached a duty
of
reasonable care owed to the patient and can, at common law, be made
liable
for damages suffered by the patient as a result of not properly
advising the
patient about the risks involved in the medical treatment that was
carried
out. This liability can arise even if at all relevant times during the
actual medical treatment the procedure involved no negligence on the
part of
the practitioner. Therefore, informed consent is really concerned with
the
adequacy of pre-treatment disclosure made to the patient of known
risks, or
risks that ought to have been known, by the doctor and that can
eventuate as
a result of the treatment.

The liability arises in negligence. However it is worthwhile noting
that the
doctrine of informed consent initially sprang up in the United States
in
relation to the tort of trespass to the person (Salgo v Leland
Standford Jr
United Board of Trustees (1957) 317 P 2d 170; Mahoney 1985, p.110). In
turn
this has lead, in the United States, to the concept of a patient's
right of
self-determination as set forth in Canterbury v Spence (1972) 464 F 2d
772.
This concept is an extension of the tort of battery in that a person's
body
should not be violated by others. As a result the United States law on
informed consent rests on the notion that it is the patient who should
prudently assess the risks of medical treatment for themselves after
considering all the relevant information.

However because medical treatment is usually carried out with the
consent of
the patient (even if there is an inadequate explanation of risks) it
cannot
generally constitute a battery (Chatterton v Gerson [1981] QB 432 at
443).
The consent is still "real" where the patient has been informed in
broad
terms of the nature of the procedure and then given consent.
Consequently,
the doctrine of informed consent developed so as to become firmly
supplanted
under the tort of negligence (Natanson v Kline (1960) 350 P 2d 1093)
with
the battery approach being rejected (Reibl v Hughes (1981) 114 DLR (3d)
1
(SCC); Staunton 1989). A battery would, of course, still occur where
the
patient has given no consent at all (Malette v Shulman (1990) 67 DLR
(4th)
321 (OCA)).

The general argument in terms of negligence is that the doctor has a
duty to
give advice on risks to the patient so that the patient can decide
whether
to undergo the treatment proposed. That duty is breached when the
doctor
fails to inform the patient of all the material risks involved in the
treatment (Manderson 1988). Furthermore, if the patient would not have
undergone the treatment had the risks been disclosed, then the failure
of
the doctor to adequately inform the patient can have a causal
connection to
the risk and damage that eventuated. In that respect the risk ought to
have
been disclosed and negligence will be proven if causation is proven
between
the non-disclosure of the risk, the inference that the reasonable
patient if
properly informed would have refused the treatment (or as in F v R
(1983) 33
SASR 189 insisting on a more radical procedure to ensure success, eg
for
sterility), and the damage suffered by the patient.

Determination of reasonable standard of care
--------------------------------------------

A critical issue surrounding the doctrine of informed consent is
whether
breach of the duty of reasonable care owed by the doctor to the patient
to
advise on risks should be assessed according to common practices of the
medical profession and by reference to the standard of the ordinary,
but
specialised, medical practitioner. This test stems from a jury
direction of
McNair J. in the English case of Bolam v Friern Hospital Management
Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582. It has since been upheld in Whitehouse v
Jordan
[1981] 1 WLR 246 and Maynard v West Midlands Regional Health Authority
[1984] 1 WLR 634.

The Bolam approach effectively delegates to the medical profession the
determination of how much information it is appropriate to disclose to
patients about the risks of undergoing treatment and about possible
alternatives. It follows that non-disclosure by itself is not negligent
if
it accords with an accepted and proper practice followed by a
reasonable
body of medical opinion.

Modification to Bolam
---------------------

In England Bolam's Case was considered by the House of Lords in Sidaway
v
Governor of the Bethlem Royal Hospital [1985] AC 871. While the
majority of
the law lords took the view that advice (or the degree of advice) about
risks is a matter to be determined primarily by the doctor's expertise
and
proper medical judgment, nevertheless the determination of a failure to
inform of a risk does require consideration by the court. In Sidaway
this
meant that the test of whether a doctor has been careless in failing to
adequately warn a patient about the risks of a proposed treatment is
not
solely compliance with medical opinion, but should be left to the court
to
decide as a matter of law where the magnitude of the potential harm is
serious. However it is arguable that this extends to all cases and,
therefore, the use of expert medical evidence is for providing
assistance to
this determination. The foundation of this principle is that the giving
of
information concerning risks can involve considerations which are not
purely
medical (eg social and employment prospects of the patient), and thus
the
court should finally determine the standard of care required (Reibl v
Hughes
(1981) 114 DLR (3d) 1 (SCC)).

It appears that the majority in Sidaway's Case were willing to make
some
modification to the Bolam approach. As stated by Lord Templeman, the
court's
finality is particularly important where a disclosure of certain risks,
because of their magnitude or specialty to the patient, are manifestly
necessary so as to make an informed choice in which case no reasonably
prudent doctor would fail to make the disclosure. However slight or
general
risks do not appear to require the same degree of disclosure.

It should be noted that Lord Scarman in a dissenting judgment in
Sidaway did
accept the informed consent doctrine in Canterbury v Spence. However
the
majority in Sidaway stuck to the Bolam approach and tended to regard
the
Canterbury doctrine as impractical. The Canadian case of Reibl v Hughes
(1981) 114 DLR (3d) 1 (SCC) did invoke some appeal in the majority who
recognised the court as final decider, but the complete Canadian
position
was not adopted in Sidaway.

The situation in New Zealand is at best governed by the Court of Appeal
case
of Smith v Auckland Hospital Board [1965] NZLR 191 where it was held
that
expert evidence on common medical practice should be given considerable
weight. Given the relatively early stage in the development of informed
consent at the time Smith's Case was decided the situation today may
well be
that the Court of Appeal would at least adopt the Sidaway approach with
perhaps an inclination to the more liberal trend evidenced in Lord
Scarman's
dissenting judgment.

Particular factors re the patient
---------------------------------

In the Canadian case of Reibl v Hughes (1981) 114 DLR (3d) 1 (SCC) it
was
held that the standard of risk disclosure required could not be
conclusively
determined by expert medical evidence. The standard has to be
determined by
the court in all cases and not just in extreme cases with high risks
and
possible adverse consequences which then warrants more respect for
patient's
rights as was pronounced in Sidaway's Case.

In Reibl's Case the court stated that the doctor must of necessity pay
special attention to the individual circumstances of the patient when
assessing and advising upon risks. The particular individual factor in
Reibl's case placing it beyond that of the ordinary patient was his
entitlement to forthcoming pension rights.

This more patient-oriented approach requires an upgrading of medical
skills
to ensure that there is full and frank disclosure to the patient to the
extent that the patient might think important so that the patient can
participate in assessing the risks, information and alternatives.

The United States approach goes even further than the Canadian approach
with
the recognition of a patient's right of self-determination (Canterbury
v
Spence (1972) 464 F 2d 772). This approach is founded on the premise
that
every legally capable adult has the right to determine what happens to
their
own body or mind. As a result the standard of information disclosure is
assessed on the basis of what best protects the patient's rights and
not
what the medical profession considers appropriate. This allows for the
individual to determine their own destiny and also promotes the
patient's
status as an autonomous human being who values their physical and
physic
integrity (Mahoney 1985; Manderson 1988).

Material and general risks
--------------------------

It should be noted that in Canterbury it was held that a doctor need
only
disclose and warn of all "material" risks involved in the treatment
proposed. A risk is material when a reasonable person in the patient's
situation would have regarded it as important and significant in regard
to
what the doctor knows or ought to know of the patient. A similar
definition
was applied in South Australia in D v S (1981) 93 LS (SA) JS 405 and
Gover v
State of South Australia and Perriam (1985) 39 SASR 543.

In another South Australian case of F v R (1983) 33 SASR 189 it was
also
held that a doctor has a duty to disclose all matters which might
influence
the decision of a reasonable person in the situation of the patient and
should alert a patient to the risks of a serious operation and the
possibility of damage.

Therefore the law as it appears to be developing in Australia is that
breach
of a duty of care depends on whether the doctor's advice on risks
conforms
to the standard of reasonableness demanded by the law. In this respect
the
Bolam test has not won complete favour and an objective legal standard
based
somewhat upon the right of a patient's self-determination (F v R (1983)
33
SASR 189 at p.191 and p.194) seems to be the current trend. Thus the
Australian law appears to be moving in accordance with the Canadian
approach
and reaching a compromise position between the United States and
English
views. It is submitted that New Zealand courts should likewise follow a
similar approach.

It should be noted that where the possibility of damage is obvious or
only
slight then the risks may not be material and doctor's warnings become
unnecessary as they merely reinforce the obvious. This is the approach
taken
in the United States in Canterbury which sets out that there is no need
for
a doctor to inform the patient of the "general" risks of medical
treatment.
General risks are those which persons of average intellect and aptitude
are
aware of. However Lord Scarman and Lord Templeman in Sidaway both
stated
that in appropriate circumstances this does not stop a disclosure of
these
general risks from being made. If this were not so the duty on the
doctor to
volunteer information if the patient does not ask for it is greatly
reduced.

Therefore it is obviously better for the doctor to consider all known
risks
in relation to the patient. In particular all material, unusual or
special
risks involved in the proposed treatment need to be pointed out
including
the risk of the treatment being ineffective. Furthermore (as stated in
both
Sidaway and Reibl), all questions must be fully answered that relate to
the
risks in the proposed medical procedure.

Objective test - breach of duty
-------------------------------

As a doctor will not normally be liable for failing to disclose minor
risks
(and possibly even if the patient would have thought those risks
significant), whether a doctor has been in breach of a duty to disclose
material risks is an objective test, ie would a reasonable person have
thought those risks to be material.

If the duty to disclose material risks has been breached, the question
then
arises whether the breach caused the injury complained of. When
considering
causation and the doctrine of informed consent an action in negligence
will
only be successful if the injury to the patient would not have
eventuated
but for the omission of advice on risks by the doctor. This means that
the
patient has the difficult onus of proof in showing that if the risks
had
been disclosed, the patient would have decided not to undergo the
treatment
or sought more effective treatment (as in F v R). Only then can it be
said
that non-disclosure of risks caused the realisation of the harm.

Subjective test - causation
---------------------------

The courts have inclined to the view that causation is not proven
simply on
the basis of the use the particular patient would have made of the
information concerning risks had it been disclosed, ie according to a
subjective standard by the patient only needing to show that the
patient
would have refused the treatment, regardless of whether or not such a
decision was a reasonable one.

The problem with a subjective test is that the patient's evidence of
certain
risks would be biased by the fact that those risks did actually
eventuate
and so the patient's evidence would be tainted by hindsight. This means
that
the strength of the patient's contention that they would not have
undertaken
the recommended treatment if acquainted with all the relevant risks is
critical.

Objective test - causation
--------------------------

Both Canterbury and Reibl have set an objective test rather than a
subjective test on the question of whether failure to warn about risks
caused the harm to the patient. Under an objective test, for causation
to be
proved the patient must still discharge the difficult onus of proof by
convincing the court that a reasonable person in the patient's position
would have refused to undergo the proposed treatment when informed of
the
risks involved. It is not enough for the patient to show they would
have
refused the treatment as a particular patient. However the objective
test is
ameliorated slightly by looking at the circumstances of the patient as
recognised in Reibl's Case.

Under an objective test medical opinion again assumes significant
authority
when assessing negligence for non-disclosure of risks. The hurdle is
that in
many respects a reasonable person would have gone ahead with the
proposed
treatment despite the risks, if it was likely to be beneficial to their
health. For the court to determine if the medical risk is worth taking
reference to the opinion of the medical profession would be resorted
to.

Therapeutic privilege
---------------------

The issue of a subjective or an objective patient test may not make
much
difference when one considers that the defence of therapeutic privilege
is
available to the doctor. This allows a doctor to withhold information
on
risks, without liability, if the doctor reasonably believes that to do
so is
in the best interests of the patient (pursuant to the doctor's
contractual
obligation or otherwise) because disclosure would pose a detrimental
threat
so as to "become unfeasible or contraindicated from a medical point of
view"
(Canterbury v Spence (1972) 464 F 2d 772). The onus of proof is on the
doctor to establish the therapeutic privilege to withhold information.

Therapeutic privilege is often proved by considering the patient's
individual characteristics and circumstances, thereby allowing the
doctor to
censure information in order to ensure that the recommended treatment
is
undertaken. The majority of the law lords in Sidaway did not place any
controls on the defence of therapeutic privilege. Therefore therapeutic
privilege can prevail over a doctor's prima facie duty to disclose
information on risks where disclosure would lead to a reaction from the
patient so as to prevent a rational decision being made (Canterbury v
Spence), or when a patient is unable to cope with facts because of
emotional
distress or the patient's health (physical or mental) might be
seriously
harmed by that information.

This means that the patient's access is restricted to information that
can
be used rationally. Even in the United States the principle of
self-determination as set forth in Canterbury v Spence is qualified by
therapeutic privilege so as to reduce the number of situations in which
patients may make emotional or irrational decisions.

In England Lord Templeman in Sidaway acknowledged that a patient is
entitled
to reject advice on risks for reasons that are rational or irrational,
or
for no reason at all and therefore a doctor is not always entitled to
make
the final decision with regard to treatment. However, therapeutic
privilege
has never been denied as a valid defence because of the likelihood that
a
patient may make an unbalanced judgment when made aware of possible
complications that the patient is not capable of assessing. Hence it is
open
to the doctor to assess what information is in the patient's best
interests.

Lord Scarman in Sidaway (who rejected Bolam and approved Canterbury)
also
stressed that therapeutic privilege should be confined to situations
where a
warning of risks would be seriously detrimental to the patient's
immediate
health. This narrower application of therapeutic privilege is the
preferable
position as it recognises the prima facie duty on doctors to disclose
material risks of treatment to their patients.

The situation was covered in Australia in Battersby v Tottman (1985) 37
SASR
524 where the doctor knew that the patient would most probably not have
taken the drug prescribed had she known the risks. However because the
patient was mentally disturbed the doctor did not think that she was
capable
of making a rational decision and therefore did not disclose the risk
of
blindness to her on the basis that without the drug the patient would
die.
Therapeutic privilege was justified because information about the risk
could
have led to a serious deterioration in the patient's physical
condition.

However this is a narrower conception of therapeutic privilege than in
the
majority judgment in Sidaway or in F v R and is restricted to serious
cases
rather than being applied to take into account less serious but
"abnormal"
patient temperaments or emotional states. In terms of the narrower
perspective non-disclosure of risks is only allowed due to the serious
implications of the patient's condition. In all other cases recognition
of
the patient's self-determination and the need to know should be the
prima
facie rule. However even in serious cases where the patient
specifically
asks for further information on risks this should be given and again
the
situation should incline towards some semblance of patient
self-determination.

New Zealand
-----------

In New Zealand the patient's knowledge of risks should not be
considered as
less important even if there is an accident compensation system in
place
pursuant to the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act
1992
which, in general, does not allow for common law actions for medical
misadventure. Human and ethical factors should still take priority.

The pre-accident compensation decision of Smith v Auckland Hospital
Board
[1965] NZLR 191 (CA) inclines against the doctrine of informed consent
being
part of New Zealand law. However under the accident compensation system
it
has been held by the Accident Compensation Appeal Authority in Re K
(1986) 6
NZAR 231 that a patient who had been given the wrong information about
a
risk could recover compensation under the Act. Therefore if there is a
breach of duty to warn about risks, medical misadventure may still be
established under the Act. This is also supported by Re Priestly [1984]
NZACR 787 which, although only having the status of an Accident
Compensation
Appeal Authority decision, accepted the doctrine of informed consent.
The
doctrine has also been embodied in other New Zealand legislation such
as the
Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992.

Developments overseas since Smith's Case and social developments such
as a
more questioning attitude of patients, an increased distance in the
doctor-patient relationship and the growth of sophisticated technology
allowing for more insight into risks (Kirby 1984) would suggest that
New
Zealand courts should today follow the more liberal comments made in
Sidaway's case and take heed of the narrower conception of therapeutic
privilege in Battersby v Tottman.

This means that the need to disclose full and sufficient information
about
risks should become more predominant in medical practice even though
that
may not of itself change the passive role of the patient and doctor
relationship. Nevertheless it does allow for a greater sense of patient
self-determination, which while not in most cases a practical
suggestion in
times of illness or major operation, should be given due consideration
in a
free thinking society. In this regard the balanced approach in Reibl v
Hughes represents the most well reasoned proposition in this area of
the law
to date and is worthy of consideration by New Zealand courts.
