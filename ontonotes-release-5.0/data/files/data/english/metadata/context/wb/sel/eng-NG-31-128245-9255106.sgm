ISRAEL LIVES OCT 14, 2007  Elon Peace Plan with Sen. Brownback Endorsement

Population transfer was successfully used in the past to stop and prevent
international conflicts. For example: In 1922, 1.8 million Greeks and Turks were
moved to end conflict between two countries; Over 12 million people were
transferred during partition of the Indian peninsula in 1947, when India and
Pakistan obtained independence from Britain. Almost immediately after Israel won
the war of Independence, the UN adopted a resolution that Population transfer is
illegal! This way the international anti-Jewish hypocrisy facilitated the
continuation of the Arab-Israel conflict! Population transfer has been performed
'illegally' many times since - in Western Sahara and during the separation of
Yugoslavia!  (see the very end for today's article for Iran's solution for the
transfer of.. Israeli's.)

PA: Demands Eradication of Israel. Palestinian Authority (PA) Chairman Mahmoud
Abbas hardened his stance Wednesday, telling PATV viewers that he will accept
nothing less than a new Arab state along the lines of the 1949 Armistice.
Abbas's proposed state would include all the parts of Jerusalem that were
restored to the Jewish state in the 1967 Six-Day War, including decades-old
Jewish neighbourhoods such as Gilo, Ramot and Talpiot. The ancient Old City of
Jerusalem would become the centrepiece of the new PA state. (Why not go back to
1922, when the League of Nation designated all Palestine to Eretz-Israel, the
Jewish state? Like his predecessor Arafat, Abbas has no interest in peace and is
continuously 'changing' his position. Time to realize, even for tick-skulled
politicians that annihilation of Israel and killing or removal of Jews from the
Jewish land are the objectives of our enemies. This position always remains the
same!

1-3&gt;BENNY ELON Proposes a new Peace Plan.  Senator Brownback signs on, Steven
Shamrack voices thought.

The presently propose 'Road Map' doesn't work.  As it stands now, Phase III has
become Phase I; the untenable thrust of the present Rice-Bush Annapolis plan
reverses the order to create a palestinean state first and then control terror.
- The establishment of a Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria and Gaza (the West
Bank), as proposed in plans such as the &quot;Road Map&quot;, will prolong the Arab-
Israeli conflict and exact a heavy toll in human life.

As in previous failed agreements, the current Road Map proposed by President
Bush is one that defers the solution of the real problems that perpetuate the
conflict:

*         The Palestinian demand for the right of return of refugees to areas
within the State of Israel

*         The rehabilitation of Palestinian refugees.

*         The status of Jerusalem.

*         The nature of the Palestinian state and its borders

Within a short time, these unresolved problems will resurface and draw the
region into yet another war. While based on the principle of &quot;two states for two
nations&quot;, the proposed Road Map does not achieve that goal.

It is not a &quot;two state solution&quot; at all. Without the complete destruction of
Israel, Palestinian Arabs can only be offered a state-like entity, unable to
sign international agreements, without an army and made up of a number of small
and overcrowded fragments of territory.

This quasi-state would not have natural borders. Rather, population centers on
both sides will straddle the border, perpetuating continued friction between
Israelis and Palestinians.

The Palestinian entity's economy will be permanently dependent on Israel.

This entity would be an Israeli protectorate, leading to an intensification of
the sense of humiliation felt by Palestinian Arabs who would aspire to encroach
further into Israeli territory.

The refugee problem will not be solved through this entity and Palestinian Arab
demands for the right of return will continue to threaten Israel's existence.
The motivation for terror will remain high.

From every aspect - geographic, economic and demographic - it is clear that it
will be impossible to resolve the problem within the small, overcrowded area
between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.

Why - after the failure of the Oslo agreements - are we reverting to a model
already proven catastrophic for both sides?

It is clear that what is needed is a paradigm shift.

4&gt;Israeli PM Ehud Olmert  &quot;The peace process involves relinquishing the full
realisation of dreams that fed our national ethos for many years&quot; --

&lt; http://www.gandi.org.il/Site/en/pages/homePage.asp &gt; Rechavam &quot;Gandhi&quot;  Ze'evi.
&quot;What &quot;peace process&quot;? Have our enemies given up their 'dream' of the
destruction of Israel? People who are paralyzed by the Stockholm syndrome must
not be allowed to lead the country!

Palmach Ze'evi, Gandhi's son.  &quot;I'll tell you something, my father would always
ask himself, 'What has changed that we are suddenly deciding to take these
steps? Have the Arabs changed? Has Islam changed?'.We have sat with all the
so-called moderates, and even they haven't given up the Right of Return.We are
falling over ourselves to receive a hug from the world and endangering the
country.&quot;

1&gt;A PLAN FOR PEACE-PROPOSED BY MEMBER OF KNESSET BINYAMIN (BENNY) ELON

Introduction to the Elon Peace Plan

http://www.therightroadtopeace.com/eng/DefaultEng.html

Only with application of a regional solution that includes the entire territory
of British Mandatory Palestine (land of Israel) can the peace process be
delivered from its impasse. A regional solution based on geopolitical and
economic logic can provide the Middle East with long-term peace, prosperity and
stability.

The American and British coalition victory in Iraq has spurred an American
commitment to instill democratic values in the Middle East and establish a new
political map. This is an historic opportunity to enable the Arab nations to be
part of the solution to the Palestinian problem and garner international support
and funding.

The Elon Peace Plan addresses the fundamental issues related to the conflict and
offers a comprehensive solution for Israel, Palestinian Arabs and surrounding
countries.

Expanding the solution to include both sides of the Jordan River creates a new
reality in which:

Dealing directly with final-status issues, the Elon Peace Plan offers:

*       Israelis and Palestinian Arabs can exist alongside one another in two
genuine, sovereign states

*       A well-defined natural border would be established, far from population
centers.

*       Both states would have strategic depth and ample land reserves.

*       An immediate permanent-status settlement to end the conflict.

*       Full and comprehensive rehabilitation of Palestinian refugees

*       The granting of national expression and full rights for all Palestinian
Arabs

*       Removal of the threat to Israel's existence as a Jewish state.

Key principles of the Elon Peace Plan

1. Dissolution of the Palestinian Authority

Immediate dissolution of the Palestinian Authority, a non-viable entity with no
future, whose existence precludes the termination of the conflict.

2. Eradication of terror infrastructure

Israel will uproot the Palestinian terror infrastructure. All arms will be
collected, incitement will be stopped and all the refugee camps, which serve as
incubators for terror, will be dismantled. Terrorists and their direct
supporters will be deported.

3. Recognition and Development of Jordan as the Palestinian State

Israel, the United States and the international community will recognize the
Kingdom of Jordan as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians.
Jordan will once again recognize itself as the Palestinian nation-state.

In the context of a regional economic development program, Israel, the United
States and the international community will put forth a concerted effort for the
long-term development of Jordan, to rehabilitate its economy and enable it to
absorb a limited number of refugees within its borders.

4. Israeli sovereignty over Judea, Samaria and Gaza

Israeli sovereignty will be asserted over Judea, Samaria and Gaza (the West
Bank). The Arab residents of these areas will become citizens of the Palestinian
state in Jordan. The status of these citizens, their connection to the two
states and the manner of administration of their communal lives will be decided
in an agreement between the governments of Israel and Jordan (Palestine).

5. Rehabilitation of refugees and completion of population exchange

Israel, the United States and the international community will allocate
resources for the completion of the exchange of populations that began in 1948,
as well as the full rehabilitation of the refugees and their absorption and
naturalization in various countries.

6. Peace and normalization

After implementation of the above stages, Israel and Jordan-Palestine will
declare the conflict terminated. Both sides will work to normalize peaceful
relations between all parties in the region.

Underlying principles of the Elon Peace Plan:

No other proposal addresses final-status issues. The Elon plan offers a way to
translate the achievements of the war in Iraq into a new &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; for the
Middle East, a plan that is based, on the one hand on Israel, the only stable
democracy in the region, and, on the other, on Jordan which has a
quasi-democratic government, thus removing the Palestinian terrorist regime from
the picture.

The Elon Plan proposes a simple, sustainable solution that achieves historic
justice and advances the vision of the prophets. It addresses the human
tragedies of all the sides and does not harm Israeli deterrence - the most vital
element for regional peace

Simplicity

Two states for two nations on either side of the Jordan River. This solution
offers a natural and logical border, separation of hostile populations and an
end to the human tragedy that has continued since the War of Independence.

Sustainability

This plan grants the Palestinian Arabs citizenship in a real state that has the
ability to sustain itself economically and politically, with clear and final
borders. This state would not find itself in constant conflict with Israel and
its future would not be predicated on the destruction of Israel as a Jewish
state.

Morality

This plan prioritizes the treatment of human issues over empty symbols. &quot;Peace&quot;
proposals that are based on continued conflict perpetuate poverty, violence and
ignorance. The Elon Peace Plan brings about a solution to the Palestinians.
suffering without capitulating to terror and violence.

Deterrence

An Israeli withdrawal of any kind would severely harm Israel's national strength
while reinforcing the motivation for terror. The Elon Peace Plan preserves
Israel's deterrent capabilities, making it possible for the first time to
delineate secure and recognized borders.

Justice

The secure existence of Israel corrects a historic injustice. The essence of
Zionism is to establish a state for the Jewish people, a safe haven for millions
of Jewish refugees from all over the world including from the Arab countries.

The Arab world must be involved in a resolution of the Arab refugee issue, using
its vast territorial expanses and abundant natural resources.

This is not only justice in its most elementary sense - that of human decency -
but also draws on deep Biblical sources, which view the Jewish people as a
nation with a unique destiny and place in history.

This plan is founded on the fundamental historic and Biblical truth that the
land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people.

However, it realizes only part of this principle because it accepts the
existence of a Palestinian state east of the Jordan River, part of the Biblical
land of Israel.

The realization of the Zionist dream - the return of the Jewish people to its
land from all corners of the earth - is a historic event of global significance.

Only when Israel's Arab neighbors accept its right to exist within secure
boundaries as a fundamental reality, will regional peace and prosperity be
achieved.

2&gt;SENATOR BROWNBACK ENDORSES ELON PEACE PLAN

Etgar Lefkovits

October 10, 2007

http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1191257271580&amp;pagename;=JPo...
cle%2FPrinter

US Republican presidential candidate Sam Brownback has voiced support for a
Mideast peace plan put forward by MK Benny Elon (National Union-NRP) that
maintains Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank and would recognize Jordan as
the official representative of the Palestinians.

&quot;This is a realistic proposal and different way forward...which needs to be
looked at broadly in the international community,&quot; Kansas Senator Sam Brownback
said in a videotaped message shown Wednesday at a Jerusalem press conference.

Elon's plan calls for recognizing the Kingdom of Jordan as the sole
representative of the Palestinians instead of the Palestinian Authority,
dismantling UNRWA and the Palestinian refugee camps and the rehabilitation of
Palestinian refugees elsewhere.

Brownback called the plan &quot;bold, aggressive, clear and workable.&quot;

The conservative American senator who has close ties to the Christian Right in
the US noted that while he does not endorse all aspects of the plan -
specifically regarding the dismantling of the Palestinian Authority - it could
be the basis for a positive discussion for long-term relations between Israel
and the Palestinians.

&quot;Land for peace does not work,&quot; Brownback said, citing Israel's 2005 withdrawal
from the Gaza Strip as a case in point.

Elon said the long-term proposal constituted a &quot;real, deep conceptual change,&quot;
that required time, energy, and funding.

&quot;This is a national and international information campaign,&quot; Elon said at the
news conference, which included the taped video remarks of the Republican
senator.

&quot;If Israel will not be in Judea and Samaria,&quot; Elon said, using the Biblical
names for the West Bank, &quot;then Hamas will be there.&quot;

Elon will present his plan, called &quot;The Israeli Initiative - The Right Road to
Peace&quot; to President Shimon Peres and Israeli legislators across the political
spectrum in the coming days.

He also has been holding meetings with parliamentarians and officials around the
world in an effort to promote his proposal in the international arena.

The hawkish Israeli lawmaker has been at the forefront of Israel's burgeoning
relations with the predominantly supportive evangelical community around the
world.

&quot;We have had enough cocktail parties at the White House with the Nobel prize
winner Arafat,&quot; Elon said. &quot;Now is the time for a real conceptual change.&quot;

The parliamentarian's proposal contradicts the two-state solution endorsed by
the Israeli Government, and comes as senior government ministers have been
talking openly about the division of Jerusalem as part of a peace agreement with
the Palestinians.

Jordan, which ruled the West Bank from 1948 to 1967, has rejected similar plans
in the past and has long urged Israel to accept the formation of a Palestinian
state.

3&gt;Food for Thought

Steven Shamrak

We need to learn how to Act, not re-Act. Only by setting our own national goals
and actively purusing them will we be able to achieve unity of Jewish land. By
reacting we are only empowering our enemies. Please, visit: The Jewish National
Goal, Sinai Option: Road to Permanent Peace and The First Step.

No to Sharing Jerusalem. Most Israelis rejected again the idea of sharing
Jerusalem with the 'Palestinians'. Asked whether Israel should agree to &quot;any
sort of compromise on Jerusalem&quot; as part of a final deal to end the decades-old
Middle East conflict, 63 percent said &quot;No&quot;. (Still idiots in the government
continue to raise this option again and again.)

On the Subject of Transfer. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowed once
again to destroy Israel and called for a referendum to transfer Israel's Jews to
Canada, Alaska or Europe. &quot;Canada and Alaska have vast lands, why don't you
relocate them over there and keep helping them over there with (aid of) 30 to 40
billion dollars per year for building a new existence over there.&quot; (Good plan!
But, it would be easier and just to transfer all Arabs/Muslims from Jewish land
to 60 Arab/Muslim countries. They have land, money and natural resources to
support and absorb several millions of their brothers and sisters. So, let's do
it!)

Un-friendly Interference. Israel was ready to strike alleged Syrian nuclear
facilities reportedly on July 14, but some members in the Bush Administration,
especially Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, pressure Israel to delay action.
Even after Israeli officials provided strong intel, the Americans dragged their
feet in giving the approval. (President Bush did not pay attention to Sharon's
warning and invaded Iraq to accomplish the US security goals and blaming Israel
in the process! Why is Israel compromising her security for the sake of the
illusion of US friendship?)

Waiting for Missile to Hit Tel Aviv. In reaction to the Katyusha rocket fired at
Netivot, Ashkelon Mayor Roni Mahatzri predicted that the government will not act
against Gaza until a missile hits Tel Aviv: &quot;Only then will the government of
Israel do what is expected of it and act massively against the terror
organizations in Gaza&quot;.

Israel Defends Civilian Jets. Israel will replace the flare-firing systems it
has installed on some of its passenger planes to defend against missile attacks
with non-pyrotechnic lasers deemed safer abroad. An Israeli airliner narrowly
escaped being shot down by al Qaeda over Kenya in 2003. New system is
provisionally called MUSIC (Multi-Spectral Counter MANPADS System) and that its
broad-array laser can &quot;take on 1,000 threats at once&quot;.

Quote of the Week:

&quot;The peace process involves relinquishing the full realisation of dreams that
fed our national ethos for many years&quot; - Israeli PM Ehud Olmert - What &quot;peace
process&quot;? Have our enemies gaven up their 'dream' of the destruction of Israel?
People who are paralyzed by the Stockholm syndrome must not be allowed to lead
the country!

Israel is Paying for and Doing World's Dirty Job. US Congress approves $1.2
billion worth of US-funded Israeli arms purchases, including 50 huge GBU-28
guided bunker busters (which could be used during possible attack on Iranian
nuclear sites). The package includes thousands of missiles, tens of thousands of
new bombs worth $799 million and 132 million gallons of jet fuel worth $308
million. (Israel is paying back US aid with 'interest' - Israel will be able, if
needed, to restrain the &quot;Axis of evil&quot;, Syria and Iran!)

Rats are Leaving a Ship. The entire staff of Russian nuclear engineers and
experts employed in building the nuclear reactor at Bushehr had abruptly packed
their bags Friday, Sept. 28, and flown back to Russia, according to local Arab
sources.

Lieberman is Another Trojan Horse. Minister of Strategic Affairs Avigdor
Lieberman's announcement that he would give many Arab neighbourhoods in
Jerusalem to the PA came as no surprise. Jewish Front activists said &quot;We always
knew that Lieberman was a Trojan horse in the political right.&quot;  Lieberman is &quot;a
political businessman who's just looking for a seat&quot;.

A Step Toward Eretz-Israel.

NU-NRP Chairman Benny Elon is proposing an alternative solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which he presented a week ago as the &quot;Israeli
initiative.&quot; The plan calls for the annexation of Judea and Samaria by Israel
and would allow the Palestinians to remain there, but would grant them Jordanian
citizenship (which they used to have before the Yom Kippur war). Elon said he
was sure that Jordan's King Abdullah II could be persuaded to agree.

&quot;The establishment of the State of Israel did not deprive the Palestinians of
their state. There was never such a state,&quot; Elon said. His plan is to &quot;replace
the status of Palestinian refugees - one that is coupled with connotations of
poverty and hatred - with a reality of welfare, prosperity and hope.&quot;

Elon stressed the humanitarian aspect of his plan. As citizen and a Jew, I am
concerned that people see no light at the end of the tunnel and that they no
longer believe in peace and justice after the failure of the Oslo Accords and
the disengagement.&quot; (Later, a similar arrangement could be made with Egypt in
Gaza.)

&quot;The peace process involves relinquishing the full realization of dreams that
fed our national ethos for many years&quot; - Israeli PM Ehud Olmert - What &quot;peace
process&quot;? Have our enemies given up their 'dream' of the destruction of Israel?
People who are paralyzed by the Stockholm syndrome must not be allowed to lead
the country!

4&gt;6 Years After Murder, Ze'evi's Son Talks Transfer on Army Radio

Ezra HaLevi

http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123884

(IsraelNN.com) Wednesday marks six years since the assassination of
&lt; http://www.gandi.org.il/Site/en/pages/homePage.asp &gt; Rechavam &quot;Gandhi&quot;  Ze'evi,
who was Israel's Tourism Minister at the time of his murder by an Arab terrorist
on October 17, 2001.

Ze'evi, an IDF general and renowned historian, headed the Moledet party and
promoted a platform of voluntary transfer of Arabs from Israel, including Judea,
Samaria and Gaza.

He was shot dead at Jerusalem's Hyatt Hotel, now the Regency, by terrorists of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

Ze'evi's eldest son Palmach was interviewed on Army Radio Wednesday morning.
Host Razi Barkai asked him where his father would be today if he were still
alive.

&quot;He would be prime minister,&quot; Palmach said. &quot;There are a good chances that even
you would give him much more credit today after all that has happened. Much has
changed since they used to throw tomatoes at the idea of transfer.&quot;

Barkai: So if he was prime minister, he wouldn't go to Annapolis? He wouldn't
make a deal with Abu Mazen? He wouldn't give up territory?

Ze'evi: I'll tell you something, my father would always ask himself, 'What has
changed that we are suddenly deciding to take these steps? Have the Arabs
changed? Has Islam changed?'.We have sat with all the so-called moderates, and
even they haven't given up the Right of Return.We are falling over ourselves to
receive a hug from the world and endangering the country.&quot;

Barkai: You have to admit, morality aside, that transfer is simply not do-able,
it is not practical today. It just can't be done in the Middle East today.

Ze'evi: Razi, let's stop this demagoguery. If you and all those who repeat the
mantra that transfer is impossible would hold a serious discussion on it for
once, it would be considered seriously. It is serious if you desire life. Two
nations cannot split the land. That has not worked anywhere in the world and
certainly not in the Middle East. This is the reality. There are many ways to
implement it, but to come and say let's make two camps so we can live here, and
to say that transfer is racist and impractical, is really not dealing with the
issue.

Barkai: So who should lead the country today?

Ze'evi: I won't evade the question completely, but I will tell you that ideology
is sorely lacking in nearly all members of the leadership today.I will say that
the most worthy of all the possibilities today is Binyamin Netanyahu.

Memorial Ceremony
A memorial ceremony for Ze'evi is scheduled for Thursday at 3 PM at the Mt.
Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. It will be attended by dignitaries,
friends and family. The public is invited to take part.

Population Transfer: Information provided by Steven Shamrak.

Population transfer was successfully used in the past to stop and prevent
international conflicts. For example: In 1922, 1.8 million Greeks and Turks were
moved to end conflict between two countries; Over 12 million people were
transferred during partition of the Indian peninsula in 1947, when India and
Pakistan obtained independence from Britain. Almost immediately after Israel won
the war of Independence, the UN adopted a resolution that Population transfer is
illegal! This way the international anti-Jewish hypocrisy facilitated the
continuation of the Arab-Israel conflict! Population transfer has been performed
'illegally' many times since - in Western Sahara and during the separation of
Yugoslavia.

No to Sharing Jerusalem. Most Israelis rejected again the idea of sharing
Jerusalem with the 'Palestinians'. Asked whether Israel should agree to &quot;any
sort of compromise on Jerusalem&quot; as part of a final deal to end the decades-old
Middle East conflict, 63 percent said &quot;No&quot;. (Still idiots in the government
continue to raise this option again and again.)

On the Subject of Transfer Iranian style. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
vowed once again to destroy Israel and called for a referendum to transfer
Israel's Jews to Canada, Alaska or Europe. &quot;Canada and Alaska have vast lands,
why don't you relocate them over there and keep helping them over there with
(aid of) 30 to 40 billion dollars per year for building a new existence over
there.&quot; (Good plan! But, it would be easier and just to transfer all
Arabs/Muslims from Jewish land to 60 Arab/Muslim countries. They have land,
money and natural resources to support and absorb several millions of their
brothers and sisters. So, let's do it!
