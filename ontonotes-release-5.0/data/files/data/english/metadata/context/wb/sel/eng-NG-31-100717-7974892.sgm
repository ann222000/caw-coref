Snow Perfectly Conveys White House's Total Arrogance

By Bob Geiger
Created Jul 26 2007 - 12:02pm

White House Press Secretary Tony Snow, like Scott &quot;The Lyin' King&quot; McClellan
before him, does a great job serving up lies every day on behalf of George
W. Bush. If the president or Dick Cheney told Snow to go before the media
and say that today is actually Christmas, he would do it and treat everyone
in the room like idiots for being unaware of that altered reality.

So there was Snow yesterday sounding a lot like a Democrat and detailing the
amount of Congressional investigation that's been necessary on the corrupt
administration for which he is the mouthpiece, but actually using it to
illustrate how the current Congress doesn't understand the view from 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue on their role -- that they only exist to rubber stamp
King George's policies.

Here's Snow in his opening statement for the Wednesday press briefing:

&quot;As you probably know, the House Judiciary Committee has just voted along
partisan lines to have a criminal contempt of Congress referral against
White House legal counsel and the White House Chief of Staff. For our view,
this is pathetic. What you have right now is partisanship on Capitol Hill
that quite often boils down to insults, insinuations, inquisitions and
investigations rather than pursuing the normal business of trying to pass
major pieces of legislation, such as appropriations bills, and to try to
work in such a way as to demonstrate to the American people that Congress
and the White House can work together.

&quot;In any event, it's worth putting this in perspective in terms of the
accomplishments of the present Congress. If you take a look at the 110th
Congress right now, which had promised to have all of its appropriations
bills done this month, here's what we have seen since the beginning of the
Congress: More than 300 executive branch investigations or inquiries; 400
requests for documents, interviews, or testimony; we've had more than 550
officials testify; we've had more than 600 oversight hearings; 87,000-plus
hours spent responding to oversight requests; and 430,000 pages made
available to Congress for oversight. That's pretty significant.&quot;

&quot;That's pretty significant,&quot; he says.

But what he means is that Congress is wasting their time doing the oversight
inherent to that body -- because, as far as Snow is concerned, Congress
represents the White House and not the American people -- and that they
should spend more time helping Bush in his failed national agenda or, like
their GOP predecessors, focusing on issues like Terri Schiavo or flag
burning.

And then one intrepid reporter tries to remind Snow of that boring old
checks-and-balances thing:

Q: Tony, this country -- if I'm correct from our history books, wasn't
this country based on the system of checks and balances? You say they're not
doing the people's business, but isn't that the people's business? If there
is something in question -- granted, there might have been 400
investigations, but if there was something in question, isn't that the
people's business?

Snow: That's a very good question. But what if there isn't anything in
question and somebody is going on a --

Q: There are things in question.

Snow then goes on to explain how Congress is only on a partisan &quot;fishing
expedition&quot; and that Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are guilty of creating &quot;a
toxic atmosphere&quot; in Washington.

I see. We have a Supreme Court-appointed president who has done everything
but go up to Capitol Hill and urinate on the Senate floor and has
systematically shredded our Constitution, but it's the people in the
legislative branch who have polluted the political atmosphere.

And Snow wrapped up soon after one reporter expressed why Congress might be
issuing contempt citations -- &quot;you haven't made everybody available. You've
made them available if they go without the oath, if they go without the
transcript, and if they go in private&quot; -- and another asked about Alberto
Gonzales and whether Bush is &quot;troubled by senators questioning his
truthfulness and by Specter saying that he doesn't think he has any
credibility.&quot;

Snow said the president &quot;stands by the Attorney General&quot; and, perhaps to
lighten things up, &quot;the president is bothered sometimes by the tone of
debate in Washington.&quot;

Well, at least he ended on a comic note.

The GOP spends every waking minute debasing debate in this country. They
own talk radio where they spend countless hours debasing everything
known to man. Then they have Fox News which spends every evening
debasing our intellect and our constitutional democracy. Then they have
the network and cable news shows which waste countless hours reporting
their latest lies without checking to see if it's another lie.

Think fast...who was the last republican who actually raised the level
of debate in this country. Name him. I bet no one; liberal,
conservatives, libertarian, Democrat or republican can name one on
republican who's ever done anything but lie.
