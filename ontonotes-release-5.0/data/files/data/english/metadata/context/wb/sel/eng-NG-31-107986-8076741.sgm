Need a number to stick in there.. I have a 50qt Igloo extreme...  Give me a
number that will get me within a degree or two of strike temp.....

I am lazy and don't want to go through measuring it myself.....  I'll do it
one day, but for now I have limited time and just want to brew!!...

Thanks

John

Have you considered pre-heating your mash tun with hot water?  That
way you can leave the thermal mass set to zero.  I've never gotten
arounf to calculating mine either.

while we're on laziness, does anybody have the number for an uninsulated
converted keg mash tun

Agreed -- I've been doing the same thing for years, just out of laziness.

Do this the next time you preheat the mashtun and you'll have your
thermal mass:

Q: What is the Thermal Mass of my mash tun, and how can I calculate
it?
A: Thermal mass is the amount of heat your mash tun will absorb when
you add the water. This can affect your calculations a bit when
attempting to calculate your strike temperatures.

The default or &quot;average&quot; thermal mass of 0.30 will get you pretty
close most of the time, but you can measure it yourself with the
following procedure:

1. Go into ProMash and go into the Strike Temp calculator.
2. For Mash Tun Thermal Mass, Enter 0.
3. For Total Grain enter 0.00001 pounds. (It won't let you go any
smaller - entering 0 will give you a division error.) This should make
your water:grain ratio 120000:1.
4. For Total Water, enter 16.00 quarts.
5. For Desired Strike Temp, enter 170. (You can use any temperature
but this will more accurately reflect actual mash temperatures.)
6. For Grain Temp, enter the current room temperature.
7. Heat 16 quarts (4 gallons) of water to 170 degrees and pour it
quickly into the mash tun. Close the lid and seal it up, and let it
sit for about 5 minutes.
8. Measure the temperature of the water in the mash tun.
9. Enter the temperature of the water in the mash tun in the &quot;Desired
Strike Temp&quot; field in ProMash.
10. Now look at the &quot;Initial Strike Water Temp Should Be&quot; window. You
will note that, with Thermal Mass set to 0, this number will be the
same as the &quot;Desired Strike Temp&quot; field.
11. Now, in small (say 0.1 or smaller) increments, increase the
Thermal Mass field until the &quot;Initial Strike Water&quot; field reads 170
(or whatever temperature you started with, if you didn't use 170 for
some reason.).
12. Ta-da! Whatever the Thermal Mass field says is your mash tun's
thermal mass!

FWIW, my 5gal Igloo round has a thermal mass of 0.21
