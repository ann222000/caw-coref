Getting Older

Three older ladies were discussing the travails of getting
older. One said, &quot;Sometimes I catch myself with a jar of
mayonnaise in my hand in front of the refrigerator and can't
remember whether I need to put it away, or start making a
sandwich.&quot;

The second lady chimed in, &quot;Yes, some times I find myself
on the landing of the stairs and can't remember whether I
was on my way up or on my way down.&quot;

The third one responded, &quot; Well, I'm glad I don't have that
problem, knock on wood,&quot; as she rapped her knuckles on the
table, then told them &quot;That must be the door, I'll get it!&quot;
