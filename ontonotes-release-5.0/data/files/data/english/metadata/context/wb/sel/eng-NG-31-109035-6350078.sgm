The afternoon before someone posted about chain I was looking at the
choke collars in Rite Aid. I bought a 16" knowing it would fit around my
neck but having forgot how choke collars work when I tried it on, of
course it wouldn't go over my head. Well, guess what? They have a 24"
choke collar for $3.59 at Rite Aid! I am going back tomorrow in the
hopes that one will fit. Oh and they have metal handcuffs for $5.99 in
the toy section and my daughter _demanded_ I buy her a pair and then
wanted to open them in the store! So, toys can be found anywhere, I am
finding. Oh yeah, they sell leashes and other less durable collars as well.
