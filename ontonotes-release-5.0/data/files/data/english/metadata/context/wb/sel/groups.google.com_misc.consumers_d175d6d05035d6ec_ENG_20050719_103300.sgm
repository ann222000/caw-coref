'Double diabetes' puzzles doctors

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having one type of diabetes is bad enough, but two?
Doctors are seeing a new phenomenon dubbed double diabetes that makes it
harder to diagnose and treat patients -- especially children.

The mix can strike at any age, and comes in various forms: Children who
depend on insulin injections because of Type 1 diabetes gain weight and
then get the Type 2 form in which their bodies become insulin resistant,
for example.

Or someone with classic Type 2 symptoms isn't responding to therapy, and
tests reveal they also are developing the insulin-dependent form of the
disease. Or they may not fall clearly into either category.

The labels are important -- different forms require different treatments.

Yet &quot;there are many people in which it's very blurred as to what kind of
diabetes they have,&quot; says Dr. Francine Kaufman, a University of Southern
California pediatric endocrinologist and past president of the American
Diabetes Association.

There are no good statistics on this complex disease-mixing.

But the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh counts about 25 percent of child
patients with Type 1 diabetes who also are overweight and have other Type 2
features, says Dr. Dorothy Becker, a pediatric endocrinologist and leading
double-diabetes researcher.

And an ongoing study to determine the best treatment for child Type 2
diabetics is uncovering many participants who harbor antibodies that signal
they have or are developing the Type 1 form, too, says Kaufman.

Those findings echo a handful of recent research reports raising concern
about the phenomenon, which some call atypical diabetes or &quot;diabetes 11/2&quot;
or even Type 3 diabetes.

Diabetes occurs when the body can't turn blood sugar, or glucose, into
energy, either because it doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't use it
correctly.

With the Type 1 form, the patient's own immune system attacks the
insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas. Once thought to strike only
in childhood, it also can develop in adults. Symptoms usually appear
suddenly and can quickly become life-threatening. Insulin, given by shots
or a pump, is required to survive.

With the Type 2 form, the body loses its ability to use insulin properly,
even though the pancreas pumps out extra and drugs often are given to rev
up that production even more. Type 2 usually develops slowly, and once was
thought to hit only the middle-aged but now is striking even overweight
children.

Both forms can lead to heart and kidney disease, blindness and amputations,
and kill if not properly treated. But Type 2, which afflicts over 90
percent of the more than 18 million U.S. diabetics, has gotten more
attention recently because it's an epidemic fueled by increasing obesity.

Yet specialists knew Type 1 was quietly increasing, too -- and then they
began spotting double diabetics.

The theory: Overweight people need more insulin to process glucose
regardless of whether they're insulin-resistant yet. So, perhaps obesity
overworks the pancreas until it wears out, Pittsburgh's Becker suggests. Or
perhaps obesity accelerates the autoimmune destruction -- meaning someone
genetically predisposed to Type 1 diabetes might not have gotten it had
they stayed thin.

&quot;You've not just exceeded what you can make but perhaps accelerated the
destruction,&quot; and then insulin-resistance sets in, agrees Kaufman, who just
authored a book called &quot;Diabesity&quot; exploring the overall obesity-diabetes
threat.

Whatever you call that mix, it complicates treatment.

Consider Martha Larkin of Pittsburgh, diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age
3. For years, her mother would wake up in the middle of the night to test
Martha's blood sugar and administer insulin. Set mealtimes and off-limit
foods became the family's norm.

Then early puberty hit at 10, and Martha began gaining weight, says her
mother, Cindy Stevans. Now almost 12, Martha's daily insulin requirement
grew to that of grown man, signaling developing insulin resistance. And, in
a vicious cycle, the more insulin she gets, the hungrier she feels.

A recently implanted insulin pump is helping, and the family joined a pool
in hopes that physical activity will help Martha stave off double diabetes
-- and that her twin brother will stay diabetes-free. But weight is a
problem for this whole family of bookworms who hate exercise so much that
Stevans calls it &quot;torture.&quot;

&quot;It's painfully hard,&quot; she says of her daughter's co-battles with diabetes
and weight.

Not a very good article. I don't know if it came from a confused doctor
or a confused reporter.

It implies that T1 is defined mostly as &quot;insulin-dependent&quot; and that any T2
who becomes insulin-dependent might be T1 also.

In fact, all T2 will become insulin-dependent if they live long enough.
Work your program and you might hold it off until age 115. Ignore the
standard delaying therapy and you could be using insulin at age 15:

a. Lose fat lb
b. Gain muscle lb
c. Exercise every day
d. Ration your carb

I have read newspaper profiles of some of these 15-year old &quot;double
diabetics&quot;. IMO, they are cursed with ample supplies of the Type 2
Diabetes genes and the Insulin Resistance genes. However, their
lifestyles:

a. Gain fat lb, starting very young
b. Forget about muscle
c. No exercise, never
d. Carb, carb, carb

don't help one bit.

Something to think about: My T2 gene-laden daughter-in-law takes her
kindergarden son jogging with her (he rides his bike). My T2 gene-laden
neighbor takes her teen and pre-teen children on 30-mile bike rides.

Reasonale. They have two totatlly different causes-
Type 1 is destruction of pancreas islets from autoimmune
or infection. Type two is innability of cells to use
insulin.

"/>  Type 2 is marked by the slow destruction of beta cells primarily by an
apoptosis event. On average, a T2 has about 50% of his beta cells
destroyed at the time of first diagnosis.

The overwhelming majority of Type 2 also have high Insulin Resistance, i.e.
an inability of cells to use insulin. Thus, they have both a shortage of
insulin supply and an inability to use what they have. Unless they take
strong steps to stop it, the slow destruction of their beta cells continues
after diagnosis and they will end up on insulin if they live long enough.

Type 1 is marked by the rapid destruction of beta cells via an auto-immune
reaction. On average, a T1 has about 80% of his beta cells destroyed at
the time of first diagnosis.

"/> The debate hinges on the definition of &quot;insufficient insulin&quot; If you
need 50 units to process a meal and can only come up with 49 units, you
have &quot;insufficient insulin&quot; even though a non-diabetic or normal person
might only need 8 units to process that same meal. IOW, you could be
making six times as much insulin as a normal person at that time, but you
would still have &quot;insufficient insulin&quot;.

Non-diabetics have 2-4 times as much insulin capacity as they need. Making
a normal amount of insulin is still consistent with &quot;about 50% of their beta
cells destroyed at the time of first diagnosis&quot;.

Write a definition of &quot;sufficient and insufficient&quot; which is tied to
&quot;amounts normally generated by non-diabetics and suddenly a lots of T2 have
&quot;sufficient&quot; insulin.

Write a definition of &quot;sufficient and insufficient&quot; which is tied to &quot;do you
have enough to process normal meals&quot; and suddenly lots of T2 have
&quot;insufficient&quot; insulin.

I agree with the latter approach to writing the definition because of my
reading of Dr. Hayden's papers and Slide 10 in the speech at
http://www.medscape.com/viewprogram/145 , i.e. the UKPDS established the
50% destruction at time of first diagnosis.

If we had a &quot;Lord High Doctor Czar of Diabetes&quot; to establish the
definitions, everybody would use the same terms in the same ways and these
discussions would be moot.

I lifted the &quot;overwhelming majority of Type 2 Diabetes have high Insulin
Resistance&quot; quote from a medical site. I prefer that approach since a
single instance of a T2 without high Insulin Resistance disproves the &quot;all&quot;
statement. If you write the definition based on the cause of beta cell
death you have a more clear cut separation between Type 1 and Type 2,
i.e. IAPP induced Apoptosis vs auto-immune episodes.

High Insulin Resistance is an extremely common co-factor perhaps the
universal co-factor; probably the underlying cause of all T2 in that it
accelerates the beta death rate so that &quot;insufficient insulin&quot; shows up
before the T2 dies of old age. Writing the definition based on the
mechanism of beta cell death is cleaner.
