Hi Group,

No doubt this has been discussed many a time before, but seeing as methods
and approaches are always evolving, I thought I'd start a fresh discussion
:-)

We have two cats who enjoy their scratch post, but don't always seem to be
bothered to move from one room to the other to make use of it. Their
favourite clawing spot seems to be the bottom step on our stairs, of which
the carpet has now been torn to shreds, right down to the actual wood!

Shouting at them gets their attention, but they soon return, I've also tried
a method, which I may have actually read on this group, of scenting the
stairs with lemon. I read cats take a particular dislike to this smell. But
this didn't help either. Though, cleaning the top of our TV with lemon
scented polish stopped them using it as a favourite sleeping spot.

Anyway, the time has come to re-carpet the stairs, and we are looking for
better methods of protecting the carpet. De-clawing is not an option, I
personally disapprove of it and simply denying them access to the stairs is
not a realistic option for us either.

I have seen this product available, called Sticky Paws, and I wondered if
anyone has used it at all? Does anyone have any comments on it, or
suggestions as to other methods?

Don't recarpet the stairs go with hard wood. Put scratching posts in all
rooms that the cats like to use furniture to scratch on. Also scent the
posts with a catnip tea. What are their posts covered with (carpet, sisal
rope, etc.)?

Where can I purchase catnip tea from? Is it something I can buy from usual
pet stores?

Thank you.

My cats enjoy sisal rope more then carpet on their posts.

To make the tea just soak some cat nip in water and then mist on the post.
