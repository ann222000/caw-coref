so, it's nearly a non-starter or loser for the gm workers usa, they're
screwed and gm stockholders are screwed too, the medical situation
seems insurmountable

so, gm usa can't &quot;fairly&quot; compete with toyota etal

of course, there is the complexity or myriad of other
dynamics and factors; but i can conceivably predict that in 18 months
the  democrats will take back the presidency and the senate, while
medical care is big and over-riding--including the votes of moderate,
reasonable republicans and independents  in some red states for the
democrat

however, i wouldn't order new white house drapes, because tv
commercials and personalities could convince people of near anything a
la harry and louise swiftboating type of bullshite

Being without health insurance is no big deal. Just ask President
Bush. &quot;I mean, people have access to health care in America,&quot; he said
last week. &quot;After all, you just go to an emergency room.&quot;

This is what you might call callousness with consequences. The White
House has announced that Mr. Bush will veto a bipartisan plan that
would extend health insurance, and with it such essentials as regular
checkups and preventive medical care, to an estimated 4.1 million
currently uninsured children. After all, it's not as if those kids
really need insurance - they can just go to emergency rooms, right?

O.K., it's not news that Mr. Bush has no empathy for people less
fortunate than himself. But his willful ignorance here is part of a
larger picture: by and large, opponents of universal health care paint
a glowing portrait of the American system that bears as little
resemblance to reality as the scare stories they tell about health
care in France, Britain, and Canada.

The claim that the uninsured can get all the care they need in
emergency rooms is just the beginning. Beyond that is the myth that
Americans who are lucky enough to have insurance never face long waits
for medical care.

Actually, the persistence of that myth puzzles me. I can understand
how people like Mr. Bush or Fred Thompson, who declared recently that
&quot;the poorest Americans are getting far better service&quot; than Canadians
or the British, can wave away the desperation of uninsured Americans,
who are often poor and voiceless. But how can they get away with
pretending that insured Americans always get prompt care, when most of
us can testify otherwise?

A recent article in Business Week put it bluntly: &quot;In reality, both
data and anecdotes show that the American people are already waiting
as long or longer than patients living with universal health-care
systems.&quot;

A cross-national survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund found that
America ranks near the bottom among advanced countries in terms of how
hard it is to get medical attention on short notice (although Canada
was slightly worse), and that America is the worst place in the
advanced world if you need care after hours or on a weekend.

We look better when it comes to seeing a specialist or receiving
elective surgery. But Germany outperforms us even on those measures -
and I suspect that France, which wasn't included in the study, matches
Germany's performance.

Besides, not all medical delays are created equal. In Canada and
Britain, delays are caused by doctors trying to devote limited medical
resources to the most urgent cases. In the United States, they're
often caused by insurance companies trying to save money.

This can lead to ordeals like the one recently described by Mark
Kleiman, a professor at U.C.L.A., who nearly died of cancer because
his insurer kept delaying approval for a necessary biopsy. &quot;It was
only later,&quot; writes Mr. Kleiman on his blog, &quot;that I discovered why
the insurance company was stalling; I had an option, which I didn't
know I had, to avoid all the approvals by going to 'Tier II,' which
would have meant higher co-payments.&quot;

He adds, &quot;I don't know how many people my insurance company waited to
death that year, but I'm certain the number wasn't zero.&quot;

To be fair, Mr. Kleiman is only surmising that his insurance company
risked his life in an attempt to get him to pay more of his treatment
costs. But there's no question that some Americans who seemingly have
good insurance nonetheless die because insurers are trying to hold
down their &quot;medical losses&quot; - the industry term for actually having to
pay for care.

On the other hand, it's true that Americans get hip replacements
faster than Canadians. But there's a funny thing about that example,
which is used constantly as an argument for the superiority of private
health insurance over a government-run system: the large majority of
hip replacements in the United States are paid for by, um, Medicare.

That's right: the hip-replacement gap is actually a comparison of two
government health insurance systems. American Medicare has shorter
waits than Canadian Medicare (yes, that's what they call their system)
because it has more lavish funding - end of story. The alleged virtues
of private insurance have nothing to do with it.

The bottom line is that the opponents of universal health care appear
to have run out of honest arguments. All they have left are fantasies:
horror fiction about health care in other countries, and fairy tales
about health care here in America.
