Dear drumkit/drumset-playing friend,

We are writing to inquire if you'd like to take part in a performance
on friday, 7 september 2007 in Philadelphia, PA.  That evening, we
will take a shot at creating the world's first human accelerator (50
drummers drumming, 15 dancers moving, 2 videomakers projecting, and
one accelerator ring).  As you may know, particle accelerators
basically smash things up just to see what happens.  Our experiment
will basically take the same approach with people in place of
subatomic particles.  The &quot;thinking&quot; here is that the chance of
something interesting happening may increase whenever you bring lots
of people together.

Our particular experiment was designed with the help of the kind
experts at Fermilab &lt; http://www.fnal.gov/ &gt;.  Their machine achieves
about 2 million proton-antiproton collisions per second.
This project has no federal funding so we're shooting for about 25
every 20 minutes.  The experiments will be free and open to the
public.  As such, unless the DoE authorizes the allocation of a
emergency funding request, you will be volunteering your scientific
expertise along with everyone else involved should you decide to sign
on.

If you are interested/available, please read on.

nitty gritty:
date: friday, 7 september 2007
location: northwest corner of 2nd &amp; Race
run times: 7:45PM, 8:30 &amp; 9:30 (each set is approximately 20 minutes)
load-in/setup: TBA - afternoon
rain date: it won't rain (just keep saying this, please)
url: http://www.principlesofuncertainty.org/

standard equipment:
1 high hat
1 snare drum
1 foot-operated bass drum
1 tom
1 cymbal

The experiment will not be traditionally notated, involve some
ensemble playing, and frequently require individual choices be made
with respect to the folks running around and the moving images on
site.  It won't be too easy or too hard, and will hopefully yield
several plot points along the Gallagher-Schrödnakis
waterstochcaticmelon continuum.  It will likely get a little chaotic
at times but I would definitely not characterize this as a free-for-all.

So, what do you think?

If you'd like to sign up, please reply send a message to
&lt;tevat ... @principlesofuncertainty.org&gt; at your earliest convenience
with the following info:

1. legal name (and whether or not you want this used publicly)
2. mexican wrestling name (i.e. Cher, K-Fed, Ricky the Steamboat
Dragon...)
3. email address
4. telephone (mobile #, if you don't mind..)

thank you,
Team PoU

P.S. please feel free to forward this to any Philadelphia drumset-
playing friends/relatives you think may be interested.
