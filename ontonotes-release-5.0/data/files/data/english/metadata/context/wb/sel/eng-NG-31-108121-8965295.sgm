Once again, Bret, you have raised the standard of your work.

Your composition is superb, and these images are technically
faultless.  You have achieved a level of competence much higher than I
ever thought you would, and you continue to improve.

Time for that book.

I don't believe it!  It's my good friend Spike!!  I've missed you!
Very sharp and clean portrait of our friend, Bret.  Fantastic.
I LOVE that hummingbird shot!  Her wings are captured in a way that
shows movement, and that's what you want to achieve.  But I especially
like the ghost-effect (not sure what you call it but that's what it
looks like to me), of the wings.  By far your best hummer shot yet,
IMHO.
The butterfly shots are spectacular!  The colors are vibrant and the
bokeh is beautifully creamy.
Superb job.....again!

You could never accuse Bret of not putting your generous gift to very,
very good use, Helen!

Yes, that is very true.  But in all fairness Bret deserves the credit
for being generous.  He has helped me with many matters and has
generously given me  priceless gifts.

Great shots Bret! The DOF is perfect on all the shots.
Try zooming in on Spikes eye on your original, there may be enough
detail to see your own reflection.

Very nice, though I get the impression they're about 1/3 - 1/2 stop over
exposed.  Feather detail in spike in the white area below the eye
(cheek) and again on the neck is washed white.

Agreed, though it's not blown, so easy to adjust:

Optimal exposure, it's just nice to darken in processing.

Really nice work though Brett!

The light window is the original exposure.

Ah, of course.  Read it backwards.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The dynamic range of the original image is lost when converted to JPG.
One of the first steps in RAW import is to tame the highlights or lift
the shaddows.  Once the image is in JPG you have a whole lot less to
work with.  You don't know how much of the RGB channels was clipped from
the original... eg: the R channel might be more clipped than the green.

Nothing was blown in R,G or B and nothing needed to be stretched
(lightened) only compressed, so there's really no harm in working from
the jpeg. I did compress it heavily, from 300K to 66K.

By compression I mean DR not file size.

How would you know what was left out when it was DR compressed to JPG?
On compression for JPG, the worst of R|G|B would be set to 255 (by
channel) and everything else below that... only the RAW would tell the
real story.

Right, sorry for confusion mentioning that.

&gt; How would you know what was left out when it was DR compressed to JPG?
&gt; On compression for JPG, the worst of R|G|B would be set to 255 (by
&gt; channel) and everything else below that... only the RAW would tell the
&gt; real story.

Well we agree it still looks overexposed, the 3 color histogram is not
blown for any channel and I doubt he lightened anything. There is no
harm in darkening a jpeg; nothing a raw file can gain in the DR because
the DR is being reduced for the desired look.

Interesting.  It *looks* overexposed, but it isn't, at least according
to the histograms.  Since Spike was in deep shade he probably was
actually darker than he appears in the pic.  That's one case where a
more accurate representation would probably be less attractive.
Accuracy is overrated.

Indeed.  If you're right, then you would do right to tone it down 1/2
stop to bring out some detail in the white feathers.

All of my cammies are Fabulous!
I considered &quot;Fantastic 40D.&quot;
Perhaps &quot;The Fortuitous 40D&quot; would be more apt?
Nah, too hard to spell.

AH HA!! I knew it! You are an artsie-fartsie. Pretending to be a
technophyle all these years. A Techie would always rate accuracy over
*looks* any time. hehe

Bret, you always blow my mind with the images you are able to create.
A lot of folks agree with that as well. Doesn't matter if you are a
techie or an artsie. To produce the quality of work and the amount you
do requires you to be both. Ms Helen was wise to help you achieve more
of your goals of producing better quality work. I know you wont let
her down nor the rest of the NG.

Keep at it. Keep showing us the way you shot and the equipment and
settings you use. Maybe one day I might be lucky enough to produce
images of your quality. For now, I'm happy to have them come out good
enough for newspapers.
