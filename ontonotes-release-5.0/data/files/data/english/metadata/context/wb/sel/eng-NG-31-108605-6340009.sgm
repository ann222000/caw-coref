I am curious - what can a modern US aircraft carrier actually deliver,
munitions-wise? That, after all, is its raison-d'etre, to a large degree
(not entirely, since it can support a sea flank in the air against enemy
air).

To the extent that it's not classified, what might the strike aircraft of a
typical carrier be able to drop, in total? That is, every bomb and ASM on
the ship. This is no different a question than asking how many rounds are on
a NGFS ship, and what their percentage breakdown by type is - info that I
got routinely as a spotter.

The reason I'm curious is, this has to do with whether or not we need
carriers any more. I myself think we do, if for no other reason that they
have flexibility that programmed munitions currently don't, and they do
allow forced entry into a region where nobody gives us a base for
short-ranged ac. I do however believe that other platforms may be more
efficient now at carrying the load for most of the strike missions.

To look at a very extreme example, what's better? A landing craft loaded
with rockets, or a Navy ac launched off a USN carrier that carries rockets
for ground attack? Me myself I'd say the landing craft - it's a hell of a
lot cheaper.

Also, and I hate to say this, what crisis blows up so bloody fast that you
really need to have a carrier air wing on station to do land strikes? With
the politicians in DC it takes a few days or weeks to decide what to do. The
USAF can surge pretty fast, and once they do, they have lots more assets.
Hell, they can have bombers in the air from Day One and get there about the
same time as Navy planes off a carrier do, and deliver at least as much
ordnance.

As you can tell, I am a layman struggling to make sense of carriers in the
21st century. I am certain that many legislators are too. It's a tough sell
when you look at the fact that the actual strike capability of a modern US
supercarrier is not exactly that great for the cost of producing the final
effect - in fact it's rather shitty. Like I said above, I see some reasons
for retaining carriers, but I'm sure many people don't.

For starters, though, I'd be really curious as to how much warload a carrier
has, roughly?

LCI(R)s or modern NGFS ships may not - although inland these days (or in the
medium future) may mean 50-100nm for the latter. But for anything but a
strike that needs to be done really quickly, you only need carriers to do
those deep strikes if you have no basing agreements.

And so would any other military unit, including a USAF unit based in the
Middle East or planes flying from Europe or the US. Most of the carrier
group is defending and supporting *itself*. You'd get more bang for the

operations.

I conceded that, Jim - that's really the only reason for keeping carriers,
actually.

What I was curious about, though, is again specifically this - how much
stuff can a carrier throw against targets. Not compared to anything else - I
mean straight numbers of bombs and missiles. IOW, what do the magazines
hold?

No. And apart from range considerations (that can be solved with different
munitions and improved 5" guns) you really don't need anything bigger. A
155mm AGS is only an inch larger in diameter. For NGFS the 5" has always
been a decent calibre, it 's just that the range has sucked. Marine spotters
normally equated a single 5"/54 mount with a 155mm battery of howitzers,
although the comparison is rough.

What would really solve the NGFS problem is lots of 5" or 6" (155mm) ships
that don't have so many other roles that they can't be dedicated to
supporting Marines. IOW, the ships cannot be better at doing AAW to defend a
carrier.

I always wondered, why is it that that the gators themselves aren't
festooned with the guns that could support the very same Marines that are
swimming ashore in AAVs. As if it couldn't be done...bullshit.

Your time in the Corps was a long time ago Arved, your experience is
dated.  As far back as Kosovo, RPT (Rapid Precision Targeting) allowed
aircraft already on a mission to be redirected to new missions with
target packages uploaded to the Aviators display. From the China Lake
(NAWCWD) website.

"RPTS. Sensor to shooter. Time critical targeting packages developed.

During the air war in Kosovo, it was not unusual for an allied pilot
in the midst of a mission to receive an urgent message redirecting the
aircraft to a time-critical target. That target might be a threat
convoy, a mobile artillery unit or an aircraft temporarily camouflaged
at a remote airfield. On the cockpit digital display indicator, the
pilot would receive a new targeting package consisting of target
coordinates, timely imagery, annotated maps and other pertinent
information. The process of "rapid precision targeting" is part of the
larger "sensor to shooter" scenario that involves identifying a
potential target, obtaining strike authorization, preparing a
targeting package and transmitting that package to a strike pilot in
the area. (1992 - 1996)"

This technology and process has been advanced to the point where
aircraft will actually loiter at a designated spot and wait for their
mission in the air.  An FO or other SpecWar type can identify a new
target, annotate information, and get it to the pilot (Often going
through an intermediate facility to 'approve' the designated target.)
The pilot gets the data package and heads to his target within
minutes.
As a sidenote, before I took my last job I was on the short-list to
go over to Italy and man the RPT facility, it was our group that
developed it.

A USN-CV battle group is one of the most magnificient shows man has
ever staged.  The current equipment is designed to fight a high tech
war that only Russia and China have the faintest hope of challenging.
These three giant countries cannot go to war against each other at any
level of conflict because that would surely escalate into a nuclear
war that will be mutually ruinous and unwinnable.  In any case even if
the US can mass all the CV groups to fight a conventional war against
Russia or China there won't be enough aircraft nor bomb tonnage to win
the fight.  But this (same) total CV force is small enough that any
extensive period of operations such vast geography will surely ruin
it.   So the USN-CV group is used against lesser countries that cannot
even resist a single CV group from the Vietnam era.  In other words
all these latest supersized, super expensive and super teched
equipment is way way overkill.  The real story on the effrectiveness
of modern CV forces will best be seen in the "kills" per dollar
analysis.

Point taken, Sean. This is actually very cool stuff, thanks for the info.

You're quite right, I am dated, and I strive to keep abreast of what has
happened in the past 15 years through reading or posts such as yours just
now. Certainly back in the late '80's we would not have expected fixed-wing
air to operate that way, although CIFS did often have that role.

My observation regarding arty may be dated too, for all I know. Back in the
day it generally was *not* the case that most artillery fires were targets
of opportunity - we planned the hell out of stuff. Quick fire plans,
deliberate fire plans, targets plotted all over the map. Ironically a lot of
the fire planning went to arty and NGF SEADs, where both the tubes and the
planes were highly regimented. It's not that an arty FO wouldn't
occasionally see a sweet target that just popped up and do a quick CFF, but
the meat and drink of the artillery was planned missions. But things may
have changed there too.

As far as the comment in what you included, the FO going through an
intermediate facility to approve the target, I would hope so. In any
scenario, including old-style or RPT, you do need to have the FSC (fire
support coordination) layer interposed between requester and doer. In my
experience - having worked both the pointy end (spotter/FOO tech/fire
support man aka enlisted FO) and also coordination (Bn NGLO/Regt FSCC) - the
more experienced people get the coordination-liaison spots, and have the
knowledge and the experience and the information to make the call on whether
or not the CFF is justified, and if it is, whether to modify it.

To an extent targets of opportunity have always been there for air also.
Back in WW2 I don't expect that all of the Typhoons shooting and rocketing
the shit out of Germans in the Falaise pocket were actually given 6-digit
grid references  as to what they were supposed to kill. Nevertheless, their
missions weren't RPT either, exactly.

From another perspective one can argue that the carrier groups are not
overkill at all, because the mere threat of them, or the presence of them,
already accomplishes policy aims. Hence, there may be low "kills per
dollar", but still very high value per dollar. I myself would not contest
that argument at the strategic level.

I do think however that other platforms - notably cruise missiles, USAF ac
flying from CONUS even, ICBMs or SLBMs with conventional warheads (note -
perhaps not right now, but the idea has been bruited), long range USA and
USMC tube and rocket artillery - are now taking major roles in being able to
put ordnance on target quickly on targets where once only carrier air could
have been able to do that.

So that's why I am interested in how much munitions tonnage US carriers
actually have. You need to know that in order to have an informed argument.

As to conventional wars against Russia or China, in the present, I think the
US could win against either China or Russia right now, given the right
political circumstances. They could not do it *right now*, because I believe
that to attack China the US would need Russia as an ally, if for nothing
more than to allow overflight, basing and staging, and Putin is not buddies
with Bush at the moment. But if Russia did cooperate it could be done.
Russia I believe could be attacked without Chinese support - the eastern
European countries butting up against Russia tend to be fairly US-friendly
(for obvious reasons), and the carriers would be of effect in the Arctic and
the Pacific.

I don't know that a conventional conflict against either country would
result in nuclear war. I'm certain that the US would use a Spetsnaz strategy
of decapitating everyone who could possibly make a decision about pushing
buttons well before the decision had to be made. It wouldn't be so tough,
with preparation, not in these enlightened political times. Wrt Russia, for
example, the US must know down to the last detail who commands everything
down to regiment or below (if they don't they should be fired). That means
you can put in assassination teams disguised as tourists or biznismen a week
beforehand, and on a signal take out the entire leadership structure. If you
simultaneously assault ICBM fields and shoot every Russian sub you know of,
I doubt that the Russians will be fighting total nuclear war.

:&gt;&gt; munitions-wise? That, after all, is its raison-d'etre, to a large
:&gt;&gt; degree (not entirely, since it can support a sea flank in the air
:&gt;&gt; against enemy air).
:&gt;&gt;
:&gt;&gt; To the extent that it's not classified, what might the strike aircraft
:&gt;&gt; of a typical carrier be able to drop, in total? That is, every bomb
:&gt;&gt; and ASM on the ship. This is no different a question than asking how
:&gt;&gt; many rounds are on a NGFS ship, and what their percentage breakdown by
:&gt;&gt; type is - info that I got routinely as a spotter.
:&gt;&gt;
:&gt;&gt; The reason I'm curious is, this has to do with whether or not we need
:&gt;&gt; carriers any more. I myself think we do, if for no other reason that
:&gt;&gt; they have flexibility that programmed munitions currently don't, and
:&gt;&gt; they do allow forced entry into a region where nobody gives us a base
:&gt;&gt; for short-ranged ac. I do however believe that other platforms may be
:&gt;&gt; more efficient now at carrying the load for most of the strike
:&gt;&gt; missions.
:&gt;&gt;
:&gt;&gt; To look at a very extreme example, what's better? A landing craft
:&gt;&gt; loaded with rockets, or a Navy ac launched off a USN carrier that
:&gt;&gt; carries rockets for ground attack? Me myself I'd say the landing craft
:&gt;&gt; - it's a hell of a lot cheaper.
:&gt;
:&gt; the LC will not spot targets of opportunity.
:
:Targets of opportunity are out of style except for artillery, and not even
:that much then. In six years in the Corps I never heard of ac that just
:loitered over the battlefield looking for shit...they were all tasked
:already.

You should get out more.  This is frequently done with aircraft
carrying PGMs, which 'loiter' around as 'on call' fire and receive
'pop-up' targets via radio.

:&gt; They may not have the range to threaten inland targets,nor interdict
:&gt; supply lines.
:
:LCI(R)s or modern NGFS ships may not - although inland these days (or in the
:medium future) may mean 50-100nm for the latter. But for anything but a
:strike that needs to be done really quickly, you only need carriers to do
:those deep strikes if you have no basing agreements.

Which we frequently don't and certainly cannot rely on.

Hint:  There were *FIVE* carriers servicing targets in Iraq during the
Second Gulf War.

:&gt; what happens after the LC shoots off it's loadout? I doubt any LC will
:&gt; have the munitions that an entire carrier can carry.
:
:Well, that was my question actually. :-)

I doubt anyone has a good answer.  However, it really doesn't matter
since carriers can receive ordnance from replenishment ships while on
station.  Ask yourself how long we kept carriers 'on line' at Yankee
Station during Vietnam.  Figure they were launching at least one
full-deck alpha strike per day.

I think it's safe to say that the magazine capacity of a modern
supercarrier is measured in the thousands of tons.  Figure that a
full-deck strike will take around 100 tons of ordnance inshore. Figure
that a carrier can sustain a rate of one such strike per day until
they run out of fuel and ammo or two such strikes per day for short
periods.

:&gt;&gt; Also, and I hate to say this, what crisis blows up so bloody fast that
:&gt;&gt; you really need to have a carrier air wing on station to do land
:&gt;&gt; strikes? With the politicians in DC it takes a few days or weeks to
:&gt;&gt; decide what to do. The USAF can surge pretty fast, and once they do,
:&gt;&gt; they have lots more assets. Hell, they can have bombers in the air
:&gt;&gt; from Day One and get there about the same time as Navy planes off a
:&gt;&gt; carrier do, and deliver at least as much ordnance.
:&gt;
:&gt; I'm not so sure about USAF planes arriving in time like carrier-based AC
:&gt; would,if the carrier was in range.Land-based AC would take much longer to
:&gt; arrive.
:
:That was my point about crises. I think the time envelope is large enough
:for most situations to allow the USAF to arrive.

Assuming they have someplace to arrive at and that you can get a base
set up for them.  All that comes 'ready made' with an aircraft
carrier.

:&gt; Also,AC malfunctions need be considered;if a plane malfs,then a carrier can
:&gt; launch another quickly,but to get another land-based AC in the theater will
:&gt; take much longer.
:
:Not a consideration if you already have enough land-based ac in theatre.

Yep.  If you assume you have enough land-based aircraft everywhere in
the world with fully equipped bases, then aircraft carriers become
unnecessary.

Of course, if you assume we can all just get along you don't need a
military at all.

:What I was curious about, though, is again specifically this - how much
:stuff can a carrier throw against targets. Not compared to anything else - I
:mean straight numbers of bombs and missiles. IOW, what do the magazines
:hold?

My best guess is several thousand tons, based on sizing of
replenishment ships intended to operated with fast carrier task
forces.  This also works out well if you assume that a carrier strike
is around 100 tons of munitions (~50 aircraft with 2 tons of bombs per
aircraft), carriers can sustain 1 full strike per day pretty much
indefinitely, and typical 'on line' time for things like Vietnam was
2-4 weeks 'on line'.  That seems to get you 2,000-3,000 tons of bombs
as a minimum, which is roughly what modern ammo ships can deliver.

I think you are partially right, and partially wrong. All of my NGF
aide-memoires include the LHA's...in the 5"/54 configuration.

In my copy of a 1988 SACC Handbook produced by NAS Coronado, there's a
telling little footnote to the Tarawa's - it says: "The LHA will not provide
NGF support under ordinary circumstances". That leads me to believe - and
certainly did 20 years ago - that if they ever had a vague intention of
using those guns for NGFS it disappeared pretty quick.

I dispute that - big gators are big ships - they can handle a couple of 5"
mounts. The LPDs at times had 4, albeit for self-defence. The reason for
having the guns on the gators is that when Mama (the carrier 100 miles
offshore) gets threatened, all the kids (the gunships) scurry off to protect
Mama. The Navy has a propensity to do that, and I've seen it happen. Recall
Guadalcanal, Fred?

No, that's why the Marines have Marine air, and that's why guns on gators
aren't such a bad idea. The USN looks after Navy first, Marines second, Army
third, and probably doesn't know the USAF exists.

OK, that's the kind of stuff I was looking for. It seems plausible.

I realize that an exact analysis is impossible, because of resupply. You
can't say that an arty battery only has so much stuff either, because
eventually it will get a new dump of ammo. But there is sort of an "organic"
capability - what does a carrier actually carry, and what does a arty
battery actually have on its trucks - this is what I was getting at.

Based on your figures I'd say that a carrier is still better than the
alternatives.

&gt; No. And apart from range considerations (that can be solved with different

Largely because if you took a 30 minute gator ride

I'd say that quite often that's the case - though the carrier gives you
the flexibility to enable the other platforms. Carrier air can get where
it's needed without squabbles over basing rights ("you can shuttle
tankers and transports but no weapons even as cargo") to knock back the
enemy air defences and provide or support pre- and post-strike

aircraft to do the heavy hitting.

It *can* do a lot of the strike work if nothing else is available, but
as you say other platforms may be better for the role.

the carrier? Sink the UNREP ships. Do they get a SSN escort with an AEGIS

No, though they may not be left totally undefended either. A frigate to
escort them, and some MPA cover to radar-flood the limiting lines of
approach, perhaps, if there's a threat that merits it.

The problem is that in open ocean they're operating on the far side of
the carrier, so either they're with the CVBG (in which case you have to
get through all those defensive layers - so why not just nail the
carrier?) or else you have to sneak around /through the CVBG's operating
area without being spotted in order to find the replen ship.

And the usual problems with DE boats: you're sneaky but you're slow.
Even if you pick up where an AOR is, are you able to intercept and
engage?

It's a valid tactic when feasible, but you need the numbers of DE boats
to be able to throw out a patrol line over where you think the AOR will
pass; or some other means of cueing the boat to a stealthy intercept.

The initial UNREP package is probably a fast supply ship that is
operating with the CVBG.  Otherwise, I'd expect what kind of escort
they would get would depend on the threat and that availability of
forces.

Why go after the carrier?  Because a carrier can UNREP other ships but
an UNREP vessel cannot launch air strikes.  Ships to bring bombs to
the carrier are easier, faster, and cheaper to build than a carrier.
The carrier can, if necessary, go into port to replenish.  A
replenishment ship with nothing to replenish is useless.  A carrier
with no replenishment will still tear you a new asshole.

&gt; The initial UNREP package is probably a fast supply ship that is

Good points, Fred.

I would however argue that an UNREP ship does not enjoy the protection
afforded to CSGs or ESGs when she is in transit. I doubt that such a ship
has escorts that will foil a determined DE sub, if the attack happens
outside the protected zone of a group.

You're quite correct - the primary target is still the carrier. But you may
not be able to sink it. Hence, impair its mission effectiveness. Hence, sink
the UNREP ships.

And what port is that, that the carrier is going to go into? One of the
selling points of floating airfields is that USN carriers don't need
friendly ports. Perhaps there might not be one especially close when the
magazines get empty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The reason I'm curious is, this has to do with whether or not we need
&gt;&gt;&gt;carriers any more. I myself think we do, if for no other reason that they
&gt;&gt;&gt;have flexibility that programmed munitions currently don't, and they do
&gt;&gt;&gt;allow forced entry into a region where nobody gives us a base for
&gt;&gt;&gt;short-ranged ac. I do however believe that other platforms may be more
&gt;&gt;&gt;efficient now at carrying the load for most of the strike missions.

&gt;&gt; A USN-CV battle group is one of the most magnificient shows man has
&gt;&gt; ever staged.  The current equipment is designed to fight a high tech
&gt;&gt; war that only Russia and China have the faintest hope of challenging.
&gt;&gt; These three giant countries cannot go to war against each other at any
&gt;&gt; level of conflict because that would surely escalate into a nuclear
&gt;&gt; war that will be mutually ruinous and unwinnable.  In any case even if
&gt;&gt; the US can mass all the CV groups to fight a conventional war against
&gt;&gt; Russia or China there won't be enough aircraft nor bomb tonnage to win
&gt;&gt; the fight.  But this (same) total CV force is small enough that any
&gt;&gt; extensive period of operations such vast geography will surely ruin
&gt;&gt; it.   So the USN-CV group is used against lesser countries that cannot
&gt;&gt; even resist a single CV group from the Vietnam era.  In other words
&gt;&gt; all these latest supersized, super expensive and super teched
&gt;&gt; equipment is way way overkill.  The real story on the effrectiveness
&gt;&gt; of modern CV forces will best be seen in the &quot;kills&quot; per dollar
&gt;&gt; analysis.

&gt;From another perspective one can argue that the carrier groups are not
&gt;overkill at all, because the mere threat of them, or the presence of them,
&gt;already accomplishes policy aims. Hence, there may be low &quot;kills per
&gt;dollar&quot;, but still very high value per dollar. I myself would not contest
&gt;that argument at the strategic level.

&gt;I do think however that other platforms - notably cruise missiles, USAF ac
&gt;flying from CONUS even, ICBMs or SLBMs with conventional warheads (note -
&gt;perhaps not right now, but the idea has been bruited), long range USA and
&gt;USMC tube and rocket artillery - are now taking major roles in being able to
&gt;put ordnance on target quickly on targets where once only carrier air could
&gt;have been able to do that.

&gt;So that's why I am interested in how much munitions tonnage US carriers
&gt;actually have. You need to know that in order to have an informed argument.

&gt;As to conventional wars against Russia or China, in the present, I think the
&gt;US could win against either China or Russia right now, given the right
&gt;political circumstances. They could not do it *right now*, because I believe
&gt;that to attack China the US would need Russia as an ally, if for nothing
&gt;more than to allow overflight, basing and staging, and Putin is not buddies
&gt;with Bush at the moment. But if Russia did cooperate it could be done.
&gt;Russia I believe could be attacked without Chinese support - the eastern
&gt;European countries butting up against Russia tend to be fairly US-friendly
&gt;(for obvious reasons), and the carriers would be of effect in the Arctic and
&gt;the Pacific.

&gt;I don't know that a conventional conflict against either country would
&gt;result in nuclear war. I'm certain that the US would use a Spetsnaz strategy
&gt;of decapitating everyone who could possibly make a decision about pushing
&gt;buttons well before the decision had to be made. It wouldn't be so tough,
&gt;with preparation, not in these enlightened political times. Wrt Russia, for
&gt;example, the US must know down to the last detail who commands everything
&gt;down to regiment or below (if they don't they should be fired). That means
&gt;you can put in assassination teams disguised as tourists or biznismen a week
&gt;beforehand, and on a signal take out the entire leadership structure. If you
&gt;simultaneously assault ICBM fields and shoot every Russian sub you know of,
&gt;I doubt that the Russians will be fighting total nuclear war.

===============================

Wow, a wannabe Conan the Barbarian on the loose.

1.  In the run up to a US first strike on China there will be a long
build-up of tensions.  China's most predictable and pre-emptive
response will be to unload her multibillion dollar holdings (will
exceed a trillion this year) of US debt.   These are bearer securities
and have no identity as to owner origin.   It's a sovereign promise by
the US government to meet its debt obligations.  Fail that and your
financial system crashes. Without money in the bank you have no means
of financing your everyday imports let alone a war.

Your current adventure in Iraq and Afghanistan is financed by
countries, especially China, Japan and the Asian countries willing to
lend the US money by taking on US debt.  You already have no
possibility of paying back this debt in your life time.  A Chinese
abandonment of the USD and every country will unload their USD
holdings too before they become worthless paper.  The world can get
along by bartering or by tightening their belts until the smoke
clears.  At present the US already hardly makes anything the rest of
the world wants (thus the humongous deficit) and hardly make ordinary
consumer goods for herself anymore.  You will have nothing with which
to barter for with other countries especially if it is to pay for oil
imports.  You wouldn't even have the means to continue your average
American lifestyle let alone the means to fight a global war.

2.  Some 160,00 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and already you are
scraping the bottom of the barrel and would have run out of options
this time next year.  Another year of operations and your military
will be fatally ruined on manpower,  morale, fighting ability and in
equipment.  The US will take at least two presidential administrations
to rebuild to pre GWII levels, not to superwar status.   What is more
dangerous will be the loss of intelligent and  morally balanced minds
who will not enlist because of the erosion of the fine institutions
once so admired by everyone.  What will be left will be the type of
leaders you have now, and maybe worse, whose knee jerk reactions to
any situation is to shoot first then figure out the whys later.  Your
post and many in this newsgroup places you in this exalted company.

The rest of the world can read the same coffee grounds (aka tea
leaves).  Even your best friends in the EU are distancing themselves
from you.  The US is still the world's premier economic and military
power though in a long term decline .  You will still have many
countries extending the normal diplomatic courtesies to US officials
no matter how unpopular.  But no one will be so incautious as to
unquestionably support US causes or ally themselves with the US ever
again.  The result will be a multipolar world where the US will be
just another country at the conference table.

3.      While the US still stuck on a self flagellation mode and seek
new and ever bigger wars to fight the world is moving on.  A good
example is the Trans Asian Railway project
http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IC21Df01.html [India gets
aboard the Trans-Asian Railway   The Trans-Asian Railway, one of the
most economically and culturally important transport projects in
modern history, is chugging forward at speed now that New Delhi has
signed an intergovernmental agreement to connect 32 Asian countries to
Europe by 2015. - Raja M] as well as Trans Asia Road, oil and gas
pipelines, and joint infrastructure development projects the details
of which can be found in the archives of AsiaTimes online
http://www.atimes.com/ .

I had deleted my long rebuttal on your scenario for a possible US
attack on China.    As posited above the US is in no position to fight
a war with China for at least two US administrations.  That is another
12 to 20 years, way too far into the future for China to worry about.
Based on the present trends  the US will become increasingly impotent
militarily and economically.  Technological improvements will make
supercarriers and ultra expensive planes anachronisms in the future
battlefield.  There won't be any big wars in any case as the world now
has viable alternatives in China, Russia and perhaps the EU, India and
some others to trade with for technology goods that make modern life
possible and ignore the US altogether.  And no country will be so
idiotic as to invite the US to intervene in their quarrels for that
will spell their own subjugation and/or destruction.

I think there are probably creative ways around that. One might be simply
that the US says that it cannot honour the debts of a country, or citizens
of a country, that it is at war with, because to do so would be to finance
the enemy. I think other debtors will find no flaw in that logic.

You mention a long build-up of tensions. As it happens we've been in that
stage since the late '40's. I haven't seen the PRC unload anything. It would
actually be quite easy for the US to sneak an attack past China - all that
needs to be done is initial sabre-rattling at North Korea (and despite
current thawing of the ice from 12" to 11", DPRK won't be normal any decade
soon), and the PRC won't be all that surprised that there are extra US
forces just off her shore.

people, but not good at programming.

12-20 years is too far into the future?!? That's hardly a Chinese
perspective. 12-20 years is an eyeblink - even the US thinks that way.

In any case, if China becomes too powerful there is a possibility that the
US - in 2030 or 2050, whenever - will smack her down. All it takes is a
provocation, perhaps over Taiwan, and then the US can sink half the Chinese
merchant fleet, bomb the shit out of Beijing and Shanghai, and destroy all
your missile sites.

Me myself I 'd do that right now. You can call me Conan the Barbarian, but
the fact is the Chinese are our enemies, by and large. They are not friendly
to my way of life. They smile and smile when we see them as businessmen and
diplomats, but they mean us no goodwill. They need a slap, and a hard one.

What folks like PaPaPeng miss is that China dumping US securities
doesn't hurt us nearly as much as it hurts China.  They're causing the
value of securities they hold to plummet.  Meanwhile, they haven't
really hurt the US very much because we don't have to redeem them just
because China is selling them.  It is, however, the perfect
opportunity to redeem some early while the prices are depressed.

Meanwhile, the effect on the domestic credit market (where the US
government gets most of its loans) is minimal.

By all means, I hope China is stupid enough to take his advice.
Nothing like having the other fellow implode by crashing his own
financial markets, after all.

"Far enough outside" is a pretty broad area - like most of the planet. When
I floated with 4th MEB back in GW1, it seemed like we were doing UNREPsand
VERTREPs all the time - God knows I was in the chain passing shit from
flight deck to lockers often enough. But it seems to me that the
replenishment ships had to come from somewhere, and if you're being
replenished in the North Arabian Sea, they probably did not pick up stores
and fuel in Oman or Yemen or Iran. We were out there for over half a year,
and I assume that the support ships did not carry enough stuff to supply a
MEB for that period of time. I know they didn't, because we continually saw
new ones. That means that they all were sailing from us to a point where
they could load up, and then back to us.

I don't know where those points were, where they loaded up, but they weren't
close. We were essentially out in the Indian Ocean at some times. An SSK in
the Red Sea, or parked just outside, or near the Straits of Hormuz, or near
the Straits of Malacca, is going to cause alarm, but when it starts sinking
supply vessels you've got a lot of square miles to search, and a lot of
ships need to be diverted to look for the subs.

I agree - if you get inside the screen then you go for the carrier, and
you're probably dead along with the carrier.

My premise with the rep ships was simply that you nail them well outside the

They are pretty big ships, aren't they? :-) What you just said is pretty
much how you'd logically tackle a super carrier - you win if you achieve a
mission kill. Either take out it's steering/propulsion, and/or crater its
flight deck. You'll also be doing significant damage if you whack the
elevators.

As to sinking one, I figure a 500 KT fission bomb ought to do 'er.

">

No. My current electronics suite is all Asian. So is my car. That to me is
not indicative of anything other than the fact that China uses cheap labour.

Besides, China is training her people in the US, Canada and other Western
countries. There must be a reason for that. Namely, we are better at
innovation.

I am relatively unconcerned about Russia, India and China. India is hobbled
by caste, and that goes back centuries - they won't shrug that off any time
soon. Russia is dysfunctional like it's been for nearly a millennium. China
is like the Arabs - a glorious heyday way away back when, but now pretty
weak as a society...and also communist, which screws them from the gitgo.

Like I said in another post, I've worked with Indians and Chinese
practically off the boat. Come to think of it, Russians also. The ones that
come over here are presumably fairly good, but they by no means outshine
native North Americans. I could program their asses into the dirt. They are
hierarchical, submissive, and unimaginative. As long as their cultures stay
the way they are, we have little to fear from them.

I recall one contract I had in 2004, in Houston. One of the co-workers was
an Indian. Very bright, well-spoken. One of the project leads was also
Indian, also high-caste. It just so happened that one of the other
programmers was a fellow Nova Scotian, and he was struggling a bit. The
Indian dude was treating him like a slave. I guess over in India the
untouchables get used to that.

Finally I snapped a bit, and I did it in public in front of every person in
the room, which was about 20 people. The team included in total 5 Indians. I
reamed his ass like a Marine NCO can do. I just basically told him that if
he tells my buddy one more time that he's slow and stupid (that is the
language that he was using), he can eat knuckles and knees. I told him that
he was a pisspoor team lead (which he was), and I told him why. I also let
him know that the shit he programmed might not stand up well to a code
review.

At the end of it, he was very quiet. High caste Indians don't expect to be
brutalized verbally that way.

The funny thing is, at the end of the day, my popularity went up with all
the non-Indians, and everyone of the other Indians. Because he'd been
treating the other Indians like dirt also, except for the project lead. The
project lead just thought he was an asshole, so she enjoyed seeing him taken
down a few pegs.

Point being, we are not screwed up the way those societies are. The fact is,
the majority of Russians, Chinese and Indians are dirt poor. They can build
my TV, but they can't feed most of their people properly.

Considering that they use what amounts to slave labour, the best thing the
President could do is just announce a trade embargo on India and China. It
might fuck up Walmart (which wouldn't bother me), but it would get jobs back
here.

Fred's comment about relative construction speeds is however verging

I think the original poster has a valid point - the best way to reduce
an army in the field or a fleet at sea is to eliminate its ability to
continue the fight.  One way is to attack it directly - another is to
reduce its ability to remain deployed and combat ready.  A CVBG is a
frightening and lethal package, but one with resupply is considerably
less so.  Fred is correct that a CVN can UNREP the remainder of the
BG, but that capability is not infinite.

&gt;&gt; Wow, a wannabe Conan the Barbarian on the loose.

&gt;The actual saying is attributed, I believe, to Genghis Khan.

&gt;&gt; 1.  In the run up to a US first strike on China there will be a long
&gt;&gt; build-up of tensions.  China's most predictable and pre-emptive
&gt;&gt; response will be to unload her multibillion dollar holdings (will
&gt;&gt; exceed a trillion this year) of US debt.   These are bearer securities
&gt;&gt; and have no identity as to owner origin.   It's a sovereign promise by
&gt;&gt; the US government to meet its debt obligations.  Fail that and your
&gt;&gt; financial system crashes. Without money in the bank you have no means
&gt;&gt; of financing your everyday imports let alone a war.

&gt;I think there are probably creative ways around that. One might be simply
&gt;that the US says that it cannot honour the debts of a country, or citizens
&gt;of a country, that it is at war with, because to do so would be to finance
&gt;the enemy. I think other debtors will find no flaw in that logic.

&gt;&gt; 12 to 20 years, way too far into the future for China to worry about.

I was the original poster, in the sense of suggesting that replenishment
ships might be the weak point of a carrier or amphibious group. I didn't
really want to get too aggressive in advancing the thesis, since I am
clearly out of date in some things (as has been pointed out). However, I did
think that my reasoning, which is merely that of an informed layman, was
fairly sound.

I think you advanced the argument quite well. I am fairly certain that UNREP
ships don't enjoy protection until they are part of the group that they are
supplying - in transit they are out there on their lonesome. I've never read
anything, or heard anything, that suggests otherwise. As you also state, if
someone sinks a few then they will start being escorted, which itself may
not be a useful strategy if the SSK is taking shots from shallow water with
complex bathymetry and lots of noise - you might end up losing not just the
replenishment ships but a few frigates too. But making the attempt to escort
would be a logical assumption, and as you say (a point I had not thought of)
it draws off escorts that are doing ASW, SW and AAW, plus NGFS.

I didn't understand Fred's comment, hence chose not to say anything about
that. Us two are currently in a tiff, and I'm trying to avoid a lawsuit. It
did strike me as an odd thing to say. You don't build an UNREP ship
overnight. I think you could, relatively quickly, lease commercial vessels
and refit them to support VERTREP, so you'd not be lacking food and stores
and ammunition. But fuel would be the issue, and you'd likely be making
trips into friendly or neutral ports to gas up. I am minded of the little
oil tanker that I see quite often in Halifax Harbour - it's been around for
decades, and I doubt it's seen the open ocean except maybe on its maiden
voyage...all it does is fill up at the refinery here in Dartmouth, and then
journey around the harbour tanking up the container ships, gypsum
freighters, automobile carriers, occasional warship I suppose, and BIG oil
tankers. That's probably what a US CSG or ESG crippled by not having fuel
delivered by UNREP would be doing.

I'd be curious - exactly how (and I ask this precisely because I don't know)
would a CVN be able to supply its escorts these days? Is the fuel that it
carries - for the planes - of any use to the escorts (apart from their own
ac, like helos)? People live a long time without food, and ships have their
own distillation equipments. And I can't see a carrier loading up a bunch of
5" rounds just in case a destroyer needs a few more. :-)

Is this really such a dead cert?  If a crafty SSK skipper gets inside
the escorts and tags a USN CV with 2-3 fish, isn't the highest priority
for the rest of the battle group going to be giving aid to the
striciken flattop?  That's a multi-billion dollar strategic asset
that's at least in some credible danger of sinking, so how many escorts
do you release for active ASW interdiction and how many stick with
homebase and try to keep her above the waves?

Well presumably USN CVBG's practice this scenario so often in ASW
exercises that all the likely responses to the above are
well-practiced, and that there's enough escorts in the group to both
aid the CVN with damage control and nail the now-located SSK.  But how
'bout this?  The CVBG is cruising off the coast of Hostile-o-stan and
said SSK is part of a combined-arms op. in which Hostile-o-stan's
nearest airbase has been keeping a putative strike package on thirty
minute alert.  Hostile-o-stan's lucky/crafty SSK skipper, having
nothing to lose, releases an active message beacon signaling, "Allahu
akbar, scratch one flattop!" at which point the strike package begins
to noisily (on open comms) scramble.

OK, so you're R. Adm. Placebo and your flagship took three torps to
starboard five minutes ago:

--Your carrier is already listing so much as to preclude flight ops, so
the only airborne intercept assets you have are the CAP birds and E-2
that were already aloft.

--One third of your escorts are already coming alongside to help with
damage control.

--One third are still on ASW/AAW picket screening.

--One third are pinging the hell out of a search box centered on the
torpedo launch location fix and/or that damned beacon, said two
positions not being as co-located as you'd like, but the beacon giving
a plenty good location fix for...

--...The inbound strike package of 20-30 bogeys you've just now
detected with ELINT and AEW.

...So now, do you still try to sink that SSK or do you put every escort
you can spare on AAW alert?

Is this such an implausible scenario?

&gt; &gt; Is there anything bigger than 5&quot; tubes current on active US ships these
&gt; &gt; days?

&gt; &gt; Dan

&gt; No. And apart from range considerations (that can be solved with different
&gt; munitions and improved 5&quot; guns) you really don't need anything bigger. A
&gt; 155mm AGS is only an inch larger in diameter. For NGFS the 5&quot; has always
&gt; been a decent calibre, it 's just that the range has sucked. Marine spotters
&gt; normally equated a single 5&quot;/54 mount with a 155mm battery of howitzers,
&gt; although the comparison is rough.

&gt; What would really solve the NGFS problem is lots of 5&quot; or 6&quot; (155mm) ships
&gt; that don't have so many other roles that they can't be dedicated to
&gt; supporting Marines. IOW, the ships cannot be better at doing AAW to defend a
&gt; carrier.

&gt; I always wondered, why is it that that the gators themselves aren't
&gt; festooned with the guns that could support the very same Marines that are
&gt; swimming ashore in AAVs. As if it couldn't be done...bullshit.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The reason I'm curious is, this has to do with whether or not we need
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;carriers any more. I myself think we do, if for no other reason that they
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;have flexibility that programmed munitions currently don't, and they do
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;allow forced entry into a region where nobody gives us a base for
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;short-ranged ac. I do however believe that other platforms may be more
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;efficient now at carrying the load for most of the strike missions.

&gt; &gt;&gt; A USN-CV battle group is one of the most magnificient shows man has
&gt; &gt;&gt; ever staged.  The current equipment is designed to fight a high tech
&gt; &gt;&gt; war that only Russia and China have the faintest hope of challenging.
&gt; &gt;&gt; These three giant countries cannot go to war against each other at any
&gt; &gt;&gt; level of conflict because that would surely escalate into a nuclear
&gt; &gt;&gt; war that will be mutually ruinous and unwinnable.  In any case even if
&gt; &gt;&gt; the US can mass all the CV groups to fight a conventional war against
&gt; &gt;&gt; Russia or China there won't be enough aircraft nor bomb tonnage to win
&gt; &gt;&gt; the fight.  But this (same) total CV force is small enough that any
&gt; &gt;&gt; extensive period of operations such vast geography will surely ruin
&gt; &gt;&gt; it.   So the USN-CV group is used against lesser countries that cannot
&gt; &gt;&gt; even resist a single CV group from the Vietnam era.  In other words
&gt; &gt;&gt; all these latest supersized, super expensive and super teched
&gt; &gt;&gt; equipment is way way overkill.  The real story on the effrectiveness
&gt; &gt;&gt; of modern CV forces will best be seen in the &quot;kills&quot; per dollar
&gt; &gt;&gt; analysis.

&gt; &gt;From another perspective one can argue that the carrier groups are not
&gt; &gt;overkill at all, because the mere threat of them, or the presence of them,
&gt; &gt;already accomplishes policy aims. Hence, there may be low &quot;kills per
&gt; &gt;dollar&quot;, but still very high value per dollar. I myself would not contest
&gt; &gt;that argument at the strategic level.

&gt; &gt;I do think however that other platforms - notably cruise missiles, USAF ac
&gt; &gt;flying from CONUS even, ICBMs or SLBMs with conventional warheads (note -
&gt; &gt;perhaps not right now, but the idea has been bruited), long range USA and
&gt; &gt;USMC tube and rocket artillery - are now taking major roles in being able to
&gt; &gt;put ordnance on target quickly on targets where once only carrier air could
&gt; &gt;have been able to do that.

&gt; &gt;So that's why I am interested in how much munitions tonnage US carriers
&gt; &gt;actually have. You need to know that in order to have an informed argument.

&gt; &gt;As to conventional wars against Russia or China, in the present, I think the
&gt; &gt;US could win against either China or Russia right now, given the right
&gt; &gt;political circumstances. They could not do it *right now*, because I believe
&gt; &gt;that to attack China the US would need Russia as an ally, if for nothing
&gt; &gt;more than to allow overflight, basing and staging, and Putin is not buddies
&gt; &gt;with Bush at the moment. But if Russia did cooperate it could be done.
&gt; &gt;Russia I believe could be attacked without Chinese support - the eastern
&gt; &gt;European countries butting up against Russia tend to be fairly US-friendly
&gt; &gt;(for obvious reasons), and the carriers would be of effect in the Arctic and
&gt; &gt;the Pacific.

&gt; &gt;I don't know that a conventional conflict against either country would
&gt; &gt;result in nuclear war. I'm certain that the US would use a Spetsnaz strategy
&gt; &gt;of decapitating everyone who could possibly make a decision about pushing
&gt; &gt;buttons well before the decision had to be made. It wouldn't be so tough,
&gt; &gt;with preparation, not in these enlightened political times. Wrt Russia, for
&gt; &gt;example, the US must know down to the last detail who commands everything
&gt; &gt;down to regiment or below (if they don't they should be fired). That means
&gt; &gt;you can put in assassination teams disguised as tourists or biznismen a week
&gt; &gt;beforehand, and on a signal take out the entire leadership structure. If you
&gt; &gt;simultaneously assault ICBM fields and shoot every Russian sub you know of,
&gt; &gt;I doubt that the Russians will be fighting total nuclear war.

&gt; Wow, a wannabe Conan the Barbarian on the loose.

&gt; 1.  In the run up to a US first strike on China there will be a long

&gt; exceed a trillion this year) of US debt.   These are bearer securities
&gt; and have no identity as to owner origin.   It's a sovereign promise by
&gt; the US government to meet its debt obligations.  Fail that and your
&gt; financial system crashes. Without money in the bank you have no means

Yup, I thought of that.  I'm projecting a CVBG casualty response based
on what happened during the Forrestal and Enterprise fires during
Vietnam and when USN CV's were torpedo'ed during WWII.  And I admit
that those scenarios may be woefully inaccurate in projecting how a
contemporary CVBG would react to multiple torpedo hits on the carrier.
Then again, are you saying that in the case of a CVN being heavily
stricken and in danger of sinking that the flag in command wouldn't
order some subset of escorts alongside for support?  That also seems
unlikely.

Absolutely.  What I'm conjecturing is that, even with a solid fix, the
ASW response might not have time to get an active sonar track on the
SSK and kill it before being pulled off to help on AAW response.  Could
they fire off a salvo of ASROC's at that "solid fix" before being
pulled off the hunt?  Almost certainly.  Would that salvo of ASROC's
have a good chance acquiring the SSK solely with their active sonar
after the sub has had 3-5 minutes to creep quietly on a random course
and then lie doggo?  I have no idea.

I'm assuming that the Aegis Tico's and some majority of the most
AAW-capable escorts would be steaming at flank speed towards the
inbound bogeys, probably dispersing somewhat to form an AAW screen,
whilst the CVN and some number of escorts would limp away on a
reciprocal course.  Theoretically, this might allow the SSK to creep
away sneakily orthogonal to all the hubub and live another day?  That's
what I'm conjecturing.  Total crap?  Maybe so.

You don't have to go to that extreme.  AIUI, the Federal Reserve has
been modeling the "massive bond dump" scenario of a nation-state with
multi-hundred-billion/low trillion-dollar holding in US government
bonds selling them off precipitously since the Gulf States started
building up huge dollar surpluses in the early 70's.  I recall reading
a Paul Erdman doomsday novel premised on this.  But the models play out
such that beyond a certain window of financial hurt the dumping ends up
crippling the nation dumping bonds far worse than the US.  The worst
case scenario, I gather, results in a massive worldwide economic crash
somewhat akin in economic terms, if not death toll, to the results of a
middlin' big nuclear war, except that the nation surviving best is the
one with the greatest basic agrarian resources and projectible military
capability (to go grab what we need and screw the rest of you lot).
Which is, surprise surprise, the USA...and, for Arved's sake, our
toque-wearing brethren up north of forty-four forty.

Now if China were to shift $100 billion USD into Euro's per year for
the next 5-10 years, yeah, that'd hurt.  The US economy would tip into
some degree of a moderate-to-severe recession, but the cost to China in
the end would be at least $300 billion USD in losses due to do dumping
depressed-value USG securities, being shut out of what would still be
(albeit barely) the world's largest consumer market, and the undying
enmity of the undisputed nuclear superpower on the planet.  Hmmm, might
want to rethink that ploy...

While the US is in hock to China for a huge sum of money, China needs the
cash.

To develop their economy the Chinese need new infrastructure on a far
greater scale than most other countries.

China needs a huge expantion in internal air traffic to make their economy
work  properly in the long term, and so needs lots of aircraft and pilots.

These are cheaper to buy than to build/train.

China needs to expand its high speed communications nets and so needs the
vast sums of money required to lay thousands of miles of fast fibre.

They also need the technology like switching centres &amp; etc and the expensive
training that goes with them and that sort of stuff costs a serious amount
of money.

Plus the Chinese people want all the fun stuff like computers and mobile
phones and motor cars and PDAs and all the rest of it. At the moment all
they get,  on average,  is a can of Coke once every three weeks.

China doesn't make most of the clever stuff  that all this consumer stuff
needs to run.

It's all going to have to be bought in from somewhere,  and China is in a
hurry.

In two year's time India will surpass China in population and they already
have a huge English speaking population.  India looks like winning the 'soft
skills' race.

China also wants some high tech guns and bombs and delivery systems, and
again, these have to be bought.

The Chinese people (or at least a small proportion of them) also want a
bigger slice of the action. At the moment two thirds of all shares in any
company are held by the Chinese government.  The people who are getting rich
do so because the government trusts them and wants them to be rich.  Most of
them were army officers or spooks or party men (and they're nearly all men).

But the next generation is coming along.  The Chinese government is facing a
new generation of rich kids who own them nothing and resent them interfering
in what they see as 'my dad's business' which they're now running...

People here seem to be obsessed with the idea of China challenging the USA
in a military manner.  China doesn't want a war with their major customer
who'll almost certainly destroy them if even if they can't defeat them.

China wants to defend her own interests in the region,  and the major
players there are Russia and India.

Russia and India both have 'blue water' navies.

China doesn't...
