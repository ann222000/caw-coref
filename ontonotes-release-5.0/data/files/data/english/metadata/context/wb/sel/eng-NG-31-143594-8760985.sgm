Yesterday my husband came home and a white paper towel was wrapped around our front door knob. He didn't think anything of it and just threw it away. However today he came home only to find another white paper towel wrapped around our side door (a totally different door on the side of our home, meaning someone went down into our yard). Should we be alarmed? I called 311 but they said all they could do was come out and take a report, which we declined. We asked if they had anything on record that it could possibly mean and the operator said they would have no way of knowing. We can't think of anyone or any reason why this was done. Any thoughts???

I agree.  This seems to be the most likely reason.  Someone appearsto be trying the doors to see if they are open.  That would petrify me. Do you have deadbolts on your ndoors?  If not, I would suggest you put them in as soon as possible.

Absolutely.  Also, consider getting an alarm system installed soon, if
you don't already have one.  Every little bit helps.  And it would
probably help to alert your neighbors and ask them if they've seen
anything &amp; to keep their eyes peeled.

Dead bolts are always a great idea, also motion detection outdoor lighting.
I also have a indoor video camera photographing my yard  24/7.   This has really helped.
I got mine a BJ's.  My house was broken into 5 times within the first two years I lived in Baltimore.
However, now with the lights and the camera, I have no problems and no monthly fee.

AND, if I were a thief, I would take my handkerchief with me.

Are thieves so stupid as to alarm the victim before the hit?   Mine certainly never did.

Yip, dead bolts, alarm system, we have a lot of protection but we are interested in getting cameras and better lighting. We alerted the neighbors also. It could be anything from a kid playing a prank to someone really trying to break in and left their evidence of their attempt. But we are taking this very seriously and taking extra precautions.

Holy Crap! I would definitely be careful. I am not sure whether you
read earlier messages with regards to a person going door to door
posing as a salesman and trying to find out if the owners had an
alarm. And if they didn't, they would mark the sidewalk with a red X
and come back later to rob the house. I would be mad just because
someone came into my yard without permission- but that's just me.

PS- Louise could you get back to me on the camera and whether someone
actually came out to install it/how well it worked for you? My direct
email address is su ... @yahoo.co.uk.
