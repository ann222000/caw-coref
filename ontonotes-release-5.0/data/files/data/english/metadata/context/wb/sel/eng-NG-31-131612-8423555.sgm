Female soul singer, Shirley Bassey went to see one of Elvis's shows at the International Hotel in Las Vegas during his premier engagement in August 1969. Throughout the show, Bassey was going crazy over Elvis's sexy moves and powerful voice. She had never realized how much she liked him til that night.
At the shows end she was invited backstage for a party that was thrown for Elvis by the hotel staff. When she saw him, she was very attracted to him and told some of her famous friends that she wanted &quot;to get a Â piece of him.&quot; Knowing that she was not going to get anywhere by being shy, she started to pursue him openly. She was not ashamed of her actions and knew that if she pushed the right buttons, she could win the prize.
Elvis was not interested in Bassey or her seductive manner. He wiggled himself out of her close embrace and excused himself. For the duration of the evening he ignored her as best he could, without being rude. He made sure he was never alone with her, fearing that she would attack him, and as he said, &quot;jump my bones.&quot; Bassey was hurt to find him unresponsive to her advances, but that didn't deter her from loving the &quot;King of Rock and Roll.

Elvis never left the building like we thought, if you listen close you can still hear him singing.

October 28,1956 was the date of Elvis's second &quot;historic&quot; appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. When they arrived in New York, Elvis and his friends checked into the posh Warwick Hotel located at 54th Street and Sixth Avenue.Elvis was chauffered by limo to the Sullivan Theatre on Broadway where a large throng of girls was waiting for him at the back entrance. As he was being escorted towards the theatre door, Elvis heard the voice of an elderly woman calling his name. She was waving one of his record albums in the air and asking him to autograph it. A studio executive attempted to force Elvis inside, but he pushed the man back. The executive shouted, &quot;Come on, you don't have time for autographs now! Fifty million people are waiting to see you.&quot; Elvis ignored him and went over to autograph the album for the woman. He turned to the executive and said, &quot;Listen, if she can take the time to buy my album, then by God, I can spare the time to sign it.&quot; He then stormed inside and got ready to go onstage.
The crowd cheered long and loud in support of Elvis's loyalty. They made so much noise that a security guard had to come out and hush them. The audience inside could not hear above the racket.

In March and April 1964, Elvis was filming a fight scene for &quot;Roustabout&quot; in which he was to knock down stunt man Glenn Wilder with a karate chop. As Wilder fell to the ground, his leg flew out and made contact with Elvis's head.Blood spurted out of the wound and everyone on the set panicked. Several crew members inspected the wound and decided it was just a scratch. The studio nurse tried for over an hour to stop the bleeding but it would not subside. When the doctor was called he diagnosed the &quot;scratch&quot; as a two inch laceration which could only be closed with stitches.
Elvis was taken to Conejo Medical Square inThousand Oaks, where Dr. Daniel MacGillis closed his wound with nine stitches. he prescribed pain medication and antibiotics to prevent infection. As Elvis was ordered to wear bandages for two weeks, his wound was incorporated into the movie. Until the day he died, Elvis sported a small scar above his left eyebrow.

MGM rented Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for the fictitious Santa Fe Race scenes in &quot;Spinout.&quot; Three elderly ladies found out that Elvis was there and they traveled to L.A. in hopes of seeing him. They made their way into the stadium and walked all around the track, unaware that the scene was being filmed where cars were going by at over 100 mph. Elvis ran to where the ladies were standing and pulled them off the track, knocking himself over in the process.
Elvis found himself on top of one of the women, and he quickly got up and apoligized. The ladies realized Elvis had just saved them form being mangled, and they jumped all over him in thanks. Elvis was extremely amused; he told them that he would not be able to live with himself if anything happened to them.
Elvis made the ladies promise to sit in the bleachers and stay out of the way. They agreed, but only if he would give each of them his autograph. Elvis replied, &quot;What a small price to pay, to save you young ladies.&quot;

Actor Lorne Greene, star of the famous TV Western series, Bonanza, was the honorary chairman of the Dunaoff School for Mentally Retarded Children. In 1965, Elvis heard about the charity and wanted to contribute something that would help the children. He decided to donate his 1962 Dodge motorhome to the school. When Greene heard about Elvis's donation, he met with the singer and accepted the gift on the school's behalf. The two talked for several hours. Elvis complimented Greene's work, explaining that he was an avid western fan and that one of his favorites was Bonanza. Greene was delighted that Elvis knew so much about him and was thrilled to personally accept his donation.
The motor home was eventually auctioned off and the sizeable proceeds went to the school. Lorne thanked Elvis and told him that his donation was benefiting a great cause. Because of his generosity, doctors would be able to buy better equipment and the children would be more comfortable. Elvis thanked Greene and graciously answered that it was worth the time and effort if it meant he could help needy children.
