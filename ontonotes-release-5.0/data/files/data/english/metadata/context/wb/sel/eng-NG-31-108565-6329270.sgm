Interesting article in the Jan *Scientific American*.  Yes, I am a
slow reader now.

Several hundred Megayears ago the collision between North &amp; South
America raised the East/West *Ouachita* mountains across Oklahoma and
Arkansas.  Later this blocked access to the Gulf, continental drainage
was to the north and west.

This part of the continent moved over the Bermuda Hot Spot from
central Kansas 115 Mya to central Mississppi 70 Mya.  During the
mid-Cretaceous 'super plume' events this raised a N/S arch several km's
high, which eroded back down in abut 10 My.  Then the 'super plume'
activity quieted, the eroded arch subsided, leaving the embayment
through the mountain range flooded from the Gulf.  Continental drainage
now shifted to this southern access, and sedimentation filled in the
embayment.

Being as I am familiar with the general geology and topography, there
are several things
about this explanation which do not compute.

The Ouachitas (@ 300 million years old) are still quite definitively
steep highlands. Ok, they are not real mountains, but they are ridge and
valley system some hundreds to 1500 ft higher than the coastal plains
to the south. The Ozarks (@ 900 Ma to 1.5 Ga)are rounded and worn, but
still quite distinctly hills, caldera rims, and so forth.

The article asks us to believe that the Mississippi Embayment rose
multiple km a mere 70 Mya, and then wore down in 10My to a flat, mostly
featureless plain, at about 200-400 asl, with 1-3 kms of sediment below
the surface until you hit bedrock.

If such extreme inflation/deflation occurred, where are the brecciated
zones surrounding the hot spot active zone?

Where is the residue from that removed rock? What sort was it?

How did the South Central Mo Ozarks remain so tectonically unaffected?
(Flat lying beds stayed flat lying, and steeply sloping beds on the east
side of the preCambrian seem basically unaffected by any systematic
regional faults.

There is no topographic lowland trough from central Kansas through
Mississippi similar to that tracing the Yellowstone hot spot. There also
is not a basaltic  trace, nor any metamorphics, either of which I would
expect.  I would expect such a thing, if this migrating hot spot theory
is true. The authors talk about the Crater of Diamonds laprolite pipes--
those are to the southwest of the Embayment, not to the northwest as one
might expect of such an arch coming in from Kansas.

As I understand their presentation, the hot spot was active in
mid-Kansas, quiescent through eastern Kansas, SW and SC Missouri, and
then all heck broke loose under the New Madrid zone. They say this was a
time of superplumes the world over, but do not cite other examples.

The rock between eastern Kansas and the Embayment is mostly Paleozoic in
age and nearly flat lying (a very small regional dip) to the Ozark
Highlands, then a steeper dip on the eastern side to the Mississippi.
Not Mesozoic. The transition from Ordovician to Quaternary surface
deposits is quite abrupt. Only a few places (Crowley's Ridge) do
Cretaceous/Tertiary strata exist at the surface. Geological cross
sections of the subsurface continue the pattern, though layers are
jumbled due to faulting.

Finally, the New Madrid area faulting predates the Cretaceous, as
indicated by subsurface geologic faulting. They cite this faulting as
related to the formation/collapse of the hot spot arch-- it actually
predates it.

While the Van Arsdale and Cox paper presents an intriguing scenario,and
might explain some previously obscure diatremes in eastern Missouri, as
well as subsurface igneous emplacements in the rift zone, I'm not yet
convinced this explanation doesn't raise more questions than it answers.

Congratulations Jo !

Excellent and superior indeed reply proceeding of what should be
rightly called  a True Geologist's mind. In fact somehow you are
recovering your free mind and free will and breaking free then of the
dogmatic Universilities teaching so painfully evident in poor Jim 's
input.

In fact, Jo, you only need as Don,  to get the correct basis of
reasoning imparted by the True Geology and you will be able to
reconsider all Earth relief in this light. Indeed the correct approach
does not change the hard facts, but it brings a true understanding
based on well known engineering process to account for such. Moreover
it has to be coherent with the whole spectra of data imported from all
disciplines i.e. Physics; Chemistry( low &amp; high energy alchemistry
indeed) , Palaeontology, Archaeology, History, Ethnology, Agriculture,
Medecine ( endocrinology and genetic manipulation through circumcision
manipulation ) ,  Psyche vs Soma interaction, History of the sects vs
ET input

We have to get away from the specialisation &amp; ultra specialisation
pronés by those mind programming bodies known as Universilities !
A TRUE GEOLOGIST IS NECESSARILY A UNIVERSAL MIND !
( who has all the answers indeed )

... and this something towards which you are obviously tending.

Jo - thank you for the excellent review.
Shades of the *Penny tutorials*.

They also show a path for the 'Great Meteor' hot spot.  That left
volcanos at Montreal, then I know of none through the 'Green Mountains'
until around NYC(?).  Beyond which there is a chain of seamounts.

But looking out my window I do not see a lowland trough or
ex-volcanos.  I understand the Hudson River / Lake Champlain to be a
suture where a 'New England' microplate impacted NA much earlier.

As far as rocks in Arkansas: McFarland (Stratigraphic Summary of
Arkansas)  says that the total mapped exposure of igneous in Arkansas is
15 square miles. Other than  a single outcrop in the Boston Mountains,
they are located in the eastern Ouachitas, roughly between Hot Springs,
Malvern and Little Rock, right on the edge between the
Ordovician/Mississippian Ouachitas, and the Embayment. Rocks consist of
nepheline syenite, peridotite-carbonatite sills and dikes,  some weird
highly mineralized suites such as those at Magnet Cove, and the
lamprolite pipes in Pike County. Most of these rocks are in rather small
plots, not one 15 mile area. These are likely the rocks Van Arsdale and
Cox are talking about when they are saying that the hotspot idea
explains their presence, since everything except some Precambrian
metagabbro and serpentine/soapstone in Saline and Pike Counties dates to
the Cretaceous. The only other 'metamorphic' rock I am aware of in the
Ouachitas is novaculite-- that strange recrystallized chert used for
whetstones. That stuff is ubiquitous in Hot Springs and nearby, but
seems to be related to the Pennsylvanian era compressional forces of
Pangaea, not their thesis.

Looking at Arkansas faults and mountains-- the Ouachita Mountains begin
slightly northwest of Little Rock, and are bounded roughly by Little
Rock to Ft. Smith, to McAlester OK, to Atoka, OK, then back around to
Murfreesboro, AR, thence to Arkadelphia, and back up I-30 to Little
Rock. Nearly all the faults in this area are almost directly east-west,
presumably as a result of continental collision. North of there, the
faults generally and gradually skew to the NW/SE direction which is the
usual Missouri trend (over the whole state not just SE Missouri).

Many of the faults in Missouri (looking at a structural map) trend
NW/SE, including those in the Embayment. One notable trace, the Pascola
Arch, which goes from the Mississippi at Caruthersville  in the Bootheel
NW to Poplar Bluff is almost perfectly perpendicular to the axis of most
of the New Madrid quakes (also shown on this map.) Only right around the
Ozark dome (old Precambrian of south central Mo.) do the faults somewhat
define  and roughly parallel the circular edges of the dome.

Looking at the maps I have available, I'm not seeing any faults trending
steeply NE/SW along the line of the Mississippi River, the postulated
direction of the hotspot rise. In fact, the Pascola Arch near the New
Madrid zone is NW/SE-- the fault itself has several segment directions,
but the primary one is NE/SW. Do big arches have little perpendicular
arches?

The point is: the breakthrough which they postulate has to be not just
in Arkansas along the Ouachita range hundreds of miles southwest of the
NMSZ-- the Mississippi Embayment comes up as far as Cape Girardeau (that
bit of Missouri which sticks out into the Mississippi like a wart above
the Bootheel). I really wish, instead of their cute little 'how a
hotspot moves beneath the crust' diagram, they had one good drawing of
the trace of the hotspot, and one good drawing of the area affected by
the superplume. The Mississippi Embayment is a big place, you know.

The other thing they never really address (which could be key to their
argument) is Crowley's Ridge. Crowley's Ridge is a 200 mile long curved
arc of ground between 100 and 400 feet above the Embayment. There are
about as many hypotheses about the Ridge as there are people in the
Bootheel and NE Arkansas.  There are vegetative studies, linking the
vegetation of Crowley's Ridge (long considered an erosional remnant, not
a tectonic artifact--for the most part, it consists of gravel, sand,
silt and sediment, not bedrock) higher than the Embayment surrounding
it) to that of Appalachian Tennessee-- Crowleys Ridge has relict
populations of present day plants from Southern Appalachia. If all this
geological development happened back in the Cretaceous, how did these
plants get here?

Do I have an answer or counter-thesis? Not really, and I wouldn't
presume to make up something without a lot of research on my own. I'm a
neophyte in understanding the geology/seismology of Southeast Missouri--
although I had a lot of school teachers from there, it was only last
fall that I spent a couple of weeks knocking around there with geos and
naturalists.  I just don't think this article in Sci Am added up to what
they think it does, at least for me,  and I'm not sure the public is
well-served, because I am sure now some school kid is going to accept
this hypothesis as scientific truth with the certainty of fact, since
'hey it was published in a magazine in the library.'

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where is the residue from that removed rock? What sort was it?

&gt;&gt; All good questions. Is there any high pressure stuff in the Ouachita?
&gt;&gt; I'm not really at all familiar
&gt;&gt; with them.

&gt;&gt; Stuart

&gt; As far as rocks in Arkansas: McFarland (Stratigraphic Summary of
&gt; Arkansas)  says that the total mapped exposure of igneous in Arkansas is
&gt; 15 square miles. Other than  a single outcrop in the Boston Mountains,
&gt; they are located in the eastern Ouachitas, roughly between Hot Springs,
&gt; Malvern and Little Rock, right on the edge between the
&gt; Ordovician/Mississippian Ouachitas, and the Embayment. Rocks consist of
&gt; nepheline syenite, peridotite-carbonatite sills and dikes,  some weird
&gt; highly mineralized suites such as those at Magnet Cove, and the
&gt; lamprolite pipes in Pike County. Most of these rocks are in rather small
&gt; plots, not one 15 mile area. These are likely the rocks Van Arsdale and
&gt; Cox are talking about when they are saying that the hotspot idea explains
&gt; their presence, since everything except some Precambrian metagabbro and
&gt; serpentine/soapstone in Saline and Pike Counties dates to the Cretaceous.
&gt; The only other 'metamorphic' rock I am aware of in the Ouachitas is
&gt; novaculite-- that strange recrystallized chert used for whetstones. That
&gt; stuff is ubiquitous in Hot Springs and nearby, but seems to be related to
&gt; the Pennsylvanian era compressional forces of Pangaea, not their thesis.

&gt; Looking at Arkansas faults and mountains-- the Ouachita Mountains begin
&gt; slightly northwest of Little Rock, and are bounded roughly by Little Rock
&gt; to Ft. Smith, to McAlester OK, to Atoka, OK, then back around to
&gt; Murfreesboro, AR, thence to Arkadelphia, and back up I-30 to Little Rock.
&gt; Nearly all the faults in this area are almost directly east-west,
&gt; presumably as a result of continental collision. North of there, the
&gt; faults generally and gradually skew to the NW/SE direction which is the
&gt; usual Missouri trend (over the whole state not just SE Missouri).

&gt; Many of the faults in Missouri (looking at a structural map) trend NW/SE,
&gt; including those in the Embayment. One notable trace, the Pascola Arch,
&gt; which goes from the Mississippi at Caruthersville  in the Bootheel NW to
&gt; Poplar Bluff is almost perfectly perpendicular to the axis of most of the
&gt; New Madrid quakes (also shown on this map.) Only right around the Ozark
&gt; dome (old Precambrian of south central Mo.) do the faults somewhat define
&gt; and roughly parallel the circular edges of the dome.

&gt; Looking at the maps I have available, I'm not seeing any faults trending
&gt; steeply NE/SW along the line of the Mississippi River, the postulated
&gt; direction of the hotspot rise. In fact, the Pascola Arch near the New
&gt; Madrid zone is NW/SE-- the fault itself has several segment directions,
&gt; but the primary one is NE/SW. Do big arches have little perpendicular
&gt; arches?

&gt; The point is: the breakthrough which they postulate has to be not just in
&gt; Arkansas along the Ouachita range hundreds of miles southwest of the
&gt; NMSZ-- the Mississippi Embayment comes up as far as Cape Girardeau (that
&gt; bit of Missouri which sticks out into the Mississippi like a wart above
&gt; the Bootheel). I really wish, instead of their cute little 'how a hotspot
&gt; moves beneath the crust' diagram, they had one good drawing of the trace
&gt; of the hotspot, and one good drawing of the area affected by the
&gt; superplume. The Mississippi Embayment is a big place, you know.

&gt; The other thing they never really address (which could be key to their
&gt; argument) is Crowley's Ridge. Crowley's Ridge is a 200 mile long curved
&gt; arc of ground between 100 and 400 feet above the Embayment. There are
&gt; about as many hypotheses about the Ridge as there are people in the
&gt; Bootheel and NE Arkansas.  There are vegetative studies, linking the
&gt; vegetation of Crowley's Ridge (long considered an erosional remnant, not
&gt; a tectonic artifact--for the most part, it consists of gravel, sand, silt
&gt; and sediment, not bedrock) higher than the Embayment surrounding it) to
&gt; that of Appalachian Tennessee-- Crowleys Ridge has relict populations of
&gt; present day plants from Southern Appalachia. If all this geological
&gt; development happened back in the Cretaceous, how did these plants get
&gt; here?

&gt; Do I have an answer or counter-thesis? Not really, and I wouldn't presume
&gt; to make up something without a lot of research on my own. I'm a neophyte
&gt; in understanding the geology/seismology of Southeast Missouri--
&gt; although I had a lot of school teachers from there, it was only last fall
&gt; that I spent a couple of weeks knocking around there with geos and
&gt; naturalists.  I just don't think this article in Sci Am added up to what
&gt; they think it does, at least for me,  and I'm not sure the public is
&gt; well-served, because I am sure now some school kid is going to accept
&gt; this hypothesis as scientific truth with the certainty of fact, since
&gt; 'hey it was published in a magazine in the library.'

&gt; &gt;&gt;   Interesting article in the Jan *Scientific American*.  Yes, I am a
&gt; &gt;&gt; slow reader now.

&gt; &gt; There is no topographic lowland trough from central Kansas through
&gt; &gt; Mississippi similar to that tracing the Yellowstone hot spot. There also
&gt; &gt; is not a basaltic  trace, nor any metamorphics, either of which I would
&gt; &gt; expect.  I would expect such a thing, if this migrating hot spot theory
&gt; &gt; is true.

&gt; Jo - thank you for the excellent review.
&gt;       Shades of the *Penny tutorials*.

&gt;     They also show a path for the 'Great Meteor' hot spot.  That left
&gt; volcanos at Montreal, then I know of none through the 'Green Mountains'
&gt; until around NYC(?).  Beyond which there is a chain of seamounts.

&gt;    But looking out my window I do not see a lowland trough or
&gt; ex-volcanos.  I understand the Hudson River / Lake Champlain to be a
&gt; suture where a 'New England' microplate impacted NA much earlier.

(...Don't know where you get the idea that Plates can move.)   Plates
don't move any more than you do when you're watching telly.   Your
circulation's moving, .. and maybe your eyeballs, if your mind's in
gear, .. but all that 'moving' doesn't help you crash into the wall
now does it?  Come on, ..be reasonable Jim .  Be a proud engineer, not
a dumb geologist.

Once people start talking about "colliding plates" it's clear they
don't have a clue what Plate Tectonics is actually saying.

("Moving plates'" is a very common misconception, deplored by the
Geological Society of London

(And anyway, .. what was that bullshit about South America colliding
with North America?  Folds like that are gravity collapse structures -
not caused by colliding crust)
