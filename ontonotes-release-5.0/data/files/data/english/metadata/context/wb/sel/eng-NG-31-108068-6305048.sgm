I recently acqured a pistol that is marked with

FEMARU-FEGYVER-ES GEPGYAR R.T. 37 M.

It was loaded with .380 ammunition, but there is no indication of
caliber on
it that I can find.  Anybody know anything about this gun?

How about a break down procedure.  I would like to inspect the firing
pin
movement.  Just pushing on the head of it produces no movement and I
fear
that it may be stuck in the forward position which could result in
double
fires or even an accidental firing when dropping the slide.

P.S.  Why don't my posts EVER make it onto the newsgroup.  Atleast not
from my regular usenet account.  I was told I had to use a real e-mail
address as the reply to, and even that doesn't work.  Now, I'm trying
google to see if that will work.  I don't post inflamatory stuff, and
just offer my own opinion.

It is a Femaru 37M, and is chambered for 9mm Kurz, aka .380.  Hungarian
pistol, WWII era.

I do not remember the breakdown, but it did not seem odd.  I believe
there are two notches for the hold open lever, and the back one is for
takedown.  The barrel turns to unlock the slide/barrel combination.

Femaru, a firearms manufacturer in Hungary, produced this firearm in .
32 ACP and .380 ACP from 1937 until the late 1940s.

Many have Nazi proofs, which siginificantly enhance the pistol's
value.

This one made it fine.  As for your pistol, it is fairly common.  GOOGLE is
your friend!  Use it first when you have a question.   Just do a search on
the markings and you will find MANY hits on this Hungarian pistol.  Much
more than is feasible to copy and paste to this newsgroup.  Happy reading.

Your acquisition is in all probability a Femaru Model 37, manufactured in
Budapest between 1937, the year of its adoption by the Hungarian Royal Army,
and 1941.

In police work, the presence of the .380 ACP (9mm Kurz) in the pistol would
be considered a "clue," but you were wise to inquire since the design was
also offered in 7.65mm Browning.

As for a break down procedure, if you proceed cautiously, you can probably
figure it out.

# P.S.  Why don't my posts EVER make it onto the newsgroup.

Well, this one seems to be the exception, doesn't it?

Well, it seems to be coming in via your Hotmail account, which is pretty
low-rent and not very secure. That could be a problem. I'll leave it to
Magnum to explain it to you in detail about the vagaries of some ISPs.

its an hungarian gun, a FEG. caliber 7.62 tokarev with manual safety (made
for the german army, as hungary was a WWII ally). first built around 1933. a
9mm version was adopted by the hungarian army in 1937. easily convertable to
7.65 browning (.32 acp) or .380 acp.

breakdown should be very easy, as it has just a simple slide.

I did use it first.  Thank you so much.  I'm sure some folks might not
have thought of that.  As I often tell the tecnicians that work for me
I would rather tell them something they already know than not tell
them something they need to know.

&gt; ...

Again, I did use it first.  Some of my questions were answered, but
not specifically.  Basically what I found was some historical summary
listed along with three of the guns listed for sale.  Between the
three for sale listings I was able to piece together general
information.  I did find a couple foreign language listings that look
really interesting, but for some reason babel fish was not translating
them properly.

&gt; ...

I really did not find that many useful listings.  With a verbatim
search I only got two pages of results on google.  Many of them only
contained part of the actual search string and no actual refference to
that pistol.

&gt; ...

I actually did learn some things here that the various web listings I
read didn't tell me.

Yeah probably.  One poster did have a hint on that.  I'll try it.  I
do not want to cycle any ammo through it until I am certain that it is
safe to do so.

Actually I was surprised.  I usually use a junk address for usenet due
to the massive influx of spam that results with a real address.  I was
told that I had to use a real address so I set one up on one of my
mail servers that would just delete incoming mail.  Then I tried a
yahoo address and then a hotmail address.  None of my posts showed up
in the last couple years.  This is not the first time I have tried
google groups either.  This was posted via google groups using a
hotmail address and to be honest I really didn't expect to see it show
up either.  I was pleasantly surprised when it did.  I have visited
the faq page several times, and never really found a definitive answer
to why what I thought were legitimate on topic non-inflammatory psots
were not showing up.  The hint about e-mail addresses came from a user
on one of the hunting groups.  The info I needed may be on the faq
page, but it certainly wasn't apparent at first or second glance.  No
doubt somebody will now point out where it is and how obvious it
should have been to me.  LOL.

Thanks.  That seems like it makes sense.  I mostly a wheel gun
shooter.  This is only my second automatic.  My 1st is a Norinco 1911A
with some trigger work.  Most automatics tend to sit wrong in my hand
(even my .45) so that I shoot low when point shooting.  I guess that
comes from growing up shooting cowboys guns.   Anyway.  I did not want
to shoot this gun or even cycle a round through it until I could get
it apart and check the movement of the firing pin.  I sure don't want
to cycle a round if the firing pin is indeed stuck in the forward
position.  Actually after playing with it a bit and holding it in a
barrel up position I found that the firing pin is not stuck and falls
back easily.  In the level position though it simpley stayed forward
and I could detect no movement.  I'll check it right now for the 2
rear notch and rotate.  I did find some history for the gun on-line,
but no breakdown info.

Thanks again.

Thanks.  This appears to be a private purchase from somewhere in
Europe (probably London) by a bomber pilot as the shoulder holster
that came with it has his name and rank crudely lettered onto it.  The
pilot was a relative whom I never met before he died in the 1990s.  I
received it from another relative who was also a WWII bomber pilot.
No Nazi proofs on it.  That would have been exciting wouldn't it?

No, never in 7.62x25!!   Most were made in 9mm K.

A look at an older copy of Small Arms of the World will give you some
history and a takedown procedure on the gun.   A decent public library
should have W.H.B. Smith's work in some revision or another.  Look
under "Hungary" and you should find it.  Was a service pistol of home-
grown design, issued by the Germans in WWII to second-line troops and
such.  Nazi-marked ones have some additional value to collectors.

Might have been somebody that flew with the RAF after escaping from
Hungary.  Would be interesting to have the whole story.  IIRC, it was
issued to whatever air force Hungary had pre-war, might have come with
him.  No Nazi marks in that case.  If you could document ownership and
service record, that adds a lot to both interest and collectibility of
the pistol.  As far as I know, this was NOT a commercial pistol.

Thanks, that was eaxctly the ticket.  Google really didn't help.  I
found
some for sale listings which helped a little with history, but that
was it.
Your tip on breakdown was what I needed.  It looks like it has hardly
ever
been fired, and its very clean.  Almost like a new gun internally.
Even
exterrnal holster wear is minimal.  Being a wheel gun man myself I
tend to
be cautious with autos until somebody tells/shows me the basics.

As to it being a common gun as some folks mentioned.. it sure seems to
have
held its relative value very well based on the few for sale listings
I
found.  While its nothing special in the auto world, its not the
cheap
Saturday night special I expected either.  The trigger pull seems a
little
heavy with a firm break, but it is pretty smooth.  A more experienced
shooter should be able to shoot it to its potential with minimal
practice.
If it is stock its certainly better than my 1911 was before I had the
trigger
worked on.  Hard to tell for certain of course until I actually go out
and
run a couple mags through it.

Now that I have had the chance to take it down and make cerrtain that
the
firing pin is not stuck and put it through its paces dry (except
firing)
I'll take it out to the range and put a couple magazines through it.
With
such a short barrel and my own prefference for the curved stocks of
cowboy
guns I am not expecting much for accuracy, but you never know.

I did see one that was rebarreled to .22 with an extended barrel
sticking
out of the slide.  That looks like it would be a lot of fun.  Has
anybody
here done that conversion.  How much is required to make that
conversion?  A
barrel obviously, and probably a different magazine.  How about the
slide
spring.  Is a .22 capable of operating that spring?  Since its
supposed to
be a pretty common gun is there an off the shelf .22 conversion kit
available for it?  It would be a heck of a lot of fun to have a small .
22
auto for target shooting at the range.  Yeah I know there is an off
the
shelf kit for my .45 but this gun seems to have more appeal for me to
do
that.

Sounds a lot like my old .380 Colt.  You have to turn the barrel to
accomplish takedown.

I certainly do not know of any such conversions, nor would I do it with
a 37M.  They are not that common, and are collectible, and shoot fine
with the ammunition for which they were intended.

LOL.  I was kinda poking fun at some folks with that one, although in
my on-line searches I did find one shown that was converted to .22.

I'ld convert my .45 sooner since the kit is a direct parts swap and
can be converted back in minutes.
