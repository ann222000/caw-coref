REPUBLICANS PLAN PUSH FOR ELIMINATION OF IRS

**Exclusive**

A domestic centerpiece of the Bush/GOP agenda for a second Bush term
is getting rid of the Internal Revenue Service, the DRUDGE REPORT has
learned.

The Speaker of the House will push for replacing the nation's current
tax system with a national sales tax or a value added tax, Hill
sources tell DRUDGE.

platform, or on Bush's agenda?

This is just a rehash of Forbes' flat tax idea, which went
nowhere -- especially among Republicans.

"/> It's a great idea. There's a huge amount of money lost to accountants and
lawyers. The devil will be in the details.

In theory, replacing income tax with flat consumption tax is a good thing. In
reality, there will be a legion of interests on both the Republican and Democrat
side of the political spectrum that will fight this to the death.

On the right, the number of people associated with the home building/owning
industry will scream bloody murder at the loss of the mortgage interest
deduction. Even if you can show that the net tax payments will be lower under a
national VAT or sales tax, too many people have a vested interest in the current
system to allow it to go away. Some sort of 10/20 year phase out might work, but
if there is no income tax, what would you phase it out against? Applying a VAT
or sales tax to the sale of a house would also cause problems.

On the left, those that have an interest in &quot;taxing the rich&quot; ie, a progressive
income tax will scream. Trying to convince them that the rich will pay more in
taxes because they spend more and buy more expensive items will fall upon deaf
ears.

Certain members from both sides like the Earned Income Credit, a thinly
disguised welfare program. Losing that will be difficult.

Sales taxes are OK because they are only applied once and are very visible. VATs
are nasty because what looks like a very low rate gets applied at every stage of
production, building up a huge final bill that is mostly hidden.

As with all Washington programs, you have to follow the money trail to
understand what's going on here. The US &quot;voluntary&quot; income tax system is slowly
becoming untenable. Too many people are gaming the system and enforecement is
gradually becomeing more and more difficult. The real reason this program will
fly is because it's far easiler to look for the smaller number of businesses
that would have to collect the tax than 250 million individual tax payers.

"/> Uh, maybe because the headline of Drudge's story states

&quot;REPUBLICANS PLAN PUSH FOR ELIMINATION OF IRS&quot;

That and the fact that Hastert is the head Republican in the House pretty much
nails the fact that it's a GOP plan. Bush is nominally the head of the GOP you
know...

"/> Doesn't look like it. IIRC Forbes proposed a flat income tax, with little or no
deductions. VAT or Sales taxes are consumption taxes. In other words, you only
pay them when you spend money, not when you earn it.

Many would argue that is a &quot;fairer&quot; system. It certain would encourage savings,
which is also held to be a good thing.

Americans. If it didn't, you can bet Hastert wouldn't be

Taxes on all unearned income (capital gains, stock/bond
dividends, etc etc) would be dropped altogether, and the
slack would be picked up by -- you guessed it -- middle
and lower income Americans, the lowest of which
currently pay nothing or very little in income taxes. A
national sales tax would not exempt anyone.

goods tho, most commonly food etc.

The fundament reason that not one modern first world
country relys on a sales tax alone is because to raise
the same total taxes, the tax rate would have to be
very high indeed, and the voters will never buy it.

It really is as basic as that.

like
$1000 for the first $10,000 of income
$ 500 for the second $10,000 of income
$ 100 for the third $10,000 of income
$ 000 for the rest

. . . something along those lines.
I kinda think there's lots of wasted effort with all the tax paperwork,
thousands of tax attorneys and bean counters could be turned to more
constructive things, the earth's magnetic poles would stop shifting, and
peace and joy would once again reign over the land.
. . . or something along those lines . . .
But I'd like to hear some debate on the issue.

Given the short term disruption that would cause, there's lots of ways to

end of the year for all mortgages issued before the effectivity of the law. As
the mortgages are retired, the claim goes away.

I agree. However there isn't going to be an expenditure increase. It's tax
transferrence from income to consumption. In theory one should be paying
about the same amount in taxes, simply in a different form.

-And such people at least have the ability to cut back
-on spending, and divert that money to savings, in order

Transferred tax burden. But I get what you mean.

There are some mitigating issues here:

1) One can simply lop off some bottom portion of spending as tax free.
Unfortunately it'll require some sort of administration to accomplish.

2) The real problem is the amount of the tax burden in order to get to an
equal value of income taxes collected. The last time I was reading about this
FairTax concept, opponents had put the equal collection rate somewhere between
35 and 40 percent. That's a hell of a lot more than what's being withheld
from my check right now. An interesting question is how much offset would
occur from collecting taxes from sources that are not currently paying
income taxes (i.e. illegals, foreign travellers, drug dealers, and the like).
Maybe the solution is to put a max cap in it, and then the government will
simply have to operate on what it collects from that capped value.

3) The key thing for it to work is NO LOOPHOLES! None. Not one. No execptions
other than the base tax rebate. It has to apply to individuals and businesses,
raw materials and consumer goods, real estate and everything else. Once a
loophole (other than don't spend the money) is created, the whole thing falls
apart.

It's an interesting idea. Still may end up squeezing the middle class though.

Again agreed. I'm not doing a very good job here am I?

Question: If the floor of where the tax is pushed up, then who get squeezed?
The middle class?

-
-&gt; All he's suggested so far is that an income tax is too
-&gt; complicated and costs the economy too much money.
-
-Another lie. He's clearly suggesting a sales tax or a vat.

Yes. Personally I think a sales tax would be better as with a VAT, only the
final consumer gets the whole bill. i.e. 4 companies pay 2% each, then pass
the 8% cost to the consumer who has to pay the entire 8%. Maybe there's nothing
that can be done about that though.

-&gt;&gt; Taxes on all unearned income (capital gains, stock/bond
-&gt;&gt; dividends, etc etc) would be dropped altogether, and the
-&gt;&gt; slack would be picked up by -- you guessed it -- middle
-&gt;&gt; and lower income Americans, the lowest of which
-&gt;&gt; currently pay nothing or very little in income taxes.
-
-&gt; Ahhh. You've already seen the final bill and determined who will pay what.
-
-Another lie. WHEN THE LOWEST INCOME AMERICANS PAY
-LITTLE OR ANY INCOME TAX, THE ELIMINATION OF INCOME
-TAX WILL SHIFT SOME OF THE CURRENT TAX BURDEN TO
-THEM, REGARDLESS OF THE DETAIL WITH A SALES TAX OR VAT.

Here's where I enter the argument. Why not have a EIC style rebate for everyone
what covers the tax up to some floor. Hand it out independent of income or
spending. So say there's a $10000/year floor and a 30% tax. Anyone who
registers will get back $3000/year ($250/month) to cover the cost of the tax
for that $10000 exemption per person. No strings (i.e. food/housing only)
or income requirement. So even if you have no income, you'd still get a
check every month.

I'm just not sure how it shifts the burden though. Maybe it screws the
middle class.

-
-&gt;&gt; A national sales tax would not exempt anyone.
-
-&gt; No, but what's to say those at certain income levels wouldn't get
-&gt; an expanded EIC to cover the cost of taxes for food &amp; housing?
-
-They'd STILL pay more tax on the non food and non housing.

The above proposal puts no restrictions on amount or type of spending. Of
course it ends up being a zero sum game, but at least the tax is mitigated.

-
-And there wont be any bill, even the republicans aint THAT stupid.
-
-Because the voters wont buy it, you watch.

No they won't. They won't understand getting their full check, plus the
rebate check, but then having to spend 30/35 cents on the dollar in tax
everytime they purchase something.

&gt;&gt;&gt; VAT or Sales taxes are consumption taxes. In other words, you only pay

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it could have a disproportionately harsh impact upon
&gt;&gt; lower-income people.

&gt;&gt; With a low total income, you can end up paying a very large percentage
&gt;&gt; of that just for necessities. Reducing spending (and thus the sales-tax
&gt;&gt; burden) can be impossible if you are already living very modestly. And
&gt;&gt; setting aside money in savings can be quite difficult, regardless of
&gt;&gt; economic &quot;encouragement.&quot;

&gt;&gt; With a higher total income, the necessities are a lower percentage of
&gt;&gt; that income. Thus, the forced expenditure of an increased sales tax
&gt;&gt; will have less of an impact, in relation to the person's total income.
&gt;&gt; And such people at least have the ability to cut back on spending, and
&gt;&gt; divert that money to savings, in order to mitigate the increased
&gt;&gt; sales-tax burden.

all the complexity of income assessement.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) The real problem is the amount of the tax burden in order to get
&gt; to an equal value of income taxes collected. The last time I was
&gt; reading about this FairTax concept, opponents had put the equal

&gt; Hand it out independent of income or spending. So say there's
&gt; a $10000/year floor and a 30% tax. Anyone who registers

&gt; In article
&gt;&lt;64arg0td634ncn0louq6ca3kiaf1erd ... @4ax.com&gt;, &quot;Clark W.
&gt; Griswold, Jr.&quot;&lt;73115 dot 1041 at compuserve dot com&gt;
&gt; says...
&gt;&gt; VAT or Sales taxes are consumption taxes. In other words, you only
&gt;&gt; pay them when you spend money, not when you earn it.

&gt;&gt; Many would argue that is a &quot;fairer&quot; system. It certain would encourage
&gt;&gt; savings,
&gt;&gt; which is also held to be a good thing.

&gt; Unfortunately, it could have a disproportionately harsh
&gt; impact upon lower-income people.

&gt; With a low total income, you can end up paying a very
&gt; large percentage of that just for necessities.
&gt; Reducing spending (and thus the sales-tax burden) can
&gt; be impossible if you are already living very modestly.
&gt; And setting aside money in savings can be quite
&gt; difficult, regardless of economic &quot;encouragement.&quot;

&gt; With a higher total income, the necessities are a lower
&gt; percentage of that income. Thus, the forced
&gt; expenditure of an increased sales tax will have less of
&gt; an impact, in relation to the person's total income.
&gt; And such people at least have the ability to cut back
&gt; on spending, and divert that money to savings, in order
&gt; to mitigate the increased sales-tax burden.

&gt; This is quite similar to the argument against
&gt; increasing the legal minimum wage.

"/> This is nothing like any argument against increasing the legal minimum wage,
at least not the argument I have made. Minimum wage hurts poor people
because those items that go up in price immediately because of a minimum
wage increase are also those products that people depend on to live. A
lower income family spends a greater percentage of their money on those more
expensive items, and since people actually trying to live off of their wage
are not working for minimum wage, they don't generally get a wage increase
when the minimum wage goes up. Even if they did, it would possibly cover
the increases they would see because of the increase.

A flat tax on the other hand, if not instituted properly, can have the
effect of making it more difficult to collect extreme amounts of tax from
the rich and give it to the poor, and lazy. Luxury items would have to be
taxed at a higher rate, and food hardly at all. It may be possible to do
this. The problem comes when some idiot trys to explain it to a person of
equal or lesser intelligence than themselves without making sure to add the
luxury tax into the mix. If you charge a flat rate, lets say 20% for a
yacht, as well as 20% for that tomato you got at the grocery store you end
up with the problem where the rich are taxed well under their means while
the poor are possibly charged beyond their means. I think that is what you
were trying to say in your post.

The simple fact about any tax system is that the rich have access to high
priced attorneys and accountants and you don't. The rich will never pay the
same amount in taxes for their 10,000 square foot house as a poor person
pays for a 900 square foot house. That may be a slight exaggeration, but
only slight. There are many ways for a person to legally avoid paying the
same income taxes you pay. Believe me, I use them. They pay tax, just not
at the same rate you do. The same methods for filtering wealth through
lowly taxed methods could work for just about any tax system, and it will be
guaranteed because those rich people are the ones keeping those idiot
parties supplied with heavy pockets and campaign money.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In theory, you could exempt necessities from the tax. It would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; tricky to define necessities but I would include food, lodging,
&gt;&gt;&gt; education, and health care. If properly defined, necessities would
&gt;&gt;&gt; include most of what a poor person buys. So the poor would effectively
&gt;&gt;&gt; be exempted from the tax.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However since this is a Republican proposal, look for increased rates
&gt;&gt;&gt; on necessities.

&gt;&gt; What does Republican have to do with it? It is done every day in PA and
&gt;&gt; some other states that apply sales tax. For example you go into the
&gt;&gt; supermarket and pickout raw meat, milk, rice and a prepared deli item.
&gt;&gt; When you checkout you will pay sales tax on only the prepared deli item.

&gt; Every state's sales tax are going to be slightly different. IIRC, you pay
&gt; full sales tax on all groceries in Republican controlled Alabama. So PA's
&gt; sales tax is more friendly to the poor.

&gt; Does the Republican proposal exempt necessities or does it not? If it does
&gt; exempt necessities how does it define necessitie?

"/> What Republican proposal? I haven't seen any Republican proposal that
even hints at anything remotely close to supporting a national sales
tax and eliminating the IRS. All I have seen is a rumor on Drudge's web
site and Drudge has near zero credibility.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In theory, you could exempt necessities from the tax. It would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tricky to define necessities but I would include food, lodging,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education, and health care. If properly defined, necessities would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; include most of what a poor person buys. So the poor would
effectively
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be exempted from the tax.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However since this is a Republican proposal, look for increased rates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on necessities.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What does Republican have to do with it? It is done every day in PA
and
&gt;&gt;&gt; some other states that apply sales tax. For example you go into the
&gt;&gt;&gt; supermarket and pickout raw meat, milk, rice and a prepared deli item.
&gt;&gt;&gt; When you checkout you will pay sales tax on only the prepared deli
item.

&gt;&gt; Every state's sales tax are going to be slightly different. IIRC, you
pay
&gt;&gt; full sales tax on all groceries in Republican controlled Alabama. So
PA's
&gt;&gt; sales tax is more friendly to the poor.

&gt;&gt; Does the Republican proposal exempt necessities or does it not? If it
does
&gt;&gt; exempt necessities how does it define necessitie?

&gt; What Republican proposal? I haven't seen any Republican proposal that
&gt; even hints at anything remotely close to supporting a national sales
&gt; tax and eliminating the IRS. All I have seen is a rumor on Drudge's web
&gt; site and Drudge has near zero credibility.

"/> It might be &quot;near&quot; zero, but there have been some pretty incredible things
that he has brought up that I thought were totally insane at the time but
all have turned out to be true. It started with the Monica/Clinton thing.
I thought for sure he was full of it when he broke that story, or at least
there wasn't near enough evidence to convince anyone that he actually did
it. Then there was the huge argument he and Bill O'reilly got into on his
radio show when he said that Bill O'reilly was going to start a radio show
that would compete with Rush Limbaugh in the same time slot. Bill was so
adamant about the fact that he had made no plans to do any radio show, and
that if anyone was making any arrangements, he had no knowledge of it.
Well, here we are a couple years later and guess who's got a radio talk show
in the same time slot as Rush Limbaugh.

I don't follow Drudge much, but the few occasions that I've had to witness
his outlandish claims have shown me that he deserves much credit for getting
access to the information he does and even more credit for releasing it to
the public when such odd information might damage his credibility if proven
untrue.

He is one of the only outlets that doesn't rely almost completely on the
news wire services for his news, and his sources are often incredible.

Since the Federal government can print money, they don't have to collect
taxes at all to extract wealth from the citizenry.

Currently, despite the Bush administration's tax cuts, Americans are less
wealthy than they used to be. One of the reasons is that the US Dollar
has dipped in value relative to other currencies.

So it is a good idea for cities and states, but without some sort of
currency control I would not support it at the federal level.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tax should be levied on the richest people, say, 2%, arguing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that the &quot;regular&quot; folks will never be taxed... sounds scarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;familiar to the income tax

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you have good intentions but this is not a good idea as

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the Federal government can print money, they don't have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; collect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxes at all to extract wealth from the citizenry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Currently, despite the Bush administration's tax cuts,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans are less wealthy than they used to be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit.

More people want houses now, and they don't want houses where people
from 100 years ago wanted houses. Try to sell a house in bumfuck
Nebraska now - noone will buy it. So, more people (the larger middle
class) are trying to buy houses in more central locations (cities and
suburbs (there is only so far you can build from cities)), and that is
why the average person can't afford the average home.

&gt;&gt;&gt; actually, what we really need is to return our government to the form
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the founding fathers intended (uncentralized, non-federalized).

&gt;&gt; Soorree, the world's moved on just a tad since then.

&gt; And republicans used to be political conservatives too, idiot.

"/> Yep. Republicans are so worried that democrats are going to one-up them in
the socialism wars that they have gotten to be just as bad.

Anyone that has read the federalist papers to any extent knows what the
founders had in mind. The federal government was basically supposed to
control interstate and international commerce and not much more. The states
were supposed to control the rest. Now, the federal government has taken
over they states by controlling the majority of the money. When the federal
government takes your money and gives it back to the states for complying
with their laws, they are using you to control the states in which they were
never supposed to have control of to any major extent. From funds for roads
to matching funds for child support collection, they have little by little
taken control of almost every aspect of state government that means
anything.

The federal government should never have been allowed to get that power in
the first place. Instead of the US being a group of individually controlled
states, we have become a totally controlled group of individual geographical
subdivisions.

If you think we need all those federal laws controlling us, apparently you
haven't seen the civil and penal codes in your state. There are laws in
every state that parrot almost every major federal law that exists. States
are doing their job, but the federal government is too busy making sure that
all the states follow its rules to care whether or not they should even be
meddling with them in the first place.

There is little difference anymore between the US and Brittain. States like
Nevada have tried to buck the federal government historically, but
eventually even they cave to the money. Even Ohio is having a problem with
certain laws currently and they are talking about ignoring the law and
waiving their &quot;privilege&quot; of receiving the federal funds for following it.
I can't remember what law it was off hand, but I was reading about it
yesterday. I'll have to go try and find it. Anyway, I doubt it will ever
happen.

Another reason that Bush's &quot;Faith Based Initiative&quot; went nowhere and will go
nowhere is because he wanted to fund faith groups to do what the federal
government is now doing. That would put churches into their hands to mangle
just like it has the states. While it sounds like a good idea, the way it
should have gone is for the federal government to never collect those taxes
in the first place. That way people could donate to whatever cause they
desired and there would be no pandering to the feds to get the money.

I've gone on way too long about this stuff. Nobody that needs to listen
will, and talking to those who will listen would be like preaching to the
choir.

&gt; Out of curiosity what do you consider to be an average job?

&gt; I realize that there are several US cities, mostly on the west coast
&gt; where the average price of a home exceeds the abilities of even those
&gt; with above average jobs, but that is not the way it is across the
&gt; country.

&gt; A person with a $30,000 a year job saving 10% of their salary towards
&gt; the down payment on a home needs to save for about seven years in most
&gt; parts of the country. Since nowadays both partners in a marriage work
&gt; that will drop it down to around 3. years. It is doable, just not all
&gt; that easy. It never really was back in the good old days either. At
&gt; least mortgage interest rates are fairly low compare to the 13% I was
&gt; paying back in the early eighties.

"/> by your calculation, saving 10% of $30,000k takehome, in seven years
you'd have $21,000 saved.
If you don't want to buy a house with PMI, that's 20% down on a $100k
home. I doubt that anyone in any fairly urban area will be able to find
a house for $100,000. I suppose you're advising to put down 10%?

&gt;&gt;That's simply not the case. The size (or at least the percentage
&gt;&gt;of total population) of the middle class has been steadily
&gt;&gt;decreasing since 1970, and the gap between rich and poor in
&gt;&gt;America is now the largest its been since the Great Depression:

&gt;&gt;5% of America's population now control 60% of the country's
&gt;&gt;total wealth -- an unprecedented inequality.

&gt;&gt;1% of America's population now hold 50% of the country's
&gt;&gt;non-home wealth -- also an unprecedented inequality.

&gt;&gt;The richest 10% of American families now hold 85% of all
&gt;&gt;outstanding stocks, 85% of all other financial securities and
&gt;&gt;90% of all business assets.

&gt;&gt;As any economist will tell you, there is no such thing as free
&gt;&gt;money. Every dollar taken by one person is taken from
&gt;&gt;someone else. Record oil company and HMO profits are
&gt;&gt;not unrelated to a record number of personal bankruptcies.

&gt; Out of curiosity what do you consider to be an average job?

&gt; I realize that there are several US cities, mostly on the west coast
&gt; where the average price of a home exceeds the abilities of even those
&gt; with above average jobs, but that is not the way it is across the
&gt; country.

&gt; A person with a $30,000 a year job saving 10% of their salary towards
&gt; the down payment on a home needs to save for about seven years in most
&gt; parts of the country. Since nowadays both partners in a marriage work
&gt; that will drop it down to around 3. years. It is doable, just not all
&gt; that easy. It never really was back in the good old days either. At

&gt;&gt;&gt; Currently, despite the Bush administration's tax cuts, Americans are
&gt;&gt;&gt; less wealthy than they used to be. One of the reasons is that the US
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dollar has dipped in value relative to other currencies.

&gt;&gt; So, you're saying that in order for the dollar to remain high, the
&gt;&gt; government has to tax the crap out of us? It certainly looks like
&gt;&gt; that's what you're saying, and if so that is the biggest load of crap

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ownership has become a distant dream for 90% of us.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This has very little to do with household wealth and much more to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with widening of the middle class (and thus the average population).

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's simply not the case. The size (or at least the percentage
&gt;&gt;&gt; of total population) of the middle class has been steadily
&gt;&gt;&gt; decreasing since 1970, and the gap between rich and poor in
&gt;&gt;&gt; America is now the largest its been since the Great Depression:

&gt;&gt; That couldn't be a factor of how much more money there is available now
than
&gt;&gt; there was then could it? Even if you factor in inflation since then,
you're
&gt;&gt; still stuck with a huge surplus of funds that have to be in someone's
&gt;&gt; pocket.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5% of America's population now control 60% of the country's
&gt;&gt;&gt; total wealth -- an unprecedented inequality.

&gt;&gt; See above.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1% of America's population now hold 50% of the country's
&gt;&gt;&gt; non-home wealth -- also an unprecedented inequality.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The richest 10% of American families now hold 85% of all
&gt;&gt;&gt; outstanding stocks, 85% of all other financial securities and
&gt;&gt;&gt; 90% of all business assets.

&gt;&gt; This is funny. I look at this and see the reason for the inequality.
Poor
&gt;&gt; people do not invest. Everyone can find some money to invest, I don't
care
&gt;&gt; how poor they are. People are taught that it is a good thing to invest
in
&gt;&gt; things, and if you ask any rich person they will tell you that you
should
&gt;&gt; invest in things whenever you can. Guess what's not taught in the
wonderful
&gt;&gt; public school system that Liberals are trying to protect like it was the
&gt;&gt; last snickers bar at a fat farm. I have never come across a single
public
&gt;&gt; school that gave more than a passing phrase on investments during some
other
&gt;&gt; lecture. Our kids are taught that if you go to school and work for
someone
&gt;&gt; else all your life you will reach nirvana. Be a doctor or a lawyer, an
&gt;&gt; engineer or a chemist, but god forbid that you ever want to start your
own
&gt;&gt; business or invest in things.

&gt;&gt; You're talking about how much more money the rich have than the poor,
but
&gt;&gt; you are totally off base on how to fix that situation. Poor people are
poor
&gt;&gt; not because some rich guy is standing on their head. They are poor
because
&gt;&gt; they are ignorant about how money works. They know that if they work
for X
&gt;&gt; hours they get Y pay, and Y pay can buy them Z many twinkies, but
anything
&gt;&gt; further and they're stumped.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As any economist will tell you, there is no such thing as free
&gt;&gt;&gt; money. Every dollar taken by one person is taken from
&gt;&gt;&gt; someone else. Record oil company and HMO profits are
&gt;&gt;&gt; not unrelated to a record number of personal bankruptcies.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Taken from someone else?&quot; That's a bit on the outlandish side.

How many fewer are still rich after 10 years? Having money does nothing for
them because they know nothing about what to do with it. Give a man a
fish...Right? You do not teach anything by giving people things.

Knowing how to buy your products off the bottom shelf and from thrift stores
does not make it so a person keeps their money. We need to start teaching
people in school how to invest money. That should be the course that is
taught every year through high school. English isn't near as important to a
person's financial well being as learning how best to invest money.

Then there's the fact that you feel that people with ambition and drive who

hand that money over to people who are not as ambitious or hard working.

"/> Interesting theory. It would probably be impossible to prove or disprove.

I would classify the Sheriff of Nottingham and the King as early
Republicans. Like dubya, they financed a costly and needless war in the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What we really need is a Constitution Amendment saying 2/3

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually, what we really need is to return our government to the form
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the founding fathers intended (uncentralized, non-federalized).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Soorree, the world's moved on just a tad since then.

&gt;&gt; And republicans used to be political conservatives too, idiot.

&gt; Yep. Republicans are so worried that democrats are going to one-up them
&gt; in the socialism wars that they have gotten to be just as bad.

&gt; Anyone that has read the federalist papers to any extent knows what the
&gt; founders had in mind. The federal government was basically supposed to
&gt; control interstate and international commerce and not much more.

"/> I believe that they also wanted to disallow corporations. Some 360 degree
party spin happened at some point, obviously. Soft money? &lt;guffaw&gt;

I wonder if we can harness the energy produced by hundreds of thousands of
dead republicans spinning in their graves? Dubya shoulda looked into that
when he had the chance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The
&gt; states
&gt; were supposed to control the rest.

"/> We all know that became a pipe dream pretty quickly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, the federal government has taken
&gt; over they states by controlling the majority of the money. When the
&gt; federal government takes your money and gives it back to the states for
&gt; complying with their laws, they are using you to control the states in
&gt; which they were
&gt; never supposed to have control of to any major extent. From funds for
&gt; roads to matching funds for child support collection, they have little by
&gt; little taken control of almost every aspect of state government that means
&gt; anything.

&gt; The federal government should never have been allowed to get that power in
&gt; the first place. Instead of the US being a group of individually
&gt; controlled states, we have become a totally controlled group of individual
&gt; geographical subdivisions.

&gt; If you think we need all those federal laws controlling us, apparently you
&gt; haven't seen the civil and penal codes in your state. There are laws in
&gt; every state that parrot almost every major federal law that exists.
&gt; States are doing their job, but the federal government is too busy making
&gt; sure that all the states follow its rules to care whether or not they
&gt; should even be meddling with them in the first place.

"/> The abysmal &quot;Drug War&quot; comes to mind here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; There is little difference anymore between the US and Brittain. States
&gt; like Nevada have tried to buck the federal government historically, but
&gt; eventually even they cave to the money. Even Ohio is having a problem
&gt; with certain laws currently and they are talking about ignoring the law
&gt; and waiving their &quot;privilege&quot; of receiving the federal funds for following
&gt; it. I can't remember what law it was off hand, but I was reading about it
&gt; yesterday. I'll have to go try and find it. Anyway, I doubt it will ever
&gt; happen.

&gt; Another reason that Bush's &quot;Faith Based Initiative&quot; went nowhere and will
&gt; go nowhere is because he wanted to fund faith groups to do what the
&gt; federal
&gt; government is now doing. That would put churches into their hands to
&gt; mangle
&gt; just like it has the states. While it sounds like a good idea, the way it
&gt; should have gone is for the federal government to never collect those
&gt; taxes
&gt; in the first place. That way people could donate to whatever cause they
&gt; desired and there would be no pandering to the feds to get the money.

&gt; I've gone on way too long about this stuff. Nobody that needs to listen
&gt; will, and talking to those who will listen would be like preaching to the
&gt; choir.

"/> It is still important in these times to say what is on our minds. It is our
duty as citizens, in fact.

give

&gt;&gt;&gt; Another straw man. Generally speaking, poor people don't

the movies or out to dinner. They spend it on all sorts of unnecessary
activities that if they just cut back on a little would allow them enough to
invest. Who do you know that can't afford to invest $20/month? A person
who starts investing $20/month in their early 20's would have over a million
dollars at their disposal by the time they are 65, and that's based on
conservative investments. That is impossible for people to recognize

monthly internet bill that everyone just has to have would be $20/month.

amount of work you do is directly proportional to your income potential.
It's not how much work you do, it's the work you do, and for whom do you do
it. If you work for other people all your life you're stuck. People think
a dead end job is one that offers no opportunity for advancement. A dead
end job is any job where you work for someone else because there will always
be a ceiling on the amount of income you can make.

For example, I have a friend that just recently got out of rehab after
having his head bashed in during a mugging in Texas. As soon as he could
get a driver's license he put ads in the local paper that said that he will
haul anything. Within 2 weeks he had enough work to make about $900/week,
and it's just gotten bigger. He works about 20 hours per week now and is
making about $3000 - $4000 per month, and he's not even been at it for a
year yet. He jacks up his bids for jobs he doesn't want to do because
that's all the money he wants to make. He has the ability at any time to
make more money if he wants to, and there's enough work to hire other people
and get more vehicles, and make even more money.

I'm not touting his situation as one showing that people can invest, but
rather that people working 50-60 hours per week can find much more efficient
means to generate income. My friend has no cieling because he works for
himself. He can't remember a thing you tell him 5 minutes after you say it,
he can't see you approach him from his right side because he lost his
peripheral vision, and he sounds like he's intoxicated at all times because
of the brain damage he suffered, but he's making around $50,000/year.

buy cheaper overseas manufactured goods unless they are clearly and
extremely inferior to US made goods. If the government wants to keep those
jobs here, they have to somehow convince those workers that they need to
work for the same amount that those in other countries would work. Since
that won't happen, it's inevitable that those jobs will go elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;afford to buy the average house. Now it's to the point where,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ownership has become a distant dream for 90% of us.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt; Out of curiosity what do you consider to be an average job?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I realize that there are several US cities, mostly on the west coast
&gt;&gt;&gt; where the average price of a home exceeds the abilities of even those
&gt;&gt;&gt; with above average jobs, but that is not the way it is across the
&gt;&gt;&gt; country.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A person with a $30,000 a year job saving 10% of their salary towards
&gt;&gt;&gt; the down payment on a home needs to save for about seven years in most
&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of the country. Since nowadays both partners in a marriage work
&gt;&gt;&gt; that will drop it down to around 3. years. It is doable, just not all
&gt;&gt;&gt; that easy. It never really was back in the good old days either. At
&gt;&gt;&gt; least mortgage interest rates are fairly low compare to the 13% I was
&gt;&gt;&gt; paying back in the early eighties.

&gt;&gt;I think you need to figure out some new pretend numbers. Nobody pays
that
&gt;&gt;much of a down payment on a first house when they are only making $30,000
a
&gt;&gt;year. Not unless rich uncle Dryfus died and left it to them.

&gt; If you use an average of a $100,000 dollar home with a 20% down
&gt; payment they certainly do. Almost any bank will grant a loan with a
&gt; 20% down payment.

&gt; Now of course there are all sorts of government programs that brings
&gt; the down payment numbers down. However, that only gives even more
&gt; credence to my statements that home ownership is not out of reach for
&gt; the average American. Matter of fact the poster that said 2/3 of
&gt; Americans own there own homes was damn near right. According to the
&gt; latest numbers, 68% of Americans do in fact own their own home
&gt; according to the latest census.

"/> Yes, government programs such as FHA make it possible for most people to
purchase homes with 3% down payment. A 20% down payment is rarely made by a
first time home buyer, and those that do pay that have usually sold their
first house to buy their second or third.

&gt; You apparently are not familiar with the story of Robin Hood and his band

&gt; everything. While the people were starving, the King was sponsering an

it's stolen from the poor and kept. It is wrong and you are condoning it.

"/> Yes, the civil war was one instance where the government might have been
considered to overstep its bounds, but you seem to forget the 13th
amendment. That is what caused the states to decide to leave the union.
The civil war was not a war about slavery or about anything else but whether
or not a state had the right to leave the Union. There was no article to
the constitution or amendment that said that it wasn't allowed, but the
Federal Government made that decision arbitrarily. The funny thing is, it
never went to court. That's the way things should have gone and there may
have not even been a war. Southern states would now be a separate country
and we would all own slaves. It didn't go that way, and I can't say that is
a bad thing as far as outcomes go, but that is one instance and doesn't show
a general feeling of overall supremacy as the federal government does now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Taken from someone else?&quot; That's a bit on the outlandish side.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's how the system works. Nothing outlandish about it.

&gt;&gt; There sure is when you fail to recognize the fact that the money rich
people
&gt;&gt; make is given to them. They don't go out and take anyone's money.

&gt; It's basic economics. That's as true for you or me as it is for
&gt; everyone else, and the fact is, the richest 2% of Americans
&gt; exist at the expense of the other 98%. The richest 5% exist
&gt; at the expense of the other 95%. The richest 98% exist at
&gt; the expense of the lowest 2%. In other words, money does
&gt; not just appear out of thin air.

"/> You don't understand even basic economics if you equate wealth with just
that green shit with pictures of dead presidents on them. When the
sports-loving but penniless youth builds a cane for his frail elderly
neighbor in exchange for an old discarded baseball glove that the neighbor
happens to have in his garage, both parties end up better off than they were
before even though not a single piece of green shit changed hands.

The green shit (and the bank accounts and money market funds and all other
forms for electronic green shit) is just a medium of exchange so we don't
have to barter for everything we want. It's not the total sum of one's
wealth - it's just the portion of your wealth that you haven't yet converted
into something you can actually use.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Every dollar a person receives comes
&gt; from someone else.

"/> In exchange for something that that &quot;someone else&quot; wanted more than than he
wanted the dollar.

Not all the time - there are exceptions - like when the someone else pays
the very taxes you liberals love to impose.

But economics is *not* a zero-sum game. It's idiotic to claim that a rich
person automatically lives at the expense of the poor.

to steal even if the person from whom you are stealing is rich or has most

paying high taxes - not that they owned nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the Federal government can print money, they don't have to collect

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently, despite the Bush administration's tax cuts,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Americans are less wealthy than they used to be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One of the reasons is that the US Dollar has

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hasnt got a damned thing to do with how wealthy they are.

&gt;&gt;I think it has more to do with how stupid you are.

&gt; Ignorance is the word. People forget that for 150 years in

&gt; afford to buy the average house. Now it's to the point where,

&gt;&gt;This has very little to do with household wealth and much more to do
&gt;&gt;with widening of the middle class (and thus the average population).

&gt; That's simply not the case. The size (or at least the percentage
&gt; of total population) of the middle class has been steadily
&gt; decreasing since 1970, and the gap between rich and poor in
&gt; America is now the largest its been since the Great Depression:

&gt; 5% of America's population now control 60% of the country's
&gt; total wealth -- an unprecedented inequality.

&gt; 1% of America's population now hold 50% of the country's
&gt; non-home wealth -- also an unprecedented inequality.

&gt; The richest 10% of American families now hold 85% of all
&gt; outstanding stocks, 85% of all other financial securities and
&gt; 90% of all business assets.

&gt; As any economist will tell you, there is no such thing as free

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Soorree, the world's moved on just a tad since then.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And republicans used to be political conservatives too, idiot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep. Republicans are so worried that democrats are going to one-up
&gt; them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the socialism wars that they have gotten to be just as bad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone that has read the federalist papers to any extent knows what
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; founders had in mind. The federal government was basically supposed
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control interstate and international commerce and not much more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that they also wanted to disallow corporations. Some 360
&gt; degree
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; party spin happened at some point, obviously. Soft money? &lt;guffaw&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder if we can harness the energy produced by hundreds of
&gt; thousands of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dead republicans spinning in their graves? Dubya shoulda looked into
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when he had the chance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; states
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were supposed to control the rest.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We all know that became a pipe dream pretty quickly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it actually did pretty good until the 20'th century. Not saying
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; there wasn't some overstepping of boundaries, but it wasn't until the
&gt; last
&gt;&gt;&gt; century that the Federal Government got power hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, the federal government has taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over they states by controlling the majority of the money. When the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; federal government takes your money and gives it back to the states
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complying with their laws, they are using you to control the states
&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which they were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never supposed to have control of to any major extent. From funds
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; roads to matching funds for child support collection, they have
&gt; little
&gt;&gt;&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little taken control of almost every aspect of state government that
&gt;&gt;&gt; means
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The federal government should never have been allowed to get that
&gt; power
&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first place. Instead of the US being a group of individually
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; controlled states, we have become a totally controlled group of
&gt;&gt;&gt; individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; geographical subdivisions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you think we need all those federal laws controlling us,
&gt; apparently
&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; haven't seen the civil and penal codes in your state. There are
&gt; laws in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every state that parrot almost every major federal law that exists.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; States are doing their job, but the federal government is too busy
&gt;&gt;&gt; making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure that all the states follow its rules to care whether or not
&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should even be meddling with them in the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The abysmal &quot;Drug War&quot; comes to mind here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Exactly. While I don't necessarily know what should be done about
&gt; drugs, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; do know we shouldn't be spending so much money fighting against
&gt; something
&gt;&gt;&gt; that obviously isn't getting any better. The cost of illicit drugs
&gt; hasn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; gone up much since this &quot;war&quot; was started either. The only effect that
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; really happening is that we are spending billions of dollars every year
&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt; to keep people in jail. 2/3 of inmates are incarcerated for drug
&gt; crimes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is little difference anymore between the US and Brittain.
&gt; States
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like Nevada have tried to buck the federal government historically,
&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eventually even they cave to the money. Even Ohio is having a
&gt; problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with certain laws currently and they are talking about ignoring the
&gt; law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and waiving their &quot;privilege&quot; of receiving the federal funds for
&gt;&gt;&gt; following
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it. I can't remember what law it was off hand, but I was reading
&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yesterday. I'll have to go try and find it. Anyway, I doubt it
&gt; will
&gt;&gt;&gt; ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Another reason that Bush's &quot;Faith Based Initiative&quot; went nowhere and
&gt;&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; go nowhere is because he wanted to fund faith groups to do what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; federal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government is now doing. That would put churches into their hands
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mangle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just like it has the states. While it sounds like a good idea, the
&gt; way
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should have gone is for the federal government to never collect
&gt; those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the first place. That way people could donate to whatever cause
&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; desired and there would be no pandering to the feds to get the
&gt; money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've gone on way too long about this stuff. Nobody that needs to
&gt; listen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will, and talking to those who will listen would be like preaching
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; choir.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is still important in these times to say what is on our minds. It
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; duty as citizens, in fact.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is, but what's strange is that if you bring up things issue for issue
&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; private conversation, people invariably agree with you, but when you put
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; on a newsgroup, it is automatically attacked by people who know nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt; about what they are talking about.

an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unnecessary war against Moslems in the middle east.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh and we aren't at war with the Moslems in the Middle East or
anywhere
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; else. The radical terrorists are about as far away from the
teachings
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Islam as one can get. They have perverted a religion for their
own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; benefit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The stated goal might be to combat terrorism, but the actual victims
&gt;&gt;&gt; are primarily Moslems who have nothing to do with terrorism.

&gt;&gt; Bullshit. The primary victims were Saddam and his collection of
arseholes.

&gt; The families and friends of 12,000 Iraqi civilians who were

&gt; If al Qaeda didn't have Iraqi volunteers before the invasion,

You're ad hominem attacks give you away. You're wrong again, and I'll not
debate with someone who certainly has no skills at it.

Anyway, you've done this several times now, and you're going in the kill

&gt;&gt; taxes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually, what we really need is to return our government to
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; form
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the founding fathers intended (uncentralized,
&gt;&gt; non-federalized).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Soorree, the world's moved on just a tad since then.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And republicans used to be political conservatives too, idiot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep. Republicans are so worried that democrats are going to
one-up
&gt;&gt; them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the socialism wars that they have gotten to be just as bad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone that has read the federalist papers to any extent knows
what
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; founders had in mind. The federal government was basically
supposed
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control interstate and international commerce and not much more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that they also wanted to disallow corporations. Some
360
&gt;&gt; degree
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; party spin happened at some point, obviously. Soft money?
&lt;guffaw&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder if we can harness the energy produced by hundreds of
&gt;&gt; thousands of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dead republicans spinning in their graves? Dubya shoulda looked
into
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when he had the chance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; states
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were supposed to control the rest.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We all know that became a pipe dream pretty quickly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it actually did pretty good until the 20'th century. Not
saying
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there wasn't some overstepping of boundaries, but it wasn't until
the
&gt;&gt; last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; century that the Federal Government got power hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; More utterly ignorant pig ignorant drivel.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Have fun explaining the civil war.

&gt;&gt; Yes, the civil war was one instance where the government might have been
&gt;&gt; considered to overstep its bounds, but you seem to forget the 13th
amendment.

&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt; That is what caused the states to decide to leave the union.

&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt; The civil war was not a war about slavery or about anything
&gt;&gt; else but whether or not a state had the right to leave the Union.

&gt; Yep. And that was an absolutely classic example
&gt; of 'the Federal Government got power hungry'

&gt;&gt; There was no article to the constitution or amendment
&gt;&gt; that said that it wasn't allowed, but the Federal
&gt;&gt; Government made that decision arbitrarily.

&gt; Yep, an absolutely classic example of 'the
&gt; Federal Government got power hungry'

&gt;&gt; The funny thing is, it never went to court.

&gt; Nothing unusual about that. Plenty of obvious
&gt; flouting of the constitution didnt at that time.

&gt;&gt; That's the way things should have gone

&gt; Nope, it wouldnt have made any difference, whatever the court ruled.

&gt;&gt; and there may have not even been a war.

&gt; That was going to happen anyway.

&gt;&gt; Southern states would now be a separate country

&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt; and we would all own slaves.

"/> Like &quot;Bush the First&quot; said, Reagan's is &quot;voodoo economics&quot;. Trickle down
isn't the way a free economy works. Let the poor and middle class have the
money and they'll spend it. They have to. Certain people and businesses get
filthy rich as a result and that wealth is taxed to run the government
essentials improving everyone's lot, which is, after all, why we have
government and civilization in the first place.

Giving it directly to fat cats helps no one. Few crumbs fall from their
table, and when they do, they don't even fall in the U.S.A.!! Out-sourcing
and NAFTA (not to mention foreign wars) should be proof of that.

You can make a case that there must be one hell of a problem

Even with say South Korea and Okinawa, while there
are some fools that want the yanks out, they arent

Presumably what those raghead fools have between their
ears is a large part of the reason that entire region has
been such a complete obscenity for well over a century now.

Lot of similarity to the fools in the old Yugoslavia in many ways.

Clearly just ignoring them aint gunna work, most
obviously with the invasion of Kuwait and with Rwanda.

people like you seem to think that it's okay to go to war against a
genocidal maniac as long as the president in charge at the time is a
Democrat. What was the whole reason we went into Yugoslavia? Now that the
leader is Republican, the roles are switched. The Republicans, instead of
demonizing the president as they did when Clinton went into Yugoslavia,
praise him, and the Democrats, instead of supporting the president as they
did with Clinton, demonize him for freeing a country from a ruthless
dictator that killed more of his own people than the US ever will. The
truth is somewhere in the middle. That truth is, the world is a much better
place with Saddam gone, and that the world is a better place with Milosavich
gone. Whether or not we should have taken action in either of those
instances is debatable, but if you were supportive of Clinton then you have
no right to argue against the same result.

&gt;&gt; Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down
&gt;&gt; the toilet to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt; Talk to us about redistribution of wealth.

&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt; Like &quot;Bush the First&quot; said, Reagan's is &quot;voodoo economics&quot;. Trickle down
&gt; isn't the way a free economy works. Let the poor and middle class have the
&gt; money and they'll spend it. They have to. Certain people and businesses
get
&gt; filthy rich as a result and that wealth is taxed to run the government
&gt; essentials improving everyone's lot, which is, after all, why we have
&gt; government and civilization in the first place.

&gt; Giving it directly to fat cats helps no one. Few crumbs fall from their
&gt; table, and when they do, they don't even fall in the U.S.A.!! Out-sourcing
&gt; and NAFTA (not to mention foreign wars) should be proof of that.

"/> It sounds like you're saying that money should be taken from the rich to
give to the poor, the poor spend it and the rich get it back just to have it
taken again, but the problem with that scenario is that once it's taken, it
doesn't just recycle. The government would have to constantly take more and
more of the rich people's money so that it could be given away because that
money isn't coming in the form of paychecks anymore until they couldn't get
away with taking anymore. The cycle would have to end somewhere, and it
would be a huge economic disaster, especially for the government. Wouldn't
it be funny if a liberal idea like that caused the US government to go into
bankruptcy? I don't think it would be funny at all.

Try figuring that out again.

&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm working fifty hours a week so that the guy in South

&gt;&gt; what Democrats are all about. People who work hard are penalized for
&gt;&gt; their efforts.

&gt; I'm sure you work 50 hours a week to live better than the guy in South
&gt; Phoenix, otherwise you'd be out fishing too. You work to make more than he
&gt; does. If you don't, you don't owe anything, but if you make a hell of a
lot,
&gt; why not share your good fortune to help run the country that helped make
you
&gt; rich?

"/> People in the US get rich in spite of the government, not because of it.
The US is only as prosperous as it is because of its resources, including
human resources, and the fact that it stays out of the pockets of its people
more than most other first world countries. I've heard rumors, but not
substantiated them, that Australia is beating the US in staying out of its
citizens pockets, and that's unfortunate for us, not for them. I don't want
to fund the government that attempts to keep me from being rich.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I'm not saying that you should support that guy, but he's not your
problem.
&gt; A government that taxes hard working people like you and sends the money
&gt; directly into pockets of a few international corporate despots and war
&gt; profiteers is what you should be concerned about - not providing health
care
&gt; and education to Americans.

"/> That's not what's happening. When a person makes more than another person,
then the government taxes the person that makes less a smaller percentage,
and then gives cash back to people who clearly never paid it in the first
place, there is a redistribution of wealth to the poorer people. If a flat
percentage of total tax is cut, unavoidably people who pay the most are
going to get more back. That's just simple math. That money is never taken
from the poor, it is just not taken from the rich.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you want real tax reform, eliminate withholding so that everybody
&gt;&gt;&gt; has to send in their quarterly taxes out of their checking account,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and eliminate all hidden taxes (which are what corporate taxes are),
&gt;&gt;&gt; so that everybody knows exactly what this government costs them.

&gt;&gt; Exactly, I have been self employed for a long time and it really makes
you
&gt;&gt; think when you send in the quarterly estimated payment.

&gt;&gt; Far too many people view the net amount on their paycheck as their
earnings.

&gt; You mean that people who have tax withheld do not review their
&gt; paycheck stubs? I don't know about anyone else, but I review
&gt; each of my paycheck stubs, and certainly my W-2 each year. How
&gt; much I pay to Uncle Sam is not something that easily escapes
&gt; my attention.

"/> It sure would if when you got your paycheck you had to write a check to the
government you would notice it. It would actually hit you that the money
they were taking was actually coming out of your pocket. The way things are
now, you don't ever have the ability to touch that money so you don't get
the picture. Did it ever strike you as funny why the majority of business
owners are conservative, if not Republican? Republicans tout themselves as
being the anti-big-government party, although they aren't. Business owners
who actually do have to write those checks have a much better idea about
what happens with their money and they don't like it. They have been
swooned by the Republicans into thinking that their party will keep taxes
low, but in reality they are almost identically as fiscally irresponsible as
Democrats. While there are two schools of thought about what form of
spending should be done with that money, neither party gets the idea that
people spend their money much more wisely than any government ever will.

Don't believe for one moment that you, as an employee, have any real clue
about how much money you pay to the government. You might be able to see a
number on a paper, but if that money had to come out of your pocket after
you got your paycheck, you would be much more enlightened.

another party of anti-patriots. That atmosphere breeds hate and rhetoric,
and your blatant misrepresentation of the truth is only evidence of that
fact. Being either a Democrat or a Republican has never had the nation so
polarized as it has gotten since Clinton was elected. Clinton did some
things that Republicans will never forgive him for, and in response cranked
up the rhetoric and political pressure to a point, then feeling pressured
Democrats cranked it up another notch. The party in power always seems to
be the most sane because their party has nothing to prove. The republicans
were acting insane during Clinton's presidency, and Democrats have just
totally gone off the deep end. It's scary actually. The fact that such
utter nonsense can be spewed from the mouths of the politically dishonest
and it is repeated and believed by those who know almost nothing of politics
except what face is portrayed to them on the evening news.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perception means more than numbers. Saddam was an

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only form of government weaker than dictatorship is one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is perceived by the people to be a puppet government of

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mindlessly simplistic. Have fun explaining why that was not the
&gt;&gt;&gt; perception in Germany, Japan and France as WW2 ended.

&gt;&gt; That's easy. It's because we merely restored the former
&gt;&gt; pre-Nazi governments in Germany and France, while Japan
&gt;&gt; was a different case altogether -- there was no ground
&gt;&gt; invasion by Allied forces in Japan.

&gt;&gt; What we didn't do in any of these cases was try and impose a
&gt;&gt; new and unwelcome form of government on these countries.
&gt;&gt; Iraq is the mistake of Vietnam all over again. 58,000 dead
&gt;&gt; American kids later and the people of Vietnam STILL got the
&gt;&gt; government they wanted in the first place.

&gt; This just shows how clueless you are. We did not impose any form of
&gt; government in any country, including Iraq. We preferred it be a democracy,
&gt; and the method used to determine what that government would become was
&gt; democratic, but they chose a democracy on their own. That's the same thing

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The US is only as prosperous as it is because
&gt; of its resources, including human resources,

"/> It hasnt had anything to do with non human resources for a long time now.

The main reason is that its been the US where the full commercialisation
of virtually all technology has happened first for well over a century now,
everything from cars, radio, TV, film, aircraft, thru to the transistor, ics,
computing and now PC and the internet, medicine etc and a great raft
of less signficant technology like fast food, consumer credit, jeans,
T shirts, etc etc etc too.

And why it completely dominates military technology too, tho a large
part of that is more because it has the wealth to be able to afford that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and the fact that it stays out of the pockets of its
&gt; people more than most other first world countries.

"/> That last is arguable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've heard rumors, but not substantiated them, that Australia
&gt; is beating the US in staying out of its citizens pockets,

"/> That is largely true in the sense of the total tax
collected. But the difference isnt great. Its just a
lot lower than in the worst of high taxing EU countrys.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and that's unfortunate for us, not for them. I don't want to
&gt; fund the government that attempts to keep me from being rich.

"/> Its much more complicated than that, most obviously with the
taxes spent in the military industrial complex since the war. Thats

"/> Without those 'war profiteers' there'd be no heavy aircraft
industry, no computers, no ics, no PCs, no internet, stupid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's not what's happening. When a person makes more than another
&gt; person, then the government taxes the person that makes less a smaller
&gt; percentage, and then gives cash back to people who clearly never paid
&gt; it in the first place, there is a redistribution of wealth to the poorer people.

"/> Quite a bit of what is collected just provides services
that most of the voters have decided should be
provided by govt, like public education, roads etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If a flat percentage of total tax is cut, unavoidably people who pay
&gt; the most are going to get more back. That's just simple math.

"/> Yes, but they STILL pay a lot more tax than those on very low incomes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That money is never taken from the poor,

&gt; It sounds like you're saying that money should be taken from the rich to
&gt; give to the poor, the poor spend it and the rich get it back just to have
it
&gt; taken again,

"/> -----snip-----

It might've sounded like that to you, but that's not what I said at all. Let
me clarify:

Of course the government needs money to operate, and taxation is the usual
methodology. I wouldn't be opposed to a &quot;value added tax&quot;, as was proposed
by Nixon. Most of the world has found such a consumption tax is a fair and
simple was to go, but since we're talking about income tax in this thread,
one question is whether or not the wealthiest among us should pay more than
the rest of us, say what they did during Clinton's eight years. As I recall,
they did quite well under Clinton. We're in deep and sinking in debt, and if
tax breaks are handed out, giving more to the middle class will spin the
economy sooner. I'd also be in favor of investment tax credits for business
and credits for businesses that invest more here than abroad.

Simply giving billionaires another break just doesn't do it for me. I know a
guy worth a few hundred million who spent his Bush tax refund buying a new
French jet. How does that make you feel?

Another question is why this is the only civilized country without
affordable health care. As a small business owner and employer for 28 years,
providing health coverage for my staff has always been one of my biggest
expenses and it's grown like a cancer. We already pay twice as much as other
civilized countries for our health coverage, and we get the least for it.
Nationalizing it should cost less, not more, but I understand your concern
that the unbridled greed in the USA would see to it that we'd somehow wind
up paying triple!

Alan Greenspan recently raised a red flag when he said in so many words that
our lack of investment in education is a major concern for the health of
economy and the only way to keep jobs here (and us from becoming a banana
republic) is to educate our kids a whole lot better. I agree that education
and health coverage are just as important as armies and roads to keep this
country safe and growing. If paying for these things out of the general
trust makes me a commie, I plead guilty, but some things can't get done if
left to the private sector.

Communism didn't work because the government took all the money and kept it
among the power elite, and this is where we're currently headed now in this
country. It's what caused Rome to fall and we'll fall just as surely as Rome
did, only it took Rome 400 years and we'll do it in 1/10th the time at the
rate we're going.

portray the US as being extremely unwanted in Iraq, FOX is actually
representing things as they seem to be. Apparently you don't watch FOX
News, otherwise you would know that. I watched an interview with someone
that recently came from Iraq and they explained that the people there felt
basically identically to what your link says. It would seem to me that FOX
has them all beat.

The only place that I hear nothing but good reports about what people think

optomistic that once they elect a government that things will be better.

Anyway, I really could care less about what they are saying about us over

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ignorance is the word. People forget that for 150 years in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this country, an average American with an average job could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;afford to buy the average house. Now it's to the point where,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in my city, 90% of the people are forced to rent because they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can't afford to buy anything at all, even a condo. Home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ownership has become a distant dream for 90% of us.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This has very little to do with household wealth and much more to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with widening of the middle class (and thus the average population).

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's simply not the case. The size (or at least the percentage
&gt;&gt;&gt;of total population) of the middle class has been steadily
&gt;&gt;&gt;decreasing since 1970, and the gap between rich and poor in
&gt;&gt;&gt;America is now the largest its been since the Great Depression:

&gt;&gt;That couldn't be a factor of how much more money there is available now than
&gt;&gt;there was then could it? Even if you factor in inflation since then, you're
&gt;&gt;still stuck with a huge surplus of funds that have to be in someone's
&gt;&gt;pocket.

&gt;&gt;&gt;5% of America's population now control 60% of the country's
&gt;&gt;&gt;total wealth -- an unprecedented inequality.

&gt;&gt;See above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;1% of America's population now hold 50% of the country's
&gt;&gt;&gt;non-home wealth -- also an unprecedented inequality.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The richest 10% of American families now hold 85% of all
&gt;&gt;&gt;outstanding stocks, 85% of all other financial securities and
&gt;&gt;&gt;90% of all business assets.

&gt;&gt;This is funny. I look at this and see the reason for the inequality. Poor
&gt;&gt;people do not invest. Everyone can find some money to invest, I don't care
&gt;&gt;how poor they are. People are taught that it is a good thing to invest in
&gt;&gt;things, and if you ask any rich person they will tell you that you should
&gt;&gt;invest in things whenever you can. Guess what's not taught in the wonderful
&gt;&gt;public school system that Liberals are trying to protect like it was the
&gt;&gt;last snickers bar at a fat farm. I have never come across a single public
&gt;&gt;school that gave more than a passing phrase on investments during some other
&gt;&gt;lecture. Our kids are taught that if you go to school and work for someone
&gt;&gt;else all your life you will reach nirvana. Be a doctor or a lawyer, an
&gt;&gt;engineer or a chemist, but god forbid that you ever want to start your own
&gt;&gt;business or invest in things.

&gt;&gt;You're talking about how much more money the rich have than the poor, but
&gt;&gt;you are totally off base on how to fix that situation. Poor people are poor
&gt;&gt;not because some rich guy is standing on their head. They are poor because
&gt;&gt;they are ignorant about how money works. They know that if they work for X
&gt;&gt;hours they get Y pay, and Y pay can buy them Z many twinkies, but anything
&gt;&gt;further and they're stumped.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As any economist will tell you, there is no such thing as free
&gt;&gt;&gt;money. Every dollar taken by one person is taken from
&gt;&gt;&gt;someone else. Record oil company and HMO profits are
&gt;&gt;&gt;not unrelated to a record number of personal bankruptcies.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Taken from someone else?&quot; That's a bit on the outlandish side.

&gt; It's how the system works. Nothing outlandish about it.

&gt;&gt;That makes
&gt;&gt;it sound like those poor poor people are just cringing at the end of a gun
&gt;&gt;barrel while some evil rich person forces them to sign over their life
&gt;&gt;savings to them. This kind of rhetoric is totally irrational.

&gt; Straw man argument. That's not what I said, or am saying.

&gt;&gt;Tax the
&gt;&gt;United States into prosperity. Give money to the poor who will just give it
&gt;&gt;right back to the rich. If you give a poor person money, but don't give
&gt;&gt;them the knowledge on how to best use that money you're giving them nothing.

&gt; Another straw man. Generally speaking, poor people don't
&gt; need lessons on how to best use their money. They economize
&gt; out of necessity. And in any case the issue isn't whether we
&gt; should give poor people more money. It's about whether the
&gt; wealthiest 1% of America actually needed HALF of Bush's
&gt; $1.6 trillion tax cut, while most of America's employed are
&gt; living paycheck to paycheck.

&gt; Rick

"/>  And too lazy to look for another job or a different line of work?
Why do people think they should be able to get rich, putting a minimum

&gt;&gt;Out of curiosity what do you consider to be an average job?

&gt;&gt;I realize that there are several US cities, mostly on the west coast
&gt;&gt;where the average price of a home exceeds the abilities of even those
&gt;&gt;with above average jobs, but that is not the way it is across the
&gt;&gt;country.

&gt;&gt;A person with a $30,000 a year job saving 10% of their salary towards
&gt;&gt;the down payment on a home needs to save for about seven years in most
&gt;&gt;parts of the country. Since nowadays both partners in a marriage work
&gt;&gt;that will drop it down to around 3. years. It is doable, just not all
&gt;&gt;that easy. It never really was back in the good old days either. At
&gt;&gt;least mortgage interest rates are fairly low compare to the 13% I was
&gt;&gt;paying back in the early eighties.

&gt; I think you need to figure out some new pretend numbers. Nobody pays that
&gt; much of a down payment on a first house when they are only making $30,000 a
&gt; year. Not unless rich uncle Dryfus died and left it to them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;suppose we in effect actually saved from dying? If we hadn't gone to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;war in Iraq and saved all those sensless killings by Sadam, folks like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you would be whinning here constantly. Bottom line, you just have to whine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perception means more than numbers. Saddam was an ass, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at least he was one of their own -- it was THEIR problem. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since the invasion, have you seen the nightly news broadcasts in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq? CSPAN showed one when Colin Powell was there last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; week. I was absolutely stunned. WE are now perceived as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evil mass murderers. Their own media is portraying us as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; invading enemy to be defeated, and inciting the population to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insurgency against our sons and daughters.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you mean well Rick, but turn to any news cast in any large US
&gt;&gt;&gt; City and you will find the same sort of things going on. Some folks
&gt;&gt;&gt; just like to bitch.

&gt;&gt; And some folks listen to nothing but Fox News and remain
&gt;&gt; abysmally ignorant of the reality around them.

&gt;&gt; The first (and so far, only) independent survey of the Iraqi
&gt;&gt; people since the invasion was published just last week. Read
&gt;&gt; it yourself. While not all the news is bad, it definitely paints a
&gt;&gt; much different picture than the one being painted by Bush and
&gt;&gt; his media mouthpieces.
&gt;&gt; http://www.csis.org/isp/pcr/0407_Capturing_Iraqi_Voices.pdf

&gt; It doesn't paint any different picture than those of us who actually pay
&gt; attention already know. You said that we were perceived as being evil mass
&gt; murderers, and that link does not show that to be true. You said that we
&gt; were being portrayed as an invading enemy to be defeated, but that doesn't
&gt; show that to be true. Personally, I watch FOX News, along with MSNBC and
&gt; occasionally CNN.

"/> No wonder you're so sheltered. Two of those are nothing
but fascist mouthpieces. Fox News is not news, it's fascist
propaganda. And MSNBC? Right, they were the ones who,
as part of the Bush/Rove propaganda campaign gave us
&quot;Countdown to Iraq&quot;, 24/7, continuously for SIX MONTHS
prior to the invasion:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, you give me honest numbers of those against
&gt;&gt;&gt; the US and the overthrow of Sadam Vs the numbers that are all for what
&gt;&gt;&gt; we are doing and I will be the first to give you your due. So far those
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorts of 'news broadcasts' have mostly been spun so far out of reality
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can't even begin to accept them as proof of anything.

&gt;&gt; See above. If CSPAN rebroadcasts CSIS's press conference
&gt;&gt; be sure to watch. They go into much more detail about the
&gt;&gt; state of affairs in Iraq than what's presented in the survey.

&gt; So you're saying that their report is incorrect? The numbers they use on
&gt; that document are false? What are you saying. Those numbers look very
&gt; respectable considering what has gone on and is going on over there. That
&gt; document says that people are most worried about governance, but they are
&gt; optomistic that once they elect a government that things will be better.

"/> The press conference reveals some of the hows and whys of
the numbers. For example, one of the reasons the results look
artificially positive (and Rick Barton admitted this openly) is
because entire regions of Iraq were excluded from the survey.
We learn that in large cities such as Basra the populations are
so upset with the U.S. that the surveyors feared violence of
the masses, and for their lives. No data was obtainable for
those regions.

We also learn (in Crocker's words) that &quot;most Iraqis view
the new government as a puppet of the U.S.&quot;, and are
unsupportive of it. The written survey minces these words
rather skillfully, but the bottom line is that &quot;governance&quot; is
flopping -- big time -- in virtually the entire country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That makes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it sound like those poor poor people are just cringing at the end of a

&gt;&gt;gun

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;barrel while some evil rich person forces them to sign over their life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;savings to them. This kind of rhetoric is totally irrational.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Straw man argument. That's not what I said, or am saying.

&gt;&gt;In other words, my characterization of what you're saying is so outrageous
&gt;&gt;that you don't even want to reply. It's called exaggeration. You did it, I
&gt;&gt;just extended your exaggeration to a point where it was obvious.

&gt; Sometimes money is given willingly and sometimes it isn't.
&gt; We could start a whole other debate about the sham &quot;free
&gt; market&quot;, which in fact hasn't existed since the 1960's, but
&gt; the question of whether money is given voluntarily isn't the
&gt; issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tax the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;United States into prosperity. Give money to the poor who will just

&gt;&gt;give it

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right back to the rich. If you give a poor person money, but don't give
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them the knowledge on how to best use that money you're giving them

&gt;&gt;nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Another straw man. Generally speaking, poor people don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;need lessons on how to best use their money. They economize
&gt;&gt;&gt;out of necessity. And in any case the issue isn't whether we

&gt;&gt;Economizing while not investing just slows the amount of time until it's all
&gt;&gt;gone.

&gt; It takes money to invest money, and most employed
&gt; Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.

&gt;&gt;It does nothing to fix anything. A poor person is poor not because
&gt;&gt;that's the hand life dealt them, they are poor because they strive for
&gt;&gt;mediocrity.

&gt; Yet another supply-side delusion. How many people do
&gt; you know who strive to work their asses off for 50 or 60
&gt; hours every week while still living paycheck to paycheck?
&gt; Get real.

&gt;&gt;A poor person with a million dollars is still poor because that
&gt;&gt;is their mindset. How many lottery winners are still rich after 5 years?
&gt;&gt;How many fewer are still rich after 10 years? Having money does nothing for
&gt;&gt;them because they know nothing about what to do with it. Give a man a
&gt;&gt;fish...Right? You do not teach anything by giving people things.

&gt; You have a real penchant for straw man arguments. No one's
&gt; talking about lottery winners for chrissakes. We're talking
&gt; about the majority of Americans who're living paycheck to
&gt; paycheck. We're talking about an economy where PhD's
&gt; are bussing tables in fucking restaurants to make ends meet.

&gt;&gt;Knowing how to buy your products off the bottom shelf and from thrift stores
&gt;&gt;does not make it so a person keeps their money. We need to start teaching
&gt;&gt;people in school how to invest money.

&gt; No, we need a President who doesn't sit with his thumb up
&gt; his ass while 30% of America's manufacturing jobs get
&gt; shipped overseas. We need to provide good paying jobs so
&gt; people HAVE money to invest in the first place.

&gt;&gt;Then there's the fact that you feel that people with ambition and drive who
&gt;&gt;go out and make lots of money with their knowledge and hard work should just
&gt;&gt;hand that money over to people who are not as ambitious or hard working.

&gt; Yet another straw man. The issue here is fair burden. During
&gt; the last massive transfer of wealth to the rich, the 1980's, the
&gt; top 2% of Americans saw their federal tax liability slashed by
&gt; HALF, while America's poor and middle class saw essentially
&gt; no reductions at all. Instead of this wealth &quot;trickling down&quot; to
&gt; the poor and middle class, as Reagan claimed it would, this
&gt; money trickled all the way down to wealthy people's bank
&gt; accounts. And it stayed there. The same ruse is going on now
&gt; with Bush and his operatives in Congress, with the exact same
&gt; disastrous results: record budget deficits and plunging our
&gt; grandkids into trillions of dollars of debt, all at the expense of
&gt; America's top 1%. It is thievery on an almost incomprehensible
&gt; scale.

&gt;&gt;People are rich for a reason, and that reason is not because they stole
&gt;&gt;anything from anyone else. If everything were to follow your idea of how
&gt;&gt;things should be, nobody should be driving a luxury car unless everyone has
&gt;&gt;one. Nobody should have a pool in their yard unless everyone has one.
&gt;&gt;Can't you see how this doesn't work? The Soviet Union fell already but you
&gt;&gt;would have us make a milder clone of it.

&gt; See above. All that's required is for America's top 2% to PAY
&gt; THEIR FAIR SHARE, which they haven't done for over 20
&gt; years now.

&gt;&gt;Canada's medical system is suffering because they decided to pay for it for
&gt;&gt;everybody. People that want stuff done have to come to the US. Where do
&gt;&gt;they go if the US follows their lead?

&gt; The Canadians I know are scared to death of becoming ill
&gt; whenever they visit the U.S., and Americans are chomping
&gt; at the bit to receive vastly less expensive prescription
&gt; medications from Canada. We have absolutely nothing on
&gt; their system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;should give poor people more money. It's about whether the
&gt;&gt;&gt;wealthiest 1% of America actually needed HALF of Bush's
&gt;&gt;&gt;$1.6 trillion tax cut, while most of America's employed are
&gt;&gt;&gt;living paycheck to paycheck.

&gt;&gt;That's a bullshit argument. I know it's fashionable to tow the party line,
&gt;&gt;but when you consider that the wealthiest 1% includes those making over
&gt;&gt;$80,000, you're talking about a demographic that most people don't realize.
&gt;&gt;Then factor in the wealthiest 5% and you're down to those making
&gt;&gt;$40,000/year.

&gt; Now THAT'S bullshit. Middle class these days is defined
&gt; by our government as anyone making up to $200,000/year.

&gt;&gt;Most people would consider those income brackets middle
&gt;&gt;class, but their salaries aren't in the middle. When those people pay 60%
&gt;&gt;of all taxes, they should get 60% of the total of an equal across the board
&gt;&gt;tax cut. It's not rocket science, it's simple math.

&gt; In your case, it's pathetic ignorance. Kerry's plan is to raise
&gt; taxes on those making over $200,000/year while giving a
&gt; long, LONG overdue tax cut to those making less than that.

&gt;&gt; Remember back to your
&gt;&gt;fourth grade math class a minute. If you give someone 60 items and 40 other
&gt;&gt;people give 1 item and those items are returned to you all equally, who
&gt;&gt;should get back the 60 items? Repeating it like a broken record only
&gt;&gt;convinces the stupid and uninformed. You'll have to do much better with
&gt;&gt;most of the people on this NG.

&gt; Give me a fucking break. This is the first time in U.S. history
&gt; that a President and Congress passed and kept a massive tax
&gt; cut in a time of war. During WWII for example, income over
&gt; $25,000/year was taxed at NINETY-FOUR PERCENT, and
&gt; we STILL didn't see any rich people standing in bread lines.

&gt;&gt; It sounds like you're saying that money should be taken from the rich to
&gt;&gt; give to the poor, the poor spend it and the rich get it back just to have
&gt; it
&gt;&gt; taken again,
&gt; -----snip-----

&gt; It might've sounded like that to you, but that's not what I said at all. Let
&gt; me clarify:

&gt; Of course the government needs money to operate, and taxation is the usual
&gt; methodology. I wouldn't be opposed to a &quot;value added tax&quot;, as was proposed
&gt; by Nixon. Most of the world has found such a consumption tax is a fair and
&gt; simple was to go, but since we're talking about income tax in this thread,
&gt; one question is whether or not the wealthiest among us should pay more than
&gt; the rest of us, say what they did during Clinton's eight years. As I recall,
&gt; they did quite well under Clinton. We're in deep and sinking in debt, and if
&gt; tax breaks are handed out, giving more to the middle class will spin the
&gt; economy sooner. I'd also be in favor of investment tax credits for business
&gt; and credits for businesses that invest more here than abroad.

&gt; Simply giving billionaires another break just doesn't do it for me. I know a
&gt; guy worth a few hundred million who spent his Bush tax refund buying a new
&gt; French jet. How does that make you feel?

&gt; Another question is why this is the only civilized country without
&gt; affordable health care. As a small business owner and employer for 28 years,
&gt; providing health coverage for my staff has always been one of my biggest
&gt; expenses and it's grown like a cancer. We already pay twice as much as other
&gt; civilized countries for our health coverage, and we get the least for it.
&gt; Nationalizing it should cost less, not more, but I understand your concern
&gt; that the unbridled greed in the USA would see to it that we'd somehow wind
&gt; up paying triple!

&gt; Alan Greenspan recently raised a red flag when he said in so many words that
&gt; our lack of investment in education is a major concern for the health of
&gt; economy and the only way to keep jobs here (and us from becoming a banana
&gt; republic) is to educate our kids a whole lot better. I agree that education
&gt; and health coverage are just as important as armies and roads to keep this
&gt; country safe and growing. If paying for these things out of the general
&gt; trust makes me a commie, I plead guilty, but some things can't get done if
&gt; left to the private sector.
&gt; Communism didn't work because the government
&gt; took all the money and kept it among the power elite,

"/> Communism didnt work because there was almost no
situations in which the more effort you put in, the more

The Rich are in higher tax brackets so they pay a larger percentage.
That means they pay more. If you get back 50% of what you paid in and
they get back 5%. Guess who gets back a huge pile of money?
It isn't you.
Instead of working for someone. Why don't you do what free people can do
in this country and start a business you own all for yourself.
That way you get the benefit of seeing what employers see.
Also if you do really well, you get to see your hard work confiscated by
punitive taxes.

In order to start your business what do you need?

Come on take a stab at it.

Just guess then.

Try.

&gt; The press conference reveals some of the hows and whys of

&gt; because entire regions of Iraq were excluded from the survey.
&gt; We learn that in large cities such as Basra the populations are
&gt; so upset with the U.S. that the surveyors feared violence of
&gt; the masses, and for their lives. No data was obtainable for
&gt; those regions.

&gt; We also learn (in Crocker's words) that &quot;most Iraqis view
&gt; the new government as a puppet of the U.S.&quot;, and are
&gt; unsupportive of it. The written survey minces these words

&gt; YOU, with your desire for $30 DVD players and $300 PC's, shipped

&gt; jobs. Do you want your kids to have assembly-line jobs, or do you
&gt; aspire for something better for them?

&gt;&gt; the last massive transfer of wealth to the rich, the 1980's, the
&gt;&gt; top 2% of Americans saw their federal tax liability slashed by
&gt;&gt; HALF, while America's poor and middle class saw essentially
&gt;&gt; no reductions at all.

&gt; BULLSHIT. ALL the tax brackets dropped.

&gt; Instead of this wealth &quot;trickling down&quot; to
&gt;&gt; the poor and middle class, as Reagan claimed it would, this
&gt;&gt; money trickled all the way down to wealthy people's bank
&gt;&gt; accounts. And it stayed there. The same ruse is going on now
&gt;&gt; with Bush and his operatives in Congress, with the exact same
&gt;&gt; disastrous results: record budget deficits and plunging our
&gt;&gt; grandkids into trillions of dollars of debt, all at the expense of
&gt;&gt; America's top 1%. It is thievery on an almost incomprehensible
&gt;&gt; scale.

&gt; What you don't understand, because you didn't finish school, is
&gt; that the deficit as a percentage of GNP is actually lower now than it was.

&gt;&gt; See above. All that's required is for America's top 2% to PAY
&gt;&gt; THEIR FAIR SHARE, which they haven't done for over 20
&gt;&gt; years now.

&gt; What you don't understand is that they are INVESTING their cash
&gt; into BUSINESSES that GENERATE JOBS.

&gt;&gt; The Canadians I know are scared to death of becoming ill
&gt;&gt; whenever they visit the U.S., and Americans are chomping
&gt;&gt; at the bit to receive vastly less expensive prescription
&gt;&gt; medications from Canada. We have absolutely nothing on
&gt;&gt; their system.

&gt; I live in a community where we see Canadians FLOCK in the
&gt; wintertime for superior American health care. My husband grew up in the
&gt; U.K. under socialized medicine, and is now paying for it with having to
&gt; go to a REAL dentist to undo damage by GOVERNMENT dentists.

&gt;&gt; In your case, it's pathetic ignorance. Kerry's plan is to raise
&gt;&gt; taxes on those making over $200,000/year while giving a
&gt;&gt; long, LONG overdue tax cut to those making less than that.

&gt; When he increases those taxes, that will give people LESS MONEY TO
&gt; PAY EMPLOYEES, and unemployment will rise. But as a wage slave, that is
&gt; beyond your comprehension.

&gt;&gt; Give me a fucking break. This is the first time in U.S. history
&gt;&gt; that a President and Congress passed and kept a massive tax
&gt;&gt; cut in a time of war. During WWII for example, income over
&gt;&gt; $25,000/year was taxed at NINETY-FOUR PERCENT, and
&gt;&gt; we STILL didn't see any rich people standing in bread lines.

&gt; Do you have any idea how much $25K was worth in the forties?
&gt; Obviously not.

Vicki , My grandfather was a railroad Engineer or operator of a steam engine in
1918 to 1957. During the 1940's he told me that he was the highest paid person
in the county / Parish at the rate of $2.00 a hour or a little over $4,000.00 a
years. The Parish Judge, Local Bank President, and the Sheriff were pretty close
to him on pay.

This $25K then would be 6 times what a bank president made that was over 4 banks
and one sub bank out let. That $25K then was a un Godly amount of money for a
person to make. He also said his tax bill was about $100.00 a year totally .

WoW , $25K a year in the 1940's.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perception means more than numbers. Saddam was an ass, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at least he was one of their own -- it was THEIR problem. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since the invasion, have you seen the nightly news broadcasts in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; week. I was absolutely stunned. WE are now perceived as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evil mass murderers. Their own media is portraying us as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; invading enemy to be defeated, and inciting the population to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insurgency against our sons and daughters.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you mean well Rick, but turn to any news cast in any large US

&gt;&gt;&gt; just like to bitch.

&gt;&gt;And some folks listen to nothing but Fox News and remain
&gt;&gt;abysmally ignorant of the reality around them.

&gt;&gt;The first (and so far, only) independent survey of the Iraqi

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, you give me honest numbers of those against

those
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorts of 'news broadcasts' have mostly been spun so far out of reality
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can't even begin to accept them as proof of anything.

&gt;&gt;See above. If CSPAN rebroadcasts CSIS's press conference
&gt;&gt;be sure to watch. They go into much more detail about the
&gt;&gt;state of affairs in Iraq than what's presented in the survey.

&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt; Rick, stop and think about this calmly &amp; cooly. Let's say that Kerry
&gt; gets elected and charts a different course in Iraq. Do you think him
&gt;&amp; his media mouthpieces are going to do anything other then put a
&gt; positive spin on what he is doing in Iraq? It is a pure nature of the
&gt; beast thing. Do you really think Kerry, Bush or any other
&gt; talking-head would announce to the national press &quot;Gee guys I fucked
&gt; up and things aren't going as I planned&quot;?

"/> Then there is the fact that Kerry has made no concrete statement about what
action he would take that is different than Bush's. He says he will work
with other countries to contain things in Iraq. How does he figure he's
going to work with other countries any better than Bush did. The simple
fact is, he has no idea, but it makes a good sound byte.

Kerry has no plan that is any different than the one already in effect. He
cannot and will not do anything any differently as far as Iraq goes, so the
point in talking about it is all but moot. The only thing that should be
talked about is how big of a hypocrite that Kerry is when he says our
soldiers need more of anything when he voted against spending anything more
on them. Then there's the fact that he only states he's going to do things
that are already being done, but are abscure and nobody knows about them.

Kerry is an idiot, and the only difference he has to Bush is the fact that
he has no spine if the political wind is against his viewpoint, and that he
wants more money out of our pockets.

&gt;&gt; Of course, if you are sucking at the government teat, on welfare,
&gt;&gt; you didn't get a break BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PAY TAXES! The big Liberal
&gt;&gt; lie is that only the rich got tax breaks. If you pay taxes, you got a
&gt;&gt; break.

&gt; HALF of Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut went to the top 1%.

"/> Explain something to me you mathematical wizard. If person X made 10,000
and owed 100 in taxes, and person Y made 100000000 and owed 500000 in taxes,
but then 10% of that money owed was given back to each person, how did
person Y get a larger percentage back than person X. You're comparing
apples to oranges. Percentage of money paid in versus the percentage of
total refunded would only make sense to argue if everyone paid exactly the
same amount in taxes. If the Rich were only liable for 10% all the way down
to the poor, you would have totally different numbers, but because of a
progressive tax system you can skew your numbers from here till Tuesday and
make it sound like something unfair is going on.

If the richest 1% only paid 1% of the total tax debt, they would have only
gotten back 1% of the total tax cut. Since they pay over half of the total
tax debt, they received over half of the tax cut. When you can do honest
calculations, then tell us that something sinister happened, but until then,
you're just committing class warfare for political expediency. If you
actually believe what you're saying, then you're a sad case and only one
spilled glass of milk away from being committed.

The credit and debt you are talking about are in two totally separate areas.
We give money to everyone. They call it a loan, but nobody ever pays it
back. On the other hand, when we are borrowing money, it is not from other
countries, it is from the Federal Reserve. That money gets paid back. If
we were borrowing money from other countries, then you might have a point,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm working fifty hours a week so that the guy in South
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Phoenix can drink beer and fish all day. Redistribution of wealth
is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what Democrats are all about. People who work hard are penalized
for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their efforts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down the toilet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Talk to us about redistribution of wealth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That produced quite a bit of employment, fool.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How many people does it take to make a $500.00 hammer?

&gt;&gt; You idiot. My father worked for a defense contractor; as did
&gt;&gt; millions of peoples' parents. And not all of them overpriced their
&gt;&gt; products. Have you ever heard of something called COMPETITIVE BIDDING,
&gt;&gt; which is REQUIRED on most government purchases?

&gt; Yeah, except for Halliburton. Imagine what a Republican
&gt; controlled Congress would have done to Al Gore, if Gore
&gt; had been receiving $180,000 a year from his &quot;ex&quot; company
&gt; while giving said company $8 billion, no-bid, open-ended
&gt; government contracts. They would have had his head on a
&gt; platter, yet that's exactly what Dick Cheney did.

&gt; As for your other point, it's a well established fact that defense
&gt; contractors make 200-300% as much profit on government
&gt; contracts compared to private sector contracts. I worked for
&gt; a major defense contractor and have never seen such
&gt; monumental squandering of taxpayer dollars, before or since.
&gt; Row after row after row of six-figure bums drinking coffee
&gt; and talking about their families all day -- every day.
&gt; Absolutely pathetic.

"/> Yeah, I'll bet you worked for a defense contractor. I used to work for the
CIA in the 1980's too, and don't let me forget the KGB. I did it at the
same time and played them both against each other. I was making 12 million
dollars a year, and it was all on the back of the taxpayer.

There is no doubt that government efficiency is a contradiction in terms,
and what doesn't make a difference in that is which administration is in
office. The more socialized our government gets, the less buying power our
money has. That money gets spent on bullshit administrative costs that go
to pay people that are totally unnecessary. Democrats would rather everyone
work and pay the government 100% of their money, then give it back to them
as they see fit, especially through government programs. A government
program that guarantees to have my dog walked every day could be guaranteed
to cost at least 4 times what it should. That's what you're rooting for.

"/> The only extreme agenda we've been putting up with for the
last 20+ years has been from right-wing idiots such as yourself.

Now let's review party platforms, shall we?

Abortion - Republican

&quot;We support a human life amendment to the Constitution
and we endorse legislation that the 14th Amendment's
protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to
have legislative and judicial protection of that right against
those who perform abortions.&quot;

Yes, you read it correctly. Their platform calls for assigning
the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to fetuses,
and throwing doctors who perform abortions (note there are
no exceptions in their platform, for rape, life-of-the-mother
cases etc) in jail.

Abortion - Democratic

&quot;Because we believe in the privacy and equality of women,
we stand proudly for a woman's right to choose, consistent
with Roe v. Wade, and regardless of her ability to pay. We
stand firmly against Republican efforts to undermine that right.
At the same time, we strongly support family planning and
adoption incentives. Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.&quot;

Now, kindly tell us which is the more extreme agenda.

As for the government taking 100% of anyone's money, that's
a straw man argument and you know it. Be honest -- have you
ever met anyone who advocated such a thing?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The families and friends of 12,000 Iraqi civilians who were

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sounds like you love numbers. So tell me. Assuming 12,000 Iraqi
Non
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Combatants were killed in the battle and we sent that ass Sadam
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;underground where he became inefective, what sort of number do you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;suppose we in effect actually saved from dying? If we hadn't gone
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;war in Iraq and saved all those sensless killings by Sadam, folks
like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you would be whinning here constantly. Bottom line, you just have
to whine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perception means more than numbers. Saddam was an ass, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at least he was one of their own -- it was THEIR problem. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since the invasion, have you seen the nightly news broadcasts in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq? CSPAN showed one when Colin Powell was there last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; week. I was absolutely stunned. WE are now perceived as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evil mass murderers. Their own media is portraying us as an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; invading enemy to be defeated, and inciting the population to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insurgency against our sons and daughters.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you mean well Rick, but turn to any news cast in any large US
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; City and you will find the same sort of things going on. Some folks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just like to bitch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And some folks listen to nothing but Fox News and remain
&gt;&gt;&gt;abysmally ignorant of the reality around them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The first (and so far, only) independent survey of the Iraqi
&gt;&gt;&gt;people since the invasion was published just last week. Read
&gt;&gt;&gt;it yourself. While not all the news is bad, it definitely paints a
&gt;&gt;&gt;much different picture than the one being painted by Bush and
&gt;&gt;&gt;his media mouthpieces.
&gt;&gt;&gt;http://www.csis.org/isp/pcr/0407_Capturing_Iraqi_Voices.pdf

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, you give me honest numbers of those against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the US and the overthrow of Sadam Vs the numbers that are all for
what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we are doing and I will be the first to give you your due. So far
those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sorts of 'news broadcasts' have mostly been spun so far out of
reality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can't even begin to accept them as proof of anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;See above. If CSPAN rebroadcasts CSIS's press conference
&gt;&gt;&gt;be sure to watch. They go into much more detail about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;state of affairs in Iraq than what's presented in the survey.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt;&gt; Rick, stop and think about this calmly &amp; cooly. Let's say that Kerry
&gt;&gt; gets elected and charts a different course in Iraq. Do you think him
&gt;&gt;&amp; his media mouthpieces are going to do anything other then put a
&gt;&gt; positive spin on what he is doing in Iraq? It is a pure nature of the
&gt;&gt; beast thing. Do you really think Kerry, Bush or any other
&gt;&gt; talking-head would announce to the national press &quot;Gee guys I fucked
&gt;&gt; up and things aren't going as I planned&quot;?

&gt; The best and in fact only way out of this mess is to first send
&gt; Mr. Bush back to Texas, then begin to repair the damage he
&gt; has done by rebuilding the relationships with our allies, and
&gt; then implement a multilateral, UN guided governing force
&gt; and reconstruction effort in Iraq. As long as the Iraqi people
&gt; view their new government as a mere puppet of the U.S.
&gt; (which, as long as the U.S. is acting unilaterally, it will be),
&gt; the new government will not succeed.

"/> I guess the dozens of other countries that are our allies in Iraq does not
constitute a multilateral force. I guess that the UN, who has proven oh so
effective in the past can somehow change their methods and do a better job
than the US has proven its ability to do very well already. I guess that
the definition of unilateral means acting with dozens of allies.

Whatever it is, I'm sure you can enlighten us since you seem to have such an
excellent grasp on the truth.

&gt; Interesting side note about the upcoming elections. Seems

Yeah, Bin Laden is going to think that if he endorses a candidate that the
American people are going to vote for him. I think there is a standing
invitation for him to come spend the night at the whitehouse, that is if he
makes a large contribution to the Demo....Oh, wait, wrong president.

Any idiot would take anything Bin Laden says with a grain of salt. Even he
is intelligent enough to know that his endorsement of a candidate, if taken
seriously, would be a death sentence to that candidates chances. I guess
he's counting on people in the US to be less intelligent than he is in order
to get Kerry elected. Unfortunately he's found at least one gullible idiot,
and we all know that where there's one roach, there's thousands.

democracy, but the fact that it is a hungry bear that will take whatever it

decides how much money is yours and how much is the governments? Hint, it's
the government. So, in actuality, the only reason you keep any of your
money is because the government hasn't decided it wants it.

What's amazing to me is that there was a revolution in this country that was
started over a three cent increase on the tax on tea (this was still cheaper
than they were paying other tea merchants besides the East India Company
without the tax).

People back then realized that taxes were slavery. In fact, there is a
pretty good paper on the subject at  www.beyoneracism.org , where it explains
the ideology of the american people at the time of the revolution. Granted,
this idology conflicted greatly with the actual practice of owning African
slaves.

The government having the ability to tax me for any portion of my labors
means that that portion of my labor was done for free, especially that
portion of that labor that doesn't benefit me. Yes, I'm allowed to keep a
little more than half of what I make, but that's like telling the slave in
the field that he can eat some of the vegetables he picked every night that
he works. It means that the money I make is not mine, but someone elses,
and they are giving me an allowance. That is directly opposed to the
principals this country was founded upon, and I am in direct opposition to
it. I do not like writing that check to the IRS every month. To you, it's
just numbers on a check stub, but to me it is actual cash that was once in
my bank account, but is now being sent off to the government in order to
support programs that are meant more to keep elected officials in office
than they are to actually help anyone.

Just keep on with your bullshit rhetoric, and I'll stick with the facts.
It's been clear to anyone that your idea of a utopian society means that the
rich pay for the poor to live, and the poor then have no incentive to get
off their dead asses.

Any small business owner like myself who's tried to offer services to the
government through the competitive bidding process quickly discovers that
it's a rigged game. RFQ's are written to favor the largest bidders, not the
most competitive. Then they sub-contract the work if they can while the big
bosses play golf with the government buyers (witness Big Dick Cheney who
plays both sides of this game). A small guy would be lost in the management
of the contract details which are endless and beyond belief. The $500 hammer
is just a normal Stanley, but the packaging details are why it costs what it
does.

&gt;&gt; While that's true, the one phrase in there that sums it all up is
&quot;tolerant
&gt;&gt; of the ideas and behavior of others.&quot; That tolerance has made them the
&gt;&gt; party for everyone who has an extreme agenda, and over the years, they
have
&gt;&gt; let themselves be overtaken by those extremists to the point that there
is
&gt;&gt; nothing recognizable as a true Democratic platform anymore.

&gt; The only extreme agenda we've been putting up with for the
&gt; last 20+ years has been from right-wing idiots such as yourself.

&gt; Now let's review party platforms, shall we?

&gt; Abortion - Republican

&gt;&quot;We support a human life amendment to the Constitution
&gt; and we endorse legislation that the 14th Amendment's
&gt; protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to
&gt; have legislative and judicial protection of that right against
&gt; those who perform abortions.&quot;

&gt; Yes, you read it correctly. Their platform calls for assigning
&gt; the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to fetuses,
&gt; and throwing doctors who perform abortions (note there are
&gt; no exceptions in their platform, for rape, life-of-the-mother
&gt; cases etc) in jail.

"/> What's wrong with that? A fetus is not purely a piece of bodily tissue that
is to be thought of as some sort of tumorous growth inside a woman's body
that she should have the right to dispose of at will. That is a potential
human life. It only looses that potential after an abortion, whether chosen
or spontaneous. All humans have been determined to have inalienable rights
in this country, and a death sentence without due process would surely be a
violation of the 14th amendment, not to mention the equal protection
violations since a human life outside a woman's body is granted different
protections than a human life inside a woman's body. While the ability to
live outside that woman's body at any given time may be questionable, that
does not give anyone the right to cut off that child's life support system.
There are laws in the US about the ability to choose whether or not to cut
off someone's life support when they are outside a woman's body, but those
are not applied equally to fetuses.

This doesn't all just boil down to whether or not the child can survive
outside the woman's body. I believe it's the law in most states that if you
know CPR, you are to administer CPR until you are either too exhausted to
continue or until help arrives. That is a law that is meant to protect
human life at the expense of your comfort. That human might not be able to
live without your life giving recessitation, but hardly anyone would fight
for the right of a person not to administer CPR because they have the right
to do whatever they want to with their own body, yet we have this irrational
mantra that the left chants saying that it's alright to kill a human being
as long as that human being is inside a woman's body.

You won't find abortion rights activists calling it abortion anymore. They
prefer the phrase &quot;A woman's right to choose.&quot; which is basically saying
that if you disagree with them then you believe a woman doesn't have the
right to choose. That makes no sense. A woman's right to choose abortion
might be acceptable as a descriptive term of what they are fighting for.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Abortion - Democratic

&gt;&quot;Because we believe in the privacy and equality of women,
&gt; we stand proudly for a woman's right to choose, consistent
&gt; with Roe v. Wade, and regardless of her ability to pay. We
&gt; stand firmly against Republican efforts to undermine that right.
&gt; At the same time, we strongly support family planning and
&gt; adoption incentives. Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.&quot;

&gt; Now, kindly tell us which is the more extreme agenda.

"/> How hard is this? Hmmm....Put someone in jail for murdering a human life,
or letting murder be performed on an ad hock basis all across the country wi
th no accountability. This is a hard question to answer. Yeah, I guess
you're right. I think that murder should be legalized across the country,
and that so there are no equal protection violations that everyone should be
allowed to murder their children. There need be no notion that life is
precious.

This seems a very hypocritical agenda given the clear Democratic party
beliefs on capital punishment. You shouldn't be able to kill.a murderer,
but you should be able to kill a human who has never had a chance to do
anything to deserve that death.

Abortion is murder, and I am against it farther than the Republican party
is. Rape and incest are not reasons to murder someone. That child had no
choice in how it was conceived, and is innocent of that act. If rape or
incest are good motives for murder then children at whatever age, if they
were a product of rape or incest, should be able to be killed by their
mother. The only reason that I would condone abortion is in cases where the
life of the mother is in jeopardy.

I can't believe that you would pick a subject that is about the worst
example of what Democrats stand for and put that up as a good idea. The
majority of the US people believe that abortion should be illegal. This
again shows that Democrats are the party for the minority fringe nut jobs
that sit in the cracks and only come out when the lights are out. How about
some other groups? What about the gay marriage people. They are the major
minority, but they find a home with the Democrats. What about communists?
Their sorry excuse for a party has been all but extinct for decades, but
they still find a home with the Democrats. Socialism runs rampant in the
Democratic party and that probably is one reason for the reason for the easy
home for totalitarian socialists. Name a group of people that is not
accepted by mainstream society that doesn't find a comfortable place nestled
inside the democratic party, and I'll show you a group that will find a home
within the Democratic party within a decade.

"/> That sorry excuse for a result was one good issue that proves how truely
clueless you are. While there are people that feel that tolerance is a
virtue, I am not one that has been immasculated by the feminist movement. I
am a 100% concealed weapon carrying, tax avoiding (not evading), ball
scratching, beer belly aspiring, breast staring at, deer killing, whiskey
drinking, non fight avoiding, motorcycle riding, ranch owning, explosion
loving, horsepower loving, authority hating, and last but certainly not
least woman loving man. If it were legal, I would lead the march to shoot
every last abortion giving doctor and every person who was unrepentent about
having an abortion in the world. I'm not talking about sniping, I would
look right in their eyes when I shot them. I don't believe in God, so fear
of eternal damnation doesn't deter me from anything.

See the difference between you and I? I am they type of person that created
this country, other than the not believing in God part. The kind of person
who has no fear of what people think of me. In fact, I often feed on people
hating me. It's not that I look to make people hate me, it is that if
someone hates me it means that I didn't cave into any pressure to make them
like me. I didn't change my values to suite the situation.

I am the worst kind of person to ever run for political office because I
actually have values, and those values would keep me from voting for
something just because the majority of the people who elected me thought it
was a good idea at the time. I hate new laws so much that I would
fillibuster every law that came to the floor unless it was an attempt to
repeal existing law. I would need lung transplants every month because I
would have to talk so much. I would actually say what was on my mind, and
people could trust that what I said was exactly the truth as I know it.
That is why I identify with Dick Cheney. He is forthright, and he says
what's on his mind. He doesn't sugar coat things just so that people like
him, and that is a hell of a person in my opinion.

Now, you go back to your treehouse with your 12 year old girlfriend, and
hope I don't see you and her at the abortion clinic just as season opens on
people like you. Eat your granola and drive your Yugo, while the rest of
the world revolves around your pathetic excuse for a human life. You have a
memory for rhetoric that is second to none, it's too bad that you don't have
the intellect to understand what you are repeating. You disgust me and I'm
done talking to you.

&gt; Is that why the gap between rich and poor in America is

b) The whole abortion thing boils down to two concepts..
b-1) What rights does a person have?
b-2) What is a person? Or, more to the point, when do you admit
that something is both a person and has rights.

Since people have been convicted of murder when they kill
a fetus (i.e. shooting a mother and killing her &amp; her unborn
baby) then obviously the law considers a fetus both a person
and a person having rights. Since people have not been even
charged for murder when they kill a fetus (i.e. abortion) then
obviously the law considers a fetus both not a person and
not having any rights.

Seems obvious that the law is confused on the subject.

If one were to apply the same kind of double standard to all
human rights then you could be convicted of murder if you kill
someone else's child (i.e. shoot them in a school yard) but
not if you kill your own child (i.e. drown them in the tub).

Some other countries are much less confused. They allow parents
to drown their children.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you want real tax reform, eliminate withholding so that everybody
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has to send in their quarterly taxes out of their checking account,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and eliminate all hidden taxes (which are what corporate taxes are),
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so that everybody knows exactly what this government costs them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Exactly, I have been self employed for a long time and it really makes
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; think when you send in the quarterly estimated payment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Far too many people view the net amount on their paycheck as their
&gt; earnings.

&gt;&gt; You mean that people who have tax withheld do not review their
&gt;&gt; paycheck stubs? I don't know about anyone else, but I review
&gt;&gt; each of my paycheck stubs, and certainly my W-2 each year. How
&gt;&gt; much I pay to Uncle Sam is not something that easily escapes
&gt;&gt; my attention.

&gt; It sure would if when you got your paycheck you had to write a check to the
&gt; government you would notice it. It would actually hit you that the money
&gt; they were taking was actually coming out of your pocket. The way things are
&gt; now, you don't ever have the ability to touch that money so you don't get
&gt; the picture. Did it ever strike you as funny why the majority of business
&gt; owners are conservative, if not Republican? Republicans tout themselves as
&gt; being the anti-big-government party, although they aren't. Business owners
&gt; who actually do have to write those checks have a much better idea about
&gt; what happens with their money and they don't like it. They have been
&gt; swooned by the Republicans into thinking that their party will keep taxes
&gt; low, but in reality they are almost identically as fiscally irresponsible as
&gt; Democrats. While there are two schools of thought about what form of
&gt; spending should be done with that money, neither party gets the idea that
&gt; people spend their money much more wisely than any government ever will.

&gt; Don't believe for one moment that you, as an employee, have any real clue
&gt; about how much money you pay to the government. You might be able to see a
&gt; number on a paper, but if that money had to come out of your pocket after
&gt; you got your paycheck, you would be much more enlightened.

How about this for a broad concept: You get to keep the first million you
make each year nearly tax free, then the government takes nearly everything
you make over that. Also there should be no corporate tax so long as the
corporation keeps its money in the country. But this is all b.s. because I
already said that a VAT is better than an income tax. It's simpler, fairer
and in line with what the rest of the world does, making trade with them
easier.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ignorance is the word. People forget that for 150 years in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this country, an average American with an average job could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;afford to buy the average house. Now it's to the point where,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in my city, 90% of the people are forced to rent because they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can't afford to buy anything at all, even a condo. Home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ownership has become a distant dream for 90% of us.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt; Out of curiosity what do you consider to be an average job?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I realize that there are several US cities, mostly on the west coast
&gt;&gt;&gt; where the average price of a home exceeds the abilities of even those
&gt;&gt;&gt; with above average jobs, but that is not the way it is across the
&gt;&gt;&gt; country.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A person with a $30,000 a year job saving 10% of their salary towards
&gt;&gt;&gt; the down payment on a home needs to save for about seven years in most
&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of the country. Since nowadays both partners in a marriage work
&gt;&gt;&gt; that will drop it down to around 3. years. It is doable, just not all
&gt;&gt;&gt; that easy. It never really was back in the good old days either. At
&gt;&gt;&gt; least mortgage interest rates are fairly low compare to the 13% I was
&gt;&gt;&gt; paying back in the early eighties.

&gt;&gt;I think you need to figure out some new pretend numbers. Nobody pays that
&gt;&gt;much of a down payment on a first house when they are only making $30,000 a
&gt;&gt;year. Not unless rich uncle Dryfus died and left it to them.

&gt; If you use an average of a $100,000 dollar home with a 20% down
&gt; payment they certainly do. Almost any bank will grant a loan with a
&gt; 20% down payment.

"/> Average $100K home? Where?

The taxes that I actually pay are much less than most people reading this I

even have close to a fascist agenda. My agenda is much farther from fascism
than your agenda is from communism. Just because my views are far right of

found 5 bedroom homes with 5 acres of land or their price equivilant for
around $50,000. That wasn't usually out in the boonies either, but on the
very edge of town. I'm not sure that you can get a new home built for that

average used home goes for $100,000.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I realize that there are several US cities, mostly on the west coast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;where the average price of a home exceeds the abilities of even those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with above average jobs, but that is not the way it is across the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A person with a $30,000 a year job saving 10% of their salary towards
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the down payment on a home needs to save for about seven years in most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;parts of the country. Since nowadays both partners in a marriage work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that will drop it down to around 3. years. It is doable, just not all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that easy. It never really was back in the good old days either. At
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;least mortgage interest rates are fairly low compare to the 13% I was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;paying back in the early eighties.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you need to figure out some new pretend numbers. Nobody pays that
&gt;&gt;&gt;much of a down payment on a first house when they are only making $30,000 a
&gt;&gt;&gt;year. Not unless rich uncle Dryfus died and left it to them.

&gt;&gt;If you use an average of a $100,000 dollar home with a 20% down
&gt;&gt;payment they certainly do. Almost any bank will grant a loan with a
&gt;&gt;20% down payment.

&gt; Average $100K home? Where?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually true liberals are still liberals and not actually out for

&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves in liberal clothing as a disguise to sneak into the flock.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have to remember that a true liberal is one favoring proposals for
&gt;&gt;&gt; reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas and
&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior of others; broad-minded. The folks that call themselves
&gt;&gt;&gt; liberals nowadays fit none of these characteristics. They want the
&gt;&gt;&gt; welfare status quo, or even more of it if they can get it. They are
&gt;&gt;&gt; very intolerant of other views, and are narrow minded to the extreme.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many also no longer believe in the law of the land.

&gt;&gt; That's excellently said.

&gt; While that's true, the one phrase in there that sums it all up is &quot;tolerant
&gt; of the ideas and behavior of others.&quot; That tolerance has made them the
&gt; party for everyone who has an extreme agenda, and over the years, they have
&gt; let themselves be overtaken by those extremists to the point that there is
&gt; nothing recognizable as a true Democratic platform anymore.

"/> What conservative ideals are recognizable in the Republican party now?
I thought conservatives supported smaller government, minimal government
spending, and government that does not intrude into private lives. So,
how is the Republican party pursuing this ideals now? Seems to me, they
are moving in the opposite direction in every area and are now responding
to corporate greed and the whims of radical Christians.

Kerry has the sense to admit that not all Americans share his view

his religious-based views. That's what any sensible politician
on either party should say, and it is what most do say, except for
extremists like Rick Santorum and our president.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It sounds like you're saying that money should be taken from the rich to
&gt;&gt;&gt; give to the poor, the poor spend it and the rich get it back just to have
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; taken again,
&gt;&gt; -----snip-----

&gt;&gt; It might've sounded like that to you, but that's not what I said at all.
&gt;&gt; Let
&gt;&gt; me clarify:

&gt;&gt; Of course the government needs money to operate, and taxation is the usual
&gt;&gt; methodology. I wouldn't be opposed to a &quot;value added tax&quot;, as was proposed
&gt;&gt; by Nixon. Most of the world has found such a consumption tax is a fair and
&gt;&gt; simple was to go, but since we're talking about income tax in this thread,
&gt;&gt; one question is whether or not the wealthiest among us should pay more than
&gt;&gt; the rest of us, say what they did during Clinton's eight years. As I
&gt;&gt; recall,
&gt;&gt; they did quite well under Clinton. We're in deep and sinking in debt, and
&gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; tax breaks are handed out, giving more to the middle class will spin the
&gt;&gt; economy sooner. I'd also be in favor of investment tax credits for business
&gt;&gt; and credits for businesses that invest more here than abroad.

&gt;&gt; Simply giving billionaires another break just doesn't do it for me. I know
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; guy worth a few hundred million who spent his Bush tax refund buying a new
&gt;&gt; French jet. How does that make you feel?

&gt;&gt; Another question is why this is the only civilized country without
&gt;&gt; affordable health care. As a small business owner and employer for 28
&gt;&gt; years,
&gt;&gt; providing health coverage for my staff has always been one of my biggest
&gt;&gt; expenses and it's grown like a cancer. We already pay twice as much as
&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt; civilized countries for our health coverage, and we get the least for it.
&gt;&gt; Nationalizing it should cost less, not more, but I understand your concern
&gt;&gt; that the unbridled greed in the USA would see to it that we'd somehow wind
&gt;&gt; up paying triple!

&gt;&gt; Alan Greenspan recently raised a red flag when he said in so many words
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; our lack of investment in education is a major concern for the health of
&gt;&gt; economy and the only way to keep jobs here (and us from becoming a banana
&gt;&gt; republic) is to educate our kids a whole lot better. I agree that education
&gt;&gt; and health coverage are just as important as armies and roads to keep this
&gt;&gt; country safe and growing. If paying for these things out of the general
&gt;&gt; trust makes me a commie, I plead guilty, but some things can't get done if
&gt;&gt; left to the private sector.

&gt;&gt; Communism didn't work because the government
&gt;&gt; took all the money and kept it among the power elite,

&gt; Communism didnt work because there was almost no
&gt; situations in which the more effort you put in, the more
&gt; you ended up with on the basics of decent housing etc.

&gt; With that basic structure, hardly anyone works very hard.

"/> Tell that to the Chinese.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down the toilet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Talk to us about redistribution of wealth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That produced quite a bit of employment, fool.

&gt;&gt; How many people does it take to make a $500.00 hammer?

&gt; You idiot. My father worked for a defense contractor; as did
&gt; millions of peoples' parents. And not all of them overpriced their
&gt; products. Have you ever heard of something called COMPETITIVE BIDDING,
&gt; which is REQUIRED on most government purchases?

&gt; Pity the poor soldier who knows that his rifle was made by the low
&gt; bidder.

"/> So tell me why Bush's friends seem to get hundreds of millions in
contracts on no-bid deals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It sounds like you're saying that money should be taken from the rich to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; give to the poor, the poor spend it and the rich get it back just to have
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taken again,
&gt;&gt;&gt; -----snip-----

&gt;&gt;&gt; It might've sounded like that to you, but that's not what I said at all.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Let
&gt;&gt;&gt; me clarify:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course the government needs money to operate, and taxation is the usual
&gt;&gt;&gt; methodology. I wouldn't be opposed to a &quot;value added tax&quot;, as was proposed
&gt;&gt;&gt; by Nixon. Most of the world has found such a consumption tax is a fair and
&gt;&gt;&gt; simple was to go, but since we're talking about income tax in this thread,
&gt;&gt;&gt; one question is whether or not the wealthiest among us should pay more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; the rest of us, say what they did during Clinton's eight years. As I
&gt;&gt;&gt; recall,
&gt;&gt;&gt; they did quite well under Clinton. We're in deep and sinking in debt, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt;&gt; tax breaks are handed out, giving more to the middle class will spin the
&gt;&gt;&gt; economy sooner. I'd also be in favor of investment tax credits for business
&gt;&gt;&gt; and credits for businesses that invest more here than abroad.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply giving billionaires another break just doesn't do it for me. I know
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; guy worth a few hundred million who spent his Bush tax refund buying a new
&gt;&gt;&gt; French jet. How does that make you feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Another question is why this is the only civilized country without
&gt;&gt;&gt; affordable health care. As a small business owner and employer for 28
&gt;&gt;&gt; years,
&gt;&gt;&gt; providing health coverage for my staff has always been one of my biggest
&gt;&gt;&gt; expenses and it's grown like a cancer. We already pay twice as much as
&gt;&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt;&gt; civilized countries for our health coverage, and we get the least for it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nationalizing it should cost less, not more, but I understand your concern
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the unbridled greed in the USA would see to it that we'd somehow wind
&gt;&gt;&gt; up paying triple!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Alan Greenspan recently raised a red flag when he said in so many words
&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; our lack of investment in education is a major concern for the health of
&gt;&gt;&gt; economy and the only way to keep jobs here (and us from becoming a banana
&gt;&gt;&gt; republic) is to educate our kids a whole lot better. I agree that education
&gt;&gt;&gt; and health coverage are just as important as armies and roads to keep this
&gt;&gt;&gt; country safe and growing. If paying for these things out of the general
&gt;&gt;&gt; trust makes me a commie, I plead guilty, but some things can't get done if
&gt;&gt;&gt; left to the private sector.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Communism didn't work because the government
&gt;&gt;&gt; took all the money and kept it among the power elite,

&gt;&gt; Communism didnt work because there was almost no
&gt;&gt; situations in which the more effort you put in, the more
&gt;&gt; you ended up with on the basics of decent housing etc.

&gt;&gt; With that basic structure, hardly anyone works very hard.
&gt; Tell that to the Chinese.

"/> Even someone as stupid as you should have noticed
that china aint communist anymore and that taiwan
worked a hell of a lot better than china did too.

guess that would mean we had a bad economy, but if you do Democrat math, you
get the results you would expect from the new math crap that Democrats seem
to be supporting now. No answer is wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that something is both a person and has rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A few laws have been passed recently that attempt to confuse

&gt;&gt;&gt; been thrown out or are under challenge in our courts. But that
&gt;&gt;&gt; some people believe government should be getting involved in

&gt;&gt;&gt; Timm whine and moan about how bad government is, then
&gt;&gt;&gt; suddenly do a complete 180 when it comes to issues such as
&gt;&gt;&gt; abortion or that otherwise serve their own fascist, extreme
&gt;&gt;&gt; agenda.

&gt;&gt; Government is involved already by passing the bill of rights, and the
14th
&gt;&gt; amendment. There are very few people on this planet that think murder
&gt;&gt; should be legal, but you condone it. There should be laws against
murder.
&gt;&gt; Murderers should be executed.

&gt; Abortion is not murder. To say otherwise is extremist.
&gt; You complain about Democrats being extremist when you
&gt; are there espousing extreme right wing issues. You can't
&gt; have it both ways.

"/> Abortion is not murder only when it is spontaneous such as with a

anti-abortion/anti-murder is extremist, and thinking that abortion is

&gt; on either party should say, and it is what most do say, except for

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something wonderfully witty:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Liberals further prostitute capitalism by claiming 1. Only Us
Liberals
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;know how to spend your money. 2. Only us Liberals know who should
&gt;&gt; have,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and how much you should have. You see, Liberals have become
&gt;&gt; Socialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually true liberals are still liberals and not actually out for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others monies. What has happened is that the Socialists have
wrapped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves in liberal clothing as a disguise to sneak into the
flock.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have to remember that a true liberal is one favoring proposals
for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas
and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior of others; broad-minded. The folks that call themselves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liberals nowadays fit none of these characteristics. They want the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; welfare status quo, or even more of it if they can get it. They are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very intolerant of other views, and are narrow minded to the
extreme.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many also no longer believe in the law of the land.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's excellently said.

&gt;&gt; While that's true, the one phrase in there that sums it all up is
&quot;tolerant
&gt;&gt; of the ideas and behavior of others.&quot; That tolerance has made them the
&gt;&gt; party for everyone who has an extreme agenda, and over the years, they
have
&gt;&gt; let themselves be overtaken by those extremists to the point that there
is
&gt;&gt; nothing recognizable as a true Democratic platform anymore.

&gt; What conservative ideals are recognizable in the Republican party now?

"/> I have no idea, and I don't really give a shit. I am not a Republican, and
I have MANY problems with Republicans, if you have been reading my posts you
would know that. Republicans are just slightly right of center, and center
is a place for pansies.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I thought conservatives supported smaller government, minimal government
&gt; spending, and government that does not intrude into private lives. So,
&gt; how is the Republican party pursuing this ideals now? Seems to me, they
&gt; are moving in the opposite direction in every area and are now responding
&gt; to corporate greed and the whims of radical Christians.

"/> Yep, and they are responding to pressure from unions and minority groups as
well. It sounds just like the Democratic party doesn't it?

Where I live, it doesn't really matter who I vote for. The state is always
going to go Republican. I vote anyway, and I vote for the person I believe
is best. If you must know, I voted for Clinton his first term. Then he
decided to be an idiot right out of the gate, and I did not vote for him the
second. He didn't even give me 6 months before he made me ashamed to say I
voted for him.

Clinton was a farily conservative Democrat, although the things he did do
that were liberal were really stupid. It was Clinton that got the hatred up
so high between Democrats and Republicans. I don't know if it will subside
to any degree in the near future. This country is polarized more than it
ever has been, and it's because of radical leftist leadership decisions and
the major amounts of rhetoric from the Republicans when it happened. Now
the rhetoric is on the other side, but Bush really hasn't done anything
extremist at all. There are rumors of impropriety that are cooked up by
Democrats trying to find some dirt that isn't there, but there is no proof
of impropriety at all, otherwise there would be special prosecutors, major
amounts of press, and everything else.

Truthfully, I don't think Kerry has the guts to stand up for what he
believes in. He changes his mind so quickly that nobody can say with any
certainty what he will stand for in 2 weeks, much less in 4 years. The only
thing that Kerry has ever done that was worth a damn was get that silver
star, and after he wiped his ass on it, that's worthless too.

and over and over again they do not want the government

82% of Americans think the decision for abortion should be
left between women and their doctors, or at least available in
cases of rape, incest and when the life or health of the mother
is at risk. while only 15-20% want it to be illegal in all cases,
as the Republican Party's 2004 platform calls for.

So yet again the extremist agenda of those who now control
the Republican Party is exposed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Or you could do like the U.K. and have BOTH kinds of taxes, and a
&gt;&gt;&gt; shit health care system to show for it!

&gt;&gt; Shit health system? I have a close relative who grew up for about 20
&gt;&gt; years in the United States. He holds duel UK and USA citizenship if I am
&gt;&gt; not mistaken and he's traveled extensively. This relative tells me he
&gt;&gt; wouldn't want to have his family (two kids and a wife) live anywhere
&gt;&gt; else than in England, in large part due to the health care system there.

&gt; Yeah, their health care system is great. It includes dental, and we all
&gt; know how good British teeth are.

"/> Yawn!

&gt; opposition to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it. I do not like writing that check to the IRS every month. To you,
&gt; it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just numbers on a check stub, but to me it is actual cash that was
&gt; once in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;my bank account, but is now being sent off to the government in order
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;support programs that are meant more to keep elected officials in
&gt; office
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than they are to actually help anyone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just keep on with your bullshit rhetoric, and I'll stick with the
&gt; facts.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's been clear to anyone that your idea of a utopian society means
&gt; that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rich pay for the poor to live, and the poor then have no incentive to
&gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off their dead asses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These democrats and I'll raise your taxes Kerry sicken me. Even after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bushs tax cut I think we are still working for 5+ months to pay off
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government. It was almost 6 months.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax Freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt; Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax Freedom Day is, what,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Halloween?

&gt;&gt; Bush had to borrow money to support that tax cut. So the money you and
&gt;&gt; I got isn't really a tax cut, it is borrowed money that will need to be
&gt;&gt; repaid at some point.

&gt; Yes, and just as happened with Regan and Kennedy, if left alone the GDP will
&gt; skyrocket and the tax revenue will increase along with it. Look throughout
&gt; history, the largest tax decreases have been closely followed by the largest
&gt; increases in tax revenue.

"/> Yeh, and the largest deficits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm working fifty hours a week so that the guy in South
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Phoenix can drink beer and fish all day. Redistribution of wealth is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what Democrats are all about. People who work hard are penalized for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their efforts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the toilet to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And Bill Clinton, in a few short years, almost totally disarmed
&gt;&gt;&gt; this country.

&gt;&gt; Strange how most of the base closings under the Clinton administration
&gt;&gt; were in the chopping block due to the Base Closure Comittee which
&gt;&gt; Dick Cheney chaired. If our military is so week, how did we end up
&gt;&gt; going to fight in Bosnia and winning? To see that Clinton &quot;almost
&gt;&gt; totally disarmed this country&quot; is an outright lie. Than again, lies
&gt;&gt; are what the Republicans are all about, these days.

&gt; Cheny was given the task of choosing bases to cut because Clinton slashed
&gt; funding for them. You act like it was his idea. As for Bosnia, what kind
&gt; of military force do you think we were up against?

"/> Nonsense. We have the base closure commission actively working to
close bases even now with Republicans in control of all federal
legislative branches and the White House. Just check their web site.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Just like the lie that the economy is doing great! The numbers say
&gt;&gt; otherwise.

&gt; It also depends on how you look at those numbers. If you consider that the
&gt; recession that we just had was one of the smallest in history, and that we
&gt; are now experiencing the fastest rebound from any recession in history, I
&gt; guess that would mean we had a bad economy, but if you do Democrat math, you
&gt; get the results you would expect from the new math crap that Democrats seem
&gt; to be supporting now. No answer is wrong.

"/> Bush is the only president since Hoover to end his presidency with fewer
jobs than when he started. The budget deficit is at an all time high and
the job recovery that Bush has been crowing about is a myth. Some record.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes it is. That's why Mother Nature put it in the uterus in the
&gt; first
&gt;&gt;&gt; place.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If it were a viable life, it would be breathing on it's own.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a) This sounds completely off topic for all the newsgroups it's

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Agreed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b) The whole abortion thing boils down to two concepts..
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b-1) What rights does a person have?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b-2) What is a person? Or, more to the point, when do you admit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that something is both a person and has rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A few laws have been passed recently that attempt to confuse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the answer to these questions. Most of these laws have either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been thrown out or are under challenge in our courts. But that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some people believe government should be getting involved in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this question in the first place is my point. Hypocrites such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Timm whine and moan about how bad government is, then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suddenly do a complete 180 when it comes to issues such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abortion or that otherwise serve their own fascist, extreme
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agenda.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Government is involved already by passing the bill of rights, and the
&gt; 14th
&gt;&gt;&gt; amendment. There are very few people on this planet that think murder
&gt;&gt;&gt; should be legal, but you condone it. There should be laws against
&gt; murder.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Murderers should be executed.

&gt;&gt; Abortion is not murder. To say otherwise is extremist.
&gt;&gt; You complain about Democrats being extremist when you
&gt;&gt; are there espousing extreme right wing issues. You can't
&gt;&gt; have it both ways.

&gt; Abortion is not murder only when it is spontaneous such as with a
&gt; miscarriage. Even Kerry believes that it's a life, so if that is true,
&gt; extinguishing that life is murder. There's no question of it. If being
&gt; anti-abortion/anti-murder is extremist, and thinking that abortion is
&gt; extremist, than at least I'm just as extreme as the majority of the country
&gt; where more than 60% believe that abortion is wrong.

"/> Kerry is smart enough to realize that not every shares his beliefs and
that in this country, people are free to have their own beliefs regarding
moral issues. If abortion is murder, why is the government not
prosecuting anyone for it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; a partial birth abortion. HUH?

&gt;&gt; Kerry's stance is fine. He simply said what his personal views are.
&gt;&gt; Kerry has the sense to admit that not all Americans share his view
&gt;&gt; on abortion and it is not for government to force people to share
&gt;&gt; his religious-based views. That's what any sensible politician
&gt;&gt; on either party should say, and it is what most do say, except for
&gt;&gt; extremists like Rick Santorum and our president.

&gt; The belief that life begins at conception is not a religious-based view
&gt; idiot. You don't have to have a religion in order to believe that. I don't
&gt; believe in God at all, and I believe that. Does that make it a religious

&gt; Wrong. Bill Gates did come from a wealthy family. Further, the history
&gt; of Microsoft and its monopolistic tactics is well known.

"/> The Gates Family did have enough money to live well, but were far from
what we normally call BIG Money.

Bill Gates did exactly what every other computer geek did in those days,
only he did it better. Hired very smart folkes to run the business end

&gt;&gt;&gt;government. It was almost 6 months.

&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax Freedom
&gt;&gt;Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax Freedom Day is, what,
&gt;&gt;Halloween?

&gt; Bush had to borrow money to support that tax cut. So the money you and

"/> That is total BS. IF you seem to need more money but do not wish to do

Quit spending what you don't have. But then, Democrats would loose much

Welfare = Up to what, about 4 or 5 generations of welfare families who
never work, never want to work, don't care about school for themselves

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes it is. That's why Mother Nature put it in the uterus in the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;place.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If it were a viable life, it would be breathing on it's own.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a) This sounds completely off topic for all the newsgroups it's cross-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;posted to. Smells like troll remains.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Agreed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;b) The whole abortion thing boils down to two concepts..
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;b-1) What rights does a person have?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;b-2) What is a person? Or, more to the point, when do you admit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that something is both a person and has rights.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A few laws have been passed recently that attempt to confuse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the answer to these questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you truly want to be confused, consider Kerry's stance. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;says life begins at conception but it's okay with him if you want to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a partial birth abortion. HUH?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Kerry's stance is fine. He simply said what his personal views are.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Kerry has the sense to admit that not all Americans share his view
&gt;&gt;&gt;on abortion and it is not for government to force people to share
&gt;&gt;&gt;his religious-based views. That's what any sensible politician
&gt;&gt;&gt;on either party should say, and it is what most do say, except for
&gt;&gt;&gt;extremists like Rick Santorum and our president.

&gt;&gt;The belief that life begins at conception is not a religious-based view
&gt;&gt;idiot. You don't have to have a religion in order to believe that. I don't
&gt;&gt;believe in God at all, and I believe that. Does that make it a religious
&gt;&gt;based view?

&gt; Strange how 99% of those who believe that life begins at conception are
&gt; religious. After all, that's a Biblical perspective. Just look at the
&gt; so called &quot;moral majority&quot; and who they are.

"/> What a statement. It is right up there with stating that 99% of

&gt; I don't see Republicans doing any real tax reform. They just sent out

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ignorance is the word. People forget that for 150 years in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this country, an average American with an average job could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;afford to buy the average house. Now it's to the point where,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in my city, 90% of the people are forced to rent because they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can't afford to buy anything at all, even a condo. Home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ownership has become a distant dream for 90% of us.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Out of curiosity what do you consider to be an average job?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I realize that there are several US cities, mostly on the west coast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;where the average price of a home exceeds the abilities of even those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with above average jobs, but that is not the way it is across the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A person with a $30,000 a year job saving 10% of their salary towards
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the down payment on a home needs to save for about seven years in

&gt; most

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;parts of the country. Since nowadays both partners in a marriage

&gt; work

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that will drop it down to around 3. years. It is doable, just not

&gt; all

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that easy. It never really was back in the good old days either. At
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;least mortgage interest rates are fairly low compare to the 13% I was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;paying back in the early eighties.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you need to figure out some new pretend numbers. Nobody pays

&gt; that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much of a down payment on a first house when they are only making

&gt; $30,000 a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;year. Not unless rich uncle Dryfus died and left it to them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you use an average of a $100,000 dollar home with a 20% down
&gt;&gt;&gt;payment they certainly do. Almost any bank will grant a loan with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;20% down payment.

&gt;&gt;Average $100K home? Where?

&gt; Actually, it depends on what part of the country you are looking at. States
&gt; such as Kansas and Missouri have very low costs for property. Granted this
&gt; was about 10 years ago, but I was looking at property in Missouri, and I
&gt; found 5 bedroom homes with 5 acres of land or their price equivilant for
&gt; around $50,000. That wasn't usually out in the boonies either, but on the
&gt; very edge of town. I'm not sure that you can get a new home built for that
&gt; anywhere anymore, but you can definitely find parts of the country where the
&gt; average used home goes for $100,000.

"/> I was informed very recently that you could buy a new 3 bedroom home in
the San Antonio, Tx area for near 80,000.00. I did not look into it as
I did not want to live there for any reason.

&gt;&gt; Wrong. Bill Gates did come from a wealthy family. Further, the history

&gt; The Gates Family did have enough money to live well, but were far from

Gates realised that the increase in PC horsepower would eventually
deliver a usable result and that that is what the users wanted.

murder
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should be legal, but you condone it. There should be laws against

&gt;&gt;&gt; are there espousing extreme right wing issues. You can't
&gt;&gt;&gt; have it both ways.

&gt;&gt; Abortion is not murder only when it is spontaneous such as with a
&gt;&gt; miscarriage. Even Kerry believes that it's a life, so if that is true,
&gt;&gt; extinguishing that life is murder. There's no question of it. If being
&gt;&gt; anti-abortion/anti-murder is extremist, and thinking that abortion is
&gt;&gt; extremist, than at least I'm just as extreme as the majority of the
country
&gt;&gt; where more than 60% believe that abortion is wrong.

&gt; Kerry is smart enough to realize that not every shares his beliefs and
&gt; that in this country, people are free to have their own beliefs regarding
&gt; moral issues. If abortion is murder, why is the government not
&gt; prosecuting anyone for it?

"/> Exactly my question. The only answer I have is that people generally don't
give it enough thought to come to a conclusion about whether or not it's
murder. It's easy to think of a child as a non-person. I remember when my
first child was born. I thought about having a child often during my wife's
pregnancy, and I thought I knew what it would be like to hold that child. I
was excited about it, and I thought of it as a great thing, but no amount of
thought prepared me for the difference in emotion I felt when I actually
held that child in my arms for the first time. I got literally weak in the
knees, and I suddenly felt a love for this person that I have felt for no
other previously. It's as though nothing I had thought for the previous
nine months meant a thing.

The point of that is to illustrate that until you hold that baby in your
arms, it is almost impossible to understand what that baby really is. It's
an abstract lump in a woman's abdomen. It's not a tangible human being.
People have to think about things. Either a baby is a human being at
conception, or it is not. If it is, then it is murder. The criminal courts
have it right by making it a crime of murder to kill a woman's unborn child
without her consent. They just need to go the rest of the way and consider
it a crime to murder that child with her consent.

Don't even throw numbers at anything. You have proven that you believe that
any math answer is right, as long as you tried.

You couldn't have pulled a more false answer out of your ass.

&gt; What's extremist is intentionally making no distinction between
&gt; whether abortion is wrong, and whether our government has
&gt; any business involving itself in the issue -- especially when a
&gt; vast majority of the American people have clearly stated over
&gt; and over and over again they do not want the government
&gt; involved in the issue.

&gt; 82% of Americans think the decision for abortion should be
&gt; left between women and their doctors, or at least available in
&gt; cases of rape, incest and when the life or health of the mother
&gt; is at risk. while only 15-20% want it to be illegal in all cases,
&gt; as the Republican Party's 2004 platform calls for.

&gt; So yet again the extremist agenda of those who now control
&gt; the Republican Party is exposed.

"/> Capitalizing God is how it's supposed to be done. When used to refer to a
person, it is a proper noun. I guess that doesn't matter since you learned
your writing skills the same place you learned your math skills. If I said
I don't believe in a god, that would be proper, but where I said that I
don't believe in God, that is referring to an individual, so it is necessary
to capitalize it.

Let's get this straight now, 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 2 = 4, you capitalize proper
nouns and the beginning of sentences. Should we now spend tax dollars to
reeducate those idiots that clearly went through a liberal school system
now?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ignorance is the word. People forget that for 150 years in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this country, an average American with an average job could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;afford to buy the average house. Now it's to the point where,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in my city, 90% of the people are forced to rent because they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can't afford to buy anything at all, even a condo. Home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ownership has become a distant dream for 90% of us.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Out of curiosity what do you consider to be an average job?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I realize that there are several US cities, mostly on the west coast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;where the average price of a home exceeds the abilities of even those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with above average jobs, but that is not the way it is across the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A person with a $30,000 a year job saving 10% of their salary towards
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the down payment on a home needs to save for about seven years in

&gt;&gt; most

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;parts of the country. Since nowadays both partners in a marriage

&gt;&gt; work

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that will drop it down to around 3. years. It is doable, just not

&gt;&gt; all

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that easy. It never really was back in the good old days either. At
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;least mortgage interest rates are fairly low compare to the 13% I was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;paying back in the early eighties.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you need to figure out some new pretend numbers. Nobody pays

&gt;&gt; that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much of a down payment on a first house when they are only making

&gt;&gt; $30,000 a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;year. Not unless rich uncle Dryfus died and left it to them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you use an average of a $100,000 dollar home with a 20% down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;payment they certainly do. Almost any bank will grant a loan with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;20% down payment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Average $100K home? Where?

&gt;&gt; Actually, it depends on what part of the country you are looking at.
States
&gt;&gt; such as Kansas and Missouri have very low costs for property. Granted
this
&gt;&gt; was about 10 years ago, but I was looking at property in Missouri, and I
&gt;&gt; found 5 bedroom homes with 5 acres of land or their price equivilant for
&gt;&gt; around $50,000. That wasn't usually out in the boonies either, but on
the
&gt;&gt; very edge of town. I'm not sure that you can get a new home built for
that
&gt;&gt; anywhere anymore, but you can definitely find parts of the country where
the
&gt;&gt; average used home goes for $100,000.

&gt; I was informed very recently that you could buy a new 3 bedroom home in
&gt; the San Antonio, Tx area for near 80,000.00. I did not look into it as
&gt; I did not want to live there for any reason.

"/> I don't know. I have an old friend that just built a home on the north side
of San Antonio about 3 years ago for $86,000. It is a 3 bedroom, and it has
the largest family room I've ever seen, but I am not sure how much the
housing market has gone up there.

acreage

homes
&gt;&gt; can't be terribly high priced there if the land is so cheap.

&gt;&gt; Philadelphia is hardly the place to be looking for cheap housing.

&gt; Perhaps, but Philadelphia is an area where a large number of people
&gt; actually life. I have never been to Kansas or Missouri, least of all

&gt;&gt; Sorry, sitting with your thumb up your ass while 30% of the

"/> Yep, and that shows it. I paid about $400/acre for what I got.

Lot prices and acreage prices are very different. You can buy acreage for a
small fraction of the cost per acre than you can buy lots. If I were to
subdivide my acreage and make sure that power, telephone and water were
available, I could probably sell each lot for around $20,000/quarter acre
lot.

Specifc example -- One half acre with horse privileges,
fifty-year-old house, two bedroom, one bath, zoned for three homes --
$70K. Across the street from me...definitely NOT in a lousy
neighborhood. North Central Phoenix. Next door to me is a half-million
dollar home on an acre.

LOADS of condos and townhouses here for under $100K, small ones
for under $50K. A condo or townhome can be a great starter home and you
don't have to do yardwork.

Check out the classifieds in the local papers. Oh, yeah --
unemployment here is among the LOWEST in the nation. And that's with a
glut of mojados to do the low-end grunt work.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Talk to us about redistribution of wealth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That produced quite a bit of employment, fool.

&gt;&gt;&gt;How many people does it take to make a $500.00 hammer?

&gt;&gt; You idiot. My father worked for a defense contractor; as did
&gt;&gt;millions of peoples' parents. And not all of them overpriced their
&gt;&gt;products. Have you ever heard of something called COMPETITIVE BIDDING,

&gt;&gt; Pity the poor soldier who knows that his rifle was made by the low

&gt;&gt;&gt;You Libs think anyone can turn your mess around in just 3 - 4 years? In
&gt;&gt;&gt;fact, Bush has done that, but before he can really get to the tax
&gt;&gt;&gt;reform, he has to prosecute a war on terror and make sure his work in
&gt;&gt;&gt;turning the economy around is going to stick, then look out.

&gt;&gt;Sorry, sitting with your thumb up your ass while 30% of the
&gt;&gt;manufacturing jobs are outsourced in states like Ohio and
&gt;&gt;Pennsylvania does not qualify as &quot;turning the economy around&quot;.
&gt;&gt;You'll get definitive proof of my claim in about three months.

&gt; It would seem that you have a conflict of interest that you don't even know
&gt; about. By our corporations outsourcing jobs, whe have had a far greater
&gt; effect on stamping out poverty in third world country than any aid package
&gt; ever did. Dollar for dollar spent, outsourcing has had far greater effect
&gt; than any liberal program of stealing from the US and giving the money freely
&gt; to other countries. Outsourcing is the reason we have the majority of
&gt; countries with clean drinking water, where 50 years ago, only 15% did. It's
&gt; the reason why those people that work in Nike factories work there, because
&gt; they make 3 times what they would doing anything else.

&gt; By exporting our jobs, we benefit others and ourselves. We get cheaper
&gt; goods, and they get out of poverty. Win win as far as I can see.

"/> But wait Timm, those pesky Liberals didn't get to tax those folks and
that just kills em. Someone is finally making a living, and the
Democrats can't get their hands on the money. It is driving them nutz,
all that money and they can't get it.

BTW, No liberal will ever grasp what you have pointed out regarding
actual good for money spent. It's too complex and liberal math is just
not geared to that sort of computing.

Liberals can also blame Unions for loss of jobs in the US.

"/>  Don't forget that your hero's main squeeze has, what FIFTY-SEVEN

leaving is the fact that a other countries do not have to deal with

you REALLY want to work on an assembly line, and do you want your kids

&gt; and poorer classes -- between 60%-70% of them (depending
&gt; which numbers one chooses to believe) would register as
&gt; Democrats and vote Democratic in elections. As I noted,
&gt; there are a few areas of the country where Republicans
&gt; would continue to win elections, even if all qualified voters
&gt; actually voted. But not many.

&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt; that's they case, then why is it that Democrats have such a difficult
time
&gt;&gt; getting enough votes to win elections, even after they bribe voters?
Could
&gt;&gt; it have something to do with the fact that there are more conservative
&gt;&gt; voters? Maybe it's just because liberals are inherently lazy.

&gt; Conservatives in general are wealthier, and far less
&gt; disenfranchised as a group than America's middle class
&gt; and poor. As far as I know, never in U.S. history has a
&gt; Republican won a presidential or congressional election
&gt; with an absolute majority of those who were qualified to
&gt; vote.

"/> That's pretty amazing since according to the Wall Street Journal, the
percentage of people qualified to vote during the 2000 election was 53.8%,
and that number has been declining since the 1960 election of Kennedy over
Nixon where 65.4% of qualified votors turned out. So, since the percentage
has never been under 50%, and there have been 4 Republicans elected since
then and 3 Democrats, I think your numbers are again using your Democrat
math. Did you think that nobody would be able to disqualify your statement
again, or you figured that you have been so wrong that another lie wouldn't
hurt your credibility any?

&gt;&gt;&gt; to get an official elected.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If apathy is the problem, then there should be a general apathy with all

"/> I was so amazed by your blatant lack of honesty that I forgot to ask you how
you think conservatives are wealthier. Look at the records. Republican
election donations are raised much differently than Democratic funds. The
majority of Republican donations are $30 an $40 donations while Democrat
donations are much higher than that on average. Are we forgetting how much
money Hollywood donates? Are we forgetting about those like Theresa Heinz?
Democrats are just as wealthy, if not more than Republicans, and those poor
people you're talking about shouldn't be disinfranchised since they are the
ones getting the free money and entitlements the Democrats are throwing
around.

unaware of a single case where the same was true for a
Republican candidate.

&gt; Pure evil, the lot of you.

"/> What makes us evil? Just because you got into an area that you are clearly
outclassed in doesn't make us evil, it makes you wholly inadequate to debate
politics.

You too can learn the evils of the Democrat party. The biggest thing you
need to do is to go back to school, not a public school this time. Learn
math again, and that will cure at least half of your liberalism. Once
you've finished with that, take some real American history classes, not the
kind taught in Berkley. That will cure another quarter of your liberalism.
Then, to get about 1% more cured, go to church. I might not believe in God,
but I think that the morals that are taught in churches of almost any
religion are invaluable. Then finally, get a job. You'll notice that
conservatives do not protest much. That's because conservatives pretty much
all have jobs and can't afford to spend their time protesting.

That is the recipe to stamp out extreme liberalism. Granted, there are
those with incurable brain damage that nothing will work for, but for the
majority of people that recipe works.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rich pay for the poor to live, and the poor then have no incentive to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off their dead asses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bushs tax cut I think we are still working for 5+ months to pay off the

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax Freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax Freedom Day is, what,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Halloween?

&gt;&gt; Bush had to borrow money to support that tax cut. So the money you and
&gt;&gt; I got isn't really a tax cut, it is borrowed money that will need to be
&gt;&gt; repaid at some point.

&gt; That is total BS. IF you seem to need more money but do not wish to do
&gt; what it takes to get more money or that seems to be a bad idea, then the
&gt; real solution is to rethink that NEED for more money.

&gt; Quit spending what you don't have. But then, Democrats would loose much
&gt; of their voting base because they would not have all that pork to send
&gt; home to pay for loyalty; votes. I give Democrats credit, they have

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bottom line: Republicans hate democracy.

&gt;&gt; Nonsense. Not all Republicans are like GW Bush.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They hate large turnouts in elections.

&gt;&gt; True, and here in Arizona they regularly introduce bills to make
&gt;&gt; voting less convenient, such as by wiping out registrations every year
&gt;&gt; or, currently, by requiring proof of U.S. citizenship (oddly, nobody
&gt;&gt; who solicited one of those petitions to me was able to prove his or
&gt;&gt; her U.S. citizenship).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare = Up to what, about 4 or 5 generations of welfare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; families who never work, never want to work, don't care about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; school for themselves or anyone else trying to get an education.

&gt;&gt;&gt; More right-wing stereotypical bullshit. Good thing we
&gt;&gt;&gt; reformed welfare, isn't it?

&gt;&gt; Clinton actually reformed welfare in a big way and put a 3-year limit
&gt;&gt; on most benefits, but for some reason the Republicans don't give him
&gt;&gt; credit for this.

&gt; How about looking at that again. Bill Clinton vetoed the same welfare
&gt; reform bill twice before he finally signed it. It was put in front of him
&gt; by a Republican controlled House and Senate three times. He wouldn't sign
&gt; it until he got some concession that I can't remember right now, but the
&gt; fact is, he didn't want it. He fought against it, and he only signed it for
&gt; a quid pro quo. That's why he gets no credit for it.

"/> True, and once the Republicans get the legislation right, Clinton signed
it. If the Republicans were so strongly in support of their legislation,
they would have done a better job of garnering enough votes to override
Clinton's vetoes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm working fifty hours a week so that the guy in South

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what Democrats are all about. People who work hard are penalized for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their efforts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the toilet to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And Bill Clinton, in a few short years, almost totally disarmed
&gt;&gt;&gt;this country.

&gt;&gt; Strange how most of the base closings under the Clinton administration
&gt;&gt; were in the chopping block due to the Base Closure Comittee which
&gt;&gt; Dick Cheney chaired. If our military is so week, how did we end up
&gt;&gt; going to fight in Bosnia and winning? To see that Clinton &quot;almost
&gt;&gt; totally disarmed this country&quot; is an outright lie. Than again, lies
&gt;&gt; are what the Republicans are all about, these days.

&gt; Was a great plan to evaluate and determin what bases could be closed and
&gt; still do our job. But Clinton took that to a new level. He closed them
&gt; and instead of using all that surplus from defense to support what was
&gt; left, he even took that and sent it home to his friends in pork.

"/> You have no clue. Really. The president (any one of them) cannot send
money home. Spending is done by the House of Representatives. The House
is who holds the purse strings. Clinton could no more send federal money
home to his friends than you could.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Money is the root of all evil. And man needs roots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If money is the root of all evil, then what is capitalism?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Before you get carried away with all this IF/THEN stuff, you should be

&gt;&gt;&gt;not say, 'money is the root of all evil'. It declares, 'The LOVE of
&gt;&gt;&gt;money is the root of all evil'. And Liberals do love money, especialy
&gt;&gt;&gt;other peoples money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Liberals further prostitute capitalism by claiming 1. Only Us Liberals
&gt;&gt;&gt;know how to spend your money. 2. Only us Liberals know who should have,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and how much you should have. You see, Liberals have become Socialists.

&gt;&gt; I don't see Republicans doing any real tax reform. They just sent out
&gt;&gt; some tax rebate checks and are now spending money that we will
&gt;&gt; eventually have to pay back, plus interest.

&gt; You Libs think anyone can turn your mess around in just 3 - 4 years? In

&gt; you REALLY want to work on an assembly line, and do you want your kids

&gt; Cripes, the last time my union bought us all hats made in the U.S., they
&gt; were genuine CRAP anyway, noticeably lacking in pride of workmanship.
&gt; Decent embroidered hats would have cost a fortune made here.

"/> What main squeeze? If you are referring to the Teresa Heinz Kerry and
her involvement with Heinz company, then you should get your facts
straight. Teresa Heinz has no more control over that company's decisions
than you do. She is only a minority stockholder with something like 1%
of the company's stock. Heinz is also long known to be a conservative
company. Teresa Heinz Kerry's first husband was John Heinz who was a
Republican Senator from Pennsylvania. John Heinz served in the Senate
until his death in a plane crash. It is strange how I never heard a word
from Republicans complaining about Senator Heinz's wealth when he was in
office. I know this because I researched it, I also was one of Senator
Heinz's constituents, and I own a few shares of Heinz stock.

&gt; It would seem that you have a conflict of interest that you don't even know

&gt; effect on stamping out poverty in third world country than any aid package
&gt; ever did. Dollar for dollar spent, outsourcing has had far greater effect
&gt; than any liberal program of stealing from the US and giving the money freely
&gt; to other countries. Outsourcing is the reason we have the majority of
&gt; countries with clean drinking water, where 50 years ago, only 15% did. It's
&gt; the reason why those people that work in Nike factories work there, because
&gt; they make 3 times what they would doing anything else.

&gt; By exporting our jobs, we benefit others and ourselves. We get cheaper
&gt; goods, and they get out of poverty. Win win as far as I can see.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps, but Philadelphia is an area where a large number of people
&gt;&gt; actually life. I have never been to Kansas or Missouri, least of all

&gt;&gt; is because those areas are mostly agricultural or declining in economic
&gt;&gt; opportunity with few jobs.

&gt; What about Utah? I know of many places in Utah where you can purchase
&gt; property in areas where the economic growth is pretty good. There are
&gt; plenty of jobs, and the people are actually friendly. A place where people
&gt; still don't lock their front door. The prices are close to $100,000.

"/> Arizona seems like a better deal for a variety of reasons. I do some
consulting in Utah ocassionally. One of the people who I worked with on
my last visit to Provo told me he had to move out of Utah because the
Mormon families on both sides of his house would not allow their
children to play with his kids because they are not Mormon's. He told me
that he found the people very friendly if you're just visiting, but very

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;: God labor's there so America's working class men and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;: women still have some semblance of a voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That must be why membership in your &quot;honest broker&quot; unions is at an all-time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;low. Fucking union leadership is the most corrupt group in the country,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;even more so than the Democreeps, no wonder they're in bed with each other.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Which at one time put them in bed with the Mafia. Seems latly that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Mafia finds the Unions so bad that they now shun them as bad company and
&gt;&gt;&gt;an embarasment. Unions were once needed but are now just a bad plague
&gt;&gt;&gt;that we can't find a cure for. And BTW, the only elections I have ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;seen bought were done so by some fatcat Liberal Democrat.

&gt;&gt; Question: What percentage of non-governmental workers are unionized?

&gt; I have no clue as to percentages, but my guess would be, WAY too many.

"/> Yes, your guess would be right. ;-)

I had to look up the specifics, but according to the census[*] from 1983
to 1999, union membership in the private sector dropped from 16.5% to
9.4%, while the public sector unions grew slightly (percentage wise) from
36.7% to 37.3%. The raw numbers of private sector members fell 21% (12M
to 9.4M) while public sector union membership grew 23% (5.7M to 7M).

consider

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as you're willing to live somewhere other than New

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;California, you can find them. Single family, unattached homes...as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;long as you don't require NEW.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Really? Do you have some specific examples, or are you talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off the top of your head? In Philadelphia, where my parents live,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the only homes under $100 these days are in lousy neighborhoods with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;high likelihood of declining in value over the next 10-20 years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Look in just about any non-urban part of Kansas or Missouri. I would

&gt;&gt;bet

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that Nebraska and Wyoming are even cheaper. How about Oklahoma. I

&gt;&gt;bought

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;some pretty cheap property there a couple years ago. 100 acres of land

&gt;&gt;with

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a river and trees for about $40,000. Not many places you can find

&gt;&gt;acreage

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like that anymore for that price. Granted that wasn't a home, but the

&gt;&gt;homes

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can't be terribly high priced there if the land is so cheap.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Philadelphia is hardly the place to be looking for cheap housing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps, but Philadelphia is an area where a large number of people
&gt;&gt;&gt;actually life. I have never been to Kansas or Missouri, least of all
&gt;&gt;&gt;rural areas there, but I suspect the reason the housing is lower there
&gt;&gt;&gt;is because those areas are mostly agricultural or declining in economic
&gt;&gt;&gt;opportunity with few jobs.

&gt;&gt;What about Utah? I know of many places in Utah where you can purchase
&gt;&gt;property in areas where the economic growth is pretty good. There are
&gt;&gt;plenty of jobs, and the people are actually friendly. A place where people
&gt;&gt;still don't lock their front door. The prices are close to $100,000.

&gt; Arizona seems like a better deal for a variety of reasons. I do some
&gt; consulting in Utah ocassionally. One of the people who I worked with on
&gt; my last visit to Provo told me he had to move out of Utah because the
&gt; Mormon families on both sides of his house would not allow their
&gt; children to play with his kids because they are not Mormon's. He told me
&gt; that he found the people very friendly if you're just visiting, but very
&gt; nasty if they are your neighbors. I too found the people in Utah
&gt; friendly, but I never lived there.

"/>  I understand that the larger the town, the less likely that
everyone is Mormon. The percentage of Mormons in Salt Lake City is much
lower than in smaller (inbred?) towns. My sister lived in a small town
and as soon as her teaching contract was over, she moved to the Navajo
reservation here -- said life was MUCH better there for a single,
non-Mormon female.

&gt; Hopefully you're an atheist like our Timmy friend, and hopefully
&gt; your gamble turns out to be correct.

No, I'm a Roman Catholic, I give to charities freely. I resent mymoney
being taken ostensibly for &quot;entitlements&quot; when the only one &quot;entitled&quot; to it
is the earner or giftee. This way I have control over where I want my money
to go. Your type wants to deem what's worthy and I say, you give to where
you see fit and likewise for me. you just get upset when I call it
&quot;charity&quot;- which it is and which is totally the teachings of the Bible.
Jesus did not like the tax collectors of the day. He said render to Caesar
that which is his. He gave us free will to do as we please, not to take as
we please to redistribute other's wealth- not Pharohs, not the rich, not the
Caesars. He put our brother on our moral conscience. You are supposed to
give YOUR stuff,not someone elses. It's easy to be a big spender with
someone elses money. Ultimately we answer to God if we don't, not to the
government.
If it were easy anyone could do it- not everyone is getting to Heaven,
take consolation in that, but that's God call not yours (despite your ego
telling you otherwise).

There were many under Reagan and Bush too, mostly though it comes down to
the individual making the right choices. Your Constitution does not
guarantee you a living. Hunger is a powerful motivator, but American's are
hardly going hungry. Even your poor are rich by the rest of the worlds
standards. I have 1 phone, I pay Euro200 for internet bi monthly because I
can afford it, I don't have potable water to my house. I pay electricity

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bottom line: Republicans hate democracy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nonsense. Not all Republicans are like GW Bush.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just most. Massive voter apathy and disenfranchisement of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the electorate are what allow Republicans to win elections.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at the numbers. If everyone who could vote did vote,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Republicans would be relegated to a tiny minority of elected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officials, and limited to states such as Utah and a few
others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's so much votor apathy that Democrats have to get
out
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wheelbarrows to take the drunks in to vote. It's reminiscent of
how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was done back in the early days of this country. Ever seen
Gangs of
&gt;&gt; New
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; York? I wonder how many different times each Democrat has to
vote
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; order
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to get an official elected.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If apathy is the problem, then there should be a general apathy
with
&gt;&gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people. That means an equal percentage of Republican votors
would
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; apathetic and need to have the crow bar rammed up their ass to
vote
&gt;&gt; too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not a 1:1 ratio. A substantial majority of qualified but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unregistered voters in the U.S. fall in the lower middle class
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and poorer classes -- between 60%-70% of them (depending
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which numbers one chooses to believe) would register as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Democrats and vote Democratic in elections. As I noted,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are a few areas of the country where Republicans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would continue to win elections, even if all qualified voters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually voted. But not many.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that's they case, then why is it that Democrats have such a
&gt;&gt; difficult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; getting enough votes to win elections, even after they bribe
voters?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it have something to do with the fact that there are more
&gt;&gt; conservative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voters? Maybe it's just because liberals are inherently lazy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Conservatives in general are wealthier, and far less
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disenfranchised as a group than America's middle class
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and poor. As far as I know, never in U.S. history has a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican won a presidential or congressional election
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with an absolute majority of those who were qualified to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's pretty amazing since according to the Wall Street Journal,
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percentage of people qualified to vote during the 2000 election was
&gt;&gt; 53.8%,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and that number has been declining since the 1960 election of
Kennedy
&gt;&gt; over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nixon where 65.4% of qualified votors turned out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Apples and oranges. Your numbers are the percentages of
&gt;&gt;&gt; *registered* voters who turned out to vote -- NOT the
&gt;&gt;&gt; number of *qualified* but *unregistered* voters.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt; In that case you're using Democrat math still since there has never been
&gt;&gt; more than 50% of those qualified either registered or unregistered.

&gt; Where on earth did you go to school?? On average
&gt; throughout the last 160 years in the U.S., 75% of those who
&gt; were eligible to vote were registered to vote. And in dozens
&gt; of cases, Democratic candidates have been elected with an
&gt; absolute majority of those who were qualified to vote. I am
&gt; unaware of a single case where the same was true for a
&gt; Republican candidate.

"/> You are screwing up your own numbers. Even if what you say is true, 65.4%
of 75% is not even half, and the Kennedy election had the highest turnout of
any election ever. So, even though you're wrong again, your numbers don't
add up. Don't try to fix it, it's irreparably borked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bottom line: Republicans hate democracy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nonsense. Not all Republicans are like GW Bush.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They hate large turnouts in elections.

&gt;&gt;&gt; True, and here in Arizona they regularly introduce bills to make
&gt;&gt;&gt; voting less convenient, such as by wiping out registrations every year
&gt;&gt;&gt; or, currently, by requiring proof of U.S. citizenship (oddly, nobody
&gt;&gt;&gt; who solicited one of those petitions to me was able to prove his or
&gt;&gt;&gt; her U.S. citizenship).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare = Up to what, about 4 or 5 generations of welfare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; families who never work, never want to work, don't care about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; school for themselves or anyone else trying to get an education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More right-wing stereotypical bullshit. Good thing we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reformed welfare, isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Clinton actually reformed welfare in a big way and put a 3-year limit
&gt;&gt;&gt; on most benefits, but for some reason the Republicans don't give him
&gt;&gt;&gt; credit for this.

&gt;&gt; How about looking at that again. Bill Clinton vetoed the same welfare
&gt;&gt; reform bill twice before he finally signed it. It was put in front of
him
&gt;&gt; by a Republican controlled House and Senate three times. He wouldn't
sign
&gt;&gt; it until he got some concession that I can't remember right now, but the
&gt;&gt; fact is, he didn't want it. He fought against it, and he only signed it
for
&gt;&gt; a quid pro quo. That's why he gets no credit for it.

&gt; True, and once the Republicans get the legislation right, Clinton signed
&gt; it. If the Republicans were so strongly in support of their legislation,
&gt; they would have done a better job of garnering enough votes to override
&gt; Clinton's vetoes.

"/> They didn't change a thing about it when he signed it.

&gt;&gt; . I give Democrats credit, they have
&gt;&gt;&gt; learned how to attract votes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I love these:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Motor Voter = every illegal alien can now vote. Guess who they be
most
&gt;&gt;&gt; likley to vote for. Yep, the Libs who make it possible to be here
in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare = Up to what, about 4 or 5 generations of welfare families
who
&gt;&gt;&gt; never work, never want to work, don't care about school for
themselves
&gt;&gt;&gt; or anyone else trying to get an education.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unions = Driven more companies into bankrupsy than I care to count.
You
&gt;&gt;&gt; do have to give the unions credit. They pay their way and in fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; donate heavily to the Democrats. Unfortunatly they use the workers
hard
&gt;&gt;&gt; earned money to do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ed
&gt;&gt;&gt; USA Ret

&gt;&gt; Don't forget trial attorneys (no caps on lawsuits), convicted felons
(soft
&gt;&gt; on crime), and non-english speaking immigrants (cart them all down to
the
&gt;&gt; voting booths, tell them where to mark and give them a few dollars).

&gt; Again, wrong. Some of the most ardent supporters of the death penalty
&gt; are Democrats, and that includes President Clinton who signed a federal
&gt; death penalty policy into law and than used it when Tim McVeigh was
&gt; convicted of bombing the federal building in Oklahoma City.

&gt; As for immigrants, it is Bush who is pushing to make it legal for
&gt; illegal immigrants to work in the United States and drain government
&gt; resources.

"/> That is correct. Bush has done it, but so did Clinton. This is an issue
that the Republicans are just as guilty of doing as Democrats. Although
Bush has done it once, and Clinton did it multiple times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Freedom Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Freedom Day is, what, Halloween?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The real tax rate is what the government spends, not just what it
&gt;&gt;&gt; taxes, so don't ignore the $450 billion deficit because you're paying
&gt;&gt;&gt; for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And he [Kerry] VOTED AGAINST ARMING THEM AND GIVING THEM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PROTECTIVE WEAR. What a prick.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He wanted to vote for the military equipment but vote separately on
&gt;&gt;&gt; $19 billion for companies like Halliburton.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If he had his way, our military would be armed with stone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knives wearing bearskins

&gt;&gt;&gt; If Kerry had his way, our military wouldn't be fighting in Iraq or be
&gt;&gt;&gt; spread so dangerously thin around the world. By going to war with
&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq, GW Bush gave exactly what Osama Bin Laden wanted -- a big war in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the heart of Islam.

&gt;&gt; Kerry did have his way idiot. Kerry VOTED FOR WAR.

&gt; Wrong. Read the resolution that Kerry voted for. Section two of the
&gt; resolution clearly sets conditions on going to war in Iraq. Bush failed
&gt; to meet those conditions.

"/> The fact is, we would have gone to war with Iraq, even Kerry says we should
be in Iraq. He's not going to just get up and out when he gets in office,
he's magically going to get more support than we already have, and he's
going to get the UN to come into Iraq again. How he's going to do that I
don't know unless he has some sort of cloning machine and can get them to be
in there twice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm working fifty hours a week so that the guy in South
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Phoenix can drink beer and fish all day. Redistribution of wealth
is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what Democrats are all about. People who work hard are penalized
for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their efforts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the toilet to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And Bill Clinton, in a few short years, almost totally disarmed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this country.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Strange how most of the base closings under the Clinton administration
&gt;&gt;&gt; were in the chopping block due to the Base Closure Comittee which
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dick Cheney chaired. If our military is so week, how did we end up
&gt;&gt;&gt; going to fight in Bosnia and winning? To see that Clinton &quot;almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; totally disarmed this country&quot; is an outright lie. Than again, lies
&gt;&gt;&gt; are what the Republicans are all about, these days.

&gt;&gt; Was a great plan to evaluate and determin what bases could be closed and
&gt;&gt; still do our job. But Clinton took that to a new level. He closed them
&gt;&gt; and instead of using all that surplus from defense to support what was
&gt;&gt; left, he even took that and sent it home to his friends in pork.

&gt; You have no clue. Really. The president (any one of them) cannot send
&gt; money home. Spending is done by the House of Representatives. The House
&gt; is who holds the purse strings. Clinton could no more send federal money
&gt; home to his friends than you could.

"/> He very well could have kept the Senate and House from spending it.

&gt; True. If that has happened, the fault rests with the House of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bottom line: Republicans hate democracy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nonsense. Not all Republicans are like GW Bush.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just most. Massive voter apathy and disenfranchisement of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the electorate are what allow Republicans to win elections.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at the numbers. If everyone who could vote did vote,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Republicans would be relegated to a tiny minority of elected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officials, and limited to states such as Utah and a few others.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's so much votor apathy that Democrats have to get out with
&gt;&gt;&gt; wheelbarrows to take the drunks in to vote. It's reminiscent of how
&gt; voting
&gt;&gt;&gt; was done back in the early days of this country. Ever seen Gangs of New
&gt;&gt;&gt; York? I wonder how many different times each Democrat has to vote in
&gt; order
&gt;&gt;&gt; to get an official elected.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If apathy is the problem, then there should be a general apathy with all
&gt;&gt;&gt; people. That means an equal percentage of Republican votors would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; apathetic and need to have the crow bar rammed up their ass to vote too.

&gt;&gt; It's not a 1:1 ratio. A substantial majority of qualified but
&gt;&gt; unregistered voters in the U.S. fall in the lower middle class
&gt;&gt; and poorer classes -- between 60%-70% of them (depending
&gt;&gt; which numbers one chooses to believe) would register as
&gt;&gt; Democrats and vote Democratic in elections. As I noted,
&gt;&gt; there are a few areas of the country where Republicans
&gt;&gt; would continue to win elections, even if all qualified voters
&gt;&gt; actually voted. But not many.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt; that's they case, then why is it that Democrats have such a difficult
&gt; time
&gt;&gt;&gt; getting enough votes to win elections, even after they bribe voters?
&gt; Could
&gt;&gt;&gt; it have something to do with the fact that there are more conservative
&gt;&gt;&gt; voters? Maybe it's just because liberals are inherently lazy.

&gt;&gt; Conservatives in general are wealthier, and far less
&gt;&gt; disenfranchised as a group than America's middle class
&gt;&gt; and poor. As far as I know, never in U.S. history has a
&gt;&gt; Republican won a presidential or congressional election
&gt;&gt; with an absolute majority of those who were qualified to
&gt;&gt; vote.

&gt; That's pretty amazing since according to the Wall Street Journal, the
&gt; percentage of people qualified to vote during the 2000 election was 53.8%,

"/> This means that 53% of the total population (including children and
non-citizens) was 53.8%, right? Hard to believe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and that number has been declining since the 1960 election of Kennedy over
&gt; Nixon where 65.4% of qualified votors turned out.

"/> So 65.4% of the above 53.8% actually voted, right? I don't think that's
what you mean and that you're getting the numbers confused. There's a
big difference between the number of people qualified to vote and the
number of actual voters.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bottom line: Republicans hate democracy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nonsense. Not all Republicans are like GW Bush.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just most. Massive voter apathy and disenfranchisement of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the electorate are what allow Republicans to win elections.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at the numbers. If everyone who could vote did vote,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Republicans would be relegated to a tiny minority of elected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officials, and limited to states such as Utah and a few others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's so much votor apathy that Democrats have to get out
with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wheelbarrows to take the drunks in to vote. It's reminiscent of how
&gt;&gt; voting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was done back in the early days of this country. Ever seen Gangs of
New
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; York? I wonder how many different times each Democrat has to vote
in
&gt;&gt; order
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to get an official elected.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If apathy is the problem, then there should be a general apathy with
all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people. That means an equal percentage of Republican votors would
be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; apathetic and need to have the crow bar rammed up their ass to vote
too.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not a 1:1 ratio. A substantial majority of qualified but
&gt;&gt;&gt; unregistered voters in the U.S. fall in the lower middle class
&gt;&gt;&gt; and poorer classes -- between 60%-70% of them (depending
&gt;&gt;&gt; which numbers one chooses to believe) would register as
&gt;&gt;&gt; Democrats and vote Democratic in elections. As I noted,
&gt;&gt;&gt; there are a few areas of the country where Republicans
&gt;&gt;&gt; would continue to win elections, even if all qualified voters
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually voted. But not many.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that's they case, then why is it that Democrats have such a
difficult
&gt;&gt; time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; getting enough votes to win elections, even after they bribe voters?
&gt;&gt; Could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it have something to do with the fact that there are more
conservative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voters? Maybe it's just because liberals are inherently lazy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Conservatives in general are wealthier, and far less
&gt;&gt;&gt; disenfranchised as a group than America's middle class
&gt;&gt;&gt; and poor. As far as I know, never in U.S. history has a
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican won a presidential or congressional election
&gt;&gt;&gt; with an absolute majority of those who were qualified to
&gt;&gt;&gt; vote.

&gt;&gt; That's pretty amazing since according to the Wall Street Journal, the
&gt;&gt; percentage of people qualified to vote during the 2000 election was
53.8%,

&gt; This means that 53% of the total population (including children and
&gt; non-citizens) was 53.8%, right? Hard to believe.

"/> No, it means 53.8% of all people old enough to vote, and not precluded from
voting because of felony citizenship etc.

I know Rick is saying something different, but he's wrong as usual.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; and that number has been declining since the 1960 election of Kennedy
over
&gt;&gt; Nixon where 65.4% of qualified votors turned out.

&gt; So 65.4% of the above 53.8% actually voted, right? I don't think that's
&gt; what you mean and that you're getting the numbers confused. There's a
&gt; big difference between the number of people qualified to vote and the
&gt; number of actual voters.

"/> No, in the 1960 election 65.4% of qualified voters voted. In the 2000
election, 53.8% of all qualified votors voted. They are two separate
instances.

&gt; The disconnect I find in most conservative thinking is that everything has
a
&gt; right to life until it's born. Then nothing has a right to live unless it
&gt; can earn the minimum wage and somehow pay for its own healthcare.

"/> Yeah, conservatives believe that you can shoot anyone as long as they aren't
working. They believe that we should pollute the land, water and air. We
should just take every bit of land available and use it for whatever we want
to, and screw the ecosystem. That's why Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican,
started the National Parks. That's why the EPA was started by Nixon, a
Republican. The national clean air act, another Republican. You name every
bit of significant ecology related piece of legislation, and you'll find
that it was a Republican that did it.

There's one stereotype down the drain. How about this. Democrats are on
the side of blacks. Abraham Lincoln enacted the 13th amendment, he was
republican. Every bit of legislation all the way up to desegregation was
enacted by Republicans. Desegregation was a holdover from before Kennedy
and was enacted by a Republican controlled house and senate, and signed into
law by Eisenhower. The Republican party had been arguing the case of
desegregation of schools long before Brown vs. Board of Education, and
Eisenhower, by executive action, desegregated the armed forces, vetrans
hospitals, navy yards and other federal establishments. Republicans fought
the Democrats to vote in favor of desegregation.

The fact is, almost every issue that matters to mainstream america has been
championed by Republicans. The Republican party is not out there passing
legislation that hurts anyone, but to listen to Democrats, they would have
everyone who's not making at least 6 figures put in box cars and sent to
concentration camps.

You're comment is bullshit, your party is bullshit, and by association,
guess what that makes you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You Libs think anyone can turn your mess around in just 3 - 4 years?
In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fact, Bush has done that, but before he can really get to the tax
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reform, he has to prosecute a war on terror and make sure his work
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turning the economy around is going to stick, then look out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, sitting with your thumb up your ass while 30% of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; manufacturing jobs are outsourced in states like Ohio and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pennsylvania does not qualify as &quot;turning the economy around&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You'll get definitive proof of my claim in about three months.

&gt;&gt; It would seem that you have a conflict of interest that you don't even
know
&gt;&gt; about. By our corporations outsourcing jobs, whe have had a far greater
&gt;&gt; effect on stamping out poverty in third world country than any aid
package
&gt;&gt; ever did. Dollar for dollar spent, outsourcing has had far greater
effect
&gt;&gt; than any liberal program of stealing from the US and giving the money
freely
&gt;&gt; to other countries. Outsourcing is the reason we have the majority of
&gt;&gt; countries with clean drinking water, where 50 years ago, only 15% did.
It's
&gt;&gt; the reason why those people that work in Nike factories work there,
because
&gt;&gt; they make 3 times what they would doing anything else.

&gt;&gt; By exporting our jobs, we benefit others and ourselves. We get cheaper
&gt;&gt; goods, and they get out of poverty. Win win as far as I can see.

&gt; Do you have any proof of this claim? Its an interesting claim, but hard
&gt; to swallow.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt; Don't forget that your hero's main squeeze has, what FIFTY-SEVEN
&gt;&gt; PLANTS OUTSIDE THE U.S.? But the main reason for manufacturing jobs
&gt;&gt; leaving is the fact that a other countries do not have to deal with
&gt;&gt; OSHA, trade unions, and a lot of federal regulations and bullshit. Do
&gt;&gt; you REALLY want to work on an assembly line, and do you want your kids
&gt;&gt; to do that for forty hours a week? I would hope that you'd aspire for
&gt;&gt; better for Americans than assembling electronics and sewing clothes.
&gt;&gt; Cripes, the last time my union bought us all hats made in the U.S., they
&gt;&gt; were genuine CRAP anyway, noticeably lacking in pride of workmanship.
&gt;&gt; Decent embroidered hats would have cost a fortune made here.

&gt; What main squeeze? If you are referring to the Teresa Heinz Kerry and
&gt; her involvement with Heinz company, then you should get your facts
&gt; straight. Teresa Heinz has no more control over that company's decisions
&gt; than you do. She is only a minority stockholder with something like 1%
&gt; of the company's stock. Heinz is also long known to be a conservative
&gt; company. Teresa Heinz Kerry's first husband was John Heinz who was a
&gt; Republican Senator from Pennsylvania. John Heinz served in the Senate
&gt; until his death in a plane crash. It is strange how I never heard a word
&gt; from Republicans complaining about Senator Heinz's wealth when he was in
&gt; office. I know this because I researched it, I also was one of Senator
&gt; Heinz's constituents, and I own a few shares of Heinz stock.

"/> It's okay to be a rich Republican because Republicans do not try to get the
poor pissed at the rich. It is another story to be a rich Democrat and
pretend to be outraged by the wealth of the rich. How many of those rich
Democrats practice what they preach? How many of them are living a middle
class lifestyle while donating the vast majority of their wealth to the poor
and other social causes? How many of those Democrats cheat on their taxes
in order to pay more instead of less? I know of none. Yet, these weekend
whiners will tell you that you should pay more.

No tax increase in history has ever benefitted the poor more than it has the
rich. The rich Democrats will never close all loopholes because they want
to keep their money. They just want the poor to think they're doing
something for them on the backs of the rich.

Personally I have no problem with Kerry's wife being rich, but I do have a
problem with him whining about an imaginary tax cut that benefitted the rich
more than it did the poor while he's sitting there with plenty of money that
he and his wife should be giving away.

&gt;&gt;can earn the minimum wage and somehow pay for its own healthcare.

&gt; Yeah, conservatives believe that you can shoot anyone as long as they aren't
&gt; working. They believe that we should pollute the land, water and air. We
&gt; should just take every bit of land available and use it for whatever we want
&gt; to, and screw the ecosystem. That's why Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican,
&gt; started the National Parks. That's why the EPA was started by Nixon, a
&gt; Republican. The national clean air act, another Republican. You name every
&gt; bit of significant ecology related piece of legislation, and you'll find
&gt; that it was a Republican that did it.

&gt; There's one stereotype down the drain. How about this. Democrats are on
&gt; the side of blacks. Abraham Lincoln enacted the 13th amendment, he was
&gt; republican. Every bit of legislation all the way up to desegregation was
&gt; enacted by Republicans. Desegregation was a holdover from before Kennedy
&gt; and was enacted by a Republican controlled house and senate, and signed into
&gt; law by Eisenhower. The Republican party had been arguing the case of
&gt; desegregation of schools long before Brown vs. Board of Education, and
&gt; Eisenhower, by executive action, desegregated the armed forces, vetrans
&gt; hospitals, navy yards and other federal establishments. Republicans fought
&gt; the Democrats to vote in favor of desegregation.

&gt; The fact is, almost every issue that matters to mainstream america has been
&gt; championed by Republicans. The Republican party is not out there passing
&gt; legislation that hurts anyone, but to listen to Democrats, they would have
&gt; everyone who's not making at least 6 figures put in box cars and sent to
&gt; concentration camps.

&gt; You're comment is bullshit, your party is bullshit, and by association,
&gt; guess what that makes you?

"/>  Au contraire. It does not take a degree in agriculture to know
that bullshit is more useful than the average Democrat.

OMB Watch - Report Links Environmental Rollbacks to Industry Contributions

``Report Links Environmental Rollbacks to Industry Contributions
_________________________________________________________________

Published On: 09/30/2002 16:12

Earthjustice and Public Campaign recently released a joint report that
links recent Bush rollbacks of environmental protections to industry
campaign contributions.

Specifically:

* The administration revoked protections against hard rock mining --
allowing increased dumping in streams, rivers and wetlands -- as
mining interests forked over a total of $3.1 million to the
Bush-Cheney campaign and the Republican National Committee during
the 2000-2002 election cycles;
* The administration moved to allow increased logging in national
forests after the timber industry made $3.4 million in donations;
* The chemical industry and other manufacturers contributed $18.6
million as the administration asked taxpayers, not polluting
industry, to pick up the burden for the cleanup of hazardous
waste;
* The oil and gas industry contributed $17 million as the
administration proposed to open sensitive areas in and near
national monuments and parks to increased drilling; and
* Coal burning utilities donated $2 million as the administration
moved to relax standards and enforcement efforts to clean up aging
coal-fired power plants.

For more information on environmental rollbacks by the Bush
administration, see the Natural Resources Defense Councils report,
&quot;Rewriting the Rules: The Bush Administrations Assault on the
Environment.&quot;''

hire an attorney to help them interpret the laws.

Recently though, it has been changing. Most laws are written in a more

pay

&gt; something about Truman doing that right after the 1947 reorg act kicked

Truman ordered desegregation, but it was not put into effect because it had
no teeth. In effect, he said it shall be done but gave no timeline or
consequences. It wasn't until 1957, when Brown vs. Board of Education came
down that it was finally forced. Eisenhower's order had the teeth that
Truman's lacked. But again, not only did Eisenhower desegregate the
military, he desegregated basically every aspect of the federal government
wher Truman concentrated only on the military. When put into context,
Eisenhower's order was a much broader order, and it actually accomplished
something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a federal law protecting an endangered bird's eggs- you
get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prosecuted by the FEDERAL government. Apparentlyit's pretty clear
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those eggs are going to be more birds- there is no doubt there is
life
&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those eggsnot just some growth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Michelle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Italy

&gt;&gt;&gt; The disconnect I find in most conservative thinking is that everything
has
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt; right to life until it's born. Then nothing has a right to live unless
it
&gt;&gt;&gt; can earn the minimum wage and somehow pay for its own healthcare.

&gt;&gt;Yeah, conservatives believe that you can shoot anyone as long as they
aren't
&gt;&gt;working. They believe that we should pollute the land, water and air.
We
&gt;&gt;should just take every bit of land available and use it for whatever we
want
&gt;&gt;to, and screw the ecosystem. That's why Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican,
&gt;&gt;started the National Parks. That's why the EPA was started by Nixon, a
&gt;&gt;Republican. The national clean air act, another Republican. You name
every
&gt;&gt;bit of significant ecology related piece of legislation, and you'll find
&gt;&gt;that it was a Republican that did it.

&gt;&gt;There's one stereotype down the drain. How about this. Democrats are on
&gt;&gt;the side of blacks. Abraham Lincoln enacted the 13th amendment, he was
&gt;&gt;republican. Every bit of legislation all the way up to desegregation was
&gt;&gt;enacted by Republicans. Desegregation was a holdover from before Kennedy
&gt;&gt;and was enacted by a Republican controlled house and senate, and signed
into
&gt;&gt;law by Eisenhower. The Republican party had been arguing the case of
&gt;&gt;desegregation of schools long before Brown vs. Board of Education, and
&gt;&gt;Eisenhower, by executive action, desegregated the armed forces, vetrans
&gt;&gt;hospitals, navy yards and other federal establishments. Republicans
fought
&gt;&gt;the Democrats to vote in favor of desegregation.

&gt;&gt;The fact is, almost every issue that matters to mainstream america has
been
&gt;&gt;championed by Republicans. The Republican party is not out there passing
&gt;&gt;legislation that hurts anyone, but to listen to Democrats, they would
have
&gt;&gt;everyone who's not making at least 6 figures put in box cars and sent to
&gt;&gt;concentration camps.

&gt;&gt;You're comment is bullshit, your party is bullshit, and by association,
&gt;&gt;guess what that makes you?

&gt; Jeez Timm don't confuse them with the facts. Without an ad hominem or
&gt; two the poor bastards would be completely lost.

"/> Well, it really looks like I'm a Republican if you go through my posts.
That's probably the biggest issue they have. They think that I'm an evil
Republican, so I must be killed. If someone were trying to push Republicans
down my throat I would have just as much dirt on them. The dirt I have on
Republicans is the stuff they vote for that is not conservative. I have no
problem with supporting issues either. One issue close to my heart is the
issue of preventing the termination of parental rights without a compelling
interest to do so. Neither party seems to be much interested in that, and I
have been fighting it for years. Democrats don't want it because if put
into effect it would prevent one of the newest sources of funds from the
Federal Government to the states.

But I do have to say that there is one Democrat that I like, Jim Matheson.
I've spoken with him in person and over the phone on many occasions, and
he's explained to me rather well what reasons he has for not being able to
advance things that I have brought forward to him, as well, he has supported
things that I thought needed support. Although I didn't agree with him when
he didn't support me, he is a very considerate person, and he has been
pretty good at avoiding some of the worse legislation. Of all politicians
I've dealt with, he has got to be one of the more honest and straightforward
people, Republican or Democrat.

Now, how evil of a person am I? I'm so entrenched in my conservativism that
I can't vote for a single Democrat right, I just punch the box for straight
Republican and leave? He just doesn't share all the same views that most
Democrats do. In fact, he has a more middle of the road voting record than
most Democrats. He averages 52% toward Republican party issues. Granted,
he also averages about 72% on Democrat party issues, but often Democrat and
Republican issues cooincide.

Of anybody here, I have the right to criticize politics. I am actively
involved in speaking with congressmen. I've had Senators and Congressmen
both state and Federal at my house for parties. I've even been asked to
speak with legislative committees. I co-founded an organization for family
rights, and I run a website for family rights.  www.p4ec.org  is the
regularly updated internet arm of my organization, and I also host web sites
for non-profit organizations for free. I've even been known to donate my
skills as a graphic artist to non-profit organizations. I donate over
$100,000 a year to mine and similar organizations, and I donate another
$100,000 a year to different organizations in the name of my solely owned
corporation as well. That's $200,000 a year that comes out of my pocket for
organizations that are doing what I believe is good for society. I donate
over $300,000 a year to my mother's church. They call it tithing, but I
call it a donation because I don't do it because God says I should. I don't
go to church, and I don't believe in it, but I do believe in what they do to
help people.

I'm one of those conservative assholes that just wants to keep poor people
poor. I don't do anything with my money except keep it in the bank. I walk
on the heads of the poor and give back nothing. I shouldn't have the choice
of where I donate my money because if given the choice I would put it all in
the bank. That's what Democrats think of me.

Somebody called me evil earlier, and I know for a fact that a greater
percentage of my income and time is donated to worthy causes that need it
than probably anyone here. And if you think I donate to charities because
of the tax break you're nuts. You get squat for charitable donations off of
your taxes. You get nothing for donating your time. I'm far from evil. I
am opinionated and educated, and dedicated to the truth. I don't put up
with bullshit propaganda from either side, and the Democrats seem to have
put out much more than their fair share of it recently.

Now, to straighten out the record further, I am not a Republican. I am not
a Democrat. I am not a Libertarian although I tend to lean that way
considerably, and probably am not only because I don't like being in a box.
I am an independent with views that are conservative, such as the right to
life, and views that are liberal, such as the legalization of drugs,
especially marijuana for medical use. My major underlying belief is that
government should stay out of people's lives and let them deal with their
own problems through the multitude of organizations out there set up
specifically to cater to those needs. Federal taxes should be all but
abolished, and at the very least, give a dollar for dollar credit on taxes
for the amount spent toward 501(c)(3) organizations. That's the only way
we're ever going to get rid of the current entitlements without a major
backlash. The Federal Government needs taxes to pay the President,
Congressmen, and Judges, and almost all other areas of government should be
privatized by making them into their own corporations with government
support, such as patent offices, national parks, etc. Money for maintenance
of buildings should be raised by charging an entrance fee to those
buildings. Social security should be either gotten rid of or given to the
states. If a person doesn't like the government of one state, they can go
shopping and find the state they like best. The Federal Government will go
back to what it was intended for, regulation of interstate and international
commerce, and the states will control the rest.

Now, I'll go back to hatching my evil plot to keep the poor down, the black
black, and lie about Republicans to advance their socialist agenda since
they too are no better in that respect.

&gt; uninformed on the issues beyond what they hear as sound bites on the
&gt; TV have no business in a voting booth. Diversity of thoughts is
&gt; great. Matter of fact outstanding, but it isn't really diversity of
&gt; thought when the thoughts that you have aren't your own.

"/> That's not necessarily the fault of the voter. Voters don't get much chance
to actually meet candidates or talk to lawmakers prior to being asked to
vote on the issues. They only hear things on television because that is
where the informations gets to them conveniently. If we really want people
to understand the issues, we have to go and knock door to door or some
equivilant. As much information as possible needs to hit people where they
spend the majority of their free time. It can be friends discussing things
between friends or candidates debating, but whatever it is, it has to be
forced on people because we are all inherently lazy, and it took me really
getting angry about some issues before I even took politics seriously. I
was forced to find out what the facts were behind legislation. I found that
my friends rarely wanted to speak of politics, so the only way I had to try
and change things was to actually call up representatives.

Not all people are self motivated, not even most. If something is too
difficult to learn without leaving the comfort of their La-Z-Boy most just
ignore it. Even though those people are allowed to vote, their reliance on
sound bytes from the news is less their fault than ours for not speaking to
them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; There are issues that I am quite liberal on. I support the
&gt; legalization of Marijuana for example. I support a women's right to
&gt; chose an abortion, but think it is a lousy form of birth control. I
&gt; support gun control &amp; access, but do not want private ownership
&gt; outlawed or made impossible. I also think the large majority of
&gt; people are more moderate leaning in their feelings on these issues as
&gt; opposed to the extreme ends of the spectrum as the major parties
&gt; present themselves on these an other issues.

"/> All views have the right to be heard in this country, and that is healthy.
But, most people hear only one side of issues depending on where they live,
and what they do. When an issue is presented to the average person, they
tend to side with that issue unless they are shown the opposite side of that
issue simultaneously. Once a person sides with an issue, it's hard to get
them to realize the opposite side of it. I would say that I have only had
one occasion where I was able to change a person's mind about something of
consequence. That was the issue of abortion. He had always thought of
abortion as nothing more than getting rid of unwanted tissue, but after a
long 8 hour discussion he finally realized what I was talking about. I
didn't talk to that guy for three years afterwards, but when I did, I found
out that he had not only changed his mind, he had been talking to everyone
in his family about it. This is a guy that took his girlfriend to get an
abortion when he was 19 years old, and he took his change of heart strongly.

A similar thing happened to me. Before I got much interested in politics,
somebody asked me what I thought about abortion. At the time, I had never
given it much real thought. I just decided that since I would never have to
deal with the issue personally since I wasn't a woman, it would be better to
let women make that choice without my opinion getting into it. A woman was
talking to her friend about it at a table close to mine. She asked me what
I thought about abortion and I told her that I didn't really have an opinion
on it. She told me that my lack of opinion made me pro choice and that got
me thinking about it. It made me think about what exactly was an abortion.
The turning point for me was when I decided that a fetus was a human being,
whether or not able to live outside the mother. It feels pain, it moves, it
has a brain, and probably dreams and thinks just as all of us do. Since it
is a human being, it must be protected, even from its own mother.

You will also notice that men are more often pro choice than women. That is
because men have difficulty taking a stand about something they have no
personal control over so they think it's best left to women. I say that if
you aren't going to take a stand on the side of women's beliefs on this
issue as a man you should not say anything whatsoever about it. Don't vote
for or against it.

You can take what I say about this in context. I am an avid supporter of
the rights of families and children, especially children who have no voice
in politics or the courts. I believe that the government oversteps its
bounds horrendously in the area of rights of families and I have an
organization that educates people about those rights. You can get a better
idea of what I am talking about at  www.p4ec.org .

Not every person you talk to will change their mind, in fact almost nobody
will, but if presented with both sides of an argument at the time they are
attempted to be indoctrinated, they have a better chance of going either
direction.

Have your views and share them, but urge people to go research what you tell
them. Although it seems that this get out the vote campaign is somewhat
advancing liberal issues, it still has an effect if people listen to it. It
gets them thinking more about politics, and no matter how they vote it
starts the ball rolling.

&gt;&gt; Either a baby is a human being at

&gt;&gt; those eggsnot just some growth.

&gt; That's not the point. Involuntary servitude was outlawed in the
&gt; United States years ago. You might also try reading the Roe v. Wade
&gt; decision sometime. The decision was all about privacy rights, not
&gt; fetal viability (or lack thereof).

"/> Exactly. Reversing Roe v. Wade will have no effect on the states right to
make laws one way or the other about abortion. What's funny is that people
tout it as some great revolutionary case, but it really wasn't. States
always had the right to either make abortion legal or not.

Fetal viability has never been any nationally recognized standard, it's just
a generally recognized standard with most states. If fetal viability was a
standard then why would the Federal government have any reason to think
about partial birth abortions.

"/> How does it cost more money in the long run than giving them the presumption
of free health care? Look at medicaid. Doctors don't like it because of
many reasons, first and foremost is the fact that people on Medicaid tend to
break their appointments almost 70% of the time, and most of those are
broken without first calling. Then there's the fact that people go to the
doctor every time they get a sliver or a sniffle.

On the other hand, those that truly need medical care can get it. Then
there's the fact that doctors very often will allow a patient to make
payments to them. The hard part is getting money for prescription drugs.
But, there are places that help with that too. So, is it more expensive to
assume that everyone must get health care given to them freely, or is it
more expensive to make it so that people go to the doctor only when
necessary? Then add to that the fact that regulation would only serve to
squelch the advancement we currently see in the medical field. The less
money there is in it, the less money can be spent on research.

I think that your point of view has been pretty well proven to be
inneffective already so I'll refrain from revisiting your stupidity further.

&gt; I'm all for reproductive freedom as long as there has been no
reproduction
&gt; already. And no, we don't have a monopoly on birth, and I wasn't saying
&gt; that. I was saying that that feeling you get when you first hold your
child
&gt; is there because it is a tangible human being. When you can't see it,
hold
&gt; it, hear it, smell it, you're not going to think of it the same way.
People
&gt; need to understand that the fetus that's being killed is a human being,
&gt; every bit as real as that one they hold in their hands.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you have art, culture and really good food. Oh and id I
&gt;&gt;&gt; mention the food? I simply feel in love with Italy when I was there
&gt;&gt;&gt; this Easter for two weeks. One of the few places I have ever visited
&gt;&gt;&gt; that I began planning to go back as soon as I got back home. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; usually visit a place once and check it off the list as a been there
&gt;&gt;&gt; done that. But I will be returning to Italy very soon. I had a
&gt;&gt;&gt; wonderful time and met some fabulous people. I did the major cities
&gt;&gt;&gt; tour this time around. Next time it will be a countryside tour
either
&gt;&gt;&gt; starting or ending with Lake Como. More then likely ending, I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; heard if I start there I may not want to leave.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I agree. I spent three weeks in Italy about three years ago. I can't
&gt;&gt;wait until I return!
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Lovely place. I don't know how great it is to be a resident there,
&gt; but it is a marvelous place to visit. I was really surprised at how
&gt; friendly the people were towards Americans in these days of Americans
&gt; suck.

Most of the people do not think like the television says. We have our
liberals, but that is because, as your liberals, they don't know there is a
middle America. My friend is learning English, she was at work in her shop
and she shouted to me &quot;I am Republican-no work, no eat&quot;

I don't understand what you are saying? We believe in a death penalty for
someone who has killed- the only reason you can get it. Manson is alive
courtesy of the democrats who passed the bill on to taxpayers. We want
children to have a two parent (ideally the ones who share their DNA)
household that can feed them, yes. We give to churches and charities that
can feed them if their parents can't. You do not have a &quot;right&quot; to have
children, they don't magically appear either. You have all the ability to
control reproduction (including abortion) and still you manage to have
children unplanned uncared/unprovided for and unparented.

Or is it you should be able to breed like cats with multiple fathers,none

parent who discovers that the fetus is seriously diseased or not viable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the British health care system is so bad, why is it still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in existence? I don't see a large stream of people immigrating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from England to the United States to take advantage of the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the American health care system is so bad, why is it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still in existence? I don't see a large stream of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people immigrating from the United States to Britain to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take advantage of the British health care system. Do you?

&gt;&gt;&gt; What we *do* see are 44 million Americans without any
&gt;&gt;&gt; heathcare coverage at all, which in the long run winds up
&gt;&gt;&gt; costing everyone a lot more money. And the number is
&gt;&gt;&gt; increasing each and every year.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt; How many are by choice? I know I probably wouldrather pay for the
&gt;&gt; treatment than the insurance. I know there's a risk, but even with
&gt;&gt; insurance you can have a catastrophe befall you.

&gt; That's a good question. If you know of any credible surveys
&gt; or studies I'd be interested to know. At least in my experience,
&gt; the majority of people I know who do not have healthcare
&gt; coverage want it badly, but simply cannot afford it. And this
&gt; much we do know -- 11 million of the 44 million Americans
&gt; without coverage are children, who cannot make this decision
&gt; in any case.

"/> Those children have so many options open to them. Look at the CHIPS
program. If a child is not covered by some sort of medical coverage it's
the parent's fault. Then you're talking about 44 million not covered.
That's about 1/8 the population of the US. I would hazzard a guess that the
majority of those uncovered are probably just out of high school and have
not got a decent job that offers medical yet, or they just don't think they
need it. Then figure out those that don't have it because they can afford
whatever they need out of their own pocket. I would bet that we're down to
at least 1/16 to 1/20 of everyone doesn't have health insurance and wants
it. Now let's figure out those who might want health insurance, but are too
lazy to look for it, and those who have heard horror stories about the cost
of health care and possibly could afford it but are spooked by the hype
about the costs. We're whittling down this number even more. Granted, I
have no idea about specific numbers, but you already started out with 1/8 of
the country, it can only get lower from there to find out who wants it and
actually can't afford it.

Then, at least in this state, there is a program that is a version of
medicaid that you pay $50 to take a class to teach you what is covered and
what's not, and you get your doctor visits covered for a year with a $15
copay, and prescriptions are paid for but a $5 copay for a year. I think
there may be dental coverage in that too, but I'm not sure. That's the
majority of what most people need, and almost anyone qualifies for that.

I don't know what that program is called, but I doubt this is the only state
that's doing it. I would bet that the percentage of people who want
insurance and don't have it is higher only because nobody's telling them
about these programs.

In other words, pretty much everyone has the ability to get some sort of
medical coverage, but you would rather pay for my drugs and health care when
I can clearly pay for them myself than to let those poor ignorant people
suffer without health care because they don't know about the programs
already available to help them. I guarantee one thing, if they were sick
enough they would find out about them. Hospitals all have forms to fill out
to get medical assistance.

"/> Pretty sad that he had to kill file me. Maybe one of my replies made him
question such strong beliefs that he almost went insane. Maybe I was making
so much sense that he was afraid that he might have to agree with me. Maybe
it was the fear that he would turn into a conservative and would be
ostricized by friends and family.

The real funny thing is that I was no worse to him than he was to me. I did
make many points that he couldn't deny, but that's not reason enough to kill
file someone. Maybe it was because of my teasing him about his Democrat
math. Maybe it was the fact that his numbers never added up right and he
couldn't fix them. The self reflection all this must have caused him. It
was just too much to handle. Whatever it was, I'm terribly sorry that I
hurt his feel bads. Maybe I'll be nicer to the next know nothing liberal
freak that comes along.....well, maybe not.

Whatever it is, I'm still going to have fun posting replies to his clearly
erroneous posts, and unfortunately he'll not see them and won't be able to
attempt to support his arguments when I show they were wrong.

&gt; Let's put it this way, I said 20 years because that was an assumption I
made
&gt; about how long ago it was. That has been the law for much longer than
that.
&gt; In fact it's part of the hypocratic oath. Granted that's not law, but it

&gt; illegal. Then you're saying that they made her sit, and that's why she
was
&gt; crippled. Then the next post says they used the wrong sized pin and that
&gt; crippled her. It seems that you can't get your facts straight from the
&gt; beginning.

"/> Come on, do you really think that something as complex as this could be
reduced to a short paragraph to be digested during the limited attention
spans of the mongrels who browse the usenet? I never said that it was her
stay in the hallway that cause her ailment, but it plays into it. There's a
lot more I could tell, and it might make more sense to you if I did, but if
all you want to do is call me a liar then it won't make any difference. The
fact remains that our system isn't what everyone in the US has been told
repeatedly, &quot;We have the best health care in the world&quot;, and that's the only
point I want to convey. Could the same thing happen elsewhere? Absolutely.
Can it be worse elsewhere? Sure, but it's not necessarily &quot;the best&quot; here. I
don't think that we have the right to brag to the rest of the world just
yet, especially when it comes to treating those who have a questionable
ability to pay.

My father didn't have health insurance NOT because he couldn't afford it; he
didn't believe in it. He saw that it would be the ruination of health care
making it unaffordable. An employee of mine just had a baby - a healthy
baby, normal delivery without complications and three nights in a
semi-private room. I saw the insurance bill. It was over $44,000! A salesman
who works for me took his wife for a mammogram and a biopsy was done. As an
out-patient service it took a few hours total - $14,400. He's an independent
rep and has no health insurance because, like my dad, he doesn't believe in
it. He paid the bill out of pocket, but hey, still cheaper than insurance at
over $10k a year. Fortunately, the biopsy was benign. If not, he'd be
bankrupt in a hurry.

My belief after all of this is that we already have the most expensive
system ever devised, plus it's not very accessible for a lot of people. Most
people in Europe live as well and as long as we do at half the medical cost.
I wouldn't mind going back to the way things were before insurance (my dad
used to give the doc ten bucks for a house call), but we can do a lot better
than what we've got.

Lastly, I oppose any attempt to put the burden on the backs of employers
too. Health care is either a personal cost or it's everyone's, and that's a
moral issue that needs a lot more space than this to discuss.

I will say it again. I love the Mexican People, hate their government,
altho it is improving. My best friend is Mexican. My son is married to
a Mexican, my Grand Kids are 1/2 Mexican, BUT illegal immigration is
just that, and to provide free health, education to them all is killing
some of our states. I have mixed emotions regarding the jobs they take,

&gt; who works for me took his wife for a mammogram and a biopsy was done. As
an
&gt; out-patient service it took a few hours total - $14,400. He's an
independent
&gt; rep and has no health insurance because, like my dad, he doesn't believe
in
&gt; it. He paid the bill out of pocket, but hey, still cheaper than insurance
at
&gt; over $10k a year. Fortunately, the biopsy was benign. If not, he'd be
&gt; bankrupt in a hurry.

&gt; My belief after all of this is that we already have the most expensive
&gt; system ever devised, plus it's not very accessible for a lot of people.
Most
&gt; people in Europe live as well and as long as we do at half the medical

It's not just insurance though. Insurance does play a part in it. Doctors
realize that the pockets they are digging into are usually not as shallow as
they used to be, plus they can't put a face on the insurance company, and so
rates need to go up. Same thing with anything that is mainly paid by
insurance. Auto body work being one of those.

&gt; I wouldn't mind going back to the way things were before insurance (my dad

better

"/> People have decided that insurance is necessary, and just to insure their
salaries, Doctors have increased their prices to follow suit. The problem
is, Doctors pay insurance too. Their pockets being so big have caused those
people they have to pay to charge them more for their services. There are a
lot of people that depend on money from the medical profession, and there is
a long line of people that receive your money from that doctor. There will
be hell to pay if a bunch of those people have to quit because there's no
money. The problem is, in order to change anything we're talking about
regulation. I don't believe that regulation ever helps anyone in the long
run. Reagan and Maggie Thatcher both proved that back in the '80s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Lastly, I oppose any attempt to put the burden on the backs of employers
&gt; too. Health care is either a personal cost or it's everyone's, and that's
a
&gt; moral issue that needs a lot more space than this to discuss.

"/> Well, Patch Adams is a nutcase, so that leaves it with personal expense. I
say that because I've actually spoken with the guy. He's nothing like he
was portrayed by Robin Williams. At least the guy in the movie was a
likeable nutcase.

who relieve parents of their babies just so they can adopt them out. It
sounds unbelievable, but our organization along with another found proof of
this, and there is a federal lawsuit happening over it right now. They
would love to get babies, and those parents who adopt them would have no

&gt;&gt;any

viable.

&gt;&gt;By diseased, what does that mean? If it is going to have down syndrome
or
&gt;&gt;some other such problem, that is still not justification. Not viable
would
&gt;&gt;mean that it would either be stillborn or would spontaneously abort.
Unless
&gt;&gt;it is a tubal pregnancy, then there is great danger to the life of the
&gt;&gt;mother and that is the only reason for an abortion.

&gt; Not viable in that it will never have any quality of life. Require
&gt; the assistance of others for the rest of it's tortured existence. One
&gt; that without the miracles of modern medicine would never have made it
&gt; anyway. One that is not only a burden in many ways on it's family,

enjoy talking when they can, and communicating any way they can. There is
no way you can tell me that they aren't having quality of life. Those
children often grow up to be adults, and as adults they still enjoy life as
you did when you were a child. Remember when you had no worries? Nothing
stressed you out, and your biggest problem was when you had to go home for
bed at night. That is how these kids are their entire lives. Yes, they
have medical issues that aren't easy to deal with, but you would have them
prevented from experiencing those joys that you remember just because of a
disease? That's cruel.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; These are private matters and decisions that shouldn't be legislated

&gt;&gt;those
&gt;&gt;&gt; who oppose it.

&gt;&gt;They already are legislated. The only thing that legally gives a person
the
&gt;&gt;right to kill a child is the law, otherwise it is illegal. If a state
had
&gt;&gt;no abortion laws whatsoever, that would make it technically murder.

&gt; It all depends on your point of view. For you it is as you say. For
&gt; others it is a completely different situation. It is up to the woman
&gt; involved and hopefully the father as well. It is no one else's issue
&gt; or concern.

"/> No, it depends on the law. How do you think they are able to prosecute
Scott Peterson for the death of the child? It was not yet born. Was it a
human life just because the mother had not aborted it? That would mean that
there is not equal protection of the law. A child is protected from murder
if the mother wants it, but not protected if the mother doesn't want it. A
fetus should be a suspect class and by the very invocation of the term
should dictate strict scrutiny of the laws that would infringe on the rights
of that class. Law class will come later.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you have art, culture and really good food. Oh and id I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mention the food? I simply feel in love with Italy when I was there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this Easter for two weeks. One of the few places I have ever visited
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that I began planning to go back as soon as I got back home. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually visit a place once and check it off the list as a been there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; done that. But I will be returning to Italy very soon. I had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wonderful time and met some fabulous people. I did the major cities
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tour this time around. Next time it will be a countryside tour
either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; starting or ending with Lake Como. More then likely ending, I've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heard if I start there I may not want to leave.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree. I spent three weeks in Italy about three years ago. I can't
&gt;&gt;&gt; wait until I return!

&gt;&gt;Did two tours of duty there, one in Naples and one in La Maddalena.
&gt;&gt;The wife and I loved it!

&gt; Where is La Maddalena located at? Next time I go I will probably plan
&gt; the trip around getting a military hop out of Norfolk NAS over &amp; back.
&gt; Start in Naples and then work my way north to Lake Como. From there I
&gt; will catch a train or a flight back to Naples to catch a hop back
&gt; home.

&gt; I also learned my lesson about Hotels in Europe charging by the
&gt; person. I paid dearly for triples on my last trip. You wouldn't
&gt; believe what I paid for Hotel rooms for Easter Week and the week
&gt; afterwards. It was almost obscene. Nice enough Hotels in sort of an
&gt; old and quaint way, but at $350 a pop for a room I would have expected
&gt; a little more. Next time I'll sub-let an apartment of house. I found
&gt; a website with a nice one bedroom in the heart of Rome for $100 a
&gt; night. It actually overlooks the square where the Trevi Fountain is.

"/> La Maddalena is an island off the northern coast of Sardinia.
It is a major resort area, that is very beautiful. Crystal clear
blue water. Nice Beaches. Great food (though the food is
better in Naples IMNSHO).

We have a Sub Tender based there. About $100 to fly in
to Olbia from Rome. Or there is the Ferry from Civitá Vecchia.

Easter weekend I am surprised you found anything in Rome.

There are a number of cheap hotels near the main train station
that are significantly cheaper than the big hotels. One I used a
couple of times is Hotel Quisisana. Same name as a very
expensive hotel on Capri. Reasonably priced and clean. And
from the main station, nearly everything is in walking distance
or a short cab ride.

Get up to Cinqueterra if you get a chance.

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; What we *do* see are 44 million Americans without any
&gt;&gt;&gt; heathcare coverage at all, which in the long run winds up
&gt;&gt;&gt; costing everyone a lot more money. And the number is
&gt;&gt;&gt; increasing each and every year.

&gt;&gt;How does it cost more money in the long run than giving them the
presumption
&gt;&gt;of free health care? Look at medicaid. Doctors don't like it because of
&gt;&gt;many reasons, first and foremost is the fact that people on Medicaid tend
to
&gt;&gt;break their appointments almost 70% of the time, and most of those are
&gt;&gt;broken without first calling. Then there's the fact that people go to
the
&gt;&gt;doctor every time they get a sliver or a sniffle.

&gt;&gt;On the other hand, those that truly need medical care can get it. Then
&gt;&gt;there's the fact that doctors very often will allow a patient to make
&gt;&gt;payments to them. The hard part is getting money for prescription drugs.
&gt;&gt;But, there are places that help with that too. So, is it more expensive
to
&gt;&gt;assume that everyone must get health care given to them freely, or is it
&gt;&gt;more expensive to make it so that people go to the doctor only when
&gt;&gt;necessary? Then add to that the fact that regulation would only serve to
&gt;&gt;squelch the advancement we currently see in the medical field. The less
&gt;&gt;money there is in it, the less money can be spent on research.

&gt;&gt;I think that your point of view has been pretty well proven to be
&gt;&gt;inneffective already so I'll refrain from revisiting your stupidity
further.

&gt; There ya go confusing with facts and the truth again. I am surprised
&gt; that you are aware of the issue with Medicaid and people missing their
&gt; appointments. That isn't a very well known fact. One of my Dr's has
&gt; completely stopped accepting Medicaid &amp; Medicare patients for that
&gt; very reason. He actually had one day where every single one of his
&gt; appointments were missed in one day. They were all Medicaid patients
&gt; and he wasted an entire day of business. Because of that he began
&gt; checking his records and it was as you say. About a 70% no show rate
&gt; with no prior courtesy call.

"/> I have a friend that is a doctor. We talk about lots of stuff like that.
He's got problems with almost everything the government has done with
medical care.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; While no one is refused emergency medical care, a couple of folks do
&gt; have problems with long-term health care. Especially in the area of
&gt; maintenance medications. I was behind the line at the Pharmacy the
&gt; other day and this little old lady was picking up her meds and
&gt; complaining about the cost which was $271 for two scripts. I hope
&gt; that is all she has to take a month, but I doubt it.

"/> Unfortunately, prescription medication is one of those areas that does need
something done. I remember the first time I realized how much things can
be. I went to the doctor because I had high blood pressure, and I also had
severe heartburn all the time. He wrote me two prescriptions, and I wen to
get them filled. The blood pressure medication was about $15, and then they
gave me the bill for the Prilosec or Prevacid or whatever it was at the time
was $130. I never heard of such an expensive medication before, so I only
had about $50 on me. You would think the doctor would have been more
careful not to cause such a shock to a person with high blood pressure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rich pay for the poor to live, and the poor then have no incentive to get

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bushs tax cut I think we are still working for 5+ months to pay off the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government. It was almost 6 months.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax Freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax Freedom Day is, what,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Halloween?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush had to borrow money to support that tax cut. So the money you and

&gt;&gt;&gt;repaid at some point.

&gt;&gt;That is total BS. IF you seem to need more money but do not wish to do
&gt;&gt;what it takes to get more money or that seems to be a bad idea, then the

&gt;&gt;Quit spending what you don't have. But then, Democrats would loose much
&gt;&gt;of their voting base because they would not have all that pork to send
&gt;&gt;home to pay for loyalty; votes. I give Democrats credit, they have
&gt;&gt;learned how to attract votes.

&gt; Wrong. Under Clinton, we not only balanced the federal budget, it was
&gt; in the black. Bush took the federal budget into the red. Don't believe
&gt; me. Do your own research. Look at the Congressional Budget Office's
&gt; web site for starters.

"/> Wrong. Under Clinton, over a year before his departure and the
Gauranteed election of the VP Gore, the Citizens had discovered just how
over valued all Dot.Com companies were and the Market began adjusting
for the real values. Bush inherited that and the Terrorist Problem from
Clinton.

&gt; Again, wrong. The Motor Voter law did not open up any more opportunities

"/> Sorry, but you are wrong. Further Bush is the current president and has
done two things. Tighten up the Borders, which Liberals scream about
daily. IN fact they would love to have Federal AirConditioned Deli

Border to destination of their choice. You would have nice folks there
to meet them with nice shiny new drivers licenses and a voter
registration card which proclaimed them to be voters in good standing of
the Democratic Party, the party of the illegals. Bush has tried to ease
the problems by using some of the Democrate Programs to aid those

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm working fifty hours a week so that the guy in South
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Phoenix can drink beer and fish all day. Redistribution of wealth is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what Democrats are all about. People who work hard are penalized for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their efforts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the toilet to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And Bill Clinton, in a few short years, almost totally disarmed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Strange how most of the base closings under the Clinton administration
&gt;&gt;&gt;were in the chopping block due to the Base Closure Comittee which
&gt;&gt;&gt;Dick Cheney chaired. If our military is so week, how did we end up
&gt;&gt;&gt;going to fight in Bosnia and winning? To see that Clinton &quot;almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;totally disarmed this country&quot; is an outright lie. Than again, lies
&gt;&gt;&gt;are what the Republicans are all about, these days.

&gt;&gt;Was a great plan to evaluate and determin what bases could be closed and
&gt;&gt;still do our job. But Clinton took that to a new level. He closed them
&gt;&gt;and instead of using all that surplus from defense to support what was
&gt;&gt;left, he even took that and sent it home to his friends in pork.

&gt; You have no clue. Really. The president (any one of them) cannot send
&gt; money home. Spending is done by the House of Representatives. The House
&gt; is who holds the purse strings. Clinton could no more send federal money
&gt; home to his friends than you could.

"/> Yea, the Government always was a mystery to me. Like, how there is no
way a Democrat Pres could ever do anything wrong cause the Congress
won't let him. Or if he did, The congress made me do it.

Yet you sit there daily claiming the congress must be giving this
Republican Pres free reign to do as he damn well pleases, right or wrong
and the way you tell it, all wrong. How is that?

While you're at it. Tell me about Clintons favourite chicken guy. He
never benifited much did he? You are naive bud, it happens every

I ask myself why in hell anyone would do that. You seldom throw
garbage at anyone, you always have a grip on the subject you are writing
about and have the logic to understand how some disguised things really
are.

So, I conclude, the guy is just unable to refute you and your

viability. In fact that's the only reason why the state
was allowed to put restrictions on abortions during
the last trimester of pregnancy.

But at least in the first two trimesters, it was correctly
ruled that the rights of women to decide whether and

imagined rights of their fetuses, unless the fetus is
viable. Right-wingnuts have been hacking away at this

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bushs tax cut I think we are still working for 5+ months to pay off
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government. It was almost 6 months.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax Freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax Freedom Day is,
what,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Halloween?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush had to borrow money to support that tax cut. So the money you and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I got isn't really a tax cut, it is borrowed money that will need to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;repaid at some point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That is total BS. IF you seem to need more money but do not wish to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;what it takes to get more money or that seems to be a bad idea, then the
&gt;&gt;&gt;real solution is to rethink that NEED for more money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Quit spending what you don't have. But then, Democrats would loose much
&gt;&gt;&gt;of their voting base because they would not have all that pork to send
&gt;&gt;&gt;home to pay for loyalty; votes. I give Democrats credit, they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;learned how to attract votes.

&gt;&gt; Wrong. Under Clinton, we not only balanced the federal budget, it was
&gt;&gt; in the black. Bush took the federal budget into the red. Don't believe
&gt;&gt; me. Do your own research. Look at the Congressional Budget Office's
&gt;&gt; web site for starters.

&gt; Wrong. Under Clinton, over a year before his departure and the
&gt; Gauranteed election of the VP Gore, the Citizens had discovered just how
&gt; over valued all Dot.Com companies were and the Market began adjusting
&gt; for the real values. Bush inherited that and the Terrorist Problem from
&gt; Clinton.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I love these:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Motor Voter = every illegal alien can now vote. Guess who they be most
&gt;&gt;&gt;likley to vote for. Yep, the Libs who make it possible to be here in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the first place.

&gt;&gt; Again, wrong. The Motor Voter law did not open up any more opportunities
&gt;&gt; for illegals to vote than were already there. Further, Bush is the one
&gt;&gt; who's making the most noise about allowing illegals to work in this
&gt;&gt; country legally.

&gt; Sorry, but you are wrong. Further Bush is the current president and has
&gt; done two things. Tighten up the Borders, which Liberals scream about

"/> This is information I have yet to hear. How has bush tightened up the
borders? Are there more border patrol agents? Is there something that has
been done with illegal immigrants other than give them amnisty? Bush's
policies have been woefully lacking on border control.

&gt; daily. IN fact they would love to have Federal AirConditioned Deli

&gt; to meet them with nice shiny new drivers licenses and a voter
&gt; registration card which proclaimed them to be voters in good standing of
&gt; the Democratic Party, the party of the illegals. Bush has tried to ease
&gt; the problems by using some of the Democrate Programs to aid those
&gt; already here under the Liberal Rule.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Welfare = Up to what, about 4 or 5 generations of welfare families who
&gt;&gt;&gt;never work, never want to work, don't care about school for themselves
&gt;&gt;&gt;or anyone else trying to get an education.

&gt;&gt; And under Clinton, that trend started to reverse. Just take a look at
&gt;&gt; welfare data to see for yourself what the situation is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Unions = Driven more companies into bankrupsy than I care to count. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;do have to give the unions credit. They pay their way and in fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;donate heavily to the Democrats. Unfortunatly they use the workers hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;earned money to do it.

&gt;&gt; Really? So, you do have proof of that claim, right?

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's not the point. Involuntary servitude was outlawed in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; United States years ago. You might also try reading the Roe v. Wade
&gt;&gt;&gt; decision sometime. The decision was all about privacy rights, not
&gt;&gt;&gt; fetal viability (or lack thereof).

&gt;&gt; So if it is a private killing it is ok?

&gt; Read the decision. It does talk quite a bit about fetal
&gt; viability. In fact that's the only reason why the state
&gt; was allowed to put restrictions on abortions during
&gt; the last trimester of pregnancy.

"/> The decision had the effect of making it illegal to make laws regarding the
criminality of a mother seeking abortion. It did nothing to prevent laws
totally preventing doctors from performing abortions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But at least in the first two trimesters, it was correctly
&gt; ruled that the rights of women to decide whether and

&gt; viable. Right-wingnuts have been hacking away at this

If it's legal to deny blobs of cells the right to live, then that should

Courts in this country do not have the ability to make arbitrary decisions
when it comes to those rights which are considered fundamental, especially
the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court overstepped its bounds in that
decision, and even the majority of the current justices believe that.

Laws infringing on fundamental rights must rise to the level in which they
pass what's referred to as &quot;strict judicial scrutiny.&quot; That means that the
law must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling interest. States have
a compelling interest in preventing the death of their children, and that in
itself is reason enough for the Supreme Court to have bowed out on that
decision. In this instance, there are two sets of fundamental rights that
clash. The fundamental right of the mother to her right to privacy, and the
fundamental right of that child to its right to life. The court weighed
those fundamental rights improperly. Nobody in their right mind would say
that a parent's right to privacy outweighs the right of a person to live,
but since this person is intangible, and unable to live outside a woman's
body, people think that it has no civil rights.

It was a bad decision on many levels, and done today would have turned out
very differently.

Putting the cost of health care on the backs of employers was never the
correct thing to do. Dental insurance wouldn't exist if it weren't for
unions because it's such a bad buy. It arose out of negotiated settlements
with employers who were being held up at gunpoint. Now the rest of us have

&gt; he's explained to me rather well what reasons he has for not being able to
&gt; advance things that I have brought forward to him, as well, he has supported
&gt; things that I thought needed support. Although I didn't agree with him when
&gt; he didn't support me, he is a very considerate person, and he has been
&gt; pretty good at avoiding some of the worse legislation. Of all politicians
&gt; I've dealt with, he has got to be one of the more honest and straightforward
&gt; people, Republican or Democrat.

&gt; Now, how evil of a person am I? I'm so entrenched in my conservativism that
&gt; I can't vote for a single Democrat right, I just punch the box for straight
&gt; Republican and leave? He just doesn't share all the same views that most
&gt; Democrats do. In fact, he has a more middle of the road voting record than
&gt; most Democrats. He averages 52% toward Republican party issues. Granted,
&gt; he also averages about 72% on Democrat party issues, but often Democrat and
&gt; Republican issues cooincide.

&gt; Of anybody here, I have the right to criticize politics. I am actively
&gt; involved in speaking with congressmen. I've had Senators and Congressmen
&gt; both state and Federal at my house for parties. I've even been asked to
&gt; speak with legislative committees. I co-founded an organization for family
&gt; rights, and I run a website for family rights.  www.p4ec.org  is the
&gt; regularly updated internet arm of my organization, and I also host web sites
&gt; for non-profit organizations for free. I've even been known to donate my
&gt; skills as a graphic artist to non-profit organizations. I donate over
&gt; $100,000 a year to mine and similar organizations, and I donate another
&gt; $100,000 a year to different organizations in the name of my solely owned
&gt; corporation as well. That's $200,000 a year that comes out of my pocket for
&gt; organizations that are doing what I believe is good for society. I donate
&gt; over $300,000 a year to my mother's church. They call it tithing, but I
&gt; call it a donation because I don't do it because God says I should. I don't
&gt; go to church, and I don't believe in it, but I do believe in what they do to
&gt; help people.

&gt; I'm one of those conservative assholes that just wants to keep poor people
&gt; poor. I don't do anything with my money except keep it in the bank. I walk
&gt; on the heads of the poor and give back nothing. I shouldn't have the choice
&gt; of where I donate my money because if given the choice I would put it all in
&gt; the bank. That's what Democrats think of me.

&gt; Somebody called me evil earlier, and I know for a fact that a greater
&gt; percentage of my income and time is donated to worthy causes that need it
&gt; than probably anyone here. And if you think I donate to charities because
&gt; of the tax break you're nuts. You get squat for charitable donations off of
&gt; your taxes. You get nothing for donating your time. I'm far from evil. I
&gt; am opinionated and educated, and dedicated to the truth. I don't put up
&gt; with bullshit propaganda from either side, and the Democrats seem to have
&gt; put out much more than their fair share of it recently.

&gt; Now, to straighten out the record further, I am not a Republican. I am not
&gt; a Democrat. I am not a Libertarian although I tend to lean that way
&gt; considerably, and probably am not only because I don't like being in a box.
&gt; I am an independent with views that are conservative, such as the right to
&gt; life, and views that are liberal, such as the legalization of drugs,
&gt; especially marijuana for medical use. My major underlying belief is that
&gt; government should stay out of people's lives and let them deal with their
&gt; own problems through the multitude of organizations out there set up
&gt; specifically to cater to those needs. Federal taxes should be all but
&gt; abolished, and at the very least, give a dollar for dollar credit on taxes
&gt; for the amount spent toward 501(c)(3) organizations. That's the only way
&gt; we're ever going to get rid of the current entitlements without a major
&gt; backlash. The Federal Government needs taxes to pay the President,
&gt; Congressmen, and Judges, and almost all other areas of government should be
&gt; privatized by making them into their own corporations with government
&gt; support, such as patent offices, national parks, etc. Money for maintenance
&gt; of buildings should be raised by charging an entrance fee to those
&gt; buildings. Social security should be either gotten rid of or given to the
&gt; states. If a person doesn't like the government of one state, they can go
&gt; shopping and find the state they like best. The Federal Government will go
&gt; back to what it was intended for, regulation of interstate and international
&gt; commerce, and the states will control the rest.

&gt; Now, I'll go back to hatching my evil plot to keep the poor down, the black
&gt; black, and lie about Republicans to advance their socialist agenda since
&gt; they too are no better in that respect.

"/>  My closest friend for years could get a job doing the same thing
she is doing right now, for a different employer -- the difference in
pay is fifty cents an hour less but she would have health care. She
refuses to take a cut in pay to get the coverage.

She could get a modicum of coverage for what she spends on
satellite and cell phones. She is a wonderful person, but she has made
the economic decision for herself, as we all do.

Explain to me why *I* should pay for her health care? I've taken
jobs for almost two dollars an hour less so I could get health coverage
-- I have horses, and refuse to be without medical insurance.

She is NOT the only American who has made this choice.

&gt; What we *do* see are 44 million Americans without any
&gt; heathcare coverage at all, which in the long run winds up
&gt; costing everyone a lot more money. And the number is
&gt; increasing each and every year.

How does it cost more money in the long run than giving them the presumption
of free health care? Look at medicaid. Doctors don't like it because of
many reasons, first and foremost is the fact that people on Medicaid tend to
break their appointments almost 70% of the time, and most of those are
broken without first calling. Then there's the fact that people go to the
doctor every time they get a sliver or a sniffle.

On the other hand, those that truly need medical care can get it. Then
there's the fact that doctors very often will allow a patient to make
payments to them. The hard part is getting money for prescription drugs.
But, there are places that help with that too. So, is it more expensive to
assume that everyone must get health care given to them freely, or is it
more expensive to make it so that people go to the doctor only when
necessary? Then add to that the fact that regulation would only serve to
squelch the advancement we currently see in the medical field. The less
money there is in it, the less money can be spent on research.

I think that your point of view has been pretty well proven to be
inneffective already so I'll refrain from revisiting your stupidity further.

In May, I needed an antibiotic not covered by my Cigna insurance.
The pills would cost me ten bucks each, which I was willing and able
to pay. But when my doctor found out, he called the sales rep and had
her drop off the sample pills for me for free. I know his office does a
LOT of passing out samples, and must do it for people who can't afford
them, too. And is probably not the only one doing that.

companies get away with it constantly. Then they make sure that everyone
has car insurance. There used to be a few holdout states, just like there
was with seatbelts, but now I bet there are no more states that operate like
that. When everyone's insured, the prices go up because everyone knows that
insurance companies have the money to pay. They don't care that their price
increases increase everyone's insurance. It's similar with healthcare.

Well, we'll just have to agree to disagree on most of this. All I have to
say is that abortion laws are technically illegal as they are written now,
and the double standards in the law show aggregious errors that need to be
remedied.

Basically the question is, if that fetus is alive, and could go to term,
should it have the same civil rights as any other human? If there is just
the slightest possibility that those that believe that it is just a clump of
cells are wrong, would it not be better to err on the side of the child,
especially since it did not participate in its own conception and has no
voice of its own? If either of those questions can be answered with a yes,
it would be disgustingly immoral of any person to stand by and ignore what
is happening.

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand your views on the subject, but highly don't agree that a
&gt;&gt;&gt; woman should be forced to bring a rape induced fetus to full term.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The psychological impacts of this action are huge. Many of these
&gt;&gt;&gt; fetus are actually better off in the long term then they would have
&gt;&gt;&gt; been being raised by a cold &amp; distant woman who is reliving the trauma
&gt;&gt;&gt; of her attack every day for the rest of her life by simply looking at
&gt;&gt;&gt; her child.

&gt;&gt;Do you have any idea how easy it is to adopt out babies? No raped woman
&gt;&gt;would have to look at the baby at all if they didn't want to. Adopting
&gt;&gt;parents always want babies. They can't get rid of teenagers, but babies
&gt;&gt;they can't get enough of. States are giving incentives to social workers
&gt;&gt;who relieve parents of their babies just so they can adopt them out. It
&gt;&gt;sounds unbelievable, but our organization along with another found proof
of
&gt;&gt;this, and there is a federal lawsuit happening over it right now. They
&gt;&gt;would love to get babies, and those parents who adopt them would have no
&gt;&gt;problem with the previous parentage.

&gt; As I said, I understand your view on the subject and have no intention
&gt; of arguing with you in an attempt to change your mind. Regardless of
&gt; how easy it is to adopt an infant, the poor rape victim still has to
&gt; carry the memory of her attack for nine months along with the trauma
&gt; of giving birth. Giving up a child for adoption can also be traumatic
&gt; as well.

&gt;&gt;I deal with children with those types of diseases all the time. Those
&gt;&gt;children get just as happy and just as excited as any other. Kids that
&gt;&gt;can't talk and are in wheelchairs get so happy to see me that they've
just
&gt;&gt;about jumped out of their wheelchairs. They enjoy being talked to, they
&gt;&gt;enjoy talking when they can, and communicating any way they can. There
is
&gt;&gt;no way you can tell me that they aren't having quality of life. Those
&gt;&gt;children often grow up to be adults, and as adults they still enjoy life
as
&gt;&gt;you did when you were a child. Remember when you had no worries?
Nothing
&gt;&gt;stressed you out, and your biggest problem was when you had to go home
for
&gt;&gt;bed at night. That is how these kids are their entire lives. Yes, they
&gt;&gt;have medical issues that aren't easy to deal with, but you would have
them
&gt;&gt;prevented from experiencing those joys that you remember just because of
a
&gt;&gt;disease? That's cruel.

&gt; I don't see it as cruel. We have no problem with putting down a pet
&gt; that we love. I see it in a similar way. Again, there is the social
&gt; burden as well. If a parent decides they do not want the burden &amp;
&gt; associated costs they should not be forced into it. Society should
&gt; not also have defective members forced upon them either. Cultural
&gt; history is full of examples of societies abandoning defective newborns
&gt; to the elements because of the burden on the tribe to care for it.

&gt;&gt;No, it depends on the law. How do you think they are able to prosecute
&gt;&gt;Scott Peterson for the death of the child? It was not yet born. Was it
a
&gt;&gt;human life just because the mother had not aborted it? That would mean
that
&gt;&gt;there is not equal protection of the law. A child is protected from
murder
&gt;&gt;if the mother wants it, but not protected if the mother doesn't want it.
A
&gt;&gt;fetus should be a suspect class and by the very invocation of the term
&gt;&gt;should dictate strict scrutiny of the laws that would infringe on the
rights
&gt;&gt;of that class. Law class will come later.

&gt; You are absolutely correct. It depends on the law, The law of the
&gt; land supported by the citizens of said land. Any national vote on
&gt; abortion would have the same results as the currently enforced laws.
&gt; I am not 100% sure of the law, but in the Peterson case I think it has
&gt; something to do with the child be so close to term. Close enough to
&gt; be a viable stand alone life form outside of the host mother.

&gt; Again I have no idea about either the scientific or law based
&gt; applications, but to me it isn't a stand alone viable life form unless
&gt; it is able to sustain life outside of the host mother. That means it
&gt; is no longer a fetus but a fully developed child. Some might say a
&gt; sentient being. One that is able to support life on its own and is
&gt; aware of its surroundings. There are even cultures that do not think
&gt; a newborn child has a soul until it reaches a certain age. In
&gt; particular 100 days. It is an old copping mechanism from high infant
&gt; mortality days. So just like different people have different views,
&gt; so do cultures.

&gt; I understand your beliefs and feelings on the subject. If they work
&gt; for you that is outstanding and I have no problem with you holding
&gt; them. I think it is good to have strong feelings on certain subjects.
&gt; However, as long as you understand that they don't work for everyone
&gt; and they are not even views held in the majority. It is good that
&gt; different people hold different views on things. It makes life more
&gt; interesting. As I said earlier I do not support abortion as a viable
&gt; form of birth control. Once it gets to that point it is just plain
&gt; laziness and shows a lack of responsibility. However, there are many
&gt; cases where I can see it being a justified medical procedure.
&gt; --
&gt; Money is the root of all evil. And man needs roots.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it really looks like I'm a Republican if you go through my posts.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's probably the biggest issue they have. They think that I'm an evil
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican, so I must be killed. If someone were trying to push Republicans
&gt;&gt;&gt; down my throat I would have just as much dirt on them. The dirt I have on
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republicans is the stuff they vote for that is not conservative. I have no
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem with supporting issues either. One issue close to my heart is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; issue of preventing the termination of parental rights without a compelling
&gt;&gt;&gt; interest to do so. Neither party seems to be much interested in that, and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been fighting it for years. Democrats don't want it because if put
&gt;&gt;&gt; into effect it would prevent one of the newest sources of funds from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Federal Government to the states.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But I do have to say that there is one Democrat that I like, Jim Matheson.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've spoken with him in person and over the phone on many occasions, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; he's explained to me rather well what reasons he has for not being able to
&gt;&gt;&gt; advance things that I have brought forward to him, as well, he has supported
&gt;&gt;&gt; things that I thought needed support. Although I didn't agree with him when
&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't support me, he is a very considerate person, and he has been
&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty good at avoiding some of the worse legislation. Of all politicians
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've dealt with, he has got to be one of the more honest and straightforward
&gt;&gt;&gt; people, Republican or Democrat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, how evil of a person am I? I'm so entrenched in my conservativism that
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't vote for a single Democrat right, I just punch the box for straight
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican and leave? He just doesn't share all the same views that most
&gt;&gt;&gt; Democrats do. In fact, he has a more middle of the road voting record than
&gt;&gt;&gt; most Democrats. He averages 52% toward Republican party issues. Granted,
&gt;&gt;&gt; he also averages about 72% on Democrat party issues, but often Democrat and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican issues cooincide.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of anybody here, I have the right to criticize politics. I am actively
&gt;&gt;&gt; involved in speaking with congressmen. I've had Senators and Congressmen
&gt;&gt;&gt; both state and Federal at my house for parties. I've even been asked to
&gt;&gt;&gt; speak with legislative committees. I co-founded an organization for family
&gt;&gt;&gt; rights, and I run a website for family rights.  www.p4ec.org  is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; regularly updated internet arm of my organization, and I also host web sites
&gt;&gt;&gt; for non-profit organizations for free. I've even been known to donate my
&gt;&gt;&gt; skills as a graphic artist to non-profit organizations. I donate over
&gt;&gt;&gt; $100,000 a year to mine and similar organizations, and I donate another
&gt;&gt;&gt; $100,000 a year to different organizations in the name of my solely owned
&gt;&gt;&gt; corporation as well. That's $200,000 a year that comes out of my pocket for
&gt;&gt;&gt; organizations that are doing what I believe is good for society. I donate
&gt;&gt;&gt; over $300,000 a year to my mother's church. They call it tithing, but I
&gt;&gt;&gt; call it a donation because I don't do it because God says I should. I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; go to church, and I don't believe in it, but I do believe in what they do to
&gt;&gt;&gt; help people.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm one of those conservative assholes that just wants to keep poor people
&gt;&gt;&gt; poor. I don't do anything with my money except keep it in the bank. I walk
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the heads of the poor and give back nothing. I shouldn't have the choice
&gt;&gt;&gt; of where I donate my money because if given the choice I would put it all in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the bank. That's what Democrats think of me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Somebody called me evil earlier, and I know for a fact that a greater
&gt;&gt;&gt; percentage of my income and time is donated to worthy causes that need it
&gt;&gt;&gt; than probably anyone here. And if you think I donate to charities because
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the tax break you're nuts. You get squat for charitable donations off of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your taxes. You get nothing for donating your time. I'm far from evil. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; am opinionated and educated, and dedicated to the truth. I don't put up
&gt;&gt;&gt; with bullshit propaganda from either side, and the Democrats seem to have
&gt;&gt;&gt; put out much more than their fair share of it recently.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, to straighten out the record further, I am not a Republican. I am not
&gt;&gt;&gt; a Democrat. I am not a Libertarian although I tend to lean that way
&gt;&gt;&gt; considerably, and probably am not only because I don't like being in a box.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am an independent with views that are conservative, such as the right to
&gt;&gt;&gt; life, and views that are liberal, such as the legalization of drugs,
&gt;&gt;&gt; especially marijuana for medical use. My major underlying belief is that
&gt;&gt;&gt; government should stay out of people's lives and let them deal with their
&gt;&gt;&gt; own problems through the multitude of organizations out there set up
&gt;&gt;&gt; specifically to cater to those needs. Federal taxes should be all but
&gt;&gt;&gt; abolished, and at the very least, give a dollar for dollar credit on taxes
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the amount spent toward 501(c)(3) organizations. That's the only way
&gt;&gt;&gt; we're ever going to get rid of the current entitlements without a major
&gt;&gt;&gt; backlash. The Federal Government needs taxes to pay the President,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Congressmen, and Judges, and almost all other areas of government should be
&gt;&gt;&gt; privatized by making them into their own corporations with government
&gt;&gt;&gt; support, such as patent offices, national parks, etc. Money for maintenance
&gt;&gt;&gt; of buildings should be raised by charging an entrance fee to those
&gt;&gt;&gt; buildings. Social security should be either gotten rid of or given to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; states. If a person doesn't like the government of one state, they can go
&gt;&gt;&gt; shopping and find the state they like best. The Federal Government will go
&gt;&gt;&gt; back to what it was intended for, regulation of interstate and international
&gt;&gt;&gt; commerce, and the states will control the rest.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, I'll go back to hatching my evil plot to keep the poor down, the black
&gt;&gt;&gt; black, and lie about Republicans to advance their socialist agenda since
&gt;&gt;&gt; they too are no better in that respect.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, you're libertarian, too. No need to be embarrassed --
&gt;&gt;Repunlicans and Demoncrats started out as third parties, once upon a
&gt;&gt;time -- or we would still be Whigs or Tories.
&gt; I think that most people would actually take the time and
&gt; fully read through the libertarian party platform they would
&gt; be impressed with the general ideas behind the party.

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Read the decision. It does talk quite a bit about fetal
&gt;&gt;&gt; viability. In fact that's the only reason why the state
&gt;&gt;&gt; was allowed to put restrictions on abortions during
&gt;&gt;&gt; the last trimester of pregnancy.

&gt;&gt;The decision had the effect of making it illegal to make laws regarding
the
&gt;&gt;criminality of a mother seeking abortion. It did nothing to prevent laws
&gt;&gt;totally preventing doctors from performing abortions.

&gt; And that is as it should be. If a Dr's moral compass says that it is
&gt; a wrong thing to do, he doesn't have to perform the procedure. Why
&gt; should any viable medical procedure be ruled out?

&gt;&gt;&gt; But at least in the first two trimesters, it was correctly
&gt;&gt;&gt; ruled that the rights of women to decide whether and
&gt;&gt;&gt; when to bring their pregnancies to term preclude any
&gt;&gt;&gt; imagined rights of their fetuses, unless the fetus is
&gt;&gt;&gt; viable. Right-wingnuts have been hacking away at this
&gt;&gt;&gt; decision ever since it was made, trying to assign
&gt;&gt;&gt; personhood rights to blobs of cells.

&gt;&gt;That's the problem. Technically you are just a blob of cells. That
court
&gt;&gt;had no right to determine whether or not it was a blob of cells or a
person.
&gt;&gt;If it's legal to deny blobs of cells the right to live, then that should
&gt;&gt;make it legal to deny you the right to live as well.

&gt; Then who had the right to decide? We are a nation of laws created by
&gt; lawmakers. Society has input into whom those law makers are. Those
&gt; same lawmakers have decided that it is also legal to end a fully grown
&gt; adult life in certain circumstances as well. As far as his right to
&gt; life, if he is a non-sentient being unaware of his surroundings then
&gt; yes. Whoops I guess I shouldn't have said that in this particular
&gt; case.

"/> The Supreme Court is there to interpret law. They do not have the right to
make arbitrary decisions. They must follow precedence and law, and if there
is no law or precedence to guide them, they must then leave it for the
legislature. The Federal Courts are not like the courtrooms you are used
to. Everything in Federal Court must follow a strict set of guidelines, and
the opinion of a judge cannot be the determining factor in a case unless
that opinion is based on his interpretation of law. There was no
precedential decision or law that gave them the right to declare the human
status of a fetus. There was no precedence to cause them to make any
declaration whatsoever about when a child can or can't be killed without it
being wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Courts in this country do not have the ability to make arbitrary
decisions
&gt;&gt;when it comes to those rights which are considered fundamental,
especially
&gt;&gt;the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court overstepped its bounds in that
&gt;&gt;decision, and even the majority of the current justices believe that.

&gt; And who appointed the majority of the current justices and what is
&gt; their political affiliation? If you truly believe that they do and
&gt; you are as rich as you state why not bring the case back to the
&gt; supreme court for another decision? Better yet why not work to bring
&gt; it to a national referendum to be voted on by the people. We have the
&gt; technology to put any major issue before the citizens of this country.
&gt; We should take advantage of it and quit guessing about the true will
&gt; of the people.

"/> I have no standing to bring the decision back to the supreme court. In
order to have standing, I must show that there was an injury in fact toward
me, or that a case in controversy exists but evades meritorious review. I
have no personal interest in the matter as far as federal courts are
concerned, and it's hard to think of a case where there would be one since
the decision whether or not to get an abortion is the providence of a woman,
and when making that decision, she is not going to implicate herself in a
lawsuit. Probably the only way it will ever make it back to federal courts
is for a state to ignore the Roe v. Wade decision and again make a law
criminalizing the seeking of an abortion. In that instance the only way it
will be overturned will be by the Supreme Court since all lower courts are
bound by their initial decision. Getting a case into the Supreme Court is
almost impossible. Tens of thousands of cases get filed with the Supreme
Court every year, and they only hear about 100. That makes the chances of a
retrial rather slim.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Laws infringing on fundamental rights must rise to the level in which
they
&gt;&gt;pass what's referred to as &quot;strict judicial scrutiny.&quot; That means that
the
&gt;&gt;law must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling interest. States
have
&gt;&gt;a compelling interest in preventing the death of their children, and that
in
&gt;&gt;itself is reason enough for the Supreme Court to have bowed out on that
&gt;&gt;decision. In this instance, there are two sets of fundamental rights
that
&gt;&gt;clash. The fundamental right of the mother to her right to privacy, and
the
&gt;&gt;fundamental right of that child to its right to life. The court weighed
&gt;&gt;those fundamental rights improperly. Nobody in their right mind would
say
&gt;&gt;that a parent's right to privacy outweighs the right of a person to live,
&gt;&gt;but since this person is intangible, and unable to live outside a woman's
&gt;&gt;body, people think that it has no civil rights.

&gt;&gt;It was a bad decision on many levels, and done today would have turned
out
&gt;&gt;very differently.

&gt; But that is only based on what your personal belief of what a child is
&gt; and your views on the subject. Many will very heartily disagree with
&gt; you on the subject. They will take the stance that a fetus is not a
&gt; child, not a sentient being, and therefore does not have the same
&gt; protection under the laws of this land. That doesn't mean you or they
&gt; are right or wrong, it just means there is a difference of opinion.

"/> It is not just my personal beliefs. Law was created in the Supreme Court on
January 22, 1973. The court overstepped their bounds in their decision, and
congress has been too limp wristed to even attempt to deal with it. The
checks and balances have not yet worked to prevent the courts from taking
over the legislature.

Anyway, the issue is not necessarily who is right or who is wrong, but it is
more a question of what side should we err on given our current level of
knowledge regarding the human fetus.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I will say one thing on subject that there is an area that we must be
&gt; very careful about and that is the about a beings ability to survive
&gt; outside of a woman's body. Just because it is able to draw a breath
&gt; and all of its internal organs function that does not mean it is able
&gt; to sustain life on it's own. It must still be nourished, clothed,
&gt; groomed and be kept warn &amp; dry. Otherwise if we stated that a being
&gt; must be fully self-sustaining or it is eligible to be legally
&gt; terminated we would widen the scope way beyond just abortions. There
&gt; are plenty of adults, and children as well, that were once fully
&gt; functional sentient beings who are no longer aware of their
&gt; surroundings or able to self-sustain life. Some must still be cared
&gt; for like newborns babies and some must be tended by constant medical
&gt; intervention &amp; technology.

"/> There is a problem with that though. Medical technology is getting more
advanced every day. Their ability to sustain the life of a premature infant
has gone all the way back to the beginning of the second trimester now, and
given future technological breakthroughs, it is highly possible that a human
fetus can be sustained from conception outside of a woman's body. Since
we're able to keep a child alive that was born in its fourth month now, it's
only a matter of time before we get to the third and second months. Thus
there is a real conundrum with the decision of the Supreme Court, and with
those who say that abortions given in the first trimester are only getting
rid of cells that cannot possibly grow into a human child outside the womb
if terminated at that point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; BTW -- What are your feelings on euthanasia and the death penalty?

"/> I believe that if a person wants to commit suicide, that is their own
decision. I don't think that anyone else should be able to make that
decision for that person. If a person gets to a point that they are unable
to make that decision for themselves and left no living will in case of that
event, they should be kept alive until they are brain dead, whereafter a
person of sufficient relation should be able to make that decision to
euthanize.

As far as the death penalty, fry the bastards. I believe the punishment
should fit the crime. If a person beats the hell out of someone, that
person should be held down and have the hell beaten out of them, preferably
by the person they harmed. If that is the punishment they receive, there
should be no jail time afterward. A person who steals from someone else is
one instance where it's probably not likely that the victim will be able to
get anything of value from the criminal, so they should sit in jail. Drug
users should not go to jail, but anyone convicted of a crime where drugs or
alcohol were involved should be given the option of serving a greatly
extended sentence or going through a rehab program. Extended mandatory jail
time should be given for repeat offenders, but they should always have the
option of shaving off some jail time if they go to rehab. Drugs should be
legal, but controlled. Kids are smoking pot more often than they are
smoking cigarettes anymore because it's much easier to get pot. Control the
pot and other drugs just as we control alcohol and cigarettes now. Nothing
will ever totally keep drugs out of the hands of children, but we can lessen
the degree of access to it. And above all, if

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And many people here in the states wait years for medical treatment

&gt; too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;By choice.

&gt;&gt;You can't tell me we have a great system in the USA. My mother was left
&gt;&gt;without treatment for almost a week with a broken hip because my father

&gt; was

&gt;&gt;self-employed and had no insurance. I mean she was left on a cot in a
&gt;&gt;hallway in the hospital without so much as an aspirin while they confirmed
&gt;&gt;my father's ability to pay the bill before they would touch her! She was
&gt;&gt;crippled for the rest of her life due to the wonderful treatment she got

&gt; in

&gt;&gt;a NJ hospital, and don't think we got rich suing anyone either. I know
&gt;&gt;Canadian citizens who live here and they laugh at the idea of giving up
&gt;&gt;their citizenship for what we have here.

&gt; I don't know what part of the 18th century this happened, but if it happened
&gt; within the last 20 years I'd say you're full of shit. They cannot refuse to
&gt; serve you, not even if you owe them money. It's Federal law, and if your
&gt; parents didn't go after them, that's their fault.

"/> The main reason for the high cost of hospitalization is the raw fact
that many indigent patients cannot pay. And some that are on welfare
get Medicade and county help for medical bills. Our one hospital here
shows $23 million last year in uncollectable fees. The other Hsopital,
I really don't know what their loss factors is. Now on a seperate
account...Both hospitals take in Children from South America etc. that
are in dire need of Orthopedic, plastic surgery, eye surgery, brain
surgery etc. The Doctors pledge their time for free. Now we are a small
state of roughly 760,000 folks and the biggest medical center area is
about 130,000 people.. With those figurs in mind... I do believe these
charitable actions are manifold across the entire USA. So multiply that
by population base and I think you would have some good figures. Now,
our VA center takes care of over 23,000 veterans a year with very short
wait periods for those that can wait. Any veteran without the economic
ability to pay may go to the VA centers. Not just veterans of wounds or
wars..Any!! Our Shrine unit takes care of burns and orthopedic needs
children without a dime being paid.. We have 23 such hopitals across
the USA that are financed by us, our football games, the Shriners Circus
and many other methods.. Many shriners also pledge their Wills and
annuities to this project. If anyone goes without needed medical
attention, that is because of ignorance or not asking. Veterans cannot
go to the VA on an emergency call.. But go to a regular hospital with
their VA card. The VA then compensates the hospital such a sum as is
deemed necessary due to the veterans ability to pay.(Non-war vets).
If your in dire need and have no knowledge.. contact you local
&quot;Salvation A5rmy&quot;. They will guide you... Our real probelm in the
USA is the lack of Dental care for indigent and homeless folks.
It seems the Dentists in most parts of the country are not as
generous as others in the medical profession. Aging South Dakotans
go to Sioux City Iowa to cut their Dental work and false teeth cost in
Half of what local state denstsist charge. If you can act like a
non english speaking immigrant... Lutheran Social Services wi9ll fix you
right up and then overcharge the US government(us taxpayers). Mexican
Women illegally enter the US in all our souther border states so as to
have children that are American citizens and to have the US government
pay for the medical expense.. I understand that is roughly $7,000...Same
cost as a funeral.

&gt;&gt;Well, we'll just have to agree to disagree on most of this. All I have to
&gt;&gt;say is that abortion laws are technically illegal as they are written now,
&gt;&gt;and the double standards in the law show aggregious errors that need to be
&gt;&gt;remedied.

&gt; I don't have a problem with that. You have proven to me that you can
&gt; argue your point with out becoming offensive. It is quite rare that
&gt; people can disagree without being disagreeable. I have no problem
&gt; discussing the finer aspects of this area with you, but have no desire
&gt; to exchange words in anger.

&gt;&gt;Basically the question is, if that fetus is alive, and could go to term,
&gt;&gt;should it have the same civil rights as any other human? If there is just
&gt;&gt;the slightest possibility that those that believe that it is just a clump of
&gt;&gt;cells are wrong, would it not be better to err on the side of the child,
&gt;&gt;especially since it did not participate in its own conception and has no
&gt;&gt;voice of its own? If either of those questions can be answered with a yes,
&gt;&gt;it would be disgustingly immoral of any person to stand by and ignore what
&gt;&gt;is happening.

&gt; That is an interesting question that unfortunately doesn't seem to
&gt; have an easy answer. Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn't. I already
&gt; see way to many children who should have never been brought into this
&gt; world. Hell I would support the sterilization of some of these so
&gt; called parents jus so the possibility of them bring another mistreated
&gt; unwanted child to conception and birth. I know that sounds cold, but
&gt; there really are people who should simply not be allowed to reproduce
&gt; and further contaminate the overall gene pool. If the entity can not
&gt; speak or mount a defense on its own accord does it have or deserve
&gt; right could be another question as well. While I don't think they can
&gt; be answered with a definitive yes, I do think a some what qualified
&gt; maybe might be in order. Believe it or not, not all people have the
&gt; same moral compass that you do. Again that doesn't make you or them
&gt; right or wrong, just means you have different perspectives on the
&gt; issue. Who knows who is right? Hell there is even the chance you
&gt; could both be wrong.

"/> You've put your finger on the exact reason why government
shouldn't get involved in this issue. If you ask 100 people
their opinion about when a person becomes a person, when
it should be imbued with civil rights, when government should
or shouldn't come between women and their doctors etc etc,
you'll invariably get close to 100 different opinions.

Right-wingnuts are always screaming about agendas and
slippery slopes, but the fact is their own agenda and slippery
slope are the only ones Americans have been dealing with
for the last 20+ years. They succeeded in outlawing
so-called &quot;partial birth abortions&quot; (which is a misnomer by
the way), and fortunately the law was thrown out in court,
but the next step in their agenda is to outlaw all abortion,
with no exceptions for rape, incest or cases when the life
or health of women are involved (see current platform for
the Republican Party). The next logical step is to outlaw
&quot;morning after&quot; pills and everything else that interferes with
the reproductive process.

In other words, it's a very slippery slope, and in their view
there is no limit to the extent government can and should
interfere with women on this issue. They are about as far
removed from conservativism as a group can get.

&gt;&gt;It did happen just over 20 years ago. They can't refuse, but they

&gt; was

&gt;&gt;not of anyone's concern. We had to wait until after the holiday so they
&gt;&gt;could complete a search to verify that there was no mortgage on our house.

&gt;&gt;There was an attempt to go after them and the surgeon who failed to order
&gt;&gt;the correctly sized pin to hold the hip together while it healed (which
&gt;&gt;actually crippled her), but our wonderful legal system turned out to be

&gt; more

&gt;&gt;of an incompetent and unaffordable joke than the medical system it's

&gt; should

&gt;&gt;protect us from, and I don't think either has gotten any better since the
&gt;&gt;seventies.

&gt; Let's put it this way, I said 20 years because that was an assumption I made

&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Read the decision. It does talk quite a bit about fetal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; viability. In fact that's the only reason why the state
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was allowed to put restrictions on abortions during
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the last trimester of pregnancy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The decision had the effect of making it illegal to make laws regarding
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;criminality of a mother seeking abortion. It did nothing to prevent
laws
&gt;&gt;&gt;totally preventing doctors from performing abortions.

&gt;&gt; And that is as it should be. If a Dr's moral compass says that it is
&gt;&gt; a wrong thing to do, he doesn't have to perform the procedure. Why
&gt;&gt; should any viable medical procedure be ruled out?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But at least in the first two trimesters, it was correctly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ruled that the rights of women to decide whether and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when to bring their pregnancies to term preclude any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagined rights of their fetuses, unless the fetus is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; viable. Right-wingnuts have been hacking away at this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decision ever since it was made, trying to assign
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; personhood rights to blobs of cells.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's the problem. Technically you are just a blob of cells. That
court
&gt;&gt;&gt;had no right to determine whether or not it was a blob of cells or a
person.

&gt; Wrong. For the first several weeks a fertilized egg is just a
&gt; blob of cells. Trying to assign rights to it is beyond ridiculous.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If it's legal to deny blobs of cells the right to live, then that
should
&gt;&gt;&gt;make it legal to deny you the right to live as well.

&gt; As the state does with some people. Over 150 just in one
&gt; state alone, during George W. Bush's terms as governor.

&gt;&gt; Then who had the right to decide? We are a nation of laws created by
&gt;&gt; lawmakers. Society has input into whom those law makers are. Those
&gt;&gt; same lawmakers have decided that it is also legal to end a fully grown
&gt;&gt; adult life in certain circumstances as well. As far as his right to
&gt;&gt; life, if he is a non-sentient being unaware of his surroundings then
&gt;&gt; yes. Whoops I guess I shouldn't have said that in this particular
&gt;&gt; case.

&gt; Yes, whoops is the word.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Courts in this country do not have the ability to make arbitrary
decisions
&gt;&gt;&gt;when it comes to those rights which are considered fundamental,
especially
&gt;&gt;&gt;the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court overstepped its bounds in that
&gt;&gt;&gt;decision, and even the majority of the current justices believe that.

&gt; Nonsense. Roe v. Wade has been upheld repeatedly and
&gt; continuously, despite the best efforts of idiots like you.

"/> Roe v. Wade has not been subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court idiot.
Subordinate federal courts must always cede to the higher court, so any case
that did not reach the Supreme Court is of no more precedence value than the
original case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;Laws infringing on fundamental rights must rise to the level in which
they
&gt;&gt;&gt;pass what's referred to as &quot;strict judicial scrutiny.&quot; That means that
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;law must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling interest. States
have
&gt;&gt;&gt;a compelling interest in preventing the death of their children, and
that in
&gt;&gt;&gt;itself is reason enough for the Supreme Court to have bowed out on that
&gt;&gt;&gt;decision. In this instance, there are two sets of fundamental rights
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;clash. The fundamental right of the mother to her right to privacy,
and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;fundamental right of that child to its right to life.

&gt; That's not the only issue. The court also affirmed the right of
&gt; women to control their own reproductive systems, vs. the
&gt; imaginary rights of fetuses. When the two conflict, deferance
&gt; must be given to the group who have established constitutional
&gt; rights.

"/> Our constitution guarantees the right of every person to life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. The question is not whether or not the fetus has
established rights, but whether or not the fetus is a person. If, as the
Supreme Court decision says, it is not a person because it cannot live
outside the mother, that issue will soon be gone. If, as I claim, it is a
person as recognized by the Constitution of the United States, the issue
becomes one of which is more important, the right to privacy, which has
always been a controversial right, especially in the Supreme Court, or the
right to life. I would say that life is the most important right, because
without that right we would not be able to enjoy any other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; The court weighed
&gt;&gt;&gt;those fundamental rights improperly. Nobody in their right mind would
say
&gt;&gt;&gt;that a parent's right to privacy outweighs the right of a person to
live,
&gt;&gt;&gt;but since this person is intangible, and unable to live outside a
woman's
&gt;&gt;&gt;body, people think that it has no civil rights.

&gt; Wrong. Again, as long as a fetus is dependant on the mother
&gt; for its survival, it is not a person and it has no rights. Most of
&gt; the recent laws which attempt to confuse this issue have either
&gt; been thrown out by courts or are under legal challenge.

"/> So, again you're saying that if a fetus can survive without depending on the
mother, it can have rights. That means, as of this moment, a fetus that has
been conceived only 4 months earlier can be given the right to life. What
happens in 10 years when that moves to 3 months or when it moves to 2 months
or 1 month. By the second month, women are just barely finding out they are
pregnant usually. In other words, your basis for denying a child the right
to live is based solely on our level of medical technology. That is
illogical.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;It was a bad decision on many levels, and done today would have turned
out
&gt;&gt;&gt;very differently.

&gt; Because you say so? Hardly. 70% of the American people
&gt; still want abortion legal in all or most cases, and a majority
&gt; still want the decision left to women and their physicians.

"/> You have that number inversed. 60% of the American people believe that
abortion is abhorrent. Somebody needs to have a reverse democrat math
filter that can be put on these messages. At least that way I can find out
what orfice that number came from.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people immigrating from the United States to Britain to

&gt;&gt; What we *do* see are 44 million Americans without any
&gt;&gt; heathcare coverage at all, which in the long run winds up
&gt;&gt; costing everyone a lot more money. And the number is
&gt;&gt; increasing each and every year.

&gt; How does it cost more money in the long run than giving them the
presumption
&gt; of free health care? Look at medicaid. Doctors don't like it because of
&gt; many reasons, first and foremost is the fact that people on Medicaid tend
to
&gt; break their appointments almost 70% of the time, and most of those are
&gt; broken without first calling. Then there's the fact that people go to the
&gt; doctor every time they get a sliver or a sniffle.

&gt; On the other hand, those that truly need medical care can get it. Then
&gt; there's the fact that doctors very often will allow a patient to make
&gt; payments to them. The hard part is getting money for prescription drugs.
&gt; But, there are places that help with that too. So, is it more expensive
to
&gt; assume that everyone must get health care given to them freely, or is it
&gt; more expensive to make it so that people go to the doctor only when
&gt; necessary? Then add to that the fact that regulation would only serve to
&gt; squelch the advancement we currently see in the medical field. The less
&gt; money there is in it, the less money can be spent on research.

&gt; I think that your point of view has been pretty well proven to be
&gt; inneffective already so I'll refrain from revisiting your stupidity
further.

&gt; In May, I needed an antibiotic not covered by my Cigna insurance.
&gt; The pills would cost me ten bucks each, which I was willing and able
&gt; to pay. But when my doctor found out, he called the sales rep and had
&gt; her drop off the sample pills for me for free. I know his office does a
&gt; LOT of passing out samples, and must do it for people who can't afford
&gt; them, too. And is probably not the only one doing that.

"/> No, you're absolutely correct. I don't know of any doctor that doesn't have
a large amount of samples that they pass out regularly to their less well
off patients. In fact, I had my doctor offer them to me when I complained
about how he should have warned me about the price of a prescription he gave
me. I turned him down, but it happens all the time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, wrong. The Motor Voter law did not open up any more
opportunities
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for illegals to vote than were already there. Further, Bush is the
one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who's making the most noise about allowing illegals to work in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country legally.

&gt;&gt; I don't know who originally posted this but it is true that the Motor
&gt;&gt; Voter Laws have opened up the possibility of illegal, or even legal
&gt;&gt; aliens for that matter, to vote. My wife is a Korean national and has
&gt;&gt; never gotten her citizenship even though she has lived here for 25
&gt;&gt; years. Last year when I renewed her license for her on line I checked
&gt;&gt; the box for registering to vote just for laughs &amp; giggles. She got
&gt;&gt; her voter registration card in the mail with her new license. No
&gt;&gt; checks, reviews or anything else. They just signed her right up. It
&gt;&gt; is a stupid law with no checks &amp; balances. If one can get away with
&gt;&gt; there has to be more with more nefarious purposes as well.

&gt; I registered by mail to vote 40 years ago. I've voted in every election
&gt; since then and NOBODY has ever asked to see a smidge of identification.
&gt; I tell them my name and address, sign my name, they give me a ballot, I
&gt; vote. Whoever designed the system relied on the honor system. Hah.

"/> That's one aspect I have never understood. I signed up with some guy taking
a petition years ago. I never showed any ID, and there was no way to prove
whether or not I was a felon, or what my citizenship status was. Is there
any behind the scenes cross checking of names with identity, or is it just
purely the honor system? Since they didn't take any ID, how do they know
that I'm Timm Simpkins born in Junction City Kansas, or Timm Simpkins from
New York?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it really looks like I'm a Republican if you go through my posts.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's probably the biggest issue they have. They think that I'm an
evil
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican, so I must be killed. If someone were trying to push
Republicans
&gt;&gt;&gt; down my throat I would have just as much dirt on them. The dirt I have
on
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republicans is the stuff they vote for that is not conservative. I
have no
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem with supporting issues either. One issue close to my heart is
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; issue of preventing the termination of parental rights without a
compelling
&gt;&gt;&gt; interest to do so. Neither party seems to be much interested in that,
and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been fighting it for years. Democrats don't want it because if
put
&gt;&gt;&gt; into effect it would prevent one of the newest sources of funds from
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Federal Government to the states.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But I do have to say that there is one Democrat that I like, Jim
Matheson.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've spoken with him in person and over the phone on many occasions,
and
&gt;&gt;&gt; he's explained to me rather well what reasons he has for not being able
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; advance things that I have brought forward to him, as well, he has
supported
&gt;&gt;&gt; things that I thought needed support. Although I didn't agree with him
when
&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't support me, he is a very considerate person, and he has been
&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty good at avoiding some of the worse legislation. Of all
politicians
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've dealt with, he has got to be one of the more honest and
straightforward
&gt;&gt;&gt; people, Republican or Democrat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, how evil of a person am I? I'm so entrenched in my conservativism
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't vote for a single Democrat right, I just punch the box for
straight
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican and leave? He just doesn't share all the same views that
most
&gt;&gt;&gt; Democrats do. In fact, he has a more middle of the road voting record
than
&gt;&gt;&gt; most Democrats. He averages 52% toward Republican party issues.
Granted,
&gt;&gt;&gt; he also averages about 72% on Democrat party issues, but often Democrat
and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Republican issues cooincide.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of anybody here, I have the right to criticize politics. I am actively
&gt;&gt;&gt; involved in speaking with congressmen. I've had Senators and
Congressmen
&gt;&gt;&gt; both state and Federal at my house for parties. I've even been asked
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; speak with legislative committees. I co-founded an organization for
family
&gt;&gt;&gt; rights, and I run a website for family rights.  www.p4ec.org  is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; regularly updated internet arm of my organization, and I also host web
sites
&gt;&gt;&gt; for non-profit organizations for free. I've even been known to donate
my
&gt;&gt;&gt; skills as a graphic artist to non-profit organizations. I donate over
&gt;&gt;&gt; $100,000 a year to mine and similar organizations, and I donate another
&gt;&gt;&gt; $100,000 a year to different organizations in the name of my solely
owned
&gt;&gt;&gt; corporation as well. That's $200,000 a year that comes out of my
pocket for
&gt;&gt;&gt; organizations that are doing what I believe is good for society. I
donate
&gt;&gt;&gt; over $300,000 a year to my mother's church. They call it tithing, but
I
&gt;&gt;&gt; call it a donation because I don't do it because God says I should. I
don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; go to church, and I don't believe in it, but I do believe in what they
do to
&gt;&gt;&gt; help people.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm one of those conservative assholes that just wants to keep poor
people
&gt;&gt;&gt; poor. I don't do anything with my money except keep it in the bank. I
walk
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the heads of the poor and give back nothing. I shouldn't have the
choice
&gt;&gt;&gt; of where I donate my money because if given the choice I would put it
all in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the bank. That's what Democrats think of me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Somebody called me evil earlier, and I know for a fact that a greater
&gt;&gt;&gt; percentage of my income and time is donated to worthy causes that need
it
&gt;&gt;&gt; than probably anyone here. And if you think I donate to charities
because
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the tax break you're nuts. You get squat for charitable donations
off of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your taxes. You get nothing for donating your time. I'm far from
evil. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; am opinionated and educated, and dedicated to the truth. I don't put
up
&gt;&gt;&gt; with bullshit propaganda from either side, and the Democrats seem to
have
&gt;&gt;&gt; put out much more than their fair share of it recently.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, to straighten out the record further, I am not a Republican. I am
not
&gt;&gt;&gt; a Democrat. I am not a Libertarian although I tend to lean that way
&gt;&gt;&gt; considerably, and probably am not only because I don't like being in a
box.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am an independent with views that are conservative, such as the right
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; life, and views that are liberal, such as the legalization of drugs,
&gt;&gt;&gt; especially marijuana for medical use. My major underlying belief is
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; government should stay out of people's lives and let them deal with
their
&gt;&gt;&gt; own problems through the multitude of organizations out there set up
&gt;&gt;&gt; specifically to cater to those needs. Federal taxes should be all but
&gt;&gt;&gt; abolished, and at the very least, give a dollar for dollar credit on
taxes
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the amount spent toward 501(c)(3) organizations. That's the only
way
&gt;&gt;&gt; we're ever going to get rid of the current entitlements without a major
&gt;&gt;&gt; backlash. The Federal Government needs taxes to pay the President,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Congressmen, and Judges, and almost all other areas of government
should be
&gt;&gt;&gt; privatized by making them into their own corporations with government
&gt;&gt;&gt; support, such as patent offices, national parks, etc. Money for
maintenance
&gt;&gt;&gt; of buildings should be raised by charging an entrance fee to those
&gt;&gt;&gt; buildings. Social security should be either gotten rid of or given to
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; states. If a person doesn't like the government of one state, they can
go
&gt;&gt;&gt; shopping and find the state they like best. The Federal Government
will go
&gt;&gt;&gt; back to what it was intended for, regulation of interstate and
international
&gt;&gt;&gt; commerce, and the states will control the rest.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, I'll go back to hatching my evil plot to keep the poor down, the
black
&gt;&gt;&gt; black, and lie about Republicans to advance their socialist agenda
since
&gt;&gt;&gt; they too are no better in that respect.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, you're libertarian, too. No need to be embarrassed --
&gt;&gt;Repunlicans and Demoncrats started out as third parties, once upon a
&gt;&gt;time -- or we would still be Whigs or Tories.

&gt; I think that most people would actually take the time and fully read
&gt; through the libertarian party platform they would be impressed with
&gt; the general ideas behind the party. There biggest problem is with the
&gt; viability of their candidates. The majority of them are screaming
&gt; loons. That is a shame because the actual party itself has some damn
&gt; fine ideas in its platform.

"/> I had a big problem with the idea of legalizing drugs for years, but as time
goes by, and I learn more about history, and I notice how things are in
other parts of the world, I realize that it probably would work. I have
found that the Libertarian party is a little on the fringe as far as their
candidates go, but the platform is a very good one. It appeals to a wide
range of people from both sides of the fence too. There are still some
issues that I don't like, but I find myself more aligned with their platform
than any other party.

&gt;&gt;Basically the question is, if that fetus is alive, and could go to term,

yes,
&gt;&gt;it would be disgustingly immoral of any person to stand by and ignore
what
&gt;&gt;is happening.

&gt; That is an interesting question that unfortunately doesn't seem to
&gt; have an easy answer. Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn't. I already
&gt; see way to many children who should have never been brought into this
&gt; world. Hell I would support the sterilization of some of these so
&gt; called parents jus so the possibility of them bring another mistreated
&gt; unwanted child to conception and birth. I know that sounds cold, but
&gt; there really are people who should simply not be allowed to reproduce

"/> While I agree with you in theory, I can't agree in fact. Sterilization is
an option in my opinion for child molesters, but even though my organization
takes a tough stand on children's rights, I cannot say that a parent should
be prevented from having children without an extremely compelling state
interest, and that interest must be a narrowly worded law that states
exactly what is proscribed, and gives careful, but achievable steps to
prevent that kind of intervention. The reason for such a standoffish
approach is because the right to procreate and the right to raise one's
children in any manner you choose is the cornerstone to diversity. A fit
parent should have the right to raise their children in any manner, since
nobody is competent to judge whether or not one parent's methods are wrong
or right unless that parent puts the health or welfare of that child in
jeopardy.

"/> So, an infant has no right to live? That would also include almost all
children. Although they can speak, they can't often defend themselves in a
manner that would protect their interests. That is why we have parents.
Parental rights are the most perfect way to protect children's rights. A
fit parent is considered to inherent protect the best interests of their
children. This is known in the courts as the Paraham presumption. The
rights and best interests of a child are best protected by fit parents, and
therefore parental rights should be protected at all costs, except in cases
where a parent is unfit by some measurable standard.

"/> Believe me, I have been on different sides of the issue at different times
in my life, but eventually the facts became so clear that I had to take a
strong stand on the side I'm on now. The law is precise, although not
always accurate. It was created to exact a set of specific purposes. The
law as it currently stands is not legal, and cannot be changed until the
right person figures out the right way to establish standing and take it to
the right court.

&gt; You've put your finger on the exact reason why government
&gt; shouldn't get involved in this issue. If you ask 100 people
&gt; their opinion about when a person becomes a person, when
&gt; it should be imbued with civil rights, when government should
&gt; or shouldn't come between women and their doctors etc etc,
&gt; you'll invariably get close to 100 different opinions.

"/> The issue here is not an issue of opinion though. It's the issue that the
law has yet to be properly applied. It is not an issue of when the

totally separate and independent of the issue of whether or not a fetus has
rights as a human.

&gt;&quot;morning after&quot; pills and everything else that interferes with
&gt; the reproductive process.

"/> Morning after pills are a bit of a grey area for me. I'm unsure how they
work. If I'm correct, it prevents a fertilized egg from attaching itself to
the wall of the uterus. I have not thought about that issue enough to come

&gt; In other words, it's a very slippery slope, and in their view

like

&gt;&gt;Rod's not a liberal necessarily,

&gt; Not a 'liberal' at all in fact.

&gt; I've always favoured the chinese approach with the worst of

&gt; Your stupid system of a decade or more between

&gt;&gt; No chance you could be a liberal. Liberals like big government with

&gt;&gt; make you wear that seatbelt to bed if they could. One of the
&gt;&gt; fundamental aspects of the Libertarians is the communities right to
&gt;&gt; decide how they should live. It advocates much more control at the
&gt;&gt; State level. The seatbelt laws and national speed limits were
&gt;&gt; enforced by blackmail from the federal level. If a State didn't

&gt; In spite of how most people use the term, this is the Princeton dictionary
&gt; definition:

&gt; 1. liberal, progressive -- (a person who favors a political philosophy of
&gt; progress and reform and the protection of civil liberties)
&gt; 2. liberal -- (a person who favors an economic theory of laissez-faire and
&gt; self-regulating markets)

&gt; It would seem that the term correctly applies to many who consider
&gt; themselves anti-government. How did we get so confused?

"/> You are absolutely right. The problem is, liberals idea of progress and
protection of civil liberties now days is very skewed. You will notice that
the civil liberties they stand for are those which most people find
absolutely insane. The anti-christian sentiment is one issue that fits
this. Liberals have this feeling that they must repent for whatever they
have done wrong, and they must do it to the extent that nobody can doubt
they are truely sorry for being rich, christian, white or male, or that they
drive an SUV or once pissed in a rain forest. Whatever perceived ill they
or their group has inflicted upon the world must be reversed to the extent
that instead of discriminating against these groups, we totally reverse it
to the point that we are discriminated against. This kind of thinking makes
them magnets for insane groups that want their issues supported. While
radical right wing groups are kept where they belong, and that is out of the
middle of politics, radical left wing groups are seriously considered by
Democrats. To illustrate, when was the last time you heard that the KKK
should have a voice in the Senate? Wait, bad example. David Duke is a
Democrat. Anyway, racist and white supremist groups are not represented by
Republican politicians, but things such as pro-abortion groups, radical
women's rights groups (I'm not anti woman, just anti-NOW etc.) or whatever
other odd group there is are faithfully catered to by the Democrats.

One thing I don't understand is how right wing groups are labeled right
wing. If Republicans are right wing, how come they don't represent any
radical causes?

The point is, Liberals take it too far. The groups with the loudest voice
get their civil rights promoted, even if it comes at the expense of other
groups. That's how it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Clinton actually reformed welfare in a big way and put a 3-year limit
&gt;&gt;&gt; on most benefits, but for some reason the Republicans don't give him
&gt;&gt;&gt; credit for this.

&gt;&gt; How about looking at that again. Bill Clinton vetoed the same welfare
&gt;&gt; reform bill twice before he finally signed it. It was put in front of
him
&gt;&gt; by a Republican controlled House and Senate three times. He wouldn't
sign
&gt;&gt; it until he got some concession that I can't remember right now, but the
&gt;&gt; fact is, he didn't want it. He fought against it, and he only signed it
for
&gt;&gt; a quid pro quo. That's why he gets no credit for it.

&gt; If Clinton wasn't in favor of that kind of welfare reform, then why
&gt; did he keep bringing it up in his first presidential campaign in 1992?

"/> I know he campaigned on it in '92. That's one big reason I voted for him.
The only reason I can see for it is that he was just telling us that he
would put soda pop in the drinking fountains. In other words, he was saying
what we all wanted to hear. He never once pushed for reform, and when given
to him on a silver platter, he refused it. Actions speak louder than words,
and his actions shouted to me.

&gt;&gt; Well, who do you think are the biggest proponents of laws that take away
&gt;&gt; personal freedom? What reason is there to prevent a person from not
&gt; wearing
&gt;&gt; a seatbelt if they don't want to. It's my life, I should be able to
wear
&gt;&gt; one or not.

&gt;&gt; There is a well known phrase that says that your rights end where my
nose
&gt;&gt; begins. That is the general idea behind what law is supposed to be
there
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; protect. Law that protects me from myself is stupid, but insurance
&gt;&gt; companies get away with it constantly. Then they make sure that
everyone
&gt;&gt; has car insurance. There used to be a few holdout states, just like
there
&gt;&gt; was with seatbelts, but now I bet there are no more states that operate
&gt; like
&gt;&gt; that. When everyone's insured, the prices go up because everyone knows
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; insurance companies have the money to pay. They don't care that their
&gt; price
&gt;&gt; increases increase everyone's insurance. It's similar with healthcare.

&gt; You won't find an argument from me on any of this. As I've already said,
the
&gt; insurance companies are at the root of the problem along with the lawyers
&gt; who insist that we have to be protected from ourselves. I'm vehemently
&gt; opposed to things like seat belt laws and the war on drugs. I believe in
&gt; personal freedom so long as it doesn't hurt others in the community. Does
&gt; this make me a liberal or a libertarian?

"/> That is more Libertarian. Liberals think they corner the market on their
idea of personal freedom, but what they really have cornered the market on
is abnormal freedom.

If you want to sum up the idea of Libertarianism, you can think of it like a
method to ensure that people have the most control over themselves. The
more government migrates to Washington, the more detached it gets from the
people it is designed to work for. The closer the governmental power is to
the individual, the more that individual feels free.

It would be great if anarchy could work, but it can't. Anarchy would
basically be everyone governing themselves. The wild west proved that isn't
such a good idea. The next step up the ladder is city government, then
state, then federal. How is someone from Virginia supposed to know the
needs of a person from North Dakota? They live totally different
lifestyles. When you have a delegation where 98% of the people in the room
are looking out for the lifestyle of their constituents and not yours,
you're pretty screwed. Then there's the house, where a state like North
Dakota is represented by less than 1% of the votes.

Libertarians believe that the federal government doesn't belong in the daily
lives of individuals. That should be the pervue of the states. States are
much better at meeting the needs and desires of their people than Washington
ever will be. Similarly, the federal government should be minimalist. It
only needs to deal with issues that are particularly federal government
related, such as interstate and international commerce, since the states
have the rest taken care of.

There are some other Libertarian views that I don't quite understand, such
as the view that all land should be privatized. Some of the theories I've
heard advanced about that seem rather strange, but I could be just
misunderstanding them.

"/> When I was young in New Mexico, we, like all other ranchers, really had
hard times finding good steady help. Same for many or all of the
farmers along the Gila River. The Gov had a program where you could
contract for Mexican Citizens, for 6 mo at a shot, pick them up at the
border, take them to a place to live which had to meet certain
standards, pay them the wages agreed on by all, and then put them to
work. Best workers I ever worked with.

We had about 15 and I gave them my guitar which they played and sang
every nite for me. Hell I knew the words to about 6 or 7 Mexican songs
before I ever learned one in English. I read and wrote letters for them
as few could read or write. No, I had no clue what I was reading or
writing but Spanish pretty much sounds like it reads so we got along til
I did learn some. There will always be jobs you can't fill with
Americans and for those, welcome the Mexicans. I worked down there, BUT
I had the equivilant of our Green Cards which are hard to get and expensive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;support programs that are meant more to keep elected officials in

&gt; office

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than they are to actually help anyone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just keep on with your bullshit rhetoric, and I'll stick with the

&gt; facts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's been clear to anyone that your idea of a utopian society means

&gt; that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rich pay for the poor to live, and the poor then have no incentive

&gt; to get

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off their dead asses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These democrats and I'll raise your taxes Kerry sicken me. Even after

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bushs tax cut I think we are still working for 5+ months to pay off

&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government. It was almost 6 months.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax Freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax Freedom Day is,

&gt; what,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Halloween?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush had to borrow money to support that tax cut. So the money you and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I got isn't really a tax cut, it is borrowed money that will need to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;repaid at some point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That is total BS. IF you seem to need more money but do not wish to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what it takes to get more money or that seems to be a bad idea, then the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;real solution is to rethink that NEED for more money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Quit spending what you don't have. But then, Democrats would loose much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of their voting base because they would not have all that pork to send
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;home to pay for loyalty; votes. I give Democrats credit, they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;learned how to attract votes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong. Under Clinton, we not only balanced the federal budget, it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the black. Bush took the federal budget into the red. Don't believe
&gt;&gt;&gt;me. Do your own research. Look at the Congressional Budget Office's
&gt;&gt;&gt;web site for starters.

&gt;&gt;Wrong. Under Clinton, over a year before his departure and the
&gt;&gt;Gauranteed election of the VP Gore, the Citizens had discovered just how
&gt;&gt;over valued all Dot.Com companies were and the Market began adjusting
&gt;&gt;for the real values. Bush inherited that and the Terrorist Problem from
&gt;&gt;Clinton.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I love these:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Motor Voter = every illegal alien can now vote. Guess who they be most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;likley to vote for. Yep, the Libs who make it possible to be here in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, wrong. The Motor Voter law did not open up any more opportunities
&gt;&gt;&gt;for illegals to vote than were already there. Further, Bush is the one
&gt;&gt;&gt;who's making the most noise about allowing illegals to work in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;country legally.

&gt;&gt;Sorry, but you are wrong. Further Bush is the current president and has
&gt;&gt;done two things. Tighten up the Borders, which Liberals scream about

&gt; This is information I have yet to hear. How has bush tightened up the
&gt; borders? Are there more border patrol agents? Is there something that has
&gt; been done with illegal immigrants other than give them amnisty? Bush's
&gt; policies have been woefully lacking on border control.

"/> What I said may in fact be skewed a tad due to the aftermath of 9/11. I
have been crossing the Border for many years and yes, there are more
agents, and they are on a mission. What is hard to discern is whether
it is Drugs, Terrorists or just illegals that is the major push but
believe me, it is 10 times tuffer to get accross a US Border from the
South. According to some agents willing to talk, it is Bush, but how
much pressure from others is not known. We do know Liberals seem to
want the borders opened so I just drew my own conclusions.

from parents, I hope, guess how that will turn out in a few years if

&gt; had nothing to do with unions. Unions were once necessary, and served to
&gt; promote change throughout the country on issues such as safety, and the
&gt; amount of hours one can work. In fact, I think they had their hand in child
&gt; labor laws if I remember correctly. Now their job is solely to increase the
&gt; pay and benefits of their workers well beyond the point of reason for the
&gt; positions their workers fill.

"/> You are correct on all accounts. He must consider this tho: I only
mentioned three, I know of more, I am only one guy and if I know this
much, how much more is going on?

When Unions were concieved, they were indeed nessessary. However, for
some 40 or more years, they have only hurt this country and put many
Union workers out of work.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The disconnect I find in most conservative thinking is that everything has a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right to life until it's born. Then nothing has a right to live unless it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can earn the minimum wage and somehow pay for its own healthcare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You know friend, it occurs to me that you folks do understand what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;going on and that most abortion (Birth Control) occurs in the welfare
&gt;&gt;&gt;state, that if you condone killing the babies, your welfare will spread
&gt;&gt;&gt;further. But wait a min. Every time you kill one, ooops, there went a
&gt;&gt;&gt;possible Liberal vote. You guys need to take another look. You could
&gt;&gt;&gt;be killing off your party, one abortion at a time.

&gt;&gt; There go the hot buttons again.

&gt;&gt; If you were a woman, would abortion be your preferred
&gt;&gt; method of birth control?

&gt;&gt; It must get old, living in such a tiny box. I pity you.

&gt; Rick, you seem to be pre-occupied with buttons and boxes. What's wrong
&gt; with facing the subject at hand? You know the major parties stance on
&gt; the subject, deal with that. Most Democrats feel it is ok to kill
&gt; unborn babies, most Republicans do not.

"/> That's exactly what I mean by tiny boxes. The world really is
a black or white affair with you, isn't it? That anyone could
actually be both against abortion and also against government
intrusion on the issue doesn't even enter your pea brain as a
possibility, does it? How many people, Democrat or otherwise
have you ever heard say, &quot;Gee, I think abortion's a great thing.
I just love them.&quot; Get real.

The way to deal with unwanted prenancy is through education
and availability of alternate birth control methods. We've
already tried dealing with it by making government some kind
of totalitarian Big Brother. Yeah, the &quot;good 'ol days&quot; of back
alley coat hanger abortions. That's the real goal here, isn't it?

You want me to face the issue at hand? Ok. First of all, in
my opinion men have no business imposing their will on women,
or even forming a final opinion about abortion since it's not men
who get pregnant nor is it they who understand the issue. If a
majority of American women want abortion illegal then so be it,
but the numbers don't show that kind of support for such laws.
70% of us (both men and women) want abortion kept legal in
all or most cases, and a majority want the decision left between
women and their physicians. Even greater majorities are seen
in polls taken of just women.

&gt;&gt; I registered by mail to vote 40 years ago. I've voted in every election

&gt;&gt; vote. Whoever designed the system relied on the honor system. Hah.

&gt; That's one aspect I have never understood. I signed up with some guy taking
&gt; a petition years ago. I never showed any ID, and there was no way to prove
&gt; whether or not I was a felon, or what my citizenship status was. Is there
&gt; any behind the scenes cross checking of names with identity, or is it just
&gt; purely the honor system? Since they didn't take any ID, how do they know
&gt; that I'm Timm Simpkins born in Junction City Kansas, or Timm Simpkins from
&gt; New York?

You'd think that somebody would care, but apparently they don't. I have
to figure that The Powers That Be don't think that fraudulent voting is
anything they need to worry about. Sort of like Microsoft's attitude
toward security updates -- the only convenient (or perhaps possible) way
is to just hit 'automatic update,' bend over and grab your ankles...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamental aspects of the Libertarians is the communities right to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decide how they should live. It advocates much more control at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; State level. The seatbelt laws and national speed limits were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enforced by blackmail from the federal level. If a State didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comply its federal highway funds were placed in jeopardy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The disconnect I find in most conservative thinking is that
everything has a

unless it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can earn the minimum wage and somehow pay for its own healthcare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know friend, it occurs to me that you folks do understand what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;going on and that most abortion (Birth Control) occurs in the welfare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;state, that if you condone killing the babies, your welfare will
spread
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;further. But wait a min. Every time you kill one, ooops, there went
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;possible Liberal vote. You guys need to take another look. You could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be killing off your party, one abortion at a time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There go the hot buttons again.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you were a woman, would abortion be your preferred
&gt;&gt;&gt; method of birth control?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It must get old, living in such a tiny box. I pity you.

&gt;&gt; Rick, you seem to be pre-occupied with buttons and boxes. What's wrong
&gt;&gt; with facing the subject at hand? You know the major parties stance on
&gt;&gt; the subject, deal with that. Most Democrats feel it is ok to kill
&gt;&gt; unborn babies, most Republicans do not.

&gt; That's exactly what I mean by tiny boxes. The world really is
&gt; a black or white affair with you, isn't it? That anyone could
&gt; actually be both against abortion and also against government
&gt; intrusion on the issue doesn't even enter your pea brain as a
&gt; possibility, does it? How many people, Democrat or otherwise
&gt; have you ever heard say, &quot;Gee, I think abortion's a great thing.
&gt; I just love them.&quot; Get real.

&gt; The way to deal with unwanted prenancy is through education
&gt; and availability of alternate birth control methods. We've
&gt; already tried dealing with it by making government some kind
&gt; of totalitarian Big Brother. Yeah, the &quot;good 'ol days&quot; of back
&gt; alley coat hanger abortions. That's the real goal here, isn't it?

&gt; You want me to face the issue at hand? Ok. First of all, in
&gt; my opinion men have no business imposing their will on women,

"/> Well, if a man kills a fetus it's murder, but if a woman kills a fetus it's
birth control. That doesn't sound quite fair. Where's the 14th amendment
on that one?

rights of children.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; majority of American women want abortion illegal then so be it,
&gt; but the numbers don't show that kind of support for such laws.

"/> Wrong again. More men than women believe abortion should be illegal. Women
have a much better handle on these things than men do apparently. Men are
the ones who obstruct this issue, because men generally don't want to make a
decision they know little about, but the reason they know little about it is
because they haven't thought about it. When you think about the issue it is
not an issue of whether or not a woman has the right to control her own
body, but whether or not that child has a right to live.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 70% of us (both men and women) want abortion kept legal in
&gt; all or most cases, and a majority want the decision left between

your man elected which is why, for example, it's pointless to vote
Libertarian and why half the country doesn't even bother.

conglomeration of minority groups, each with a particular agenda. The
leaders don't even dare dwell on the issues because they might offend some
of the competing interests. If support drops below 50 percent, all is lost.
So much for principle!

So the problem as I see it is our very electoral system. Would a
proportional representation system be possible? Could we ever have an
instant run off election where people get a first choice without fear of
throwing the vote away, then a safety vote if that person fails to win? I'm
told that these things work in other countries, and it sounds a lot more
fair than what we currently have. The founding fathers could never have
envisioned television and the internet. Maybe it's time to change the way we
do business.

&gt;&gt; One thing I don't understand is how right wing groups are labeled right
&gt;&gt; wing. If Republicans are right wing, how come they don't represent any
&gt;&gt; radical causes?

&gt;&gt; The point is, Liberals take it too far. The groups with the loudest voice
&gt;&gt; get their civil rights promoted, even if it comes at the expense of other
&gt;&gt; groups. That's how it is.

&gt; It's all the product of our winner take all election system. Each party
&gt; finds it necessary to get enough support to win from wherever they can get
&gt; votes rather than stand on principles. Viewpoints that are held by less than
&gt; fifty percent of the population aren't represented at all if you can't get
&gt; your man elected which is why, for example, it's pointless to vote
&gt; Libertarian and why half the country doesn't even bother.

&gt; The Democratic party (and to a lesser extent the Republicans) has become a
&gt; conglomeration of minority groups, each with a particular agenda. The
&gt; leaders don't even dare dwell on the issues because they might offend some

Nice theory, pity about the reality that tiny special interest
group partys end up with FAR more political power than can
be justified by the percentage of the vote they actually got.

Nothing like 'fair' in practice.

Its no coincidence that the great democracys that have done fine
for a century or more now dont use proportional voting systems.
Its almost exclusively those who have had anything like a real
democratic system for often less than 50 years, that do on the whole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is true that there should be no need for abortion (except for rape)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Did the child decide who its father was? Should that child not have the

&gt;&gt;I understand your views on the subject, but highly don't agree that a

&gt;&gt;The psychological impacts of this action are huge. Many of these
&gt;&gt;fetus are actually better off in the long term then they would have

&gt; Do you have any idea how easy it is to adopt out babies? No raped woman

&gt; parents always want babies. They can't get rid of teenagers, but babies

&gt; Read the decision. It does talk quite a bit about fetal

&gt; the last trimester of pregnancy.

&gt; But at least in the first two trimesters, it was correctly
&gt; ruled that the rights of women to decide whether and
&gt; when to bring their pregnancies to term preclude any

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The disconnect I find in most conservative thinking is that everything has a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can earn the minimum wage and somehow pay for its own healthcare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know friend, it occurs to me that you folks do understand what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;going on and that most abortion (Birth Control) occurs in the welfare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;state, that if you condone killing the babies, your welfare will spread
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;further. But wait a min. Every time you kill one, ooops, there went a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;possible Liberal vote. You guys need to take another look. You could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be killing off your party, one abortion at a time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you were a woman, would abortion be your preferred
&gt;&gt;&gt;method of birth control?

&gt;&gt;&gt;It must get old, living in such a tiny box. I pity you.

&gt;&gt;Rick, you seem to be pre-occupied with buttons and boxes. What's wrong
&gt;&gt;with facing the subject at hand? You know the major parties stance on
&gt;&gt;the subject, deal with that. Most Democrats feel it is ok to kill

&gt;&gt;personal freedom? What reason is there to prevent a person from not

&gt; wearing

&gt;&gt;a seatbelt if they don't want to. It's my life, I should be able to wear
&gt;&gt;one or not.

&gt;&gt;There is a well known phrase that says that your rights end where my nose
&gt;&gt;begins. That is the general idea behind what law is supposed to be there

&gt; to

&gt;&gt;protect. Law that protects me from myself is stupid, but insurance
&gt;&gt;companies get away with it constantly. Then they make sure that everyone
&gt;&gt;has car insurance. There used to be a few holdout states, just like there
&gt;&gt;was with seatbelts, but now I bet there are no more states that operate

&gt; like

&gt;&gt;that. When everyone's insured, the prices go up because everyone knows

&gt; that

&gt;&gt;insurance companies have the money to pay. They don't care that their

&gt; price

&gt;&gt;increases increase everyone's insurance. It's similar with healthcare.

&gt; You won't find an argument from me on any of this. As I've already said, the
&gt; insurance companies are at the root of the problem along with the lawyers
&gt; who insist that we have to be protected from ourselves. I'm vehemently
&gt; opposed to things like seat belt laws and the war on drugs. I believe in
&gt; personal freedom so long as it doesn't hurt others in the community. Does
&gt; this make me a liberal or a libertarian?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Either a baby is a human being at

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it right by making it a crime of murder to kill a woman's unborn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;child
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without her consent. They just need to go the rest of the way and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consider
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it a crime to murder that child with her consent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a federal law protecting an endangered bird's eggs- you get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;prosecuted by the FEDERAL government. Apparentlyit's pretty clear that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those eggs are going to be more birds- there is no doubt there is life in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those eggsnot just some growth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's not the point. Involuntary servitude was outlawed in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;United States years ago. You might also try reading the Roe v. Wade
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decision sometime. The decision was all about privacy rights, not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fetal viability (or lack thereof).

&gt;&gt;&gt;So if it is a private killing it is ok?

&gt;&gt; Read the decision. It does talk quite a bit about fetal
&gt;&gt; viability. In fact that's the only reason why the state
&gt;&gt; was allowed to put restrictions on abortions during
&gt;&gt; the last trimester of pregnancy.

&gt;&gt; But at least in the first two trimesters, it was correctly
&gt;&gt; ruled that the rights of women to decide whether and
&gt;&gt; when to bring their pregnancies to term preclude any
&gt;&gt; imagined rights of their fetuses, unless the fetus is
&gt;&gt; viable. Right-wingnuts have been hacking away at this
&gt;&gt; decision ever since it was made, trying to assign
&gt;&gt; personhood rights to blobs of cells.

&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt; Okay, so is it a baby a day before full term? A week before full
&gt; term? A MONTH before full term? Give me exactly the time and the date
&gt; that it becomes a human being, since you';ve decided that.

"/> In most cases viability of a fetus occurs sometime during
the third trimester. Hence the decision in Roe v. Wade.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The disconnect I find in most conservative thinking is that everything has a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right to life until it's born. Then nothing has a right to live unless it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can earn the minimum wage and somehow pay for its own healthcare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know friend, it occurs to me that you folks do understand what is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;going on and that most abortion (Birth Control) occurs in the welfare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;state, that if you condone killing the babies, your welfare will spread
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;further. But wait a min. Every time you kill one, ooops, there went a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;possible Liberal vote. You guys need to take another look. You could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be killing off your party, one abortion at a time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There go the hot buttons again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you were a woman, would abortion be your preferred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;method of birth control?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It must get old, living in such a tiny box. I pity you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick, you seem to be pre-occupied with buttons and boxes. What's wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt;with facing the subject at hand? You know the major parties stance on
&gt;&gt;&gt;the subject, deal with that. Most Democrats feel it is ok to kill
&gt;&gt;&gt;unborn babies, most Republicans do not.

&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I mean by tiny boxes. The world really is
&gt;&gt; a black or white affair with you, isn't it?

&gt; Yea Rick, I tend to like things tied down, no wishy washy BS, floppin in
&gt; the wind sorta thing. Makes for a more tidy way of life for me and I
&gt; need that. You feel free to play in the grey.

&gt;&gt; The way to deal with unwanted prenancy is through education

&gt; The problem just could be that you liberals have given us 'freedom to
&gt; ----------fill in the blank until we are beyond help. Take speech for
&gt; example. Kids enjoy free speech to the point of total obsenity. I have
&gt; to make sure I go to movies in the daytime when kids are in school so I
&gt; don't have to subject my family to the filth they spew in public as I
&gt; try to get my tickets and inside. BUT the Liberal courts keep on
&gt; throwing more freedoms at us until we are a country of filth and
&gt; loosers. Just my opinion, you may like all that crap.

"/> Ok, we get it. You're a fascist. Well, if you don't like the

come and haul him off to prison. And if they catch your
son masturbating they'll hack off his hands. Sounds like
heaven to you, doesn't it?

You make it sound as ifthey were prevalent. It's not even necessary for

2. Pill
3. Condoms

Their will was not imposed upon- they knew there was consequences before

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know friend, it occurs to me that you folks do understand what is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;possible Liberal vote. You guys need to take another look. You could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be killing off your party, one abortion at a time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There go the hot buttons again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you were a woman, would abortion be your preferred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;method of birth control?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It must get old, living in such a tiny box. I pity you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick, you seem to be pre-occupied with buttons and boxes. What's wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with facing the subject at hand? You know the major parties stance on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the subject, deal with that. Most Democrats feel it is ok to kill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unborn babies, most Republicans do not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's exactly what I mean by tiny boxes. The world really is
&gt;&gt;&gt;a black or white affair with you, isn't it?

&gt;&gt;Yea Rick, I tend to like things tied down, no wishy washy BS, floppin in
&gt;&gt;the wind sorta thing. Makes for a more tidy way of life for me and I
&gt;&gt;need that. You feel free to play in the grey.

&gt; The world is 6 billion shades of gray. Reducing it to black
&gt; and white is usually a result of old age, a closed mind or both.

&gt;&gt; That anyone could

&gt;&gt;&gt;actually be both against abortion and also against government
&gt;&gt;&gt;intrusion on the issue doesn't even enter your pea brain as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;possibility, does it?

&gt;&gt;So You are against abortion, but you just don't want the Government to
&gt;&gt;be likewise? I guess that's grey alright.

&gt; Yup. A simple bumper sticker states my position:
&gt;&quot;Against Abortion? Don't Have One.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;The way to deal with unwanted prenancy is through education
&gt;&gt;&gt;and availability of alternate birth control methods. We've
&gt;&gt;&gt;already tried dealing with it by making government some kind
&gt;&gt;&gt;of totalitarian Big Brother.

&gt;&gt;The problem just could be that you liberals have given us 'freedom to
&gt;&gt;----------fill in the blank until we are beyond help. Take speech for
&gt;&gt;example. Kids enjoy free speech to the point of total obsenity. I have
&gt;&gt;to make sure I go to movies in the daytime when kids are in school so I
&gt;&gt;don't have to subject my family to the filth they spew in public as I
&gt;&gt;try to get my tickets and inside. BUT the Liberal courts keep on
&gt;&gt;throwing more freedoms at us until we are a country of filth and
&gt;&gt;loosers. Just my opinion, you may like all that crap.

&gt; Ok, we get it. You're a fascist. Well, if you don't like the
&gt; First Amendment, take your family and go live in Iran for
&gt; a few years. Then, when someone utters an obscenity in
&gt; public, you can watch in glee while government thugs
&gt; come and haul him off to prison. And if they catch your
&gt; son masturbating they'll hack off his hands. Sounds like
&gt; heaven to you, doesn't it?

&gt; Rick

"/> Rick Rick, where is your sense of grey here. I have no problem with
the First Amendment, only the extent to which our illustrious Courts
have figured to apply it to. Amazing to me how much the ACLU can
package into that FREEDOM. Pick any other and apply the same sentiments
from me.

And By the WAY, do you always jump to the furtherest extreams in
everything you do or think or say? I say, Man that dog pissed me off,
and from that you would come back suggesting I hate dogs, want to cut
off their legs, bash their teeth in and kick em when they tried to get
up. Just another one of your freedoms, but like others, gone haywire.

Rick, would spitting on you in PUBLIC be one of my freedoms? I don't do
those things, but I would like to know what you believe.

&gt; Your choice.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The way to deal with unwanted prenancy is through education

&gt;&gt;&gt; already tried dealing with it by making government some kind
&gt;&gt;&gt; of totalitarian Big Brother. Yeah, the &quot;good 'ol days&quot; of back
&gt;&gt;&gt; alley coat hanger abortions. That's the real goal here, isn't it?

&gt;&gt; You make it sound as ifthey were prevalent.

&gt; They WERE prevalent for 150 years in this country.

&gt;&gt;It's not even necessary for
&gt;&gt;an abortion anymore- you have so many methods of birth control-

&gt;&gt; 1. Abstinence (not &quot;taught&quot; i.e. hot to say NO or I'll wait, or let's do
&gt;&gt;something else- in your public schools)

&gt; Already done.

&gt;&gt; 2. Pill
&gt;&gt; 3. Condoms
&gt;&gt; 4. Sponge
&gt;&gt; 5. Spermicide
&gt;&gt; 6. IUD
&gt;&gt; 7. A shot in the arm THAT LASTS FOR 3 MONTHS- for the too busy to take a
&gt;&gt;pill daily and stupid crowd

&gt; Variations on a theme. Accidents (and rape, and incest, and
&gt; lying boyfriends, and and and) still happen.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You want me to face the issue at hand? Ok. First of all, in
&gt;&gt;&gt; my opinion men have no business imposing their will on women,

&gt;&gt; Their will was not imposed upon- they knew there was consequences before
&gt;&gt;they had sex unless it was rape, in which case charges would be leveled.

&gt; Ah yes, the Father Knows Best mentality. Still doesn't address
&gt; the problem. If you were a woman with an unwanted pregnancy,
&gt; would you seriously let Uncle Sam dictate to you what to do?
&gt; If so, you're in an extreme minority.

&gt;&gt;Women needto be treated as intelligent people able to understand what they
&gt;&gt;do has repercussions. If you get drunk and drive and kill someone, there is
&gt;&gt;no going back and an unwanted pregnancy should be dealt with the same way
&gt;&gt;fortunately there is relief in adoption.

&gt; You know talk like that is the most insulting of all to women.
&gt; Hey women, we need to treat you like intelligent people, but
&gt; we can't trust you to plan your own family.

&gt; Look, even with the relentless pro-life campaign of the last
&gt; 30 years a majority of the American people STILL want
&gt; abortion legal in all or most cases, and a majority STILL
&gt; want the decision left to women and their doctors:

&gt; finished with a job in his specialty he cannot be made use of doing
&gt; something else (menial or otherwise) and he cannot be sent home before so
&gt; many hours. This means they are getting paid to do nothing literally

Right hand sweepers required in every building, North sweepers and South

with two backups drawing full pay, in case one of the HOT sweepers got

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, who do you think are the biggest proponents of laws that take
away
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;personal freedom? What reason is there to prevent a person from not

&gt;&gt;&gt; wearing

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a seatbelt if they don't want to. It's my life, I should be able to
wear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one or not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a well known phrase that says that your rights end where my
nose
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;begins. That is the general idea behind what law is supposed to be
there

&gt;&gt;&gt; to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;protect. Law that protects me from myself is stupid, but insurance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;companies get away with it constantly. Then they make sure that
everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has car insurance. There used to be a few holdout states, just like
there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was with seatbelts, but now I bet there are no more states that
operate

&gt;&gt;&gt; like

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that. When everyone's insured, the prices go up because everyone
knows

&gt;&gt;&gt; that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;insurance companies have the money to pay. They don't care that their

&gt;&gt;&gt; price

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;increases increase everyone's insurance. It's similar with
healthcare.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't find an argument from me on any of this. As I've already
said, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; insurance companies are at the root of the problem along with the
lawyers
&gt;&gt;&gt; who insist that we have to be protected from ourselves. I'm vehemently
&gt;&gt;&gt; opposed to things like seat belt laws and the war on drugs. I believe
in
&gt;&gt;&gt; personal freedom so long as it doesn't hurt others in the community.
Does
&gt;&gt;&gt; this make me a liberal or a libertarian?

&gt;&gt; LIBERTARIAN. I HATE it when people can't tell the difference!

&gt; Almost as much as I hate people who've been brainwashed
&gt; into believing the word liberal means the exact opposite of
&gt; what it actually means.

"/> The problem with the word liberal is that nut jobs like you identify with
it. People that are so out of touch with reality that they think they can
just pull numbers and statements portrayed as facts out of thin air and
believe it so much that they get their panties in a bunch when they are
called on it. Some of them even put the people intelligent enough to hand
them their hat on their block lists.

That's why the word has such a negative connotation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Michelle

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The disconnect I find in most conservative thinking is that
everything has a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right to life until it's born. Then nothing has a right to live
unless it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can earn the minimum wage and somehow pay for its own healthcare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know friend, it occurs to me that you folks do understand what
is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;going on and that most abortion (Birth Control) occurs in the
welfare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;state, that if you condone killing the babies, your welfare will
spread
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;further. But wait a min. Every time you kill one, ooops, there
went a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;possible Liberal vote. You guys need to take another look. You
could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be killing off your party, one abortion at a time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There go the hot buttons again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you were a woman, would abortion be your preferred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;method of birth control?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It must get old, living in such a tiny box. I pity you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick, you seem to be pre-occupied with buttons and boxes. What's
wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with facing the subject at hand? You know the major parties stance on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the subject, deal with that. Most Democrats feel it is ok to kill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unborn babies, most Republicans do not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I mean by tiny boxes. The world really is
&gt;&gt;&gt; a black or white affair with you, isn't it?

&gt;&gt; Yea Rick, I tend to like things tied down, no wishy washy BS, floppin in
&gt;&gt; the wind sorta thing. Makes for a more tidy way of life for me and I
&gt;&gt; need that. You feel free to play in the grey.

&gt; The world is 6 billion shades of gray. Reducing it to black
&gt; and white is usually a result of old age, a closed mind or both.

"/> There are really very few issues that have any gray area whatsoever. There
are issues that people don't want to think hard enough about to categorize
them in either black or white, but the truth is that people who see gray
areas in everything are like leaves in the breeze. If you can't make
difficult decisions, you belong as far away from politics as possible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; That anyone could
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually be both against abortion and also against government
&gt;&gt;&gt; intrusion on the issue doesn't even enter your pea brain as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility, does it?

&gt;&gt; So You are against abortion, but you just don't want the Government to
&gt;&gt; be likewise? I guess that's grey alright.

&gt; Yup. A simple bumper sticker states my position:
&gt;&quot;Against Abortion? Don't Have One.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; The way to deal with unwanted prenancy is through education
&gt;&gt;&gt; and availability of alternate birth control methods. We've
&gt;&gt;&gt; already tried dealing with it by making government some kind
&gt;&gt;&gt; of totalitarian Big Brother.

&gt;&gt; The problem just could be that you liberals have given us 'freedom to
&gt;&gt; ----------fill in the blank until we are beyond help. Take speech for
&gt;&gt; example. Kids enjoy free speech to the point of total obsenity. I have
&gt;&gt; to make sure I go to movies in the daytime when kids are in school so I
&gt;&gt; don't have to subject my family to the filth they spew in public as I
&gt;&gt; try to get my tickets and inside. BUT the Liberal courts keep on
&gt;&gt; throwing more freedoms at us until we are a country of filth and
&gt;&gt; loosers. Just my opinion, you may like all that crap.

&gt; Ok, we get it. You're a fascist. Well, if you don't like the
&gt; First Amendment, take your family and go live in Iran for
&gt; a few years. Then, when someone utters an obscenity in
&gt; public, you can watch in glee while government thugs
&gt; come and haul him off to prison. And if they catch your
&gt; son masturbating they'll hack off his hands. Sounds like
&gt; heaven to you, doesn't it?

&gt; How many people, Democrat or otherwise

&gt;&gt; I just love them.&quot; Get real.

&gt; Actually wasn't it Planned Parenthood or some other NOW group that had

&gt;&gt; The way to deal with unwanted prenancy is through education

&gt;&gt; alley coat hanger abortions. That's the real goal here, isn't it?

&gt; You make it sound as ifthey were prevalent. It's not even necessary for
&gt; an abortion anymore- you have so many methods of birth control-

&gt; 1. Abstinence (not &quot;taught&quot; i.e. hot to say NO or I'll wait, or let's
do
&gt; something else- in your public schools)
&gt; 2. Pill
&gt; 3. Condoms
&gt; 4. Sponge
&gt; 5. Spermicide
&gt; 6. IUD
&gt; 7. A shot in the arm THAT LASTS FOR 3 MONTHS- for the too busy to take
a
&gt; pill daily and stupid crowd

"/> You forgot my favorite. We should advance oral sex. If that's all you do,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; You want me to face the issue at hand? Ok. First of all, in
&gt;&gt; my opinion men have no business imposing their will on women,

&gt; Their will was not imposed upon- they knew there was consequences before
&gt; they had sex unless it was rape, in which case charges would be leveled.
&gt; Women needto be treated as intelligent people able to understand what they
&gt; do has repercussions. If you get drunk and drive and kill someone, there
is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's the problem. Technically you are just a blob of cells.
That
&gt;&gt; court
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;had no right to determine whether or not it was a blob of cells
or a
&gt;&gt; person.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. For the first several weeks a fertilized egg is just a
&gt;&gt;&gt; blob of cells. Trying to assign rights to it is beyond ridiculous.

&gt;&gt; So then you disagree with the laws that protect an endangered species
&gt;&gt; eggs?

&gt; If the eggs were inside a woman's body, and unable to survive
&gt; outside her body, she'd still have a constitutional right to decide
&gt; what to do with them. Get it?

"/> In other words, he agrees that a fertalized egg deserves life, just not if
it's inside a woman's body. Then it should be treated as a tumor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Either a baby is a human being at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conception, or it is not. If it is, then it is murder. The
criminal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;courts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it right by making it a crime of murder to kill a woman's
unborn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;child
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without her consent. They just need to go the rest of the way
and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consider
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it a crime to murder that child with her consent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a federal law protecting an endangered bird's eggs- you
get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;prosecuted by the FEDERAL government. Apparentlyit's pretty clear

life in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those eggsnot just some growth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's not the point. Involuntary servitude was outlawed in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;United States years ago. You might also try reading the Roe v. Wade
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decision sometime. The decision was all about privacy rights, not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fetal viability (or lack thereof).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So if it is a private killing it is ok?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Read the decision. It does talk quite a bit about fetal
&gt;&gt;&gt; viability. In fact that's the only reason why the state
&gt;&gt;&gt; was allowed to put restrictions on abortions during
&gt;&gt;&gt; the last trimester of pregnancy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But at least in the first two trimesters, it was correctly
&gt;&gt;&gt; ruled that the rights of women to decide whether and
&gt;&gt;&gt; when to bring their pregnancies to term preclude any
&gt;&gt;&gt; imagined rights of their fetuses, unless the fetus is
&gt;&gt;&gt; viable. Right-wingnuts have been hacking away at this
&gt;&gt;&gt; decision ever since it was made, trying to assign
&gt;&gt;&gt; personhood rights to blobs of cells.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt; Okay, so is it a baby a day before full term? A week before full
&gt;&gt; term? A MONTH before full term? Give me exactly the time and the date
&gt;&gt; that it becomes a human being, since you';ve decided that.

&gt; In most cases viability of a fetus occurs sometime during
&gt; the third trimester. Hence the decision in Roe v. Wade.

"/> But there are still very many cases of a baby living after being born
premature by several months. So, the answer still has not been given. How
can you tell which baby is able to live outside the body, and which can't?
Where is that line between it being a baby and it being a blob of cells.
Since there is clearly no clear line, there can clearly be no definitive
answer and no set point at which, in your opinion, a blob becomes a baby.

You're going to beat this horse until it's hamburger, and you're never going
to be right. Your position is so unsupportable it's a wonder why you even
attempted to argue it in the first place. Then again, you have proven that
you're not very bright. I thought you had to wait until you were 16 in most
states to drop out of school. Never heard of it being done in the first
grade.

&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, did the stuff work? When the neurologist wanted my MIL to try
&gt;&gt;&gt; Aricept to see if it would help her memory problems, she opened up a
&gt;&gt;&gt; cabinet which must have had hundreds of cards of the stuff.

&gt;&gt; It worked for almost a year, but then I started getting unpleasant side

but
&gt;&gt; no side effects. Now I'm not taking anything, and haven't for almost 2

something
&gt;&gt; better now.

&gt; Have you tried Nexium yet? BTW, you can get OTC versions of several of

&gt;&gt;&gt;What the extremists keep forgetting is you have your right to free
&gt;&gt;&gt;speech, life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness. Your freedoms
&gt;&gt;&gt;should not be hampered by others exercising theirs. Just because some
&gt;&gt;&gt;punk kid has the right to say something, doesn't mean you don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;the right not to want to listen to it.

&gt;&gt; Amazing. And when the EXACT SAME argument is used against
&gt;&gt; being forced to hear, for example, &quot;under God&quot; during the Pledge
&gt;&gt; of Allegiance, some people throw hissy fits of the first degree. Do
&gt;&gt; you see the problem here? One person's prayer is another's
&gt;&gt; obscenity, and if our laws start trying to dictate whose opinion is
&gt;&gt; more important than it's a very, very short trip to fascism.

&gt; Sorry Rick, but what I see more than anything is someones need for a
&gt; cause. Those that asked for the Under God thing were here first.

&gt; And my do you love that extreamist word fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think what you have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;talking about is breaches of decorum. Our society no longer has any
&gt;&gt;&gt;class or respect, and is slowing losing its morals as well.

&gt;&gt; People have been claiming that for 200 years now. If you compare
&gt;&gt; society today to 100 years ago, we're better off in almost every
&gt;&gt; respect (crime rates, standard of living, life expectancy, etc etc).
&gt;&gt; Did you know life expectancy for an average American born in
&gt;&gt; 1900 was only 50 years? And as for moral decay, again we're
&gt;&gt; much better off now than in the past. Go back far enough and
&gt;&gt; women had no right to vote, African-Americans were legally
&gt;&gt; considered to be chattel, etc.

&gt; You don't get it Rick. Slavery is wrong, was corrected. Women not
&gt; voting was maybe wrong (just kidding), was corrected. You continue to
&gt; skirt the issue of indecency in public. The filth in Public. We may be
&gt; better off where you live, but disrespect for others, is rampant and
&gt; wrong under any circumstance.

&gt; they responded by always acting like ladys.

"/> I don't believe I'm going to say this, but Rick is right. We cannot just
treat our freedom as though it's ours to decide for someone else. You
pointed out the difference between the way things were and the way they are,
and it has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with the
changing morality of the world. The phrase &quot;chivalry is dead&quot; is not far
off. We have become the way we are not because the government doesn't crack
down on us hard enough, we have come to be this way because we all have a
laizes fair attitude about life, and we think that somebody else, mainly
government, is going to solve our problems for us. Men have been taught to
not be confrontational, and women taught to be extremely confrontational.
We are taught tolerance to such an extreme level that the slightest bit of
intolerance is looked at as evil and vulgar. The funny thing about that is
that when we are tolerant, the people that get what they want are those most
intolerant.

We must take great care when giving up our freedoms. Those athiests that
would have the word God stricken from the dictionary are intolerant of
other's freedom to speak it, or their freedom to let others know they
believe in a god. Those that can't stand the idea of homosexuals engaging
in sexual acts would give up your freedom to do whatever you would like to
in the privacy of your own house and bedroom. There are even people that
would like to prevent you from having sex in almost every position other
than their preferred position. There are people that would have your rights
as a parent taken away because they don't like how you choose to educate
them.

When our fundamental human rights are challenged, we should not tolerate it.
People should not say that just because it doesn't cause them any hardship
that it is okay. The police should be kept from being able to just search
whenever they please. It's not a matter of what you have to hide, it's a
matter of what business do they have, and what might incriminate you without
your knowledge.

A fundamental change in our belief system needs to happen in order to change
what you're talking about. In order for that change to happen, we need to
be less tolerant and more prone to act in the interests of ourselves and our
children.

"/> You are basically asking if you have the right not to be offended. I would
have to say no. There's no right in the Constitution of the United States,
or in any state constitution that would guarantee you the right not to be
offended. In fact, the first amendment was put in place precisely to
protect the right of others to offend you with their speech. If we were
able to prevent speech solely because it is offensive, I would have been in
jail long ago.

I think that those who never speak to more than just their friends often
don't understand how easily seemingly benign things offend some people. I
speak to large groups regularly, and I manage to offend at least one person
every time. People have written whole newspaper articles about how
offensive my words and point of view are. I am accutely aware of the fact
that I may not be able to speak for the rights of children and families in
some countries, and in even more I might be subject to censorship to a
degree that my message would fade.

I think I have proven my level of liberalism. I am not a fan of liberalism
as it is known today. I am a staunch supporter of liberty though, and I
also support the liberty of others to offend me. If I don't like it I can
stand up against their abhorrent behavior and show them that it is not okay
to treat people disrespectfully. If enough people do it, it won't be long
before it is well in the background.

&gt; However, common decency would dictate that when you identified to the

&gt; the would modify their behavior out of common courtesy. Instead the
&gt; normal response is &quot;Screw you old man&quot;.

"/> True, but that's because we have moved away from anything common. It's
faddish to buck the trend and be as abnormal as you want to be. What I am
saying is to attack the cause and not the effect. The bad behavior is the
effect of modern society's belief system, and that belief system is
generated by people's attitudes. Where we now live in a society of anything
goes, that means that our kids learn that same belief. Each person that has
a problem with it needs to do something. If everyone who disliked the way a
person acted told them they would soon learn to act differently.

Bad behavior is continued because the person behaving that way gets the
response they desire, and usually that's fear, or some sort of personal
gratification in ignoring socially acceptable behavior.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And my do you love that extreamist word fascism.

"/> Nothing extremist about it. The rise of the radical right, who
have successfully passed themselves off as &quot;conservatives&quot;
are clearly one of the most imminent threats to American
freedom in our nation's history. Infinitely more dangerous
than a bunch of foreign idiots with box cutters.

Case in point: our current President, who sat with his thumb
up his ass while 30% of the manufacturing jobs in America's
industrial heartland were shipped overseas, and what did he
do instead? Well, he was primarily concerned with pretending
to be a war hero, and keeping the American people fearful
and submissive. Three friggin' years later and the man STILL
can't manage to speak a single paragraph without shoving the
words &quot;terrorists&quot; or &quot;evildoers&quot; or &quot;threat&quot; or &quot;homeland
security&quot; down our throats.

And what else did he focus on? Mounting a campaign of
misinformation regarding certain medical procedures (see:
http://www.libchrist.com/other/abortion/partialbirth.html )
and trying to have these procedures outlawed. And also
mounting a campaign to deny one of the most fundamental
of all human rights to some 25+ million Americans. If this
doesn't smack of fascism, NOTHING ELSE DOES.

As for our Congress, just a month ago the radical right was
able to push for and garner 48 votes in the U.S. Senate to
use our Constitution, not for its intended purpose which is to
limit government power and expand individual civil liberties,
but as a weapon to explicitly deny some 25 million Americans
one of the most basic of all human rights. If this doesn't
smack of fascism, NOTHING ELSE DOES.

As with the 1950's, history will prove who were the true
American patriots during this current decade, and who were
the anti-American, fascist idiots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think I have proven my level of liberalism. I am not a fan of
&gt;&gt;liberalism
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as it is known today. I am a staunch supporter of liberty though, and
I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;also support the liberty of others to offend me. If I don't like it I
&gt;&gt;can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stand up against their abhorrent behavior and show them that it is not
&gt;&gt;okay
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to treat people disrespectfully. If enough people do it, it won't be
&gt;&gt;long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;before it is well in the background.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, common decency would dictate that when you identified to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; offender that they were being offensive, especially in public, that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the would modify their behavior out of common courtesy. Instead the
&gt;&gt;&gt; normal response is &quot;Screw you old man&quot;.

&gt;&gt;True, but that's because we have moved away from anything common. It's
&gt;&gt;faddish to buck the trend and be as abnormal as you want to be. What I
am
&gt;&gt;saying is to attack the cause and not the effect. The bad behavior is
the
&gt;&gt;effect of modern society's belief system, and that belief system is
&gt;&gt;generated by people's attitudes. Where we now live in a society of
anything
&gt;&gt;goes, that means that our kids learn that same belief. Each person that
has
&gt;&gt;a problem with it needs to do something. If everyone who disliked the
way a
&gt;&gt;person acted told them they would soon learn to act differently.

&gt;&gt;Bad behavior is continued because the person behaving that way gets the
&gt;&gt;response they desire, and usually that's fear, or some sort of personal
&gt;&gt;gratification in ignoring socially acceptable behavior.

&gt; Actually all of that was part of my original thesis on the subject.
&gt; The only problem with your approach is that there is also no longer
&gt; any respect for authority. I chalk part of that up to two things.

&gt; The first being our society of &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. The second being the
&gt; dissolution of the draft. With fewer &amp; fewer young men not serving in
&gt; the Military they haven't learned some very important concepts that
&gt; are taught in basic training about conforming to a norm. Other things
&gt; such as respect for authority, teamwork, and acceptable group behavior
&gt; are also lost.

"/> Not serving in the military has nothing to do with it. The people most
likely to act like asses are that way from the time they are children. Even
7-9 year old kids have no respect for anyone. (Man, I feel like Rodney
Dangerfield.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Every year our society has become more free and our citizens less able

"/> What society are you living in? Every year our society is getting less and
less free. The fact that people are more and more free to do some things
lends nothing to the fact that every year you have a more and more difficult
time not breaking at least one law a day.

&gt; to adapt to having those freedoms. I just don't think that telling
&gt; little Johnny Potty Mouth he is not acting in an appropriate manner in
&gt; public is going to cut it. Matter of fact he just might pull out his
&gt; shiv and cut you. Or even worse his 9 and cap your ass. After all
&gt; both of those actions are glorified in much of the music they listen
&gt; to today. Which of course is protected speech as well.

"/> Well, I'm not one that thinks that merely telling someone they aren't acting
in an appropriate manner is what should happen. They should be publicly
humiliated. When everyone is against them, which takes education, they
won't have even their friends to back them up in their actions.

&gt; You are basically asking if you have the right not to be offended. I
would
&gt; have to say no. There's no right in the Constitution of the United
States,
&gt; or in any state constitution that would guarantee you the right not to
be
&gt; offended. In fact, the first amendment was put in place precisely to
&gt; protect the right of others to offend you with their speech. If we were
&gt; able to prevent speech solely because it is offensive, I would have been
in
&gt; jail long ago.

I don't know if it's your &quot;right&quot; to not be offended, but there is an
appropos that is applied to free speech to time and place. You may not say
or joke about a bomb on an airplane. There are obscenities laws also which
some speech,clothing, and gestures are aimed at.

&gt;
&gt; I think that those who never speak to more than just their friends often
&gt; don't understand how easily seemingly benign things offend some people.
I
&gt; speak to large groups regularly, and I manage to offend at least one
person
&gt; every time. People have written whole newspaper articles about how
&gt; offensive my words and point of view are. I am accutely aware of the
fact
&gt; that I may not be able to speak for the rights of children and families
in
&gt; some countries, and in even more I might be subject to censorship to a
&gt; degree that my message would fade.
&gt;
&gt; I think I have proven my level of liberalism. I am not a fan of
liberalism
&gt; as it is known today. I am a staunch supporter of liberty though, and I
&gt; also support the liberty of others to offend me. If I don't like it I

&gt; I don't think so. Bad behavior is a request for recognition and the shock
&gt; value assures that the offender will strike pay dirt. Complaining about
such
&gt; behavior reinforces it.

"/> Yeah, that's why it gets so reinforced in a society where there is no such
thing as a person that stands for anything. We let ourselves get walked all
over, and believe me, you can get almost any idiot to stop what they are
doing if you're persistent enough.

I had a guy heckling me for about half an hour while I was giving a speech
once. Nobody thought it was really funny, and at first I tried to ignore
it. After a while, I turned my speech around right then and used the guy as
an example about what we should not do to our children. I called him up on
stage and pointed out the neandrathol features, and the obviously low
intelligence level. The whole crowd was laughing at him, and after I
finished my speech about how we needed to educate the ugly that being rude
is only going to make your life socially miserable. Once he got off the
stage, he took off. He tried to sneak out, but I caught him and made fun of
him some more. Needless to say, he was probably never more embarassed in
his life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;obscenity, and if our laws start trying to dictate whose opinion is

&gt;&gt;Sorry Rick, but what I see more than anything is someones need for a

&gt;&gt;And my do you love that extreamist word fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think what you have been

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;class or respect, and is slowing losing its morals as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;People have been claiming that for 200 years now. If you compare
&gt;&gt;&gt;society today to 100 years ago, we're better off in almost every
&gt;&gt;&gt;respect (crime rates, standard of living, life expectancy, etc etc).
&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you know life expectancy for an average American born in
&gt;&gt;&gt;1900 was only 50 years? And as for moral decay, again we're
&gt;&gt;&gt;much better off now than in the past. Go back far enough and
&gt;&gt;&gt;women had no right to vote, African-Americans were legally
&gt;&gt;&gt;considered to be chattel, etc.

&gt;&gt;You don't get it Rick. Slavery is wrong, was corrected. Women not

&gt;&gt;skirt the issue of indecency in public. The filth in Public. We may be

&gt;&gt;maybe you like the way it is now, fine, I hate it.

&gt; I don't believe I'm going to say this, but Rick is right. We cannot just
&gt; treat our freedom as though it's ours to decide for someone else. You
&gt; pointed out the difference between the way things were and the way they are,
&gt; and it has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with the
&gt; changing morality of the world. The phrase &quot;chivalry is dead&quot; is not far
&gt; off. We have become the way we are not because the government doesn't crack
&gt; down on us hard enough, we have come to be this way because we all have a
&gt; laizes fair attitude about life, and we think that somebody else, mainly
&gt; government, is going to solve our problems for us. Men have been taught to
&gt; not be confrontational, and women taught to be extremely confrontational.
&gt; We are taught tolerance to such an extreme level that the slightest bit of
&gt; intolerance is looked at as evil and vulgar. The funny thing about that is
&gt; that when we are tolerant, the people that get what they want are those most
&gt; intolerant.

&gt; We must take great care when giving up our freedoms. Those athiests that
&gt; would have the word God stricken from the dictionary are intolerant of
&gt; other's freedom to speak it, or their freedom to let others know they
&gt; believe in a god. Those that can't stand the idea of homosexuals engaging
&gt; in sexual acts would give up your freedom to do whatever you would like to
&gt; in the privacy of your own house and bedroom. There are even people that
&gt; would like to prevent you from having sex in almost every position other
&gt; than their preferred position. There are people that would have your rights
&gt; as a parent taken away because they don't like how you choose to educate
&gt; them.

&gt; When our fundamental human rights are challenged, we should not tolerate it.
&gt; People should not say that just because it doesn't cause them any hardship
&gt; that it is okay. The police should be kept from being able to just search
&gt; whenever they please. It's not a matter of what you have to hide, it's a
&gt; matter of what business do they have, and what might incriminate you without
&gt; your knowledge.

&gt; A fundamental change in our belief system needs to happen in order to change
&gt; what you're talking about. In order for that change to happen, we need to
&gt; be less tolerant and more prone to act in the interests of ourselves and our
&gt; children.

"/> Timm, when the courts have determined you can not discipline kids at
school, the teacher lost control. That soon became, you can't
discipline your kids at home, the parents lost control. Now you have
the begining of a runnaway culture that respects nothing or no one.

Kids no longer cared about education, and those that did were in the
middle of classes of out of control kids where the learning process had
come to a screeching halt.

Did that ever happen before, like when we were kids, sure, but on such a
small scale it was quickly stopped. No court was sitting there just
waiting to give the violators carte blanch free run knowing they were
immune from censure. Multiply that by 1000 and you have our current
scociety.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok, we get it. You're a fascist. Well, if you don't like the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First Amendment, take your family and go live in Iran for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a few years. Then, when someone utters an obscenity in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;public, you can watch in glee while government thugs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;come and haul him off to prison. And if they catch your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;son masturbating they'll hack off his hands. Sounds like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;heaven to you, doesn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick Rick, where is your sense of grey here. I have no problem with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the First Amendment, only the extent to which our illustrious Courts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have figured to apply it to. Amazing to me how much the ACLU can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;package into that FREEDOM. Pick any other and apply the same sentiments

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;from me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And By the WAY, do you always jump to the furtherest extreams in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;everything you do or think or say? I say, Man that dog pissed me off,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and from that you would come back suggesting I hate dogs, want to cut
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off their legs, bash their teeth in and kick em when they tried to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up. Just another one of your freedoms, but like others, gone haywire.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And where else would an extremist think other then the extremes? They
&gt;&gt;&gt;figure if you always act based on the extreme you should by default
&gt;&gt;&gt;catch the people in the middle. Personally I am with you that we have
&gt;&gt;&gt;become way to lenient in our interpretations of what our forefathers
&gt;&gt;&gt;were thing of when they laid down the framework for this country.
&gt;&gt;&gt;What the extremists keep forgetting is you have your right to free
&gt;&gt;&gt;speech, life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness. Your freedoms
&gt;&gt;&gt;should not be hampered by others exercising theirs. Just because some
&gt;&gt;&gt;punk kid has the right to say something, doesn't mean you don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;the right not to want to listen to it. I think what you have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;talking about is breaches of decorum. Our society no longer has any
&gt;&gt;&gt;class or respect, and is slowing losing its morals as well.

&gt;&gt;Exactly right on all accounts. The problem
&gt;&gt;is so deep now we may never fix it.

&gt; Its never been 'fixed'.

&gt; Even Jefferson got up to some of it.

&gt;&gt;Parents have long since even tried to teach any morals to kids,

&gt; Bullshit. Plenty still do.

"/> You are of course right, Rod. I, like my liberal friends get to
carrying a pretty wide brush at times. But unless they also send their
kids to pvt schools, the kids will still have to try for an education in
pretty tuff conditions. I am not suggesting it is this way everywhere,
but think NY, LA, Chi.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; And it continues to work only with a subset of the kids.

&gt;&gt;hell, some never did and many parents were such bad examples
&gt;&gt;it is no wonder we have the cess pool scociety we live in.

&gt; The ancient greeks used to sit around in their togas
&gt; or whatever they wore raving on the same way.

&gt;&gt;But we DO have our Free Speech.

&gt;&gt;What I am asking is this. Do I have any freedoms not to have to
&gt;&gt;hear that trash, without the usual Liberal suggestion, STAY HOME,?

&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rick, would spitting on you in PUBLIC be one of my freedoms? I don't do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those things, but I would like to know what you believe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; People have been claiming that for 200 years now. If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compare society today to 100 years ago, we're better off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in almost every respect (crime rates, standard of living, life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expectancy, etc etc). Did you know life expectancy for an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; average American born in 1900 was only 50 years? And as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for moral decay, again we're much better off now than in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; past. Go back far enough and women had no right to vote,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; African-Americans were legally considered to be chattel, etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You don't get it Rick. Slavery is wrong, was corrected. Women

&gt;&gt;&gt; We may be better off where you live, but disrespect for others,

&gt;&gt; I don't believe I'm going to say this, but Rick is right. We cannot just
&gt;&gt; treat our freedom as though it's ours to decide for someone else. You
&gt;&gt; pointed out the difference between the way things were and the way they are,
&gt;&gt; and it has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with the
&gt;&gt; changing morality of the world. The phrase &quot;chivalry is dead&quot; is not far
&gt;&gt; off. We have become the way we are not because the government doesn't crack
&gt;&gt; down on us hard enough, we have come to be this way because we all have a
&gt;&gt; laizes fair attitude about life, and we think that somebody else, mainly
&gt;&gt; government, is going to solve our problems for us. Men have been taught to
&gt;&gt; not be confrontational, and women taught to be extremely confrontational.
&gt;&gt; We are taught tolerance to such an extreme level that the slightest bit of
&gt;&gt; intolerance is looked at as evil and vulgar. The funny thing about that is
&gt;&gt; that when we are tolerant, the people that get what they want are those most
&gt;&gt; intolerant.

&gt;&gt; We must take great care when giving up our freedoms. Those athiests that
&gt;&gt; would have the word God stricken from the dictionary are intolerant of
&gt;&gt; other's freedom to speak it, or their freedom to let others know they
&gt;&gt; believe in a god. Those that can't stand the idea of homosexuals engaging
&gt;&gt; in sexual acts would give up your freedom to do whatever you would like to
&gt;&gt; in the privacy of your own house and bedroom. There are even people that
&gt;&gt; would like to prevent you from having sex in almost every position other
&gt;&gt; than their preferred position. There are people that would have your rights
&gt;&gt; as a parent taken away because they don't like how you choose to educate
&gt;&gt; them.

&gt;&gt; When our fundamental human rights are challenged, we should not tolerate it.
&gt;&gt; People should not say that just because it doesn't cause them any hardship
&gt;&gt; that it is okay. The police should be kept from being able to just search
&gt;&gt; whenever they please. It's not a matter of what you have to hide, it's a
&gt;&gt; matter of what business do they have, and what might incriminate you without
&gt;&gt; your knowledge.

&gt;&gt; A fundamental change in our belief system needs to happen in order to change
&gt;&gt; what you're talking about. In order for that change to happen, we need to
&gt;&gt; be less tolerant and more prone to act in the interests of ourselves and our

&gt;&gt; children.

&gt; Timm, when the courts have determined you can not discipline kids at
&gt; school, the teacher lost control. That soon became, you can't
&gt; discipline your kids at home, the parents lost control. Now you have
&gt; the begining of a runnaway culture that respects nothing or no one.

"/> None of that is correct. Your children can be disciplined at school, and
they can be disciplined at home, it has just become so unacceptable to
strike a child that people have taken it to mean that they can only tell
little Johnny &quot;Don't do that.&quot; I used to get beaten pretty badly when I was
a kid. I had chairs broken over my head and steel bed frame parts bent over
my back. I was abused, and it took some real thought in order to decide how
to bring up children in an environment without that, but I have rarely had
to strike my children, and when I have it was a short whack on the butt when
they were little. If I were to start all over again, I think I could have
done it without spanking at all. It's been years since I've spanked, and
they still know not to get caught disrespecting people when I'm around.

Today, we have a society where a large portion of our children are brought
up by their mothers, and dad is almost totally impotent as far as enforcing
any rules. The majority of single mothers are not effective
disciplinarians. They are nurturers, and have difficulty being the bad guy,
and when they are, it's often out of anger which makes for bad discipline.
My mother was the one that attacked me with furniture. My dad never lifted
a finger against me, yet I was more scared of him than my mother.

I could go on for hours about this, but suffice it to say, there is a way to
lower the amount of families where there is little discipline. That is to
have equal physical custody arrangements when divorce happens. 90% of
research suggests that this is an arrangement that most closely approximates
the environment children have with intact families, and also brings their

&gt; Kids no longer cared about education, and those that did were in the
&gt; middle of classes of out of control kids where the learning process had
&gt; come to a screeching halt.

&gt; Did that ever happen before, like when we were kids, sure, but on such a
&gt; small scale it was quickly stopped. No court was sitting there just
&gt; waiting to give the violators carte blanch free run knowing they were
&gt; immune from censure. Multiply that by 1000 and you have our current
&gt; scociety.

"/> It's easy to blame the courts, but the courts are only a small part of an
overwhelmingly societal problem. Kid's fearlessness of discipline is only a
result of the fact that discipline is not sufficiently adverse to their
ideas of fun to make acting badly undesirable. That is not the fault of the
courts. I know of no court that will lock a parent up for spanking a child
where they don't leave bruises. Well, I shouldn't say that because I do,
but I know of no court that does regularly with good information.

The ONLY way to stop a person from behavior that is intolerable is to make
it so that either the consequences are so bad they choose not to do it, or
that they stop getting what they want. Once they stop getting what they
want on a consistent basis they generally stop the behavior.

&gt;&gt; You are basically asking if you have the right not to be offended. I
&gt; would
&gt;&gt; have to say no. There's no right in the Constitution of the United
&gt; States,
&gt;&gt; or in any state constitution that would guarantee you the right not to
&gt; be
&gt;&gt; offended. In fact, the first amendment was put in place precisely to
&gt;&gt; protect the right of others to offend you with their speech. If we
were
&gt;&gt; able to prevent speech solely because it is offensive, I would have
been
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; jail long ago.

&gt; I don't know if it's your &quot;right&quot; to not be offended, but there is an
&gt; appropos that is applied to free speech to time and place. You may not
say
&gt; or joke about a bomb on an airplane. There are obscenities laws also
which
&gt; some speech,clothing, and gestures are aimed at.

"/> We do not have true freedom of anything, we only have freedom to the extent
that the state does not have an interest that compels them to infringe on
that freedom. That means that if by your exercise of your freedom you do
something that &quot;shocks the oncious,&quot; you can have your freedom infringed.
Causing a panic can cause physical injury or death to other people. Your
words that cause a panic compel the state to pass laws against it in order
to protect life, which is our most precious of all rights.

Now, a state cannot enact a law legally that infringes on a freedom without
a compelling interest. The fact that a person might be offended is not
enough since there is no right fundamental or otherwise that a person be
free from being offended. So, any perceived right not to be offended is
only perceived. If a right at all, it is considered secondary to the right
to say whatever you want.

Any law that would limit that right significantly would need a
constitutional amendment, and that's not going to happen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I think that those who never speak to more than just their friends
often
&gt;&gt; don't understand how easily seemingly benign things offend some
people.
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; speak to large groups regularly, and I manage to offend at least one
&gt; person
&gt;&gt; every time. People have written whole newspaper articles about how
&gt;&gt; offensive my words and point of view are. I am accutely aware of the
&gt; fact
&gt;&gt; that I may not be able to speak for the rights of children and
families
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; some countries, and in even more I might be subject to censorship to a
&gt;&gt; degree that my message would fade.

&gt;&gt; I think I have proven my level of liberalism. I am not a fan of
&gt; liberalism
&gt;&gt; as it is known today. I am a staunch supporter of liberty though, and
I
&gt;&gt; also support the liberty of others to offend me. If I don't like it I
&gt; can
&gt;&gt; stand up against their abhorrent behavior and show them that it is not
&gt; okay
&gt;&gt; to treat people disrespectfully. If enough people do it, it won't be
&gt; long
&gt;&gt; before it is well in the background.

&gt; No chance you could be a liberal. Liberals like big government with

&gt; Well, that's about the only thing that's getting better about the law. Laws
&gt; have historically been written in such a manner that the average person
&gt; couldn't understand them. This isn't because they had any different meaning
&gt; when written that way, but more so that the average person would have to
&gt; hire an attorney to help them interpret the laws.

&gt; Recently though, it has been changing. Most laws are written in a more
&gt; common dialect. I'm not sure if that's because they want normal people to
&gt; understand the laws, or if that's because they are having a hard time with
&gt; these prospective attorneys that have graduated from public school.

"/> Exactly. Lawmakers are becoming more aware that laws need to be written
in a way that can be understood by reasonably intelligent people if
those laws are to be effective. This is a realization that did not come
quickly or easily.

Several years ago, I served as a technical (computer) advisor to a
committee that consisted of about 100 volunteers who were assembled by
the supreme court in one of the larger American states. Our task was to
look at ways that future and existing technology can be utilized to make
the administration of law and justice cheaper and more efficient.

One of the topics that came up was that legislators need to write laws
that do not require high powered legal experts to comprehend them. As
the only person on that committee who did not work in the legal
profession, after a few meetings, I was asked to be a consumer advocate,
in addition to offering my computer expertise. I spent a lot of time in
both roles, including traveling with the judge who chaired the committee
to look at technology providers to see what they could offer us.

People on this committee included law school faculty, law librarians,
lawyers, judges, and one or two people from law enforcement. After many
meetings and hours spent writing reports, we produced a long document
that was sent to the state supreme court for its review and many of the
recommendations we made were adopted. This was probably one of the more
interesting projects I have worked on and it resulted in some meaningful
reform, although considerably more work still needs to be done in order
to meet all the recommendations our committee made.

&gt;&gt;saying this, or are you just setting up straw men?

&gt; Ain't no strawman just because you haven't met one. Who do you think
&gt; removed prayer from schools? Some Nun? They couldn't even handle a
&gt; moment of silence because some kids might be praying. Who do you
&gt; think wants to have the Ten Commandments removed from the Courthouse
&gt; down South? If these people do not believe in a supreme being why are
&gt; they so offended at the acknowledgement of one by other people? Why
&gt; are they afraid of a concept that they say doesn't exist?

"/> It's not a matter of being &quot;offended&quot;. This is yet another
hot button issue of the radical right.

IN FACT, the majority of people who fight to keep church
and state separate, even to sometimes ridiculous proportions
are THEISTS, and they fight this fight for the protection of
both state AND church. In every case throughout history --
every single one -- the union of church and state has
inevitably and invariably resulted in the corruption of both.

If a judge in Alabama wants to display a religious monument
on his front lawn, no one can or is going to stop him. But the
decision of the other justices that forced him to remove it from
a government building was probably the easiest legal decision
they ever made.

If parents believe children must have the right to pray in a
classroom, that's what parochial schools are for.

&gt; Sounds like the current band of conservatives who are running things in
&gt; Washington. Government has grown huge. Government has grown intensely
&gt; more intrusive into our personal lives. Government is spending our tax
&gt; dollars like there is no tomorrow. And this IS with conservatives in
&gt; charge of things.

"/> They ALL spend too much money, the difference is how they spend it. Choosing
one over the other is like saying that you like being hit in the head better
than being hit in the stomach. Liberals are supposed to believe in
protecting civil liberties rather than giving government the control over
people's private lives, and I think that is still true.

You're right. Conservatives don't act like conservatives at all when they
get in charge. They spend more than the liberals, but what's worse is what
they spend it on. I really don't think we need another nuclear weapons
program, but we're getting one anyway. How about funding alternative energy
research so we can get out of the middle east and give power to the people?
I wouldn't expect a serious effort from either side of the aisle on this
because it steps on too many vested interests that each side depends upon
for re-election. It's all over folks. Our government's been bought and the
country's been sold to the highest bidder. Eisenhower warned us, and he was
right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And my do you love that extreamist word fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think what you have been talking about is breaches
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of decorum. Our society no longer has any class or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;respect, and is slowing losing its morals as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People have been claiming that for 200 years now. If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;compare society today to 100 years ago, we're better off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in almost every respect (crime rates, standard of living, life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expectancy, etc etc). Did you know life expectancy for an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;average American born in 1900 was only 50 years? And as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for moral decay, again we're much better off now than in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;past. Go back far enough and women had no right to vote,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;African-Americans were legally considered to be chattel, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't get it Rick. Slavery is wrong, was corrected. Women
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not voting was maybe wrong (just kidding), was corrected. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;continue to skirt the issue of indecency in public. The filth in Public.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We may be better off where you live, but disrespect for others,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is rampant and wrong under any circumstance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I grew up where women were respected and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they responded by always acting like ladys.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Most did, some didnt.

&gt;&gt;Possible, I never saw the 'didnts'.

&gt; Yeah, they were mostly in physically separated, with the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;maybe you like the way it is now, fine, I hate it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't believe I'm going to say this, but Rick is right. We cannot just
&gt;&gt;&gt;treat our freedom as though it's ours to decide for someone else. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;pointed out the difference between the way things were and the way they are,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and it has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;changing morality of the world. The phrase &quot;chivalry is dead&quot; is not far
&gt;&gt;&gt;off. We have become the way we are not because the government doesn't crack
&gt;&gt;&gt;down on us hard enough, we have come to be this way because we all have a
&gt;&gt;&gt;laizes fair attitude about life, and we think that somebody else, mainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;government, is going to solve our problems for us. Men have been taught to
&gt;&gt;&gt;not be confrontational, and women taught to be extremely confrontational.
&gt;&gt;&gt;We are taught tolerance to such an extreme level that the slightest bit of
&gt;&gt;&gt;intolerance is looked at as evil and vulgar. The funny thing about that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;that when we are tolerant, the people that get what they want are those most
&gt;&gt;&gt;intolerant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;We must take great care when giving up our freedoms. Those athiests that
&gt;&gt;&gt;would have the word God stricken from the dictionary are intolerant of
&gt;&gt;&gt;other's freedom to speak it, or their freedom to let others know they
&gt;&gt;&gt;believe in a god. Those that can't stand the idea of homosexuals engaging
&gt;&gt;&gt;in sexual acts would give up your freedom to do whatever you would like to
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the privacy of your own house and bedroom. There are even people that
&gt;&gt;&gt;would like to prevent you from having sex in almost every position other
&gt;&gt;&gt;than their preferred position. There are people that would have your rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;as a parent taken away because they don't like how you choose to educate
&gt;&gt;&gt;them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;When our fundamental human rights are challenged, we should not tolerate it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;People should not say that just because it doesn't cause them any hardship
&gt;&gt;&gt;that it is okay. The police should be kept from being able to just search
&gt;&gt;&gt;whenever they please. It's not a matter of what you have to hide, it's a
&gt;&gt;&gt;matter of what business do they have, and what might incriminate you without
&gt;&gt;&gt;your knowledge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A fundamental change in our belief system needs to happen in order to change
&gt;&gt;&gt;what you're talking about. In order for that change to happen, we need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;be less tolerant and more prone to act in the interests of ourselves and our
&gt;&gt;&gt;children.

&gt;&gt;Timm, when the courts have determined you can not discipline kids at school,

&gt; Never happened.

&gt;&gt;the teacher lost control.

&gt; Have fun explaining the teachers that havent.

&gt;&gt;That soon became, you can't discipline your kids at home,

&gt;&gt;the parents lost control.

&gt; Have fun explaining the parents that havent.

&gt;&gt;Now you have the begining of a runnaway

&gt; Nope, what we actually have is just another silly old

&gt;&gt;Kids no longer cared about education,

&gt; Bullshit. Plenty do.

&gt;&gt;and those that did were in the middle of classes of out of control
&gt;&gt;kids where the learning process had come to a screeching halt.

&gt; More mindless hyperventilation.

&gt;&gt;No court was sitting there just waiting to give the violators
&gt;&gt;carte blanch free run knowing they were immune from censure.

&gt; Have fun explaining how there are FAR
&gt; more in jail than there have ever been.

&gt;&gt;Multiply that by 1000 and you have our current scociety.

&gt; Nope, just your silly little fantasy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What the extremists keep forgetting is you have your right to free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speech, life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness. Your freedoms
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should not be hampered by others exercising theirs. Just because some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;punk kid has the right to say something, doesn't mean you don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the right not to want to listen to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Amazing. And when the EXACT SAME argument is used against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being forced to hear, for example, &quot;under God&quot; during the Pledge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of Allegiance, some people throw hissy fits of the first degree. Do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you see the problem here? One person's prayer is another's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obscenity, and if our laws start trying to dictate whose opinion is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more important than it's a very, very short trip to fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry Rick, but what I see more than anything is someones need for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cause. Those that asked for the Under God thing were here first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And my do you love that extreamist word fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think what you have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talking about is breaches of decorum. Our society no longer has any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;class or respect, and is slowing losing its morals as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People have been claiming that for 200 years now. If you compare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;society today to 100 years ago, we're better off in almost every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;respect (crime rates, standard of living, life expectancy, etc etc).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you know life expectancy for an average American born in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1900 was only 50 years? And as for moral decay, again we're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much better off now than in the past. Go back far enough and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;women had no right to vote, African-Americans were legally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;considered to be chattel, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't get it Rick. Slavery is wrong, was corrected. Women not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voting was maybe wrong (just kidding), was corrected. You continue to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;skirt the issue of indecency in public. The filth in Public. We may be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;better off where you live, but disrespect for others, is rampant and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong under any circumstance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I grew up where women were respected and they responded by always acting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like ladys. Those that didn't were shunned by their familys, friends
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and peers. They soon changed. Most men would knock the hell out of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;man showing total disrespect to others and especially to a woman. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;maybe you like the way it is now, fine, I hate it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't believe I'm going to say this, but Rick is right. We cannot just
&gt;&gt;&gt;treat our freedom as though it's ours to decide for someone else. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;pointed out the difference between the way things were and the way they are,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and it has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;changing morality of the world. The phrase &quot;chivalry is dead&quot; is not far
&gt;&gt;&gt;off. We have become the way we are not because the government doesn't crack
&gt;&gt;&gt;down on us hard enough, we have come to be this way because we all have a
&gt;&gt;&gt;laizes fair attitude about life, and we think that somebody else, mainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;government, is going to solve our problems for us. Men have been taught to
&gt;&gt;&gt;not be confrontational, and women taught to be extremely confrontational.
&gt;&gt;&gt;We are taught tolerance to such an extreme level that the slightest bit of
&gt;&gt;&gt;intolerance is looked at as evil and vulgar. The funny thing about that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;that when we are tolerant, the people that get what they want are those most
&gt;&gt;&gt;intolerant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;We must take great care when giving up our freedoms. Those athiests that
&gt;&gt;&gt;would have the word God stricken from the dictionary are intolerant of
&gt;&gt;&gt;other's freedom to speak it, or their freedom to let others know they
&gt;&gt;&gt;believe in a god. Those that can't stand the idea of homosexuals engaging
&gt;&gt;&gt;in sexual acts would give up your freedom to do whatever you would like to
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the privacy of your own house and bedroom. There are even people that
&gt;&gt;&gt;would like to prevent you from having sex in almost every position other
&gt;&gt;&gt;than their preferred position. There are people that would have your rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;as a parent taken away because they don't like how you choose to educate
&gt;&gt;&gt;them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;When our fundamental human rights are challenged, we should not tolerate it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;People should not say that just because it doesn't cause them any hardship
&gt;&gt;&gt;that it is okay. The police should be kept from being able to just search
&gt;&gt;&gt;whenever they please. It's not a matter of what you have to hide, it's a
&gt;&gt;&gt;matter of what business do they have, and what might incriminate you without
&gt;&gt;&gt;your knowledge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A fundamental change in our belief system needs to happen in order to change
&gt;&gt;&gt;what you're talking about. In order for that change to happen, we need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;be less tolerant and more prone to act in the interests of ourselves and our
&gt;&gt;&gt;children.

&gt;&gt;Timm, when the courts have determined you can not discipline kids at school,

&gt; Never happened.

&gt;&gt;the teacher lost control.

&gt; Have fun explaining the teachers that havent.

&gt;&gt;That soon became, you can't discipline your kids at home,

&gt; Never happened.

&gt;&gt;the parents lost control.

&gt; Have fun explaining the parents that havent.

&gt;&gt;Now you have the begining of a runnaway
&gt;&gt;culture that respects nothing or no one.

&gt; Nope, what we actually have is just another silly old
&gt; fart mindlessly raving on about how the end is nei.

&gt;&gt;Kids no longer cared about education,

&gt; Bullshit. Plenty do.

&gt;&gt;and those that did were in the middle of classes of out of control
&gt;&gt;kids where the learning process had come to a screeching halt.

&gt; More mindless hyperventilation.

&gt;&gt;Did that ever happen before, like when we were kids,
&gt;&gt;sure, but on such a small scale it was quickly stopped.

&gt; The 'wild west' was called wild for a reason, stupid.

&gt;&gt;No court was sitting there just waiting to give the violators
&gt;&gt;carte blanch free run knowing they were immune from censure.

&gt; Have fun explaining how there are FAR
&gt; more in jail than there have ever been.

&gt;&gt;Multiply that by 1000 and you have our current scociety.

&gt; Nope, just your silly little fantasy.

"/> Rod ol bud, you got some kinda burr under your saddle blanket or
somthing? I related life in two NM towns back in the 40s and 50s and
you have been spitting all over yourself claiming you know more about
that than I do. How come? You ever been to NM. Were you even alive in
the 40s - 50s? What seems to be your problem? You seem put out that we
had no prostitutes in either town. BTW, where do you live? Where did
you grow up? I am giving you benifit of doubt here regarding the
growing up part, cause you sure as hell don't act like it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What the extremists keep forgetting is you have your right to free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speech, life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness. Your freedoms
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should not be hampered by others exercising theirs. Just because some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;punk kid has the right to say something, doesn't mean you don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the right not to want to listen to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Amazing. And when the EXACT SAME argument is used against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being forced to hear, for example, &quot;under God&quot; during the Pledge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of Allegiance, some people throw hissy fits of the first degree. Do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you see the problem here? One person's prayer is another's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obscenity, and if our laws start trying to dictate whose opinion is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more important than it's a very, very short trip to fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry Rick, but what I see more than anything is someones need for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cause. Those that asked for the Under God thing were here first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And my do you love that extreamist word fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think what you have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talking about is breaches of decorum. Our society no longer has any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;class or respect, and is slowing losing its morals as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People have been claiming that for 200 years now. If you compare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;society today to 100 years ago, we're better off in almost every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;respect (crime rates, standard of living, life expectancy, etc etc).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you know life expectancy for an average American born in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1900 was only 50 years? And as for moral decay, again we're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much better off now than in the past. Go back far enough and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;women had no right to vote, African-Americans were legally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;considered to be chattel, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't get it Rick. Slavery is wrong, was corrected. Women not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voting was maybe wrong (just kidding), was corrected. You continue to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;skirt the issue of indecency in public. The filth in Public. We may be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;better off where you live, but disrespect for others, is rampant and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong under any circumstance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I grew up where women were respected and they responded by always acting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like ladys. Those that didn't were shunned by their familys, friends
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and peers. They soon changed. Most men would knock the hell out of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;man showing total disrespect to others and especially to a woman. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;maybe you like the way it is now, fine, I hate it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't believe I'm going to say this, but Rick is right. We cannot just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;treat our freedom as though it's ours to decide for someone else. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pointed out the difference between the way things were and the way they are,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and it has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;changing morality of the world. The phrase &quot;chivalry is dead&quot; is not far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off. We have become the way we are not because the government doesn't crack
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;down on us hard enough, we have come to be this way because we all have a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;laizes fair attitude about life, and we think that somebody else, mainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government, is going to solve our problems for us. Men have been taught to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not be confrontational, and women taught to be extremely confrontational.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We are taught tolerance to such an extreme level that the slightest bit of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;intolerance is looked at as evil and vulgar. The funny thing about that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that when we are tolerant, the people that get what they want are those most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;intolerant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We must take great care when giving up our freedoms. Those athiests that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would have the word God stricken from the dictionary are intolerant of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other's freedom to speak it, or their freedom to let others know they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe in a god. Those that can't stand the idea of homosexuals engaging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in sexual acts would give up your freedom to do whatever you would like to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the privacy of your own house and bedroom. There are even people that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would like to prevent you from having sex in almost every position other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than their preferred position. There are people that would have your rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as a parent taken away because they don't like how you choose to educate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When our fundamental human rights are challenged, we should not tolerate it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People should not say that just because it doesn't cause them any hardship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that it is okay. The police should be kept from being able to just search
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whenever they please. It's not a matter of what you have to hide, it's a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;matter of what business do they have, and what might incriminate you without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your knowledge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A fundamental change in our belief system needs to happen in order to change
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what you're talking about. In order for that change to happen, we need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be less tolerant and more prone to act in the interests of ourselves and our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;children.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Timm, when the courts have determined you can not discipline kids at school,

&gt;&gt; Never happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;the teacher lost control.

&gt;&gt; Have fun explaining the teachers that havent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That soon became, you can't discipline your kids at home,

&gt;&gt; Never happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;the parents lost control.

&gt;&gt; Have fun explaining the parents that havent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now you have the begining of a runnaway
&gt;&gt;&gt;culture that respects nothing or no one.

&gt;&gt; Nope, what we actually have is just another silly old
&gt;&gt; fart mindlessly raving on about how the end is nei.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Kids no longer cared about education,

&gt;&gt; Bullshit. Plenty do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and those that did were in the middle of classes of out of control
&gt;&gt;&gt;kids where the learning process had come to a screeching halt.

&gt;&gt; More mindless hyperventilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Did that ever happen before, like when we were kids,
&gt;&gt;&gt;sure, but on such a small scale it was quickly stopped.

&gt;&gt; The 'wild west' was called wild for a reason, stupid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No court was sitting there just waiting to give the violators
&gt;&gt;&gt;carte blanch free run knowing they were immune from censure.

&gt;&gt; Have fun explaining how there are FAR
&gt;&gt; more in jail than there have ever been.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Multiply that by 1000 and you have our current scociety.

&gt;&gt; Nope, just your silly little fantasy.

have the option of voting corrupt representatives out of office
every few years. It's wealth and power that corrupts, religion
doesn't have much to do with it. In fact it usually makes the
problem worse not better. The most corrupt governments on

most any Islamic country (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria etc) for

&gt;&gt;&gt; OK, that's clear, I'll forget the rest. I wonder how closely this

&gt;&gt;&gt; complexity of the measures/concepts we're required to vote on. I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; surprised that the difference isn't larger.

&gt;&gt; Well, that's about the only thing that's getting better about the law.
Laws
&gt;&gt; have historically been written in such a manner that the average person
&gt;&gt; couldn't understand them. This isn't because they had any different
meaning
&gt;&gt; when written that way, but more so that the average person would have to
&gt;&gt; hire an attorney to help them interpret the laws.

&gt;&gt; Recently though, it has been changing. Most laws are written in a more
&gt;&gt; common dialect. I'm not sure if that's because they want normal people
to
&gt;&gt; understand the laws, or if that's because they are having a hard time
with
&gt;&gt; these prospective attorneys that have graduated from public school.

&gt; Exactly. Lawmakers are becoming more aware that laws need to be written
&gt; in a way that can be understood by reasonably intelligent people if
&gt; those laws are to be effective. This is a realization that did not come
&gt; quickly or easily.

"/> A law is void for vagueness if it is sufficiently vague that a person of
average intilligence must necessarily guess at it's meaning and differ as to
its application. This is a violation of equal protection. Since a law that
is too vague can have many different interpretations, there is no possible
way that it can be applied equally to all similarly situated people.

Where the law is written in such a manner that it is impossible for the
average person to understand, they also cannot know what is proscribed.
This is probably why the laws are getting more human readable. States don't
like it when their laws are stricken down for unconstitutionality, and when
a law is not written in plain english, that chance is greater.

&gt; Several years ago, I served as a technical (computer) advisor to a
&gt; committee that consisted of about 100 volunteers who were assembled by
&gt; the supreme court in one of the larger American states. Our task was to
&gt; look at ways that future and existing technology can be utilized to make
&gt; the administration of law and justice cheaper and more efficient.

&gt; One of the topics that came up was that legislators need to write laws
&gt; that do not require high powered legal experts to comprehend them. As
&gt; the only person on that committee who did not work in the legal
&gt; profession, after a few meetings, I was asked to be a consumer advocate,
&gt; in addition to offering my computer expertise. I spent a lot of time in
&gt; both roles, including traveling with the judge who chaired the committee
&gt; to look at technology providers to see what they could offer us.

&gt; People on this committee included law school faculty, law librarians,
&gt; lawyers, judges, and one or two people from law enforcement. After many
&gt; meetings and hours spent writing reports, we produced a long document
&gt; that was sent to the state supreme court for its review and many of the
&gt; recommendations we made were adopted. This was probably one of the more
&gt; interesting projects I have worked on and it resulted in some meaningful
&gt; reform, although considerably more work still needs to be done in order
&gt; to meet all the recommendations our committee made.

everyone knows that I'm not making things up that never happened. I see no
reason to make a specific citation. This is not a courtroom. I don't have

that is only if they don't work for the government. Apparently, government
workers are not individuals who are allowed to have religion.

The government should have no say about what religion you choose. Nobody
should be doing missionary work while simultaneously working at a government
job. People should have the right to wear their religious symbols, and
explain what they symbolize if asked as long as they don't go into why their
belief system is better than someone else's.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I wasn't changing the subject I was giving examples of successful
&gt;&gt;&gt;campaigns to wipeout religion.

&gt;&gt; Please. All that represented was an attempt to wipe out religious
&gt;&gt; welfare, where the government's resources were misappropriated to
&gt;&gt; religion. If you want a monument to your religious beliefs, then you
&gt;&gt; can raise the money to build it, build it on your own private property,
&gt;&gt; and enjoy it to your heart's content. It's called personal
&gt;&gt; responsibility.

&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, religion is not being wiped out. It is changing; as in many
&gt;&gt; other aspects of society, people are becoming more polarized. More
&gt;&gt; people are joining evangelical churches, and more are regarding
&gt;&gt; themselves as &quot;nonreligious&quot; or &quot;atheist&quot; or joining non-mainstream
&gt;&gt; religions. Fewer are in the middle. But if you think you can attribute
&gt;&gt; this change to the 0.4% of the population who call themselves &quot;atheist&quot;
&gt;&gt; then I'd have to say you grossly overestimate their power.

&gt; It's the same pea brain mentality seen over and over again...
&gt; People who fight to keep church and state separate are out
&gt; to destroy religion. People who fight for same-sex marriage
&gt; rights are out to destroy marriage. It's all a symptom of the
&gt; same problem -- a closed mind and watching too much
&gt; Fox News.

"/> The misconception is that the law was meant to keep the church out of the
state. That is not true. The law was made to keep the state out of the
church. Simple, direct, and to the point. The law states exactly what it
was meant for, but our courts have decided they need to rewrite history.
That is the injustice. Jurors are not in place to rewrite law, they are in
place to interpret that law, and the laws should not be interpreted loosly.

As far as the same-sex marriage thing. The problem with that is that it is
against the law. There is no fundamental right to gay marriage since it is
not one of those rights that has historically been understood. That is one
of the main tests of fundamental rights.

The only way homosexuals should be allowed to marry is if the legislature
gives them that right. Right now, they have not except in a panic response
to judicial misinterpretations that have not actually become ripe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thus said &quot;Timm Simpkins&quot;&lt;pod ... @relivguru.com&gt;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We must take great care when giving up our freedoms. Those athiests
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would have the word God stricken from the dictionary are intolerant
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other's freedom to speak it, or their freedom to let others know
they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe in a god.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've met quite a few atheists, but I've never met or heard of any who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would suggest such a thing. Can you provide a citation for somebody
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;saying this, or are you just setting up straw men?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ain't no strawman just because you haven't met one. Who do you think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed prayer from schools? Some Nun? They couldn't even handle a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;moment of silence because some kids might be praying. Who do you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think wants to have the Ten Commandments removed from the Courthouse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;down South? If these people do not believe in a supreme being why are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they so offended at the acknowledgement of one by other people? Why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are they afraid of a concept that they say doesn't exist?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not a matter of being &quot;offended&quot;. This is yet another
&gt;&gt;&gt; hot button issue of the radical right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; IN FACT, the majority of people who fight to keep church
&gt;&gt;&gt; and state separate, even to sometimes ridiculous proportions
&gt;&gt;&gt; are THEISTS, and they fight this fight for the protection of
&gt;&gt;&gt; both state AND church. In every case throughout history --
&gt;&gt;&gt; every single one -- the union of church and state has
&gt;&gt;&gt; inevitably and invariably resulted in the corruption of both.

&gt;&gt; I would agree that back in time, (before the flight from England) the
&gt;&gt; church and state were both corrupt and in bed with each other. The
&gt;&gt; Masses were required to change religions based on the proffessed
&gt;&gt; religion of the NEw King/Queen. I was taught that is why the fled and
&gt;&gt; came to America.

&gt;&gt; That is why the founding fathers wrote it into our constitution, this
&gt;&gt; state sponsored religion to which all must bow down to. Now I know you
&gt;&gt; folks believe the constitution barely allows religion to be spoken about
&gt;&gt; in any state connected entity or location, but in all fairness, that was
&gt;&gt; probably not the intent, and that is a very tuff subject to pursue.

&gt;&gt; ANd BTW Rick, since we have no such corruption of state by religion, how
&gt;&gt; do you suppose we have such a corrupt goverment? JUst maybe, it is a
&gt;&gt; lack of religion in the state.

&gt; Relative to other governments ours isn't that bad. At least we
&gt; have the option of voting corrupt representatives out of office
&gt; every few years. It's wealth and power that corrupts, religion
&gt; doesn't have much to do with it. In fact it usually makes the
&gt; problem worse not better. The most corrupt governments on
&gt; the planet are and have always been theocracies. Look at
&gt; most any Islamic country (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria etc) for
&gt; current examples.

"/> In your case Rick, it's stupidity and party line politics that corrupt. As
for corrupt governments, what about all the communist countries? Just
because their corruption carries over little from their borders does not
mean they are not worse. Look what Stalin did, then Lenin. Stalin alone
killed more of his own people than the Germans killed Jews. The most
corrupt countries in history have been those who believe that government is
the cure all to their problems. Much like modern liberals believe.

At least in communist countries there is no question of what the leaders
want. Liberals tend to take the stealth approach. They wait until they get
into positions of power, then they show their true colors.

they would tell their constituencies to stay home on election
day unless the Hill started dancing the defense of marriage

passes a majority vote, that's all that's necessary to prove a rational
relation. That's not the standard, but it might as well be.

Only those rights guaranteed by the constitution are considered fundamental.
The right to homosexual marriage has never in the history of this country,
even if you connect it with all the British history prior to that, been
considered a right, much less a fundamental right.

Anyway, I'm not against the idea of homosexuals having the legal right to
marry. It bothers me not one bit. What bothers me are these people that
think that it is some sacred right that homosexuals should have. Once
homosexual marriage is allowed, there will no longer be the ability to get
rid of it. It will become a fundamental right right along with Rick's right
to ignorance and the right to freedom from unlawful search and siezeure.
While I don't care if it's allowed on a personal level, I do care whether or
not it's allowed or denied without large amounts of public discourse.
People should not just jump to their respective sides of this issue and
stand fast. Homosexuality is disgusting to most heterosexuals, and they
believe it is one of the worst sins you can commit. Of course they are
going to try and protect themselves and their children against some sort of
state legitimization of homosexuality.

Also, there is the fact that statistically, homosexual relationships are the
most transient of all non-married relationships. Homosexuals statistically
have more partners per year than any other group of unmarried persons. Top
that off with the fact that one of the primary concerns of the state has
historically been the protection and promotion of families. There are those
who think that by allowing homosexuals to marry that they will somehow be
off the heterosexual market where there is a misconception now that they
might be turned to be heterosexual. If you factor all these mores into it,
you end up with a highly emotional discourse that should be aired in public
for a long time in order to be sure that it is the right thing to do.

Homosexuals have never enjoyed the right to marry, and if they make
themselves be seen as radicals, as every gay pride parade shows us, they are
their own worst enemy.

Answer that for me.

And I also question your assumptions. A CBS/NY Times poll
from just last month showed 59% of Americans want either
same-sex marriages or same-sex civil unions to be legally
recognized:  http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm . So

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, religion is not being wiped out. It is changing; as
in
&gt;&gt; many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other aspects of society, people are becoming more polarized.
More
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people are joining evangelical churches, and more are regarding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves as &quot;nonreligious&quot; or &quot;atheist&quot; or joining
non-mainstream
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religions. Fewer are in the middle. But if you think you can
&gt;&gt; attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this change to the 0.4% of the population who call themselves
&gt;&gt;&quot;atheist&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then I'd have to say you grossly overestimate their power.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's the same pea brain mentality seen over and over again...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People who fight to keep church and state separate are out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to destroy religion. People who fight for same-sex marriage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights are out to destroy marriage. It's all a symptom of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same problem -- a closed mind and watching too much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fox News.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps yes, perhaps no. What about the people who are against
these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fights simply because of their belief systems? Who is to say if
they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are right or wrong. I don't think same sex marriages are going to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ruin marriages, but I don't see any upside on advocating it. Most
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the reasons for pushing same-sex marriages are invalid anyways.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One has to sit back and ask themselves what purpose marriage serves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and why it was created as an institution to begin with. I think it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has much more to do with an attempt to legitimize a life-style
choice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then anything else. Exactly what is the overall benefit to society?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ironic you ask that, because the other side is asking the exact
&gt;&gt;&gt; same question. What benefit does society accrue by keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt; gay people perpetually single? Turns out the answer might
&gt;&gt;&gt; surprise you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; More promiscuity. More cases of sexually transmitted diseases
&gt;&gt;&gt; among both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Higher divorce
&gt;&gt;&gt; rates among opposite-sex couples. Etc.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember when going through my divorce. It had everything to do
&gt;&gt; with whether or not homosexuals can marry. I would love to see how
&gt;&gt; homosexuals getting married lowers divorce rates of heterosexual
couples.

&gt; Ask Michael Huffington or James McGreevey, I'm sure either
&gt; one could explain it to you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Denmark started legal recognition of same-sex unions in 1989,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and other Scandinavian countries have followed suit since then.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And to the surprise of many, the overall effect on their societies
&gt;&gt;&gt; has been completely conservative:
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.andrewsullivan.com/homosexuality.php?artnum=20010813

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why does it need to be a federal government issue or an election
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue? Are there not more pressing problems to deal with that we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could expend our time energy &amp; efforts on?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The constitutional amendment was proposed because federal
&gt;&gt;&gt; and state &quot;defense of marriage&quot; laws are headed for the trash
&gt;&gt;&gt; heap of history. Even most of the authors of federal and state

&gt;&gt; It's amazing how just a couple days ago, it was not a defense of
marriage
&gt;&gt; law that was trashed, but a gay marriage law. Maybe somebody's wrong
again.

&gt; What law are you referring to, the California case? The
&gt; decision there was regarding Newsom's actions, it didn't
&gt; address the constitutionality of California's DOMA. In fact
&gt; I listened to the CA Supreme Court's hearing of this case,
&gt; and it was a clear a majority of justices felt the DOMA was
&gt; unconstitutional. But that wasn't the issue that was addressed
&gt; in their decision a few days ago.

"/> It's amazing how short Democrat memories are. Who was the first president
to deal with this issue, and pass a law regarding it. I'll give you a hint,
he was the predecessor to Bush. He signed the original DOMA bill into law.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; DOMA laws have admitted it. These laws don't have a legal
&gt;&gt;&gt; leg to stand on -- if they did, there would have been no need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to propose a constitutional amendment. But DOMA laws are
&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing more than unjustifiable gender discrimination, and gay
&gt;&gt;&gt; bashing, put in a politically correct wrapper. The amendment
&gt;&gt;&gt; was a last-ditch effort to circumvent the judicial process and
&gt;&gt;&gt; stop same-sex marriages from eventually being recognized --
&gt;&gt;&gt; and to enshrine a permanent status of &quot;citizen, second-class&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the U.S. Constitution.

&gt;&gt; A law against homosexual marriage has not reached the point of requiring
an
&gt;&gt; amendment to the constitution yet. Truthfully, it is a law that only
has to
&gt;&gt; pass the rational relation test in our courts since it is not a
fundamental
&gt;&gt; right. Basically, if legislators feel it necessary to the extent that
it
&gt;&gt; passes a majority vote, that's all that's necessary to prove a rational
&gt;&gt; relation. That's not the standard, but it might as well be.

&gt;&gt; Only those rights guaranteed by the constitution are considered
fundamental.
&gt;&gt; The right to homosexual marriage has never in the history of this
country,
&gt;&gt; even if you connect it with all the British history prior to that, been
&gt;&gt; considered a right, much less a fundamental right.

&gt; Complete nonsense. The Constitution is not an enumeration
&gt; of fundamental rights. E.g. African-Americans never had the
&gt; right to be considered human beings instead of chattel. That
&gt; didn't make slavery any more constitutional.

"/> No, the right to liberty is considered to encompass many fundamental rights,
but those rights are not considered fundamental until they are upheld in the
courts as such.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; If the right to legal recognition of marriage to the person of one's
&gt; choosing is not part of our inalienable rights to liberty and the
&gt; pursuit of happiness, NOTHING ELSE IS. If the state seeks

"/> We're talking about something that is fundamentally different than anything
that has been considered marriage before. When you are speaking of two
people of the same sex, you are speaking about a couple that will not
procreate between themselves, which is one of the biggest state interests
there are. Adoption and surrogate parenthood are not the same as actually
producing a child inside the bonds of marriage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; to deny recognition of a given class of marriage, as they have
&gt; done with incestual relationships, bigamy, marriage to minors etc
&gt; they must show a COMPELLING INTEREST in doing so. But
&gt; the best argument the state has been able to come up in the case
&gt; of same-sex marriage is pointing to religious documents and
&gt; claiming the sky is going to fall if we allow it. Both of those
&gt; arguments are legally indefensible -- hence the constitutional
&gt; amendment proposal.

&gt;&gt; Anyway, I'm not against the idea of homosexuals having the legal right
to
&gt;&gt; marry. It bothers me not one bit. What bothers me are these people
that
&gt;&gt; think that it is some sacred right that homosexuals should have.

&gt; Sacred is a religious term, not a legal one.

"/> Sacred may be a religious term, but the level of feeling about a right by
the majority of the world to make them think of it as sacred is almost
paramount when determining a right to be a fundamental liberty right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; And no one is questioning the right of homosexuals to marry. They
&gt; already have that right. The issue here is state recognition of these
&gt; marriages. As with emancipation of African-Americans, women's
&gt; suffrage and a thousand other issues over the last 230 years, legal
&gt; recognition of same-sex marriage is indeed a right -- but as yet
&gt; unrecognized.

"/> There is a difference between the right to marry and the fundamental right
to marry. Until the courts overwhelmingly recognize the right of
homosexuals to marry as a fundamental right, it is not a fundamental right.
Likely, this will necessitate a Supreme Court decision.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Once
&gt;&gt; homosexual marriage is allowed, there will no longer be the ability to
get
&gt;&gt; rid of it. It will become a fundamental right right along with Rick's
right
&gt;&gt; to ignorance and the right to freedom from unlawful search and siezeure.
&gt;&gt; While I don't care if it's allowed on a personal level, I do care
whether or
&gt;&gt; not it's allowed or denied without large amounts of public discourse.

&gt; When it comes to matters of constitutionality public opinion is
&gt; not relevant. E.g. a large majority of Americans in 1958 were
&gt; opposed to interracial marriages. That didn't make laws which
&gt; prohibited these marriages any more constitutional.

"/> Public opinion is irrelevant, but the country's history and traditions
isn't. That is one major part of the test to decide whether or not
something is a fundamental liberty or not. Where there is 0% of our history
and traditions where it was considered acceptable, that part of the test
fails.

As for interracial marriages, that is a bit different. Blacks are
considered a suspect class. If their rights are different than any other
race, it immediately invokes strict scrutiny of the laws prohibiting some
behavior. Homosexuality has not yet been held as a suspect class, and
therefore has little connection with interracial marriages.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; People should not just jump to their respective sides of this issue and
&gt;&gt; stand fast. Homosexuality is disgusting to most heterosexuals, and they
&gt;&gt; believe it is one of the worst sins you can commit. Of course they are

free, or the Citizen's child who must show ability to pay?

When it comes to Illegals, Liberals tend to forget just what that word
means. You complain the hospitals and ERs are not able to help folks on
a timely basis, which is pretty much correct in many cases, but you fail
to address the reasons why. Maybe if you were to check a few of the
border states regarding money lost in health care institutions due to
treating illegals, money spent in education for illegals, you might
begin to understand why some of us want the holes plugged.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I'm an athiest that has never had a problem with people's right to
&gt;&gt;&gt;bring their faith beliefs into public life.

&gt;&gt; Are you a newbie atheist or something?

&gt;Why, because I don't have a problem with it?

"/> No. For starters, because you don't even know how to spell the word
yet you claim to be one. Ordinarily I would let this go as a typo,
but it seems on-topic here as it speaks to your credibility.

Moreover, you use the rhetorical spin one typically associates with
bible-thumping reactionary Christians. Here's a quick translation guide:

- &quot;acknowledge religion&quot; really means &quot;endorse Christianity&quot;
- &quot;public life&quot; really means &quot;government institutions&quot;
- &quot;people&quot; really means &quot;government employees acting as agents of the state&quot;
- &quot;everywhere&quot; really means &quot;on government property&quot;
- &quot;removing God&quot; really means &quot;prohibiting state-sponsored prayer&quot;

&gt;&gt; OK, so that's an example. Not much detail, a pointer to a news story or
&gt;&gt; a pending court action would be better than a vague assertion, but it's
&gt;&gt; improvement anyway.

&gt;I was referring to a news story that happened about 2-3 years ago. A woman
&gt;was suspended from her teaching job because she refused to stop wearing her

&gt;always tucked under her shirt, but they wanted it gone for fear of
&gt;prosecution. I doubt it's still easily available on the net, and I don't
&gt;have a book about it.

"/> If you're talking about Brenda Nichol in Pennsylvania, the story is
easily available on the net if you bother to look. She was violating
the Pennsylvania Public School Code, which was not written by atheists,
and which may have been excessive in its restrictions. Last I knew the
matter was still pending in the courts.

property&quot; but that would not be the plain English meaning of &quot;just

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry Rick, but what I see more than anything is someones need for

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And my do you love that extreamist word fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think what you have been talking about is breaches
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of decorum. Our society no longer has any class or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;respect, and is slowing losing its morals as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People have been claiming that for 200 years now. If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;compare society today to 100 years ago, we're better off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in almost every respect (crime rates, standard of living, life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expectancy, etc etc). Did you know life expectancy for an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;average American born in 1900 was only 50 years? And as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for moral decay, again we're much better off now than in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;past. Go back far enough and women had no right to vote,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;African-Americans were legally considered to be chattel, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't get it Rick. Slavery is wrong, was corrected. Women
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not voting was maybe wrong (just kidding), was corrected. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;continue to skirt the issue of indecency in public. The filth in Public.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We may be better off where you live, but disrespect for others,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is rampant and wrong under any circumstance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I grew up where women were respected and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they responded by always acting like ladys.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most did, some didnt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Possible, I never saw the 'didnts'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, they were mostly in physically separated, with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;dregs where the dregs 'belonged' in most small towns etc.

&gt;&gt;Rod, you feel free to tell us how it was/is where you live/lived,
&gt;&gt;but in this instance, I was relating situations as they were in two
&gt;&gt;places I lived before leaving home for the Army. No, it wasn't
&gt;&gt;paradise, and people were people who sometimes got out of
&gt;&gt;hand, but the people also took care of things and each other.

&gt; You can try claiming that there were no prostitutes
&gt; till the cows come home if you like, no one with a
&gt; clue about the real world will believe you.

&gt; No surprise that some yokels led a VERY sheltered life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Those that didn't were shunned by their familys,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;friends and peers. They soon changed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most did, some didnt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Possible, I never saw the 'didnts'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You must have been aware of the prostitutes, even if you didnt use them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And if you werent, plenty were more observant than you.

&gt;&gt;There were prostitutes, you only had to drive 166 miles east to
&gt;&gt;find one or 50 something south to the Mexican side of the border.

&gt; Dont believe it. You just werent aware of the closer ones.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most men would knock the hell out of a man showing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;total disrespect to others and especially to a woman.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And plenty of those would lay into their woman too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Possible, but you severly misspoke here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope.

&gt;&gt;Yes, you did.

&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If that had happened, a very unfriendly visit by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;brother, father, uncle, son, cousin or just a friend
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would occur and said bad boy would have had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;his ass severly kicked and kicked and kicked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Have fun explaining why that didnt happen with
&gt;&gt;&gt;Tricky Dick Nixon when he tried that with Pat.

&gt;&gt;What has anything I wrote to do with Nixon or Wife?

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

&gt;&gt;At the time I departed New Mexico, neither were residents
&gt;&gt;there, hence were not in the evaluation I handed down as
&gt;&gt;to what took place there. Surely you understand that?

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BTW, You ever live in Rodeo, NM, or Virden,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NM or anywhere in rural NM in the 40s and 50s?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Dont need to have. If you are seriously attempting
&gt;&gt;&gt;to claim that there were no prostititues there at all at
&gt;&gt;&gt;that time, you're clearly completely off with the fairys.

&gt;&gt;Boy you really don't have a clue do you?

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

&gt;&gt;For certain, you have no clue as to rual towns in
&gt;&gt;New Mexico in the 40s and 50s and for all I know,
&gt;&gt;even today. I specifically mentioned two towns
&gt;&gt;I refered to. Tell me all you know about either.

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So why are you making comment regarding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what did or did not happen there?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Because you are making completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;silly claims about what happened there.

&gt;&gt;Do you have any idea how stupid your statement and your
&gt;&gt;position is on this? You have no way of knowing but you
&gt;&gt;choose to refute a claim made by one that does know.
&gt;&gt;That is the most rediculous thing I have seen in weeks.

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just the usual rose tinted view of the past.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And lets not forget the lynch mobs. While there may
&gt;&gt;&gt;not have been that many in that particular area, you
&gt;&gt;&gt;were making a general claim about how people behaved
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the past. You didnt restrict it to that hick town.

&gt;&gt;Ahh, but I did.

&gt; Another lie.

&gt;&gt;Why would I tell you how it was in your town?

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

&gt;&gt;And yes, by all standards it was what you would call a hick town.

&gt; And you were a pig ignorant yokel that didnt have a clue about
&gt; what happened there that didnt stand out like dogs balls.

&gt;&gt;Greatest place to grow up in the world, alto I speak
&gt;&gt;of conditions, and there are other places just like it,
&gt;&gt;just not where you would know about.

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

"/> Guess I'm getting slow with age, it took two days to realize you are
nothing but a disgruntled and Pathetic TROLL. You need a better hobby
feller, find one you might be good at. The stupidity of your ranting is
something to behold but also very boring.

BTW, grumpy, since you seem to know so much about where I lived, you
tell me who were prostitutes. Better yet, tell me about the towns I
lived in. AND again, just where do you live? Might help me understand
how you come to judge other places which you have absolutly no clue about.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What the extremists keep forgetting is you have your right to free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speech, life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness. Your freedoms
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should not be hampered by others exercising theirs. Just because some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;punk kid has the right to say something, doesn't mean you don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the right not to want to listen to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Amazing. And when the EXACT SAME argument is used against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being forced to hear, for example, &quot;under God&quot; during the Pledge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of Allegiance, some people throw hissy fits of the first degree. Do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you see the problem here? One person's prayer is another's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obscenity, and if our laws start trying to dictate whose opinion is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more important than it's a very, very short trip to fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry Rick, but what I see more than anything is someones need for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cause. Those that asked for the Under God thing were here first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And my do you love that extreamist word fascism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think what you have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talking about is breaches of decorum. Our society no longer has any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;class or respect, and is slowing losing its morals as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People have been claiming that for 200 years now. If you compare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;society today to 100 years ago, we're better off in almost every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;respect (crime rates, standard of living, life expectancy, etc etc).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you know life expectancy for an average American born in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1900 was only 50 years? And as for moral decay, again we're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much better off now than in the past. Go back far enough and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;women had no right to vote, African-Americans were legally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;considered to be chattel, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't get it Rick. Slavery is wrong, was corrected. Women not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voting was maybe wrong (just kidding), was corrected. You continue to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;skirt the issue of indecency in public. The filth in Public. We may be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;better off where you live, but disrespect for others, is rampant and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong under any circumstance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I grew up where women were respected and they responded by always acting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like ladys. Those that didn't were shunned by their familys, friends
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and peers. They soon changed. Most men would knock the hell out of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;man showing total disrespect to others and especially to a woman. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;maybe you like the way it is now, fine, I hate it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't believe I'm going to say this, but Rick is right. We cannot just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;treat our freedom as though it's ours to decide for someone else. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pointed out the difference between the way things were and the way they are,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and it has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;changing morality of the world. The phrase &quot;chivalry is dead&quot; is not far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off. We have become the way we are not because the government doesn't crack
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;down on us hard enough, we have come to be this way because we all have a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;laizes fair attitude about life, and we think that somebody else, mainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government, is going to solve our problems for us. Men have been taught to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not be confrontational, and women taught to be extremely confrontational.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We are taught tolerance to such an extreme level that the slightest bit of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;intolerance is looked at as evil and vulgar. The funny thing about that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that when we are tolerant, the people that get what they want are those most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;intolerant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We must take great care when giving up our freedoms. Those athiests that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would have the word God stricken from the dictionary are intolerant of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other's freedom to speak it, or their freedom to let others know they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe in a god. Those that can't stand the idea of homosexuals engaging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in sexual acts would give up your freedom to do whatever you would like to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the privacy of your own house and bedroom. There are even people that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would like to prevent you from having sex in almost every position other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than their preferred position. There are people that would have your rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as a parent taken away because they don't like how you choose to educate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When our fundamental human rights are challenged, we should not tolerate it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People should not say that just because it doesn't cause them any hardship
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that it is okay. The police should be kept from being able to just search
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whenever they please. It's not a matter of what you have to hide, it's a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;matter of what business do they have, and what might incriminate you without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your knowledge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A fundamental change in our belief system needs to happen in order to change
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what you're talking about. In order for that change to happen, we need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be less tolerant and more prone to act in the interests of ourselves and our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;children.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Timm, when the courts have determined you can not discipline kids at school,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Never happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the teacher lost control.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Have fun explaining the teachers that havent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That soon became, you can't discipline your kids at home,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Never happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the parents lost control.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Have fun explaining the parents that havent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now you have the begining of a runnaway
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;culture that respects nothing or no one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, what we actually have is just another silly old
&gt;&gt;&gt;fart mindlessly raving on about how the end is nei.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kids no longer cared about education,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bullshit. Plenty do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and those that did were in the middle of classes of out of control
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;kids where the learning process had come to a screeching halt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;More mindless hyperventilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did that ever happen before, like when we were kids,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sure, but on such a small scale it was quickly stopped.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The 'wild west' was called wild for a reason, stupid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No court was sitting there just waiting to give the violators
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;carte blanch free run knowing they were immune from censure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Have fun explaining how there are FAR
&gt;&gt;&gt;more in jail than there have ever been.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Multiply that by 1000 and you have our current scociety.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, just your silly little fantasy.

&gt;&gt;Rod. Where do you live, in some isolated third world country?

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

&gt;&gt;Altho there are exceptions to every rule, it only takes a
&gt;&gt;few instances to begin tearing down the structure of
&gt;&gt;education and parental guidance, it happens all the time.

&gt; Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of your
&gt; predicament better than that pathetically hoary old line.

&gt; You're mindlessly hyperventilating/lying about what actually happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe in a god.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've met quite a few atheists, but I've never met or heard of any who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would suggest such a thing. Can you provide a citation for somebody
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;saying this, or are you just setting up straw men?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ain't no strawman just because you haven't met one. Who do you think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed prayer from schools? Some Nun? They couldn't even handle a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;moment of silence because some kids might be praying. Who do you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think wants to have the Ten Commandments removed from the Courthouse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;down South? If these people do not believe in a supreme being why are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they so offended at the acknowledgement of one by other people? Why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are they afraid of a concept that they say doesn't exist?

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's not a matter of being &quot;offended&quot;. This is yet another
&gt;&gt;&gt;hot button issue of the radical right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;IN FACT, the majority of people who fight to keep church
&gt;&gt;&gt;and state separate, even to sometimes ridiculous proportions
&gt;&gt;&gt;are THEISTS, and they fight this fight for the protection of
&gt;&gt;&gt;both state AND church. In every case throughout history --
&gt;&gt;&gt;every single one -- the union of church and state has
&gt;&gt;&gt;inevitably and invariably resulted in the corruption of both.

&gt;&gt;I would agree that back in time, (before the flight from England) the
&gt;&gt;church and state were both corrupt and in bed with each other. The
&gt;&gt;Masses were required to change religions based on the proffessed
&gt;&gt;religion of the NEw King/Queen. I was taught that is why the fled and
&gt;&gt;came to America.

&gt;&gt;That is why the founding fathers wrote it into our constitution, this
&gt;&gt;state sponsored religion to which all must bow down to. Now I know you
&gt;&gt;folks believe the constitution barely allows religion to be spoken about
&gt;&gt;in any state connected entity or location, but in all fairness, that was
&gt;&gt;probably not the intent, and that is a very tuff subject to pursue.

&gt;&gt;ANd BTW Rick, since we have no such corruption of state by religion, how
&gt;&gt;do you suppose we have such a corrupt goverment? JUst maybe, it is a
&gt;&gt;lack of religion in the state.

&gt; Relative to other governments ours isn't that bad. At least we
&gt; have the option of voting corrupt representatives out of office
&gt; every few years. It's wealth and power that corrupts, religion
&gt; doesn't have much to do with it. In fact it usually makes the
&gt; problem worse not better. The most corrupt governments on
&gt; the planet are and have always been theocracies. Look at
&gt; most any Islamic country (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria etc) for
&gt; current examples.

&gt; Rick

"/> Those folks have occupied and controlled their lands and contrymen for
centurys while we have only been here for 200+years. America was
founded by those who understood having the state dictate what religion
and how to be religious was a very bad thing.

The problem as I see it is that some here are so fearful of that
happening again, OR they just hate religion and this FEAR is just an
excuse to persecute religions. Some hate the word God or anything that
stands for. WHy else would they fear the words Under God in a pledge?

Having never been in their place, it is hard for me to understand just
what all that means to them.

&gt; Right. If they're going to get preferential tax treatment, they shouldn't be
&gt; allowed to influence the vote. Religions are like clubs, cults or
&gt; fraternities, and in spite of what good some might do, there's no
&gt; justification for tax exempt status when they're handling billions in cash.
&gt; Why should we fund the political interests of the Scientologists and the

"/> Maybe classification would help. Moonies and Scientologists are cults.
Tax them. Take Mormons tho. You will not find many of them on
welfare rolls even tho they would qualify. The reason is that the
Church takes care of them. They have store houses full of food they
hand out to needy familys. Should that church also pay taxes? The last
two churches I was involved with also spent lots of money which kept
folks from taking your tax money. Just not to the extent the Mormons do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And no one is questioning the right of homosexuals to marry. They
&gt;&gt;&gt; already have that right. The issue here is state recognition of these
&gt;&gt;&gt; marriages. As with emancipation of African-Americans, women's
&gt;&gt;&gt; suffrage and a thousand other issues over the last 230 years, legal
&gt;&gt;&gt; recognition of same-sex marriage is indeed a right -- but as yet
&gt;&gt;&gt; unrecognized.

&gt;&gt;I have to agree with Rick on this one. Until we're ready to tell gays that
&gt;&gt;they're not people, they have the right to do anything that other people are
&gt;&gt;allowed to do, but of course, that's where this is headed. The proposed
&gt;&gt;constitutional amendment is all about removing a right and limiting freedom
&gt;&gt;which is blatantly un-American in my view. We're talking about such a small
&gt;&gt;minority of people that this really shouldn't be important, but it's been
&gt;&gt;promoted to make it into a political mine field.

&gt; They do have the exact same right as anyone else. The right to marry
&gt; a person of the opposite sex. No one has ever attempted to stop them
&gt; from doing that and many have. Even the Ex-Governor of NJ.

"/> Sorry, that argument doesn't hold any water. It's the same
argument used a half-century ago to justify miscegenation laws,
i.e. &quot;Anyone is free to marry someone of the same race,
therefore miscegenation laws are constitutional and are not
unjustifiably discriminatory.&quot; Interracial couples didn't ask to
marry someone of the same race, and gay couples aren't asking
to marry someone of the opposite sex. So your point is moot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If it is such a small minority of people why should we be bothered
&gt; with the expense of doing it? Have you ever stopped to think through
&gt; all the ramifications of enabling a law to allow it?

"/> I believe the effect on American society will mirror that of
other countries -- it will have a conservative effect. Hetero
couples won't notice any difference at all, while gay couples
will finally be accorded the same 1000+ federal and state
rights granted by legally recognized marriage. These rights
cover a lot of areas many people haven't considered:
inheritance, immigration, child adoption and custody,
hospital and prison visitation, taxation, insurance etc.

As for expense, U.S. states and other countries that have
implemented civil unions for gay couples have discovered a
&quot;separate but equal&quot; structure is pointless. If rights are
indeed equal, there's no reason to maintain a separate
structure.

&gt; To take your line of reasoning just a tad further, what will follow

&gt; rights. All of the has absolutely nothing to do with two people

&gt; Yeah I know it is a slippery slope argument, but the damn slope is

"/> Ah yes, the Rick Santorum School of Paranoia. It's probably
the most ridiculous argument of all on this issue. The state has
had no problem justifying laws against pedophilia, since such
relations are always non-consensual and always entail
victimization, and there's absolutely no reason to believe the
state would have any problem continuing to justify these laws
if same-sex marriage was recognized.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For some states, it is illegal aliens who are clogging up the ERs. It

&gt;&gt; Perhaps we should change to a system which only treats citizens.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps treat only those who show they can pay. No more poor or

&gt; No, Anthony, it would not be compassionate, but as usual, many of you

&gt; When it comes to Illegals, Liberals tend to forget just what that word
&gt; means. You complain the hospitals and ERs are not able to help folks on
&gt; a timely basis, which is pretty much correct in many cases, but you fail
&gt; to address the reasons why. Maybe if you were to check a few of the
&gt; border states regarding money lost in health care institutions due to
&gt; treating illegals, money spent in education for illegals, you might
&gt; begin to understand why some of us want the holes plugged.

negative effect, but that effect is mainly seen in border states and not

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I'm an athiest that has never had a problem with people's right
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bring their faith beliefs into public life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you a newbie atheist or something?

&gt;&gt;Why, because I don't have a problem with it?

&gt; No. For starters, because you don't even know how to spell the word
&gt; yet you claim to be one. Ordinarily I would let this go as a typo,
&gt; but it seems on-topic here as it speaks to your credibility.

"/> An atheist is not generally someone who goes around preaching to everyone.
I believe that there is no god, and that it is silly superstition propagated
by the fact that we cannot explain everything. I don't believe that it's
necessary to prove to everyone else that there is no god. I am content to
keep it to myself most of the time, and I think the first time I've ever
written about it has been recently on this NG. The fact that I get an I and
E mixed up has little to do with what I believe, and your attempt to limit
my scope by saying that I'm some sort of newbie atheist is small minded.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Moreover, you use the rhetorical spin one typically associates with
&gt; bible-thumping reactionary Christians. Here's a quick translation guide:

&gt; - &quot;acknowledge religion&quot; really means &quot;endorse Christianity&quot;
&gt; - &quot;public life&quot; really means &quot;government institutions&quot;
&gt; - &quot;people&quot; really means &quot;government employees acting as agents of the
state&quot;
&gt; - &quot;everywhere&quot; really means &quot;on government property&quot;
&gt; - &quot;removing God&quot; really means &quot;prohibiting state-sponsored prayer&quot;

"/> No, I have never used those terms in that manner, and I have clarified my
point more than well enough that even you should be able to understand it.
I have no problem with those who desire to practice whatever religion they
want as long as they don't violate my rights in any manner. Those
government workers wearing religious symbols do not violate my rights, nor
does it offend me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I see some very good ideals
&gt;&gt;being preached in most religions.

&gt; Sure, most atheists would likely agree. If they are secular ideals then
&gt; the government can even endorse them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have to remove anything faith based from public display, all the way
down to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the type of jewelry that a teacher can wear.

&gt;&gt;&gt; OK, so that's an example. Not much detail, a pointer to a news story
or
&gt;&gt;&gt; a pending court action would be better than a vague assertion, but it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; improvement anyway.

&gt;&gt;I was referring to a news story that happened about 2-3 years ago. A
woman
&gt;&gt;was suspended from her teaching job because she refused to stop wearing
her
&gt;&gt;cross pendant around her neck. Even the school admitted that it was
almost
&gt;&gt;always tucked under her shirt, but they wanted it gone for fear of
&gt;&gt;prosecution. I doubt it's still easily available on the net, and I don't
&gt;&gt;have a book about it.

&gt; If you're talking about Brenda Nichol in Pennsylvania, the story is
&gt; easily available on the net if you bother to look. She was violating
&gt; the Pennsylvania Public School Code, which was not written by atheists,
&gt; and which may have been excessive in its restrictions. Last I knew the
&gt; matter was still pending in the courts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If a public school math teacher wore a huge, florescent medallion every
&gt;&gt;&gt; day which read &quot;THE RIVERDALE SCHOOL SYSTEM ENDORSES JESUS AS THE ONE
&gt;&gt;&gt; TRUE SAVIOR OF MANKIND&quot; would that be OK with you, or would you
consider
&gt;&gt;&gt; that a problem? I would hope that you would see a problem there.

&gt;&gt;That would be against the law. That is one of the only things I've ever
&gt;&gt;seen that would definitely be against the law saying that congress shall
&gt;&gt;pass no law respecting religion.

&gt; So, we both agree that the Constitution imposes restrictions on what
&gt; kind of jewelry a public school teacher is allowed to wear on the job.

"/> No, when that jewelry specifically states that a government agency supports
X religion, that is what is against the law. You're going to beat this
straw man to death aren't you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, try examples. &quot;Just about everywhere else&quot; is so vague I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; even know what you mean.

&gt;&gt;You know exactly what I mean.

&gt; I think you mean &quot;in governmental institutions and governmental
&gt; property&quot; but that would not be the plain English meaning of &quot;just
&gt; about everywhere else.&quot; I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt by
&gt; asking &quot;what you mean?&quot; instead of saying &quot;what you are saying
&gt; constitutes deceptive spin.&quot; But, OK, I'll do it your way and just say
&gt; that you are speaking deceptive spins.

"/> Yeah, what I say is deceptive. I'm the one trying to argue with everything
but the actual point. I will not indulge a person who wishes to prove some
irrelevant point by attacking everything but the meat of the issue. Even if
everything else I said is wrong in some way, that does not diminish the fact
that the point made was correct. Either stick to dealing with the points
made and leave the irrelevant arguments, that you are clearly on the wrong
side of, out of it.

One possible alternative is for the state to say that these symbols are
OK as long as they are &quot;small&quot; and &quot;inconspicuous.&quot; I wouldn't
necessarily object to such a policy, but it leaves room open for
interpretation about what those terms mean, and there might be some
people who would deliberately try to push the limits to try to make some

Another possible alternative is for the state to decide it's easier to
just say that all religious adornment is not OK. I'm not sure that this
is the wisest course of action, but I don't see anything particularly
illegal about it or how it violates anybody's rights. All employers
have the right to set dress codes for what their employees may wear or
not wear at work. We give up many of our freedoms while on the job, and

&gt;&gt; a serious push to keep Mexicans in Mexico. He was talking more about
&gt;&gt; incentives rather than border closures. So tell me what you know
&gt;&gt; about this idea they are not wanted back in Mexico or where ever they
&gt;&gt; aren't wanted.

&gt; the educated, healthy, bilingual ones are wanted back.

&gt; the poor mexican on life support thats sitting in a hospital in los
&gt; angeles? they dont want him back. hes here draining our resources...
&gt; they dont want him there draining theirs.

"/> The idea is to keep them from leaving Mexico in the first place. Once
here, I have mixed feelings regarding their plight also, but the states
can not continue giving them free health care and free education,
there has to be help somewhere. Feds or the guys who give them jobs in

&gt;&gt;Maybe classification would help. Moonies and Scientologists are cults.

&gt;&gt;Church takes care of them. They have store houses full of food they
&gt;&gt;hand out to needy familys. Should that church also pay taxes? The last
&gt;&gt;two churches I was involved with also spent lots of money which kept
&gt;&gt;folks from taking your tax money. Just not to the extent the Mormons do.

&gt; Why not put churches in the same boat with the rest of us: they should file
&gt; a return showing their income from all sources from which they get to deduct
&gt; their charitable &quot;expenses&quot;. What's left over is profit and it shouldn't be
&gt; used to buy the Washington Times or a tax free retreat in Maui. Some of the
&gt; best real estate I know of generates no property tax because it's owned by
&gt; some church and they don't have to show anything for it.

&gt; something wonderfully witty:

&gt;&gt;I believe the effect on American society will mirror that of
&gt;&gt;other countries -- it will have a conservative effect. Hetero
&gt;&gt;couples won't notice any difference at all, while gay couples
&gt;&gt;will finally be accorded the same 1000+ federal and state
&gt;&gt;rights granted by legally recognized marriage. These rights
&gt;&gt;cover a lot of areas many people haven't considered:
&gt;&gt;inheritance, immigration, child adoption and custody,
&gt;&gt;hospital and prison visitation, taxation, insurance etc.

&gt; Why would yo think the legitimization of deviant sexual activity would
&gt; have a conservative effect?

"/> Deviant is a loaded word. While homosexuals do comprise
a minority, &quot;deviant&quot; conjures up all sorts of negative (and in
many cases religious and/or erroneous) connotations, e.g.
the misconception that homosexuality is a choice instead of
an orientation, that homosexuality involves pedophilia or
other forms of victimization or illegal activity, etc.

The bottom line is, there are no laws in America against
homosexuality. So even if it is deviant, it's also completely
legal. Being deviant therefore is not sufficient justification to
deny legal marriage rights to gay people.

As to why I believe the effect on society would be conservative,
all one has to do is look at any of the other countries that have
recognized same-sex marriages or civil unions. Or simply think
about the issue logically. Why would the effect be anything
other than conservative? Some claim it would encourage
homosexuality, but the fact is, studies over the last 30+ years
have consistently shown people's sexual orientation is either
genetically determined, and/or determined at a very early age.
In either case it's been established that sexual orientation is
NOT a choice. Gay people can't wake up tomorrow morning
and decide to become heterosexuals any more than you or I
could wake up tomorrow morning and decide to become
homosexuals. So in my view the &quot;encouragement&quot; argument
doesn't hold any water.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is no advantage to being married in
&gt; the tax code. There is however a marriage penalty. Other issues can
&gt; be handle by legal documents.

&gt;&gt;As for expense, U.S. states and other countries that have
&gt;&gt;implemented civil unions for gay couples have discovered a
&gt;&gt;&quot;separate but equal&quot; structure is pointless. If rights are
&gt;&gt;indeed equal, there's no reason to maintain a separate
&gt;&gt;structure.

&gt; No other country operates under our current constitution nor has
&gt; protected classes of citizens as we do either. Mark my word when the
&gt; marriage issue is worked out to their favor, and I have no doubt that
&gt; it eventually will, the next battle started will be for protect class
&gt; status. Then the fun will really begin.

"/> The scope of Title VII includes gender, not sexual orientation.
That ruling has been consistent by many courts over the last 25
years. But you might want to look up H.R. 2692 or S.1284:
http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;db_id=cp107&amp;r_n=sr341.107&amp;sel...

It's the first federal legislation that explicitly prohibits
discrimination based on sexual orientation, and is being
considered precisely because such discrimination is not
covered under Title VII.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When it comes to Illegals, Liberals tend to forget just what that word
&gt;&gt;&gt; means. You complain the hospitals and ERs are not able to help folks
on
&gt;&gt;&gt; a timely basis, which is pretty much correct in many cases, but you
fail
&gt;&gt;&gt; to address the reasons why. Maybe if you were to check a few of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; border states regarding money lost in health care institutions due to
&gt;&gt;&gt; treating illegals, money spent in education for illegals, you might
&gt;&gt;&gt; begin to understand why some of us want the holes plugged.

&gt;&gt;That has little to do with the overall cost of healthcare. It does have
a
&gt;&gt;negative effect, but that effect is mainly seen in border states and not
&gt;&gt;much elsewhere.

&gt; You would have been surprised at the number of Mexicans (I have no
&gt; idea if they were legal or not, but they did not speak english) who
&gt; were in a South Eastern Virginia Emergency Room on the night of
&gt; 6/24/04. A bus of them must have flipped or something.

&gt; When the police stopped at one of our plants that was being re-roofed
&gt; by a contractor, half his laborers jumped off it and ran to the hills
&gt; yelling immigration in a hispanic accent.

&gt; Driving across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel into the Eastern Shore

a Mexican whose family is here illegally. She met him in Montana.

&gt;&gt; Ah yes, the Rick Santorum School of Paranoia. It's probably
&gt;&gt; the most ridiculous argument of all on this issue. The state has
&gt;&gt; had no problem justifying laws against pedophilia, since such
&gt;&gt; relations are always non-consensual and always entail
&gt;&gt; victimization, and there's absolutely no reason to believe the
&gt;&gt; state would have any problem continuing to justify these laws
&gt;&gt; if same-sex marriage was recognized.

&gt; hm... some states might want to rethink their &quot;age of consent&quot; laws,
&gt; then. that would mean in south carolina, a man could marry a 14 year old
&gt; boy.

&gt; is *that* wrong? discuss...

"/> Well, my point is that it's an entirely different debate. I'd have
as much problem with a man marrying a 14 year-old, whether
it's a boy or girl.

Under our laws it's impossible for minors to give legal consent
to sexual relations with an adult. Period. The issue of same-sex
marriage is an entirely different issue, unrelated to this law.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Moreover, you use the rhetorical spin one typically associates with
&gt;&gt;&gt; bible-thumping reactionary Christians. Here's a quick translation
guide:

&gt;&gt;&gt; - &quot;acknowledge religion&quot; really means &quot;endorse Christianity&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; - &quot;public life&quot; really means &quot;government institutions&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; - &quot;people&quot; really means &quot;government employees acting as agents of the
&gt;&gt;state&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; - &quot;everywhere&quot; really means &quot;on government property&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; - &quot;removing God&quot; really means &quot;prohibiting state-sponsored prayer&quot;

&gt;&gt;No, I have never used those terms in that manner, and I have clarified my
&gt;&gt;point more than well enough that even you should be able to understand
it.

&gt; In the single example you cited, that of a school teacher who wanted to
&gt; wear a religious necklace, they meant exactly that. What else does
&gt;&quot;public life&quot; mean apart from governmental institutions/agents/property?

"/> Come on, you think I have time to deal with your crap. Public life means
everywhere. There are many people that would have religious symbols torn
down in any area visible to them. The reason there is nobody suing
individuals that show a religious public persona is only because there is no
law to prevent it.

You're the type of asshole that starts referring to what happened 2 minutes
ago as happening yesterday just because it's midnight aren't you? I don't
have to prove what everyone knows already.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If a public school math teacher wore a huge, florescent medallion
every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day which read &quot;THE RIVERDALE SCHOOL SYSTEM ENDORSES JESUS AS THE
ONE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TRUE SAVIOR OF MANKIND&quot; would that be OK with you, or would you
&gt;&gt;consider
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that a problem? I would hope that you would see a problem there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That would be against the law. That is one of the only things I've
ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seen that would definitely be against the law saying that congress
shall
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pass no law respecting religion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we both agree that the Constitution imposes restrictions on what
&gt;&gt;&gt; kind of jewelry a public school teacher is allowed to wear on the job.

&gt;&gt;No, when that jewelry specifically states that a government agency
supports
&gt;&gt;X religion, that is what is against the law. You're going to beat this
&gt;&gt;straw man to death aren't you?

&gt; You need to learn the difference between a straw man and a hypothetical
&gt; example. We both agree that there exists unacceptable religious
&gt; messages sent by jewelry; let's assume that everybody does. The State
&gt; of Pennsylvania is now faced with the problem of how to define a policy
&gt; on what jewelry is acceptable for their employees to wear on the job.

&gt; One possible alternative is for the state to say that these symbols are
&gt; OK as long as they are &quot;small&quot; and &quot;inconspicuous.&quot; I wouldn't
&gt; necessarily object to such a policy, but it leaves room open for
&gt; interpretation about what those terms mean, and there might be some
&gt; people who would deliberately try to push the limits to try to make some
&gt; kind of a point.

"/> If a person wants to wear robes with a picture of a cross all the way up and
down them, that is their choice. As long as they are not representing it as
being condoned by the state it is not illegal. Conspicuousness is extremely
restrictive to many religious displays. A burka is extremely conspicuous.
A sikh with a mile high turban is wearing a religious garment. It's about
as conspicuous as you can get, but it is his religion to wear that. The
state telling a person they cannot wear religious symbols, or overtly show
that they are from a specific faith or group of faiths is ridiculous and
illegal. Anyone who believes otherwise is just not well enough informed
about what the state can and can't do to infringe on those rights which are
fundamental.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Another possible alternative is for the state to decide it's easier to
&gt; just say that all religious adornment is not OK. I'm not sure that this
&gt; is the wisest course of action, but I don't see anything particularly
&gt; illegal about it or how it violates anybody's rights. All employers
&gt; have the right to set dress codes for what their employees may wear or
&gt; not wear at work. We give up many of our freedoms while on the job, and
&gt; if we don't like it we can quit.

"/> That poses a problem. People that work in government positions have often
been held to have a right to have those positions. Police officers, social
workers, and many non-elected officials are regularly able to force their
reemployment by taking the issue to court. Even in right to work states
there are some positions that a person has been determined to have a
fundamental right to be employed in. I personally think that's garbage and
it shouldn't be that way, but government infringing on a person's right to
practice their religion in a manner that does not reflect a compelling
interest is an especially big issue, more so than your local grocery store.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you mean &quot;in governmental institutions and governmental
&gt;&gt;&gt; property&quot; but that would not be the plain English meaning of &quot;just
&gt;&gt;&gt; about everywhere else.&quot; I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt by
&gt;&gt;&gt; asking &quot;what you mean?&quot; instead of saying &quot;what you are saying
&gt;&gt;&gt; constitutes deceptive spin.&quot; But, OK, I'll do it your way and just say
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are speaking deceptive spins.

&gt;&gt;Yeah, what I say is deceptive. I'm the one trying to argue with
everything
&gt;&gt;but the actual point.

&gt; If you say so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Rick&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And no one is questioning the right of homosexuals to marry. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already have that right. The issue here is state recognition of
these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marriages. As with emancipation of African-Americans, women's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suffrage and a thousand other issues over the last 230 years, legal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recognition of same-sex marriage is indeed a right -- but as yet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unrecognized.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have to agree with Rick on this one. Until we're ready to tell gays
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they're not people, they have the right to do anything that other
people are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;allowed to do, but of course, that's where this is headed. The
proposed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;constitutional amendment is all about removing a right and limiting
freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which is blatantly un-American in my view. We're talking about such a
small
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;minority of people that this really shouldn't be important, but it's
been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;promoted to make it into a political mine field.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They do have the exact same right as anyone else. The right to marry
&gt;&gt;&gt; a person of the opposite sex. No one has ever attempted to stop them
&gt;&gt;&gt; from doing that and many have. Even the Ex-Governor of NJ.

&gt;&gt;Sorry, that argument doesn't hold any water. It's the same
&gt;&gt;argument used a half-century ago to justify miscegenation laws,
&gt;&gt;i.e. &quot;Anyone is free to marry someone of the same race,
&gt;&gt;therefore miscegenation laws are constitutional and are not
&gt;&gt;unjustifiably discriminatory.&quot; Interracial couples didn't ask to
&gt;&gt;marry someone of the same race, and gay couples aren't asking
&gt;&gt;to marry someone of the opposite sex. So your point is moot.

&gt; No my point is valid until the US Supreme Court speaks on this issue
&gt; as well. Until that time, the law of the land is the law of the land.

"/> Actually, the supreme court doesn't have to speak on it at all. Once a
majority of the federal courts in this country agree on it, the rest will
fall in line. Federal courts are very strict, and a federal decision that
stands in one district will flow over into another just because of
precedence. The Supreme Court may never weigh in on this, and by their
silence, they are generally affirming the lower court's decision.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; If it is such a small minority of people why should we be bothered
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the expense of doing it? Have you ever stopped to think through
&gt;&gt;&gt; all the ramifications of enabling a law to allow it?

&gt;&gt;I believe the effect on American society will mirror that of
&gt;&gt;other countries -- it will have a conservative effect. Hetero
&gt;&gt;couples won't notice any difference at all, while gay couples
&gt;&gt;will finally be accorded the same 1000+ federal and state
&gt;&gt;rights granted by legally recognized marriage. These rights
&gt;&gt;cover a lot of areas many people haven't considered:
&gt;&gt;inheritance, immigration, child adoption and custody,
&gt;&gt;hospital and prison visitation, taxation, insurance etc.

&gt; Why would yo think the legitimization of deviant sexual activity would
&gt; have a conservative effect? There is no advantage to being married in
&gt; the tax code. There is however a marriage penalty. Other issues can
&gt; be handle by legal documents.

"/> Deviant is a subjective description. It is not for any one man to decide
what deviant behavior is. We have laws to determine that, and as far as I
know, laws against homosexuality went out with Texas.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;As for expense, U.S. states and other countries that have
&gt;&gt;implemented civil unions for gay couples have discovered a
&gt;&gt;&quot;separate but equal&quot; structure is pointless. If rights are
&gt;&gt;indeed equal, there's no reason to maintain a separate
&gt;&gt;structure.

&gt; No other country operates under our current constitution nor has
&gt; protected classes of citizens as we do either. Mark my word when the
&gt; marriage issue is worked out to their favor, and I have no doubt that
&gt; it eventually will, the next battle started will be for protect class
&gt; status. Then the fun will really begin.

"/> This is probably a good assesment. Homosexuals have been trying to make
themselves a suspect class for a long time now. It's already a battle that
has only been decided against homosexuality so far. With the plethora of
precedence that exists, it's very likely that it will not become a suspect
class.

are
&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt; BTW -- I personally feel that Churches, Religious Institutions and the

&gt;&gt; estate not on the tax roles because of that. Nor involved in the
&gt;&gt; political process at all. No funding of candidates, no preaching from
&gt;&gt; the pulpit as to who to vote for either.

&gt; Right. If they're going to get preferential tax treatment, they shouldn't
be
&gt; allowed to influence the vote. Religions are like clubs, cults or
&gt; fraternities, and in spite of what good some might do, there's no
&gt; justification for tax exempt status when they're handling billions in

&gt; Why should we fund the political interests of the Scientologists and the

"/> Take it from me, non-profit organizations influence the vote all the time.
The law says that the majority of a non-profit organizations resources
cannot be called to lobby the government or support political candidates.
Where churches spend large amounts of money, and rarely enter into the realm
of politics, they should retain their status. Plus, churches don't
generally tell a person how they should vote, they take a position on the
issue that is already up for a vote. That is different than actually
telling their congregation that they support candidate X.

&gt;&gt; Maybe classification would help. Moonies and Scientologists are cults.
&gt;&gt; Tax them. Take Mormons tho. You will not find many of them on

&gt;&gt; hand out to needy familys. Should that church also pay taxes? The last
&gt;&gt; two churches I was involved with also spent lots of money which kept
&gt;&gt; folks from taking your tax money. Just not to the extent the Mormons do.

&gt; Why not put churches in the same boat with the rest of us: they should
file
&gt; a return showing their income from all sources from which they get to
deduct
&gt; their charitable &quot;expenses&quot;. What's left over is profit and it shouldn't
be
&gt; used to buy the Washington Times or a tax free retreat in Maui. Some of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For some states, it is illegal aliens who are clogging up the ERs. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is the only way they can get treated free and without fear of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deportation. Stop all that and maybe citizens who do pay can be seen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on a timely basis.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps we should change to a system which only treats citizens.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps treat only those who show they can pay. No more poor or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;illegal aliens clogging up the ERs and hospitals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It wouldn't be very compassionate to the sick and injured poor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people though. Might not make you very popular.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anthony

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, Anthony, it would not be compassionate, but as usual, many of you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;feel that if a person is here, they are entitled to _______what ever,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whereas a citizen has to wait AND pay. Compassionate or not, to whom do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you feel the most compassion for, the illegals child who will be treated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; free, or the Citizen's child who must show ability to pay?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When it comes to Illegals, Liberals tend to forget just what that word
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;means. You complain the hospitals and ERs are not able to help folks on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a timely basis, which is pretty much correct in many cases, but you fail
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to address the reasons why. Maybe if you were to check a few of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;border states regarding money lost in health care institutions due to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;treating illegals, money spent in education for illegals, you might
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;begin to understand why some of us want the holes plugged.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That has little to do with the overall cost of healthcare. It does have

&gt; a

&gt;&gt;&gt;negative effect, but that effect is mainly seen in border states and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;much elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;You might be surprized. I have no data but many believe there are a
&gt;&gt;great number of illegals in states such as Illinois, Minnisota, NY, and
&gt;&gt;Washington, Oregon, Colorado, none of which are border. I lived in
&gt;&gt;Bellevue, Wa for 20 years. I went to Jalisco, Mexico 2 years ago to
&gt;&gt;develop a shrimp project south of Puerto Vallarta. When we hired a
&gt;&gt;biologist I learned that he had spent 4 years, illegal, in Bellevue and
&gt;&gt;in fact lived only about 1/2 mile from me. He says there is a pipeline
&gt;&gt;from Mexico to Wash, Oregon and Colorado.

&gt; Of course there are. I didn't say there werent illegals other places. In
&gt; fact, one of the highest concentrations of illegals I've ever seen at one
&gt; time was in Washington State. It still is not as big of a drain on
&gt; resources as it is in a state where there is a huge daily influx of fresh
&gt; illegals.

"/> It might also surprise you to find that the numbers of illegals stopping
in border states is not as high as those that keep on trucking further
into the US. These are not drains in those states.

However, I find it interesting we are discussing how many a particular
state might contain vs drain on resorces. Altho the Feds have more or
less stuck it to the states to take care of them, it is a drain on
America, regardless of which state is footing the largest bill. For
example, health care. No matter what we come up with, a good part of
the planing has to cover illegals.

&gt;&gt;You would have been surprised at the number of Mexicans (I have no

&gt;&gt;were in a South Eastern Virginia Emergency Room on the night of
&gt;&gt;6/24/04. A bus of them must have flipped or something.

&gt;&gt;When the police stopped at one of our plants that was being re-roofed
&gt;&gt;by a contractor, half his laborers jumped off it and ran to the hills
&gt;&gt;yelling immigration in a hispanic accent.

&gt;&gt;Driving across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel into the Eastern Shore
&gt;&gt;of Virginia &amp; up Hwy 13 into Delaware there are Mexican farm workers,
&gt;&gt;grocery stores &amp; Taco stands all over the place.

&gt; I never said there weren't illegals in non-border states. My sister married

&gt;&gt;what way it worked out. I just want my one say in the matter. One

&gt; I'd be opposed to this because we live under a constitution that's supposed
&gt; to protect the rights of the minority in spite of how the majority feels
&gt; about it. There are limits, of course, but it doesn't affect me if some

&gt; there's also a reason to protect people's private lives from unnecessary
&gt; public scrutiny.

"/> And I would not object to that pvt life either. I lived in Palm
Springs, Californis, the Gay Capitol of the world. The home on one side
of mine was owned by an old gay couple. They were extreamly nice guys
and were very private. They just wanted to be left alone. Across the
street and down a few homes was another couple, somewhat younger and
were also great neighbors, just wanted privacy.

Then there is the Gay Pride thing where you would not believe the goings
on in public for an entire week. I am not talking about the parade they
conduct, but one part of down town is blocked off for a week and you can
see openly sexual crap going on in broad daylight. They are the 'In
your face Homos&quot; and they demand you like them.

In my struggle to be fair to my friends, I have to consider what that
will bring from the radicals. BTW, the city had to shut down the park
at sundown cause dozens of gay guys hung out there trying to entice
teens who were there to shoot hoops, into the bathrooms.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe the effect on American society will mirror that of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other countries -- it will have a conservative effect. Hetero
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;couples won't notice any difference at all, while gay couples
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will finally be accorded the same 1000+ federal and state
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights granted by legally recognized marriage. These rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cover a lot of areas many people haven't considered:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inheritance, immigration, child adoption and custody,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hospital and prison visitation, taxation, insurance etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would yo think the legitimization of deviant sexual activity would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have a conservative effect?

&gt;&gt;Deviant is a loaded word. While homosexuals do comprise
&gt;&gt;a minority, &quot;deviant&quot; conjures up all sorts of negative (and in
&gt;&gt;many cases religious and/or erroneous) connotations, e.g.
&gt;&gt;the misconception that homosexuality is a choice instead of
&gt;&gt;an orientation, that homosexuality involves pedophilia or
&gt;&gt;other forms of victimization or illegal activity, etc.

&gt; Whether or not you were born with the defective gene that gives you a
&gt; stiffy when looking at some guys fat hairy ass or not doesn't matter.
&gt; Yes you have a sexual attraction. It is when you act on it, engage in
&gt; the activity, that defines you. In the natural order of things makes
&gt; you a deviant. Just because the word has other meaning that is not
&gt; germane.

"/> Sure it's germane. There are no laws against homosexuality.
The quesiton of whether a given sexual practice deviates from
the norm is unrelated to the question of whether it's legal.
There are hundreds of &quot;deviant&quot; sexual groups -- heterosexual
transvestites, people with fetishes, and on and on. Simply
because a given activity deviates from the norm is not adequate
justification to declare it illegal, or to deny marriage rights to
the group doing the activity. The state must prove a compelling
interest based on other criteria, such as whether a given practice
entails victimization, illegal activities etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The GAY movement has done nothing to disassociate itself
&gt; from NAMBLA.

"/> That's an outrageous and completely false claim. First of all,
NAMBLA was never anything more than a few dozen men in
their forties and fifties with bad combovers who claimed child
molestation is somehow a protected civil right. No one except
the FBI ever took them seriously -- in fact their worst critics
are and always have been gay advocacy groups, since it
reinforces the erroneous/right-wing/hot button stereotype that
a greater percentage of gay people are pedophiles compared
to heterosexuals. The FBI tells us that claim is untrue.

Second of all, NAMBLA's issue is unrelated to same-sex
marriage, or homosexuality per se.

Third of all, for all practical purposes they no longer exist as
an organization in the U.S. Last I heard they still have a
website, hosted on a foreign ISP, and a single mailbox which,
if I had to guess is directed to or at least monitored by the FBI.

And lastly, NAMBLA is far from being the world's largest
organization of pedophiles. That dubious honor goes to the
Roman Catholic Church.

&gt; Once cause plan A is brought to realization then it is
&gt; to plans B, C &amp; D for them. Major slippery slope, yes. But a slope
&gt; nonetheless.

&gt;&gt;The bottom line is, there are no laws in America against
&gt;&gt;homosexuality. So even if it is deviant, it's also completely
&gt;&gt;legal. Being deviant therefore is not sufficient justification to
&gt;&gt;deny legal marriage rights to gay people.

&gt; Yup, land of the free, home of the brave. You are right that stand
&gt; alone it isn't sufficient justification. It is just a component we
&gt; are discussing now.

&gt;&gt;As to why I believe the effect on society would be conservative,
&gt;&gt;all one has to do is look at any of the other countries that have
&gt;&gt;recognized same-sex marriages or civil unions. Or simply think
&gt;&gt;about the issue logically. Why would the effect be anything
&gt;&gt;other than conservative? Some claim it would encourage
&gt;&gt;homosexuality, but the fact is, studies over the last 30+ years
&gt;&gt;have consistently shown people's sexual orientation is either
&gt;&gt;genetically determined, and/or determined at a very early age.
&gt;&gt;In either case it's been established that sexual orientation is
&gt;&gt;NOT a choice. Gay people can't wake up tomorrow morning
&gt;&gt;and decide to become heterosexuals any more than you or I
&gt;&gt;could wake up tomorrow morning and decide to become
&gt;&gt;homosexuals. So in my view the &quot;encouragement&quot; argument
&gt;&gt;doesn't hold any water.

&gt; One thing interesting thing to note; having a sexual attraction has
&gt; never been against the law. Only the defining activity. You can be
&gt; attracted to men all your life, but you are not a homosexual until you
&gt; smoke that first chubby. Now that I think if it the same thing
&gt; applies to heterosexuals. Therefore you do elect to be what you are.
&gt; It is a deliberate action.

"/> Obviously, and the stand of some churches on the issue (i.e.
it's ok to BE gay -- just don't have sex) is beyond ridiculous.
What they're saying is, we want gay people to live horribly
lonely, emotionally starved lives just so WE won't have to
feel uncomfortable. It's beyond reprehensible.

&gt; Anyhow, every society has the right to establish the bounds for that

&gt; because of the exact same thing that makes it great, allows all sorts
&gt; of fringes of society to be amalgamated into the whole. Then not only
&gt; recognizes them, but enforces their acceptance. Mark my words title
&gt; VII will be changed. You will have to begin reporting the # of Gays
&gt; you employ and so on and so forth. Will it happen fast? No, but it
&gt; will happen.

&gt; If as you say, early childhood experiences are part of the component
&gt; of becoming Gay then we don't need to expose more children to as an
&gt; acceptabl;e form of behavior. For centuries homosexuality has been
&gt; held at bay as a societal taboo. Now it is presented as almost a
&gt; glamorous life style. As you begin to accept one old taboo subject as
&gt; being normal you can slowly support more &amp; more.

"/> More slippery slope nonsense. Trying to justify unjustifiable
discrimination because of past unjustifiable discrimination isn't
an argument at all -- in fact it's all the more reason to stop
discriminating.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What American health care system?

&gt;&gt;&gt; And yet, I can still go into any hospital in the U.S. and get a broken
&gt;&gt;&gt; leg, laceration, whooping cough, or whatever taken care of. Great
&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't it?

&gt;&gt; I just spoke with a colleague who has a broken foot. He went to one of
&gt;&gt; the better hospitals and he had to wait for 15 hours (I kid you not)
&gt;&gt; in the emergency room. Another colleague of mine who used to be an EMT
&gt;&gt; overheard our conversation and said that even when he brought in
&gt;&gt; patients in his ambulance, they would sometimes have to wait many hours
&gt;&gt; for treatment, and this is for paying patients.

&gt; It's called triage. Those who are worse off get seen first.

"/> True, I understand that, but it also sucks. Now I know about this first
hand. My mother had to be rushed to the hospital today (August 15). She
got to the ER at around 8:00am today after falling and breaking her left
leg and hip at home. My dad notified me by phone and I got to the ER
around 10:00am. My mom was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital in
Northeast Philadelphia. As I write this, my mother is still waiting for
surgery and she had to wait something like two hours to get her first
x-ray. That sucks!

My mom is in a lot of pain, despite being on a morphine drip. I spoke to
her around dinner time and she told me she was feeling pain. I do not
fault the hospital personnel for my mom's delayed surgery. Everyone I
encountered at this hospital seems to be concerned with doing the best
possible job. I was told that my mom will &quot;probably&quot; go into surgery
tomorrow (Monday) morning, but only if an operating room is available.
The operating schedule will not be available until tomorrow so they
could not even tell me a specific time when my mom's surgery would begin.
One of the people there told me it is entirely possible that my mom's
surgery (she needs to have a rod inserted to patch her leg) will be
delayed another day.

In the wealthiest country in the world, paying patients (which my mom
is) should not have to wait a full day for emergency surgery while
laying in pain. There is something definitely wrong with this system.
Ironically, the ER wasn't even particularly crowded while I was there.
There was a handful of people in the ER's waiting room. Everyone I saw
was obviously there for minor ailments. One woman was there for a rash.
Another young man wasn't feeling well. I suspect those minor cases went
to the ER because they could not afford treatment with a regular doctor
so they had to go to the ER where they had to be treated even if they
could not pay.

On the plus side my mom is not suffereing from a worse condition, such
as a heart attack. She is also awake and completely alert. What's more,
the doctor who was talking with my mom about her treatment when I walked
into her hospital room is a cute blonde woman, who looks a lot like Meg
Ryan. Too bad she's married.

&gt;&gt;in the emergency room. Another colleague of mine who used to be an EMT

&gt; Any idea why this is? Go read an ER's log book of patients seen.
&gt; Many hospital publish statistics. The ER is for &quot;emergency&quot;
&gt; treatment. However, people know they can't get turned down at an ER
&gt; for not being able to pay so they flock to it with tons of stuff that
&gt; aren't an emergency. Stuff like little Johnny has a runny nose.

&gt; Add in the people who really have life-threatening issues, the lack of
&gt; staff and you have a real mess on your hands. Since a broken foot
&gt; isn't considered &quot;life-threatening&quot; he gets lumped in with the kids
&gt; with sore throats. So he sits &amp; waits.

"/> Yup, and if more Americans could get treatment for minor conditions from
means other than an emergency room, this problem wouldn't be so severe.
That's a big problem with this so called &quot;system&quot; of medical care in the
United States. So many people who should be seeking treatment from
private doctors for minor conditions end up in the ER because they have
no other choice and that stresses ER resources and delays treatment for
people who have real emergencies.

"/> Ah, but President Bush wants to allow illegal aliens to remain in
the United States so they can work at slave-labor wages and also
tap into resources such as emergency room care at taxpayers' expense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do have to give the unions credit. They pay their way and in fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; donate heavily to the Democrats. Unfortunatly they use the workers

&gt;&gt;&gt;How in God's name could I have left that one off? Here in the Valley of

&gt;&gt;&gt;suggesting new ways to go after someone elses money. Someone once told
&gt;&gt;&gt;me that in one European country, Lawyers enjoyed a status level just
&gt;&gt;&gt;below hookers. Considered to be leaches/and the blood suckers of
&gt;&gt;&gt;society.

&gt;&gt; Strange how that's happening with a Republican governor, Republican
&gt;&gt; president, Republican House, and a Republican Senate. So much for that
&gt;&gt; opposition to trial attorneys.

&gt; Do I understand you to say we have a Republican Governor here in Az?
&gt; She is gonna wake up one pissed off lady when she finds this out. And
&gt; BTW, could you educate this country boy as to what any of those guys had
&gt; to do with who advertizes on TV? One more thing, for the record; Are
&gt; saying you embrace these ambulance chasers?

&gt;&gt; Again, wrong. Some of the most ardent supporters of the death penalty
&gt;&gt; are Democrats, and that includes President Clinton who signed a federal
&gt;&gt; death penalty policy into law and than used it when Tim McVeigh was
&gt;&gt; convicted of bombing the federal building in Oklahoma City.

&gt;&gt; As for immigrants, it is Bush who is pushing to make it legal for
&gt;&gt; illegal immigrants to work in the United States and drain government
&gt;&gt; resources.

&gt; Really? Shawn, it was Clinton who opened the dikes and let them in for
&gt; the votes he knew the Democrats would be needing. The Bushes have been
&gt; trying to plug the holes and at the same time find a solution for those
&gt; that Liberals let swarm into the US.

"/> Wrong. According to a press release on the White House's own web site,
Bush supports letting illegal aliens work in the states. See the article
at  http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/immigration/more-immigration.html
for yourself. In this article, you can clearly see Bush's double-talk on
this issue. Bush says &quot;does not support amnesty because individuals who
violate America's laws should not be rewarded for illegal behavior and
because amnesty perpetuates illegal immigration&quot; and then in the very
next sentence, he says &quot;proposes that the Federal Government offer
temporary worker status to undocumented men and women now employed in
the United States and to those in foreign countries who have been
offered employment here.&quot; Huh?

The INS statistics at
http://uscis.gov/graphics/shared/aboutus/statistics/immigs.htm
also do not match up with your claim that Clinton ... opened the dikes.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I will say it again. I love the Mexican People, hate their government,
&gt; altho it is improving. My best friend is Mexican. My son is married to
&gt; a Mexican, my Grand Kids are 1/2 Mexican, BUT illegal immigration is
&gt; just that, and to provide free health, education to them all is killing
&gt; some of our states. I have mixed emotions regarding the jobs they take,
&gt; most of those are not too appealing to Americans.

&gt;&gt; office

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than they are to actually help anyone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just keep on with your bullshit rhetoric, and I'll stick with the

&gt;&gt; facts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's been clear to anyone that your idea of a utopian society means

&gt;&gt; that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rich pay for the poor to live, and the poor then have no incentive

&gt;&gt; to get

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off their dead asses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These democrats and I'll raise your taxes Kerry sicken me. Even after

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bushs tax cut I think we are still working for 5+ months to pay off

&gt;&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government. It was almost 6 months.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax Freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax Freedom Day is,

&gt;&gt; what,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Halloween?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush had to borrow money to support that tax cut. So the money you and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I got isn't really a tax cut, it is borrowed money that will need to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;repaid at some point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That is total BS. IF you seem to need more money but do not wish to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what it takes to get more money or that seems to be a bad idea, then the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;real solution is to rethink that NEED for more money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Quit spending what you don't have. But then, Democrats would loose much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of their voting base because they would not have all that pork to send
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;home to pay for loyalty; votes. I give Democrats credit, they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;learned how to attract votes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong. Under Clinton, we not only balanced the federal budget, it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the black. Bush took the federal budget into the red. Don't believe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;me. Do your own research. Look at the Congressional Budget Office's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;web site for starters.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong. Under Clinton, over a year before his departure and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Gauranteed election of the VP Gore, the Citizens had discovered just how
&gt;&gt;&gt;over valued all Dot.Com companies were and the Market began adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;for the real values. Bush inherited that and the Terrorist Problem from
&gt;&gt;&gt;Clinton.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I love these:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Motor Voter = every illegal alien can now vote. Guess who they be most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;likley to vote for. Yep, the Libs who make it possible to be here in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, wrong. The Motor Voter law did not open up any more opportunities
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for illegals to vote than were already there. Further, Bush is the one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who's making the most noise about allowing illegals to work in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;country legally.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry, but you are wrong. Further Bush is the current president and has
&gt;&gt;&gt;done two things. Tighten up the Borders, which Liberals scream about

&gt;&gt; This is information I have yet to hear. How has bush tightened up the
&gt;&gt; borders? Are there more border patrol agents? Is there something that has
&gt;&gt; been done with illegal immigrants other than give them amnisty? Bush's
&gt;&gt; policies have been woefully lacking on border control.

&gt; What I said may in fact be skewed a tad due to the aftermath of 9/11. I
&gt; have been crossing the Border for many years and yes, there are more
&gt; agents, and they are on a mission. What is hard to discern is whether
&gt; it is Drugs, Terrorists or just illegals that is the major push but
&gt; believe me, it is 10 times tuffer to get accross a US Border from the
&gt; South. According to some agents willing to talk, it is Bush, but how
&gt; much pressure from others is not known. We do know Liberals seem to
&gt; want the borders opened so I just drew my own conclusions.

"/> Of course, its harder to cross the Mexican border if you want to cross
legally. Bush has done little to nothing to address the problem of
crossing the border between the states and Mexico illegally such as
simply not going through a check-point.

"/> That's not a flaw with the motor voter law, its a flaw with voter
registration in general. Your wife could have probably registered
to vote by using any of the methods that were (and still are) available
prior to the motor voter law such as going to a public library or
post office to fill out an old style paper voter registration form.

"/> Yup. This situation is exactly why each election gives rise to some
ballots that were cast by people who died prior to election day. The
motor voter law did not address this problem, but than again it was not
intended to address that problem. On the opposite side of the coin,
there are also lots of people who are legitimately registered to vote
who are denied the right to vote because of clerical or other errors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, wrong. The Motor Voter law did not open up any more
&gt; opportunities
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for illegals to vote than were already there. Further, Bush is the
&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who's making the most noise about allowing illegals to work in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country legally.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know who originally posted this but it is true that the Motor
&gt;&gt;&gt; Voter Laws have opened up the possibility of illegal, or even legal
&gt;&gt;&gt; aliens for that matter, to vote. My wife is a Korean national and has
&gt;&gt;&gt; never gotten her citizenship even though she has lived here for 25
&gt;&gt;&gt; years. Last year when I renewed her license for her on line I checked
&gt;&gt;&gt; the box for registering to vote just for laughs &amp; giggles. She got
&gt;&gt;&gt; her voter registration card in the mail with her new license. No
&gt;&gt;&gt; checks, reviews or anything else. They just signed her right up. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a stupid law with no checks &amp; balances. If one can get away with
&gt;&gt;&gt; there has to be more with more nefarious purposes as well.

&gt;&gt; I registered by mail to vote 40 years ago. I've voted in every election
&gt;&gt; since then and NOBODY has ever asked to see a smidge of identification.
&gt;&gt; I tell them my name and address, sign my name, they give me a ballot, I
&gt;&gt; vote. Whoever designed the system relied on the honor system. Hah.

&gt; That's one aspect I have never understood. I signed up with some guy taking
&gt; a petition years ago. I never showed any ID, and there was no way to prove
&gt; whether or not I was a felon, or what my citizenship status was. Is there
&gt; any behind the scenes cross checking of names with identity, or is it just
&gt; purely the honor system? Since they didn't take any ID, how do they know
&gt; that I'm Timm Simpkins born in Junction City Kansas, or Timm Simpkins from
&gt; New York?

"/> I guess it depends on your voting district, but where I live, the
registration form to vote is ridiculously easy for a non-citizen to use
to register to vote illegally. I live in New Jersey and one can register
to vote simply by printing out a form that's available on the web site
at  http://www.state.nj.us/lps/elections/forms_doe.html  and than mailing
in the completed form. This form does not require any information that
could be used for identity authentication.

At the very least, a mortgage, apartment lease, driver's license,
current passport, or other documentation with current address and name
should be required before a voter registration form is processed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm working fifty hours a week so that the guy in South
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Phoenix can drink beer and fish all day. Redistribution of wealth is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what Democrats are all about. People who work hard are penalized for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their efforts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the toilet to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And Bill Clinton, in a few short years, almost totally disarmed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Strange how most of the base closings under the Clinton administration
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;were in the chopping block due to the Base Closure Comittee which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dick Cheney chaired. If our military is so week, how did we end up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;going to fight in Bosnia and winning? To see that Clinton &quot;almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;totally disarmed this country&quot; is an outright lie. Than again, lies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are what the Republicans are all about, these days.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Was a great plan to evaluate and determin what bases could be closed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;still do our job. But Clinton took that to a new level. He closed them
&gt;&gt;&gt;and instead of using all that surplus from defense to support what was
&gt;&gt;&gt;left, he even took that and sent it home to his friends in pork.

&gt;&gt; You have no clue. Really. The president (any one of them) cannot send
&gt;&gt; money home. Spending is done by the House of Representatives. The House
&gt;&gt; is who holds the purse strings. Clinton could no more send federal money
&gt;&gt; home to his friends than you could.

&gt; Yea, the Government always was a mystery to me. Like, how there is no
&gt; way a Democrat Pres could ever do anything wrong cause the Congress
&gt; won't let him. Or if he did, The congress made me do it.

&gt; Yet you sit there daily claiming the congress must be giving this
&gt; Republican Pres free reign to do as he damn well pleases, right or wrong
&gt; and the way you tell it, all wrong. How is that?

&gt; While you're at it. Tell me about Clintons favourite chicken guy. He
&gt; never benifited much did he? You are naive bud, it happens every
&gt; stinking day.

Congress. That's right. Zero. Clinton vetoed many bills.

&gt;&gt; possible Liberal vote. You guys need to take another look. You could

&gt; Yep, liberal mothers who believe in abortion likely would breed liberal

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, if you are sucking at the government teat, on welfare,
&gt;&gt;&gt; you didn't get a break BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PAY TAXES! The big Liberal
&gt;&gt;&gt; lie is that only the rich got tax breaks. If you pay taxes, you got a
&gt;&gt;&gt; break.

&gt;&gt; HALF of Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut went to the top 1%.

&gt;&gt; During Reagan's two terms, the top 2% saw their federal tax
&gt;&gt; liability slashed by HALF, while everyone else's remained
&gt;&gt; essentially unchanged.

&gt;&gt; Do your damned homework, and open your eyes.

&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt; Dude you are too stupid to breathe. I'll say this slowly.

"/> I will say this slowly:

A tax cut that does not come with a corresponding reduction
in government spending is really a tax increase in the long-run.
We're paying something like 20 cents on every dollar of federal
taxes for the Reagan deficit. That's no tax cut as far as I am
concerned.

&gt;&gt; Add in the people who really have life-threatening issues, the lack of

&gt;&gt; isn't considered &quot;life-threatening&quot; he gets lumped in with the kids
&gt;&gt; with sore throats. So he sits &amp; waits.

&gt; Yup, and if more Americans could get treatment for minor conditions from
&gt; means other than an emergency room, this problem wouldn't be so severe.
&gt; That's a big problem with this so called &quot;system&quot; of medical care in the
&gt; United States. So many people who should be seeking treatment from
&gt; private doctors for minor conditions end up in the ER because they have

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What American health care system?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And yet, I can still go into any hospital in the U.S. and get a
broken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leg, laceration, whooping cough, or whatever taken care of. Great
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; patients in his ambulance, they would sometimes have to wait many
hours
&gt;&gt;&gt; for treatment, and this is for paying patients.

&gt;&gt; It's called triage. Those who are worse off get seen first.

&gt; True, I understand that, but it also sucks. Now I know about this first
&gt; hand. My mother had to be rushed to the hospital today (August 15). She
&gt; got to the ER at around 8:00am today after falling and breaking her left
&gt; leg and hip at home. My dad notified me by phone and I got to the ER
&gt; around 10:00am. My mom was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital in
&gt; Northeast Philadelphia. As I write this, my mother is still waiting for
&gt; surgery and she had to wait something like two hours to get her first
&gt; x-ray. That sucks!

&gt; My mom is in a lot of pain, despite being on a morphine drip. I spoke to
&gt; her around dinner time and she told me she was feeling pain. I do not
&gt; fault the hospital personnel for my mom's delayed surgery. Everyone I
&gt; encountered at this hospital seems to be concerned with doing the best
&gt; possible job. I was told that my mom will &quot;probably&quot; go into surgery
&gt; tomorrow (Monday) morning, but only if an operating room is available.
&gt; The operating schedule will not be available until tomorrow so they
&gt; could not even tell me a specific time when my mom's surgery would begin.
&gt; One of the people there told me it is entirely possible that my mom's
&gt; surgery (she needs to have a rod inserted to patch her leg) will be
&gt; delayed another day.

&gt; In the wealthiest country in the world, paying patients (which my mom
&gt; is) should not have to wait a full day for emergency surgery while
&gt; laying in pain. There is something definitely wrong with this system.
&gt; Ironically, the ER wasn't even particularly crowded while I was there.
&gt; There was a handful of people in the ER's waiting room. Everyone I saw
&gt; was obviously there for minor ailments. One woman was there for a rash.
&gt; Another young man wasn't feeling well. I suspect those minor cases went
&gt; to the ER because they could not afford treatment with a regular doctor
&gt; so they had to go to the ER where they had to be treated even if they
&gt; could not pay.

&gt; On the plus side my mom is not suffereing from a worse condition, such
&gt; as a heart attack. She is also awake and completely alert. What's more,
&gt; the doctor who was talking with my mom about her treatment when I walked
&gt; into her hospital room is a cute blonde woman, who looks a lot like Meg
&gt; Ryan. Too bad she's married.

"/> I'm sorry to hear about your mother. I hope she recovers soon.

Now, the problem is, this country might not get to people fast, but imagine
how slow things are in those countries who can't even give a minor medical
examination in less than 9 months. Their emergency rooms must be far worse
off than ours. As for emergency room speed, I would imagine that on average
the US probably ranks up as one of the fastest. That's not to say it's the
best. I went to the ER once when I was 19. I had sliced my arm with a
razor blade and needed stitches. I got there, and waited 2 hours before a
doctor ever came to look at my arm. When he did come, he looked like he had
just woken up after a 2 day bender. He shot novacaine into my arm like he
was suffering from Parkinsons. Then the stitches he put in fell apart
within 24 hours. Needless to say, I would prefer never to deal with that
doctor again.

The US medical system is not perfect, but it is one of the best. In fact,
with the research done and the number of specialists we have that are
considered the best in the world factored in, I would say we have the best
medical system in the world. Price is directly related to level of
competence and speed, although not all of the cost goes to the person
speedily using their level of competence, and that's the biggest draw on
funds.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . I give Democrats credit, they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learned how to attract votes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I love these:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Motor Voter = every illegal alien can now vote. Guess who they
be most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; likley to vote for. Yep, the Libs who make it possible to be here
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare = Up to what, about 4 or 5 generations of welfare
families who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never work, never want to work, don't care about school for
themselves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or anyone else trying to get an education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unions = Driven more companies into bankrupsy than I care to
count. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do have to give the unions credit. They pay their way and in fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; donate heavily to the Democrats. Unfortunatly they use the
workers hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earned money to do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; USA Ret

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't forget trial attorneys (no caps on lawsuits), convicted felons
(soft
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on crime), and non-english speaking immigrants (cart them all down to
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voting booths, tell them where to mark and give them a few dollars).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, wrong. Some of the most ardent supporters of the death penalty
&gt;&gt;&gt; are Democrats, and that includes President Clinton who signed a
federal
&gt;&gt;&gt; death penalty policy into law and than used it when Tim McVeigh was
&gt;&gt;&gt; convicted of bombing the federal building in Oklahoma City.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for immigrants, it is Bush who is pushing to make it legal for
&gt;&gt;&gt; illegal immigrants to work in the United States and drain government
&gt;&gt;&gt; resources.

&gt;&gt; Really? Shawn, it was Clinton who opened the dikes and let them in for
&gt;&gt; the votes he knew the Democrats would be needing. The Bushes have been
&gt;&gt; trying to plug the holes and at the same time find a solution for those
&gt;&gt; that Liberals let swarm into the US.

&gt; Wrong. According to a press release on the White House's own web site,
&gt; Bush supports letting illegal aliens work in the states. See the article
&gt; at  http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/immigration/more-immigration.html
&gt; for yourself. In this article, you can clearly see Bush's double-talk on
&gt; this issue. Bush says &quot;does not support amnesty because individuals who
&gt; violate America's laws should not be rewarded for illegal behavior and
&gt; because amnesty perpetuates illegal immigration&quot; and then in the very
&gt; next sentence, he says &quot;proposes that the Federal Government offer
&gt; temporary worker status to undocumented men and women now employed in
&gt; the United States and to those in foreign countries who have been
&gt; offered employment here.&quot; Huh?

"/> Temporary worker status is not amnisty. Amnisty for illegal immigrants does
not mean what amnisty normally means. Normally amnisty means that a person
will be obsolved of a crime, but with illegal immigrants amnisty not only
obsolves them of their crime, but gives them permanent legal status so that
they will not be commiting a crime by staying in the US. A temporary worker
status does not obsolve them from their crime, but if they apply for that
status before caught, they would then be legal. It is technically amnisty
as far as I'm concerned, but nothing like the amnisty that Democrats
support.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The INS statistics at
&gt; http://uscis.gov/graphics/shared/aboutus/statistics/immigs.htm
&gt; also do not match up with your claim that Clinton ... opened the dikes.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I will say it again. I love the Mexican People, hate their government,
&gt;&gt; altho it is improving. My best friend is Mexican. My son is married to
&gt;&gt; a Mexican, my Grand Kids are 1/2 Mexican, BUT illegal immigration is
&gt;&gt; just that, and to provide free health, education to them all is killing
&gt;&gt; some of our states. I have mixed emotions regarding the jobs they take,
&gt;&gt; most of those are not too appealing to Americans.

&gt; My best friend is not Mexican, but I agree with you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe the effect on American society will mirror that of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other countries -- it will have a conservative effect. Hetero
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;couples won't notice any difference at all, while gay couples
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will finally be accorded the same 1000+ federal and state
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights granted by legally recognized marriage. These rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cover a lot of areas many people haven't considered:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inheritance, immigration, child adoption and custody,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hospital and prison visitation, taxation, insurance etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would yo think the legitimization of deviant sexual activity
would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a conservative effect?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Deviant is a loaded word. While homosexuals do comprise
&gt;&gt;&gt;a minority, &quot;deviant&quot; conjures up all sorts of negative (and in
&gt;&gt;&gt;many cases religious and/or erroneous) connotations, e.g.
&gt;&gt;&gt;the misconception that homosexuality is a choice instead of
&gt;&gt;&gt;an orientation, that homosexuality involves pedophilia or
&gt;&gt;&gt;other forms of victimization or illegal activity, etc.

&gt;&gt; Whether or not you were born with the defective gene that gives you a
&gt;&gt; stiffy when looking at some guys fat hairy ass or not doesn't matter.
&gt;&gt; Yes you have a sexual attraction. It is when you act on it, engage in
&gt;&gt; the activity, that defines you. In the natural order of things makes
&gt;&gt; you a deviant. Just because the word has other meaning that is not
&gt;&gt; germane.

&gt; Sure it's germane. There are no laws against homosexuality.
&gt; The quesiton of whether a given sexual practice deviates from
&gt; the norm is unrelated to the question of whether it's legal.
&gt; There are hundreds of &quot;deviant&quot; sexual groups -- heterosexual
&gt; transvestites, people with fetishes, and on and on. Simply
&gt; because a given activity deviates from the norm is not adequate
&gt; justification to declare it illegal, or to deny marriage rights to
&gt; the group doing the activity. The state must prove a compelling
&gt; interest based on other criteria, such as whether a given practice
&gt; entails victimization, illegal activities etc.

"/> No, you're wrong. The fact that there are no laws against something does
not mean much of anything. The argument that homosexuals are somehow
genetically programmed to be that way also holds little water, since there
is just as much evidence, if not more to the contrary. Thus, it remains an
issue of whether or not people believe it to be a choice. I would say that
there is a group of homosexuals that have chosen to be that way, otherwise
there would not be a group of homosexuals who have chosen to be
heterosexuals. The number who choose and the number who are possibly
biologically compelled is also a difficult issue to determine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The GAY movement has done nothing to disassociate itself
&gt;&gt; from NAMBLA.

&gt; That's an outrageous and completely false claim. First of all,
&gt; NAMBLA was never anything more than a few dozen men in
&gt; their forties and fifties with bad combovers who claimed child
&gt; molestation is somehow a protected civil right. No one except
&gt; the FBI ever took them seriously -- in fact their worst critics
&gt; are and always have been gay advocacy groups, since it
&gt; reinforces the erroneous/right-wing/hot button stereotype that
&gt; a greater percentage of gay people are pedophiles compared
&gt; to heterosexuals. The FBI tells us that claim is untrue.

"/> NAMBLA is denounced by the gay community rarely enough to allow the belief
to continue that they don't denounce them. This may be the fault of the
press, but it is still an issue that they should probably address publicly
enough to get the word out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second of all, NAMBLA's issue is unrelated to same-sex
&gt; marriage, or homosexuality per se.

"/> Other than NAMBLA would have to jump on the bandwagon that it is okay to
have sex with young boys, and marry them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Third of all, for all practical purposes they no longer exist as
&gt; an organization in the U.S. Last I heard they still have a
&gt; website, hosted on a foreign ISP, and a single mailbox which,
&gt; if I had to guess is directed to or at least monitored by the FBI.

&gt; And lastly, NAMBLA is far from being the world's largest
&gt; organization of pedophiles. That dubious honor goes to the
&gt; Roman Catholic Church.

"/> That's a low blow, and totally false. There is no church sanctioned
pedophelia in the Catholic Church. I've never been at a single Catholic
service and I can tell you that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Once cause plan A is brought to realization then it is
&gt;&gt; to plans B, C &amp; D for them. Major slippery slope, yes. But a slope
&gt;&gt; nonetheless.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The bottom line is, there are no laws in America against
&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexuality. So even if it is deviant, it's also completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;legal. Being deviant therefore is not sufficient justification to
&gt;&gt;&gt;deny legal marriage rights to gay people.

&gt;&gt; Yup, land of the free, home of the brave. You are right that stand
&gt;&gt; alone it isn't sufficient justification. It is just a component we
&gt;&gt; are discussing now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As to why I believe the effect on society would be conservative,
&gt;&gt;&gt;all one has to do is look at any of the other countries that have
&gt;&gt;&gt;recognized same-sex marriages or civil unions. Or simply think
&gt;&gt;&gt;about the issue logically. Why would the effect be anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;other than conservative? Some claim it would encourage
&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexuality, but the fact is, studies over the last 30+ years
&gt;&gt;&gt;have consistently shown people's sexual orientation is either
&gt;&gt;&gt;genetically determined, and/or determined at a very early age.
&gt;&gt;&gt;In either case it's been established that sexual orientation is
&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT a choice. Gay people can't wake up tomorrow morning
&gt;&gt;&gt;and decide to become heterosexuals any more than you or I
&gt;&gt;&gt;could wake up tomorrow morning and decide to become
&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexuals. So in my view the &quot;encouragement&quot; argument
&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't hold any water.

&gt;&gt; One thing interesting thing to note; having a sexual attraction has
&gt;&gt; never been against the law. Only the defining activity. You can be
&gt;&gt; attracted to men all your life, but you are not a homosexual until you
&gt;&gt; smoke that first chubby. Now that I think if it the same thing
&gt;&gt; applies to heterosexuals. Therefore you do elect to be what you are.
&gt;&gt; It is a deliberate action.

&gt; Obviously, and the stand of some churches on the issue (i.e.
&gt; it's ok to BE gay -- just don't have sex) is beyond ridiculous.
&gt; What they're saying is, we want gay people to live horribly
&gt; lonely, emotionally starved lives just so WE won't have to
&gt; feel uncomfortable. It's beyond reprehensible.

"/> Yeah, and those people who are attracted to animals are in the same boat.
That just reprehensible that they cannot have sexually fulfilling lives
because churches and governments prohibit their sexuality from being
practiced. When a man loves a dog, and that dog loves his man, why is it
illegal for them to express that love?

In other words, your argument can be unfolded to include that behavior.
They say that animals cannot consent to sex, but that is not true. An
animal can very well decide to have sex. When was the last time you had a
dog decide to have sex with your leg?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Anyhow, every society has the right to establish the bounds for that
&gt;&gt; society. They do this for a reason. Unfortunately our country
&gt;&gt; because of the exact same thing that makes it great, allows all sorts
&gt;&gt; of fringes of society to be amalgamated into the whole. Then not only
&gt;&gt; recognizes them, but enforces their acceptance. Mark my words title
&gt;&gt; VII will be changed. You will have to begin reporting the # of Gays
&gt;&gt; you employ and so on and so forth. Will it happen fast? No, but it
&gt;&gt; will happen.

&gt;&gt; If as you say, early childhood experiences are part of the component
&gt;&gt; of becoming Gay then we don't need to expose more children to as an
&gt;&gt; acceptabl;e form of behavior. For centuries homosexuality has been
&gt;&gt; held at bay as a societal taboo. Now it is presented as almost a
&gt;&gt; glamorous life style. As you begin to accept one old taboo subject as
&gt;&gt; being normal you can slowly support more &amp; more.

&gt; More slippery slope nonsense. Trying to justify unjustifiable
&gt; discrimination because of past unjustifiable discrimination isn't
&gt; an argument at all -- in fact it's all the more reason to stop
&gt; discriminating.

"/> Yeah, we should stop discriminating against apes too. They can punch a
ballot just as anyone else can. They should be allowed to vote.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No my point is valid until the US Supreme Court speaks on this issue

&gt;&gt;Actually, the supreme court doesn't have to speak on it at all. Once a
&gt;&gt;majority of the federal courts in this country agree on it, the rest will
&gt;&gt;fall in line. Federal courts are very strict, and a federal decision
that

there is still hardly any chance they will hear it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If it is such a small minority of people why should we be bothered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the expense of doing it? Have you ever stopped to think

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the ramifications of enabling a law to allow it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe the effect on American society will mirror that of

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would yo think the legitimization of deviant sexual activity would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have a conservative effect? There is no advantage to being married in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the tax code. There is however a marriage penalty. Other issues can
&gt;&gt;&gt; be handle by legal documents.

&gt;&gt;Deviant is a subjective description. It is not for any one man to decide
&gt;&gt;what deviant behavior is. We have laws to determine that, and as far as
I
&gt;&gt;know, laws against homosexuality went out with Texas.

&gt; Deviant means to depart from the norm. Homosexuality isn't the norm.
&gt; There was never laws against the state of being anything. There were
&gt; laws against activities because society wanted them. When society no
&gt; longer wanted them they were removed.

"/> Again, &quot;the norm&quot; is subjective.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for expense, U.S. states and other countries that have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;implemented civil unions for gay couples have discovered a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;separate but equal&quot; structure is pointless. If rights are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;indeed equal, there's no reason to maintain a separate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;structure.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No other country operates under our current constitution nor has
&gt;&gt;&gt; protected classes of citizens as we do either. Mark my word when the
&gt;&gt;&gt; marriage issue is worked out to their favor, and I have no doubt that
&gt;&gt;&gt; it eventually will, the next battle started will be for protect class
&gt;&gt;&gt; status. Then the fun will really begin.

&gt;&gt;This is probably a good assesment. Homosexuals have been trying to make
&gt;&gt;themselves a suspect class for a long time now. It's already a battle
that
&gt;&gt;has only been decided against homosexuality so far. With the plethora of
&gt;&gt;precedence that exists, it's very likely that it will not become a
suspect
&gt;&gt;class.

&gt; Personally I am not willing to take that chance. It is also why I
&gt; support a slippery slope argument. You have to really be aware of all
&gt; of the ramifications of your actions prior to engaging in them. The
&gt; Gay community has done a great PR job. I suspect the overall feeling
&gt; on the subject of marriage for them is up a couple of percentage
&gt; points in just the past year or so. However, the majority of
&gt; Americans are still against the idea. If it was simply about being in
&gt; a loving relationship with another human civil unions would be fine.
&gt; However, they want more,. oh so much more. They want to be
&gt; legitimatized. Once they have it, the fight to change Title VII will
&gt; begin. Remember when every their &quot;fight&quot; is talked about the word
&gt;&quot;rights&quot; is bandied about.

not reply to my proof that your 80% number supportive of abortion was

&gt;&gt;I'd be opposed to this because we live under a constitution that's
supposed

&gt;&gt;about it. There are limits, of course, but it doesn't affect me if some
&gt;&gt;deviant wants to marry her dog. There's a place for majority rule, but
&gt;&gt;there's also a reason to protect people's private lives from unnecessary
&gt;&gt;public scrutiny.

&gt; Ah and there in lies the rub. They are no longer keeping their
&gt; private lives private. They are moving into the public domain and
&gt; asking that their lives be recognized as no longer separate, but
&gt; joined. Hence in the public domain.

"/> Yes, but we are not a democracy. We are a republic, and therefore our
democratically elected republic representatives are assigned with the duty
of making those decisions. A public referendum would be putting the
government in the hands of the majority of the people and that would not be
proper.

Now we have another issue, and that is whether or not the federal government
should even weigh in on what right the states have to recognize things other
states decide to do. If New York suddenly decides it's legal to marry your
dog, should Utah recognize that marriage? I don't think so. It's not a
matter of federal importance, but of state recognition. The federal
government should not have the right to weigh in on it unless somehow
homosexuals become a suspect class.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah yes, the Rick Santorum School of Paranoia. It's probably

&gt; Well, my point is that it's an entirely different debate. I'd have

&gt; Under our laws it's impossible for minors to give legal consent

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And yet, I can still go into any hospital in the U.S. and get a broken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;leg, laceration, whooping cough, or whatever taken care of. Great
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I just spoke with a colleague who has a broken foot. He went to one of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the better hospitals and he had to wait for 15 hours (I kid you not)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the emergency room. Another colleague of mine who used to be an EMT
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;overheard our conversation and said that even when he brought in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;patients in his ambulance, they would sometimes have to wait many hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for treatment, and this is for paying patients.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Any idea why this is? Go read an ER's log book of patients seen.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Many hospital publish statistics. The ER is for &quot;emergency&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;treatment. However, people know they can't get turned down at an ER
&gt;&gt;&gt;for not being able to pay so they flock to it with tons of stuff that
&gt;&gt;&gt;aren't an emergency. Stuff like little Johnny has a runny nose.

&gt;&gt;For some states, it is illegal aliens who are clogging up the ERs. It
&gt;&gt;is the only way they can get treated free and without fear of
&gt;&gt;deportation. Stop all that and maybe citizens who do pay can be seen on
&gt;&gt;a timely basis.

&gt; Ah, but President Bush wants to allow illegal aliens to remain in
&gt; the United States so they can work at slave-labor wages and also
&gt; tap into resources such as emergency room care at taxpayers' expense.

"/> You must love that Shawn. It has been the dream of Liberals for some
time to have these guys come screaming across our borders. It is funny
tho, they do take up the grunt jobs which Liberal Unions just hate.
Can't get the dues from an illegal and can't get the union guys in there
to pick tomatoes for 1.00 a piece which as you know would put my
favorite fruit out of my price range.

You say Bush wants to let them remain, maybe he does, I don't know about
that, but he also is trying to plug the holes in the border to keep any
more from coming. One agent suggested to me that if our military wasn't
occupied in Iraq and other hot spots, they would be working out on the
borders. And Shawn, no one screams louder than I do about the resources
these guys are taking from Citizens. For some reason, some here just
don't think that is a big deal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;take advantage of the British health care system. Do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What American health care system?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And yet, I can still go into any hospital in the U.S. and get a broken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;leg, laceration, whooping cough, or whatever taken care of. Great
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;overheard our conversation and said that even when he brought in
&gt;&gt;&gt;patients in his ambulance, they would sometimes have to wait many hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;for treatment, and this is for paying patients.

&gt;&gt;It's called triage. Those who are worse off get seen first.

&gt; True, I understand that, but it also sucks. Now I know about this first
&gt; hand. My mother had to be rushed to the hospital today (August 15). She
&gt; got to the ER at around 8:00am today after falling and breaking her left
&gt; leg and hip at home. My dad notified me by phone and I got to the ER
&gt; around 10:00am. My mom was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital in
&gt; Northeast Philadelphia. As I write this, my mother is still waiting for
&gt; surgery and she had to wait something like two hours to get her first
&gt; x-ray. That sucks!

&gt; My mom is in a lot of pain, despite being on a morphine drip. I spoke to
&gt; her around dinner time and she told me she was feeling pain. I do not
&gt; fault the hospital personnel for my mom's delayed surgery. Everyone I
&gt; encountered at this hospital seems to be concerned with doing the best
&gt; possible job. I was told that my mom will &quot;probably&quot; go into surgery
&gt; tomorrow (Monday) morning, but only if an operating room is available.
&gt; The operating schedule will not be available until tomorrow so they
&gt; could not even tell me a specific time when my mom's surgery would begin.
&gt; One of the people there told me it is entirely possible that my mom's
&gt; surgery (she needs to have a rod inserted to patch her leg) will be
&gt; delayed another day.

&gt; In the wealthiest country in the world, paying patients (which my mom
&gt; is) should not have to wait a full day for emergency surgery while
&gt; laying in pain. There is something definitely wrong with this system.
&gt; Ironically, the ER wasn't even particularly crowded while I was there.
&gt; There was a handful of people in the ER's waiting room. Everyone I saw
&gt; was obviously there for minor ailments. One woman was there for a rash.
&gt; Another young man wasn't feeling well. I suspect those minor cases went
&gt; to the ER because they could not afford treatment with a regular doctor
&gt; so they had to go to the ER where they had to be treated even if they
&gt; could not pay.

&gt; On the plus side my mom is not suffereing from a worse condition, such
&gt; as a heart attack. She is also awake and completely alert. What's more,
&gt; the doctor who was talking with my mom about her treatment when I walked
&gt; into her hospital room is a cute blonde woman, who looks a lot like Meg
&gt; Ryan. Too bad she's married.

"/> Sorry to hear about your Mom's injury. That just isn't fun for older
people. Hell, it ain't fun for anyone but the older you get, the tuffer
it is to get those things fixed so they all work right again. Anyway, if
you like, you can tell her some folks in Arizona are thinking about her.
I will let you determin if that would cheer her up or depress her.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . I give Democrats credit, they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learned how to attract votes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I love these:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Motor Voter = every illegal alien can now vote. Guess who they be most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; likley to vote for. Yep, the Libs who make it possible to be here in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare = Up to what, about 4 or 5 generations of welfare families who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never work, never want to work, don't care about school for themselves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or anyone else trying to get an education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unions = Driven more companies into bankrupsy than I care to count. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do have to give the unions credit. They pay their way and in fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; donate heavily to the Democrats. Unfortunatly they use the workers hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earned money to do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; USA Ret

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't forget trial attorneys (no caps on lawsuits), convicted felons (soft
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on crime), and non-english speaking immigrants (cart them all down to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voting booths, tell them where to mark and give them a few dollars).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, wrong. Some of the most ardent supporters of the death penalty
&gt;&gt;&gt;are Democrats, and that includes President Clinton who signed a federal
&gt;&gt;&gt;death penalty policy into law and than used it when Tim McVeigh was
&gt;&gt;&gt;convicted of bombing the federal building in Oklahoma City.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As for immigrants, it is Bush who is pushing to make it legal for
&gt;&gt;&gt;illegal immigrants to work in the United States and drain government
&gt;&gt;&gt;resources.

&gt;&gt;Really? Shawn, it was Clinton who opened the dikes and let them in for
&gt;&gt;the votes he knew the Democrats would be needing. The Bushes have been
&gt;&gt;trying to plug the holes and at the same time find a solution for those
&gt;&gt;that Liberals let swarm into the US.

&gt; Wrong. According to a press release on the White House's own web site,
&gt; Bush supports letting illegal aliens work in the states. See the article
&gt; at  http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/immigration/more-immigration.html
&gt; for yourself. In this article, you can clearly see Bush's double-talk on
&gt; this issue. Bush says &quot;does not support amnesty because individuals who
&gt; violate America's laws should not be rewarded for illegal behavior and
&gt; because amnesty perpetuates illegal immigration&quot; and then in the very
&gt; next sentence, he says &quot;proposes that the Federal Government offer
&gt; temporary worker status to undocumented men and women now employed in
&gt; the United States and to those in foreign countries who have been
&gt; offered employment here.&quot; Huh?

"/> I wondered before where you were getting information telling us Bush was
for allowing Illegals to remain. That statement by itself sounds like
the amnesty thing which to my knowledge is just not what he has been
favoring.

Asking the Feds to grant TEMP worker status to those now here is one
giant leap from amnesty and shows Bush is not immune to the plight of
the illegals. But to spin this into claiming Bush supports a program
such as the last Democrat Pres, is not nice.

&gt; The INS statistics at
&gt; http://uscis.gov/graphics/shared/aboutus/statistics/immigs.htm
&gt; also do not match up with your claim that Clinton ... opened the dikes.&quot;

&gt;&gt;I will say it again. I love the Mexican People, hate their government,
&gt;&gt;altho it is improving. My best friend is Mexican. My son is married to
&gt;&gt;a Mexican, my Grand Kids are 1/2 Mexican, BUT illegal immigration is
&gt;&gt;just that, and to provide free health, education to them all is killing
&gt;&gt;some of our states. I have mixed emotions regarding the jobs they take,
&gt;&gt;most of those are not too appealing to Americans.

&gt; My best friend is not Mexican, but I agree with you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;years. Last year when I renewed her license for her on line I checked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the box for registering to vote just for laughs &amp; giggles. She got
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;her voter registration card in the mail with her new license. No
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;checks, reviews or anything else. They just signed her right up. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is a stupid law with no checks &amp; balances. If one can get away with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there has to be more with more nefarious purposes as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I registered by mail to vote 40 years ago. I've voted in every election

&gt;&gt;&gt;I tell them my name and address, sign my name, they give me a ballot, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;vote. Whoever designed the system relied on the honor system. Hah.

&gt;&gt;That's one aspect I have never understood. I signed up with some guy taking
&gt;&gt;a petition years ago. I never showed any ID, and there was no way to prove
&gt;&gt;whether or not I was a felon, or what my citizenship status was. Is there
&gt;&gt;any behind the scenes cross checking of names with identity, or is it just
&gt;&gt;purely the honor system? Since they didn't take any ID, how do they know
&gt;&gt;that I'm Timm Simpkins born in Junction City Kansas, or Timm Simpkins from
&gt;&gt;New York?

&gt; I guess it depends on your voting district, but where I live, the
&gt; registration form to vote is ridiculously easy for a non-citizen to use
&gt; to register to vote illegally. I live in New Jersey and one can register
&gt; to vote simply by printing out a form that's available on the web site
&gt; at  http://www.state.nj.us/lps/elections/forms_doe.html  and than mailing
&gt; in the completed form. This form does not require any information that
&gt; could be used for identity authentication.

"/> In California it was much easier than that. There were cells of Mexican
businesses, usually dealing with moving money back to Mexico, who would
also aid illegals in housing, jobs, you name it. Like some big welcome
wagon. They already had all these forms and every other item needed to
get along in the US and remain in the US.

&gt; Yup. This situation is exactly why each election gives rise to some
&gt; ballots that were cast by people who died prior to election day. The
&gt; motor voter law did not address this problem, but than again it was not
&gt; intended to address that problem. On the opposite side of the coin,
&gt; there are also lots of people who are legitimately registered to vote
&gt; who are denied the right to vote because of clerical or other errors.

"/> You would agree that it would be best to fix THAT problem rather than to
make up for it by allowing illegals to vote. We could say that those
illegaly registerd to vote would be what, 99% Democrat? And for those

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just keep on with your bullshit rhetoric, and I'll stick with the

&gt;&gt;&gt;facts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's been clear to anyone that your idea of a utopian society means

&gt;&gt;&gt;that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt;&gt;to get

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off their dead asses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These democrats and I'll raise your taxes Kerry sicken me. Even after

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bushs tax cut I think we are still working for 5+ months to pay off

&gt;&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government. It was almost 6 months.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's tax cut did something unprecedented -- moved Tax Freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Day BACK several days. The Democrats' idea of Tax Freedom Day is,

&gt;&gt;&gt;what,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Halloween?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush had to borrow money to support that tax cut. So the money you and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I got isn't really a tax cut, it is borrowed money that will need to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;repaid at some point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That is total BS. IF you seem to need more money but do not wish to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what it takes to get more money or that seems to be a bad idea, then the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;real solution is to rethink that NEED for more money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Quit spending what you don't have. But then, Democrats would loose much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of their voting base because they would not have all that pork to send
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;home to pay for loyalty; votes. I give Democrats credit, they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;learned how to attract votes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong. Under Clinton, we not only balanced the federal budget, it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the black. Bush took the federal budget into the red. Don't believe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;me. Do your own research. Look at the Congressional Budget Office's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;web site for starters.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong. Under Clinton, over a year before his departure and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gauranteed election of the VP Gore, the Citizens had discovered just how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;over valued all Dot.Com companies were and the Market began adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for the real values. Bush inherited that and the Terrorist Problem from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Clinton.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I love these:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Motor Voter = every illegal alien can now vote. Guess who they be most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;likley to vote for. Yep, the Libs who make it possible to be here in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, wrong. The Motor Voter law did not open up any more opportunities
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for illegals to vote than were already there. Further, Bush is the one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who's making the most noise about allowing illegals to work in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;country legally.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry, but you are wrong. Further Bush is the current president and has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;done two things. Tighten up the Borders, which Liberals scream about

&gt;&gt;&gt;This is information I have yet to hear. How has bush tightened up the
&gt;&gt;&gt;borders? Are there more border patrol agents? Is there something that has
&gt;&gt;&gt;been done with illegal immigrants other than give them amnisty? Bush's
&gt;&gt;&gt;policies have been woefully lacking on border control.

&gt;&gt;What I said may in fact be skewed a tad due to the aftermath of 9/11. I
&gt;&gt;have been crossing the Border for many years and yes, there are more
&gt;&gt;agents, and they are on a mission. What is hard to discern is whether
&gt;&gt;it is Drugs, Terrorists or just illegals that is the major push but
&gt;&gt;believe me, it is 10 times tuffer to get accross a US Border from the
&gt;&gt;South. According to some agents willing to talk, it is Bush, but how
&gt;&gt;much pressure from others is not known. We do know Liberals seem to
&gt;&gt;want the borders opened so I just drew my own conclusions.

&gt; Of course, its harder to cross the Mexican border if you want to cross
&gt; legally. Bush has done little to nothing to address the problem of
&gt; crossing the border between the states and Mexico illegally such as
&gt; simply not going through a check-point.

"/> Not as much as he had hoped. He had intended on Military which are now
otherwise occupied. That too was only a temp thing until they could
work out what was needed, get the money funded and get it done. And of
course all the Liberals were right out there in front greasing the skids
to make it easy for him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm working fifty hours a week so that the guy in South
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Phoenix can drink beer and fish all day. Redistribution of wealth is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what Democrats are all about. People who work hard are penalized for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their efforts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give me a break. Ronald Reagan flushed $3.5 trillion down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the toilet to his defense contractor friends in just eight years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And Bill Clinton, in a few short years, almost totally disarmed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this country.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Strange how most of the base closings under the Clinton administration
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;were in the chopping block due to the Base Closure Comittee which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dick Cheney chaired. If our military is so week, how did we end up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;going to fight in Bosnia and winning? To see that Clinton &quot;almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;totally disarmed this country&quot; is an outright lie. Than again, lies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are what the Republicans are all about, these days.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Was a great plan to evaluate and determin what bases could be closed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;still do our job. But Clinton took that to a new level. He closed them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and instead of using all that surplus from defense to support what was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;left, he even took that and sent it home to his friends in pork.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You have no clue. Really. The president (any one of them) cannot send
&gt;&gt;&gt;money home. Spending is done by the House of Representatives. The House
&gt;&gt;&gt;is who holds the purse strings. Clinton could no more send federal money
&gt;&gt;&gt;home to his friends than you could.

&gt;&gt;Yea, the Government always was a mystery to me. Like, how there is no
&gt;&gt;way a Democrat Pres could ever do anything wrong cause the Congress
&gt;&gt;won't let him. Or if he did, The congress made me do it.

&gt;&gt;Yet you sit there daily claiming the congress must be giving this
&gt;&gt;Republican Pres free reign to do as he damn well pleases, right or wrong
&gt;&gt;and the way you tell it, all wrong. How is that?

&gt;&gt;While you're at it. Tell me about Clintons favourite chicken guy. He
&gt;&gt;never benifited much did he? You are naive bud, it happens every
&gt;&gt;stinking day.

&gt; Learn more about civics. Bush has vetoed exactly zero bills from
&gt; Congress. That's right. Zero. Clinton vetoed many bills.

"/> Well, damn. Guess you told me. Clinton did lots of things that I
wouldn't be too proud of.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what way it worked out. I just want my one say in the matter. One
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;citizen, one vote.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd be opposed to this because we live under a constitution that's supposed
&gt;&gt;&gt;to protect the rights of the minority in spite of how the majority feels
&gt;&gt;&gt;about it. There are limits, of course, but it doesn't affect me if some
&gt;&gt;&gt;deviant wants to marry her dog. There's a place for majority rule, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;there's also a reason to protect people's private lives from unnecessary
&gt;&gt;&gt;public scrutiny.

&gt;&gt;And I would not object to that pvt life either. I lived in Palm
&gt;&gt;Springs, Californis, the Gay Capitol of the world. The home on one side
&gt;&gt;of mine was owned by an old gay couple. They were extreamly nice guys
&gt;&gt;and were very private. They just wanted to be left alone. Across the
&gt;&gt;street and down a few homes was another couple, somewhat younger and
&gt;&gt;were also great neighbors, just wanted privacy.

&gt;&gt;Then there is the Gay Pride thing where you would not believe the goings
&gt;&gt;on in public for an entire week. I am not talking about the parade they
&gt;&gt;conduct, but one part of down town is blocked off for a week and you can
&gt;&gt;see openly sexual crap going on in broad daylight. They are the 'In
&gt;&gt;your face Homos&quot; and they demand you like them.

&gt;&gt;In my struggle to be fair to my friends, I have to consider what that
&gt;&gt;will bring from the radicals. BTW, the city had to shut down the park
&gt;&gt;at sundown cause dozens of gay guys hung out there trying to entice
&gt;&gt;teens who were there to shoot hoops, into the bathrooms.

&gt; But do your friends understand where you stand on the issues and still
&gt; accept you as a friend for it?

"/> Good question. They never asked and I never volunteered my position.
In fact, it is exactly this position, of not discussing that makes them
different from the radicals. The radicals throw it up in your face at
every possible chance and then dare you to not accept them and their
actions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe the effect on American society will mirror that of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other countries -- it will have a conservative effect. Hetero
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;couples won't notice any difference at all, while gay couples
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will finally be accorded the same 1000+ federal and state
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights granted by legally recognized marriage. These rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cover a lot of areas many people haven't considered:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inheritance, immigration, child adoption and custody,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hospital and prison visitation, taxation, insurance etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would yo think the legitimization of deviant sexual activity
&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a conservative effect?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Deviant is a loaded word. While homosexuals do comprise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a minority, &quot;deviant&quot; conjures up all sorts of negative (and in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many cases religious and/or erroneous) connotations, e.g.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the misconception that homosexuality is a choice instead of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an orientation, that homosexuality involves pedophilia or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other forms of victimization or illegal activity, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether or not you were born with the defective gene that gives you a
&gt;&gt;&gt; stiffy when looking at some guys fat hairy ass or not doesn't matter.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes you have a sexual attraction. It is when you act on it, engage in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the activity, that defines you. In the natural order of things makes
&gt;&gt;&gt; you a deviant. Just because the word has other meaning that is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; germane.

&gt;&gt; Sure it's germane. There are no laws against homosexuality.
&gt;&gt; The quesiton of whether a given sexual practice deviates from
&gt;&gt; the norm is unrelated to the question of whether it's legal.
&gt;&gt; There are hundreds of &quot;deviant&quot; sexual groups -- heterosexual
&gt;&gt; transvestites, people with fetishes, and on and on. Simply
&gt;&gt; because a given activity deviates from the norm is not adequate
&gt;&gt; justification to declare it illegal, or to deny marriage rights to
&gt;&gt; the group doing the activity. The state must prove a compelling
&gt;&gt; interest based on other criteria, such as whether a given practice
&gt;&gt; entails victimization, illegal activities etc.

&gt; No, you're wrong. The fact that there are no laws against something does
&gt; not mean much of anything.

"/> It means everything, at least with regard to the state denying
marriage rights to a given group. In every case (incestual
relationships, marriage to minors etc) the denial of marriage
rights is justifiable because their activities are illegal, not
because they simply differ from the norm.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The argument that homosexuals are somehow
&gt; genetically programmed to be that way also holds little water, since there
&gt; is just as much evidence, if not more to the contrary. Thus, it remains an
&gt; issue of whether or not people believe it to be a choice. I would say that
&gt; there is a group of homosexuals that have chosen to be that way, otherwise
&gt; there would not be a group of homosexuals who have chosen to be
&gt; heterosexuals.

"/> Who would that group be? If you're talking about so-called
&quot;conversion therapy&quot; groups, suicide rates in these programs
are often higher than their &quot;success&quot; rates. And the few who
are able to &quot;cure&quot; themselves of homosexuality weren't gay
to begin with -- they were simply confused.

But don't take my word for it, read what the American
Psychological Association says about the issue:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The number who choose and the number who are possibly
&gt; biologically compelled is also a difficult issue to determine.

"/> It's difficult only for those who haven't done the research.
Whether it's determined before or shortly after birth, sexual
orientation is as hard-wired for homosexuals as it is for
heterosexuals. You can easily do your own research on this
by asking your gay friends or relatives (if you have any)
whether they choose to be gay. They'll likely respond by
asking you whether you choose to be heterosexual.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The GAY movement has done nothing to disassociate itself
&gt;&gt;&gt; from NAMBLA.

&gt;&gt; That's an outrageous and completely false claim. First of all,
&gt;&gt; NAMBLA was never anything more than a few dozen men in
&gt;&gt; their forties and fifties with bad combovers who claimed child
&gt;&gt; molestation is somehow a protected civil right. No one except
&gt;&gt; the FBI ever took them seriously -- in fact their worst critics
&gt;&gt; are and always have been gay advocacy groups, since it
&gt;&gt; reinforces the erroneous/right-wing/hot button stereotype that
&gt;&gt; a greater percentage of gay people are pedophiles compared
&gt;&gt; to heterosexuals. The FBI tells us that claim is untrue.

&gt; NAMBLA is denounced by the gay community rarely enough to allow the belief
&gt; to continue that they don't denounce them. This may be the fault of the
&gt; press, but it is still an issue that they should probably address publicly
&gt; enough to get the word out.

"/> Again, if you haven't heard denunciation of NAMBLA from
gay advocacy groups, it's because you haven't been listening.
Look up policy statements from GLAAD, P-FLAG or any
other major gay advocacy group.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Second of all, NAMBLA's issue is unrelated to same-sex
&gt;&gt; marriage, or homosexuality per se.

&gt; Other than NAMBLA would have to jump on the bandwagon that it is okay to
&gt; have sex with young boys, and marry them.

"/> It's an age issue, not a gender issue. A group of men who were
claiming sex with minor girls is a protected civil right would be
laughed out of court the exact same way NAMBLA is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Third of all, for all practical purposes they no longer exist as
&gt;&gt; an organization in the U.S. Last I heard they still have a
&gt;&gt; website, hosted on a foreign ISP, and a single mailbox which,
&gt;&gt; if I had to guess is directed to or at least monitored by the FBI.

&gt;&gt; And lastly, NAMBLA is far from being the world's largest
&gt;&gt; organization of pedophiles. That dubious honor goes to the
&gt;&gt; Roman Catholic Church.

&gt; That's a low blow, and totally false. There is no church sanctioned
&gt; pedophelia in the Catholic Church. I've never been at a single Catholic
&gt; service and I can tell you that.

"/> Whether it's sanctioned or not isn't the issue. The fact remains,
the Catholic Church contains the largest number of pedophiles
of any organization on Earth, and they've consistently protected
their pedophiles from civil prosecution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Once cause plan A is brought to realization then it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; to plans B, C &amp; D for them. Major slippery slope, yes. But a slope
&gt;&gt;&gt; nonetheless.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The bottom line is, there are no laws in America against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexuality. So even if it is deviant, it's also completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;legal. Being deviant therefore is not sufficient justification to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deny legal marriage rights to gay people.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yup, land of the free, home of the brave. You are right that stand
&gt;&gt;&gt; alone it isn't sufficient justification. It is just a component we
&gt;&gt;&gt; are discussing now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As to why I believe the effect on society would be conservative,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all one has to do is look at any of the other countries that have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recognized same-sex marriages or civil unions. Or simply think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;about the issue logically. Why would the effect be anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other than conservative? Some claim it would encourage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexuality, but the fact is, studies over the last 30+ years
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have consistently shown people's sexual orientation is either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;genetically determined, and/or determined at a very early age.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In either case it's been established that sexual orientation is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT a choice. Gay people can't wake up tomorrow morning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and decide to become heterosexuals any more than you or I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;could wake up tomorrow morning and decide to become
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexuals. So in my view the &quot;encouragement&quot; argument
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't hold any water.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing interesting thing to note; having a sexual attraction has
&gt;&gt;&gt; never been against the law. Only the defining activity. You can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; attracted to men all your life, but you are not a homosexual until you
&gt;&gt;&gt; smoke that first chubby. Now that I think if it the same thing
&gt;&gt;&gt; applies to heterosexuals. Therefore you do elect to be what you are.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a deliberate action.

&gt;&gt; Obviously, and the stand of some churches on the issue (i.e.
&gt;&gt; it's ok to BE gay -- just don't have sex) is beyond ridiculous.
&gt;&gt; What they're saying is, we want gay people to live horribly
&gt;&gt; lonely, emotionally starved lives just so WE won't have to
&gt;&gt; feel uncomfortable. It's beyond reprehensible.

&gt; Yeah, and those people who are attracted to animals are in the same boat.

"/> Apples and oranges. Animals cannot give legal consent to
sexual relations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That just reprehensible that they cannot have sexually fulfilling lives
&gt; because churches and governments prohibit their sexuality from being
&gt; practiced. When a man loves a dog, and that dog loves his man, why is it
&gt; illegal for them to express that love?

"/> Because animals cannot give legal consent to sexual relations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In other words, your argument can be unfolded to include that behavior.
&gt; They say that animals cannot consent to sex, but that is not true. An
&gt; animal can very well decide to have sex. When was the last time you had a

Almost every poll shows an outright ban on abortion is

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ain't no strawman just because you haven't met one. Who do you think

&gt;&gt;&gt; moment of silence because some kids might be praying. Who do you
&gt;&gt;&gt; think wants to have the Ten Commandments removed from the Courthouse
&gt;&gt;&gt; down South? If these people do not believe in a supreme being why are
&gt;&gt;&gt; they so offended at the acknowledgement of one by other people? Why
&gt;&gt;&gt; are they afraid of a concept that they say doesn't exist?

&gt;&gt;I'm not afraid of it, I just don't want it supported by ANY of my tax
&gt;&gt;money.

&gt; That is an argument I can live with. Let me ask you a question. If a
&gt; plaque is already in place, quite possibly for decades, do you support
&gt; your tax dollars being spent to remove just to make one group of
&gt; people happy? Should a community be allowed to have a majority
&gt; opinion on something like this or should it not be allowed if just one
&gt; person doesn't like it?

"/> I suppose you'd have to have strict construction for a while. Bite the
bullet now and the problem won't arise in future -- maybe. OTOH, it
seems stupid to remove the cross (representing the missions, which
undoubtedly had a major effect on California) from the Los Angeles
County Seal if it means replacing unused stuff like stationary, and I'm
pretty sure it's stupid even if it was done only by attrition.

&gt; the pulpit as to who to vote for either.

"/> Likewise. If you want to support your church, it should be with your
own dime. Likewise for Indians suddenly finding &quot;holy ground&quot; in land
that belongs to someone else, including public lands. It is not the
proper business of tax-supported agencies to support ANY religion.

The pedophiles in the church are overwhelmingly man on boy- not man on
girl. I was not saying that the priests are overwhelmingly homosexual.

The church teaches that you can naturally be attracted to anything not
conducive to procreation whether it be same sex, children, animals,
inanimate objects, etc. They teach to ask a higher power to help you
spiritually to conquer your vice. You are not supposed to ACT on the urge,
like you would restrain yourself from adultery, murder, etc. We all have
different weaknesses that are our personal demons to deal with and
homosexuality is just that.

impose their beliefs on everyone else, and the majority does
not have the right to impose their will on a minority if this will

So, if the state wants to deny recognition of marriage to any
group, it must justify this denial based on secular criteria

religious traditions.

Bestiality isn't illegal, nor is adultery along with lots of other vices.
Just cause it's not illegal doesn't make it moral or ethical. That is why
you have so many convoluted laws already. People think if there is no law
against it it must be ok.

I wasn't so much arguing the legal aspects as the moral. The fact that we
can restrain ourselves from our primal urges is what separates us from
animals. Otherwise we wouldn't have laws against raping, killing, stealing,
or anything else- we would have no soul or conscience to worry about, and
these would be arbitrary restrictions. Homosexuality is acting on a primal
urge. If it were right it would promote life, it does not. I believe you
can become attracted to someone that may not have been your first impulse,
it is called conditioning. If you lived in Africa you might really dig a
disk in the lip, in Japan the geisha look does it for many, and in the
carribean they are into tattooing. It may not be your initial choice but
you can come to be attracted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I just spoke with a colleague who has a broken foot. He went to one of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the better hospitals and he had to wait for 15 hours (I kid you not)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the emergency room. Another colleague of mine who used to be an EMT
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;overheard our conversation and said that even when he brought in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;patients in his ambulance, they would sometimes have to wait many hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for treatment, and this is for paying patients.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any idea why this is? Go read an ER's log book of patients seen.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many hospital publish statistics. The ER is for &quot;emergency&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; treatment. However, people know they can't get turned down at an ER
&gt;&gt;&gt; for not being able to pay so they flock to it with tons of stuff that
&gt;&gt;&gt; aren't an emergency. Stuff like little Johnny has a runny nose.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Add in the people who really have life-threatening issues, the lack of
&gt;&gt;&gt; staff and you have a real mess on your hands. Since a broken foot
&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't considered &quot;life-threatening&quot; he gets lumped in with the kids
&gt;&gt;&gt; with sore throats. So he sits &amp; waits.

&gt;&gt; Yup, and if more Americans could get treatment for minor conditions from
&gt;&gt; means other than an emergency room, this problem wouldn't be so severe.
&gt;&gt; That's a big problem with this so called &quot;system&quot; of medical care in the
&gt;&gt; United States. So many people who should be seeking treatment from
&gt;&gt; private doctors for minor conditions end up in the ER because they have
&gt;&gt; no other choice and that stresses ER resources and delays treatment for
&gt;&gt; people who have real emergencies.

&gt; Wrong answer. People can get free medical treatment for minor conditions.
&gt; There are free clinics all over the place.

"/> Then why did I see a woman being treated for a rash in the ER room of
a hospital in Northeast Philadelphia while I was standing by her while
waiting for my mother to be treated? Not long after I saw that woman
being treated, I also saw her casually walk out of the ER room.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What American health care system?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; patients in his ambulance, they would sometimes have to wait many
&gt; hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for treatment, and this is for paying patients.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's called triage. Those who are worse off get seen first.

&gt;&gt; True, I understand that, but it also sucks. Now I know about this first
&gt;&gt; hand. My mother had to be rushed to the hospital today (August 15). She
&gt;&gt; got to the ER at around 8:00am today after falling and breaking her left
&gt;&gt; leg and hip at home. My dad notified me by phone and I got to the ER
&gt;&gt; around 10:00am. My mom was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital in
&gt;&gt; Northeast Philadelphia. As I write this, my mother is still waiting for
&gt;&gt; surgery and she had to wait something like two hours to get her first
&gt;&gt; x-ray. That sucks!

&gt;&gt; My mom is in a lot of pain, despite being on a morphine drip. I spoke to
&gt;&gt; her around dinner time and she told me she was feeling pain. I do not
&gt;&gt; fault the hospital personnel for my mom's delayed surgery. Everyone I
&gt;&gt; encountered at this hospital seems to be concerned with doing the best
&gt;&gt; possible job. I was told that my mom will &quot;probably&quot; go into surgery
&gt;&gt; tomorrow (Monday) morning, but only if an operating room is available.
&gt;&gt; The operating schedule will not be available until tomorrow so they
&gt;&gt; could not even tell me a specific time when my mom's surgery would begin.
&gt;&gt; One of the people there told me it is entirely possible that my mom's
&gt;&gt; surgery (she needs to have a rod inserted to patch her leg) will be
&gt;&gt; delayed another day.

&gt;&gt; In the wealthiest country in the world, paying patients (which my mom
&gt;&gt; is) should not have to wait a full day for emergency surgery while
&gt;&gt; laying in pain. There is something definitely wrong with this system.
&gt;&gt; Ironically, the ER wasn't even particularly crowded while I was there.
&gt;&gt; There was a handful of people in the ER's waiting room. Everyone I saw
&gt;&gt; was obviously there for minor ailments. One woman was there for a rash.
&gt;&gt; Another young man wasn't feeling well. I suspect those minor cases went
&gt;&gt; to the ER because they could not afford treatment with a regular doctor
&gt;&gt; so they had to go to the ER where they had to be treated even if they
&gt;&gt; could not pay.

&gt;&gt; On the plus side my mom is not suffereing from a worse condition, such
&gt;&gt; as a heart attack. She is also awake and completely alert. What's more,
&gt;&gt; the doctor who was talking with my mom about her treatment when I walked
&gt;&gt; into her hospital room is a cute blonde woman, who looks a lot like Meg
&gt;&gt; Ryan. Too bad she's married.

&gt; I'm sorry to hear about your mother. I hope she recovers soon.

&gt; Now, the problem is, this country might not get to people fast, but imagine
&gt; how slow things are in those countries who can't even give a minor medical
&gt; examination in less than 9 months.

"/> There are several countries where I know that such conditions exist.
Iraq and Afghanistan come to mind. Don't think; however, that many
people here in the states can just walk to a physician's office to get a
routing check-up. I have excellent medical care through my employer, yet
I have to make an appointment months in advance with my doctor to get a
check-up. In fact, my employer's health plan was praised a few years ago
in one of the major financial magazines (I forget which one).

Some people in the states do have to wait months, even with good medical
insurance coverage. For example, I was very sick this past holiday
season. I started out with a serious cough which I self-treated and I
apparently had a reaction to OTC cough syrup which I bought on the way
home the day before Thanksgiving. On Thanksgiving day, I awoke with a
rash from head to toe with huge hives and I was itching like crazy. This
is the only time I was able to get a quick response from my doctor.
Fortunately, his diagnosis over the phone was exactly right and the
steroids he prescribed cleared up the rash the first day I took them. At
my doctor's request, I went to a private radiology service to get a lung
x-ray and I was diagnosed with pneumonia. Someone with no insurance
would not have been able to get such quality service. I was not
hospitalized, but in retrospect, I probably should have been. Obviously,
I lived though. I spent the better part of two weeks in bed and on high
doses of codein and some other meds. It was not fun and I do not
recommend it!

&gt; % to be as high as possible to make it appear more frequently

"/> For every gay person you've seen there are undoubtedly
others who're bisexual or gay, but either won't admit it or
won't give any indication of it in surveys. Kinsey's study
of male sexuality found 37% of men have had at least one
homosexual encounter to the point of orgasm. Most
credible studies I've seen put the number of people who
identify themselves as exclusively homosexual at around
5%, with twice as many identifying themselves as bisexual.
In any case the total number of people who have gay sex
on a regular basis is likely around 10%.

Great
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I just spoke with a colleague who has a broken foot. He went to one
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the better hospitals and he had to wait for 15 hours (I kid you
not)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the emergency room. Another colleague of mine who used to be an
EMT
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;overheard our conversation and said that even when he brought in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;patients in his ambulance, they would sometimes have to wait many
hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for treatment, and this is for paying patients.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any idea why this is? Go read an ER's log book of patients seen.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many hospital publish statistics. The ER is for &quot;emergency&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatment. However, people know they can't get turned down at an ER
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for not being able to pay so they flock to it with tons of stuff
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aren't an emergency. Stuff like little Johnny has a runny nose.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add in the people who really have life-threatening issues, the lack
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; staff and you have a real mess on your hands. Since a broken foot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't considered &quot;life-threatening&quot; he gets lumped in with the kids
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with sore throats. So he sits &amp; waits.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yup, and if more Americans could get treatment for minor conditions
from
&gt;&gt;&gt; means other than an emergency room, this problem wouldn't be so
severe.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a big problem with this so called &quot;system&quot; of medical care in
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; United States. So many people who should be seeking treatment from
&gt;&gt;&gt; private doctors for minor conditions end up in the ER because they
have
&gt;&gt;&gt; no other choice and that stresses ER resources and delays treatment
for
&gt;&gt;&gt; people who have real emergencies.

&gt;&gt; Wrong answer. People can get free medical treatment for minor
conditions.
&gt;&gt; There are free clinics all over the place.

&gt; Then why did I see a woman being treated for a rash in the ER room of
&gt; a hospital in Northeast Philadelphia while I was standing by her while
&gt; waiting for my mother to be treated? Not long after I saw that woman
&gt; being treated, I also saw her casually walk out of the ER room.

"/> Probably because that woman was on medicaid. When you're on medicaid,
there's little reason to wait for an appointment when you can go to the
emergency room. Also, just because there are free clinics doesn't mean that
people will go to them, and they cannot be forced out of a hospital to a
free clinic.

&gt;&gt; hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for treatment, and this is for paying patients.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's called triage. Those who are worse off get seen first.

&gt;&gt;&gt; True, I understand that, but it also sucks. Now I know about this
first
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand. My mother had to be rushed to the hospital today (August 15).
She
&gt;&gt;&gt; got to the ER at around 8:00am today after falling and breaking her
left
&gt;&gt;&gt; leg and hip at home. My dad notified me by phone and I got to the ER
&gt;&gt;&gt; around 10:00am. My mom was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Northeast Philadelphia. As I write this, my mother is still waiting
for
&gt;&gt;&gt; surgery and she had to wait something like two hours to get her first
&gt;&gt;&gt; x-ray. That sucks!

&gt;&gt;&gt; My mom is in a lot of pain, despite being on a morphine drip. I spoke
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; her around dinner time and she told me she was feeling pain. I do not
&gt;&gt;&gt; fault the hospital personnel for my mom's delayed surgery. Everyone I
&gt;&gt;&gt; encountered at this hospital seems to be concerned with doing the best
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible job. I was told that my mom will &quot;probably&quot; go into surgery
&gt;&gt;&gt; tomorrow (Monday) morning, but only if an operating room is available.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The operating schedule will not be available until tomorrow so they
&gt;&gt;&gt; could not even tell me a specific time when my mom's surgery would
begin.
&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the people there told me it is entirely possible that my mom's
&gt;&gt;&gt; surgery (she needs to have a rod inserted to patch her leg) will be
&gt;&gt;&gt; delayed another day.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the wealthiest country in the world, paying patients (which my mom
&gt;&gt;&gt; is) should not have to wait a full day for emergency surgery while
&gt;&gt;&gt; laying in pain. There is something definitely wrong with this system.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ironically, the ER wasn't even particularly crowded while I was there.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There was a handful of people in the ER's waiting room. Everyone I saw
&gt;&gt;&gt; was obviously there for minor ailments. One woman was there for a
rash.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Another young man wasn't feeling well. I suspect those minor cases
went
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the ER because they could not afford treatment with a regular
doctor
&gt;&gt;&gt; so they had to go to the ER where they had to be treated even if they
&gt;&gt;&gt; could not pay.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the plus side my mom is not suffereing from a worse condition, such
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a heart attack. She is also awake and completely alert. What's
more,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the doctor who was talking with my mom about her treatment when I
walked
&gt;&gt;&gt; into her hospital room is a cute blonde woman, who looks a lot like
Meg
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ryan. Too bad she's married.

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry to hear about your mother. I hope she recovers soon.

&gt;&gt; Now, the problem is, this country might not get to people fast, but
imagine
&gt;&gt; how slow things are in those countries who can't even give a minor
medical
&gt;&gt; examination in less than 9 months.

&gt; There are several countries where I know that such conditions exist.
&gt; Iraq and Afghanistan come to mind. Don't think; however, that many

&gt; people here in the states can just walk to a physician's office to get a

&gt; I have to make an appointment months in advance with my doctor to get a
&gt; check-up. In fact, my employer's health plan was praised a few years ago
&gt; in one of the major financial magazines (I forget which one).

"/> I have never had to wait more than a couple days to get a doctor appointment

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Some people in the states do have to wait months, even with good medical
&gt; insurance coverage. For example, I was very sick this past holiday
&gt; season. I started out with a serious cough which I self-treated and I
&gt; apparently had a reaction to OTC cough syrup which I bought on the way
&gt; home the day before Thanksgiving. On Thanksgiving day, I awoke with a
&gt; rash from head to toe with huge hives and I was itching like crazy. This
&gt; is the only time I was able to get a quick response from my doctor.
&gt; Fortunately, his diagnosis over the phone was exactly right and the
&gt; steroids he prescribed cleared up the rash the first day I took them. At
&gt; my doctor's request, I went to a private radiology service to get a lung
&gt; x-ray and I was diagnosed with pneumonia. Someone with no insurance
&gt; would not have been able to get such quality service. I was not
&gt; hospitalized, but in retrospect, I probably should have been. Obviously,
&gt; I lived though. I spent the better part of two weeks in bed and on high
&gt; doses of codein and some other meds. It was not fun and I do not
&gt; recommend it!

"/> You are definitely incorrect on that. People with no insurance can and do
get that level of medical care every day. They do have avenues, you just
overlook them to bash the current system in order to propagate interest in
your obvious agenda. If you had your way, you would be paying for my
medical care, and my drugs. I can very well afford them myself, so how is
that fair to you? The answer is, it's not. The whole medical care issue is
a method to falsely show people how poorly treated they are, and to get them
to side with a political party, not because it is an actual ill that is
perpetrated on anyone. When you see through the BS political rhetoric that
both parties spew, you get a real picture of how corrupt our politicians
really are.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe the effect on American society will mirror that of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other countries -- it will have a conservative effect. Hetero
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;couples won't notice any difference at all, while gay couples
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will finally be accorded the same 1000+ federal and state
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights granted by legally recognized marriage. These rights
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cover a lot of areas many people haven't considered:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inheritance, immigration, child adoption and custody,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hospital and prison visitation, taxation, insurance etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would yo think the legitimization of deviant sexual activity
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a conservative effect?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Deviant is a loaded word. While homosexuals do comprise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a minority, &quot;deviant&quot; conjures up all sorts of negative (and in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many cases religious and/or erroneous) connotations, e.g.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the misconception that homosexuality is a choice instead of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an orientation, that homosexuality involves pedophilia or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other forms of victimization or illegal activity, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether or not you were born with the defective gene that gives you
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stiffy when looking at some guys fat hairy ass or not doesn't
matter.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes you have a sexual attraction. It is when you act on it, engage
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the activity, that defines you. In the natural order of things
makes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you a deviant. Just because the word has other meaning that is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; germane.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure it's germane. There are no laws against homosexuality.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The quesiton of whether a given sexual practice deviates from
&gt;&gt;&gt; the norm is unrelated to the question of whether it's legal.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There are hundreds of &quot;deviant&quot; sexual groups -- heterosexual
&gt;&gt;&gt; transvestites, people with fetishes, and on and on. Simply
&gt;&gt;&gt; because a given activity deviates from the norm is not adequate
&gt;&gt;&gt; justification to declare it illegal, or to deny marriage rights to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the group doing the activity. The state must prove a compelling
&gt;&gt;&gt; interest based on other criteria, such as whether a given practice
&gt;&gt;&gt; entails victimization, illegal activities etc.

&gt;&gt; No, you're wrong. The fact that there are no laws against something
does
&gt;&gt; not mean much of anything.

&gt; It means everything, at least with regard to the state denying
&gt; marriage rights to a given group. In every case (incestual
&gt; relationships, marriage to minors etc) the denial of marriage
&gt; rights is justifiable because their activities are illegal, not
&gt; because they simply differ from the norm.

&gt;&gt; The argument that homosexuals are somehow
&gt;&gt; genetically programmed to be that way also holds little water, since
there
&gt;&gt; is just as much evidence, if not more to the contrary. Thus, it remains
an
&gt;&gt; issue of whether or not people believe it to be a choice. I would say
that
&gt;&gt; there is a group of homosexuals that have chosen to be that way,
otherwise
&gt;&gt; there would not be a group of homosexuals who have chosen to be
&gt;&gt; heterosexuals.

&gt; Who would that group be? If you're talking about so-called
&gt;&quot;conversion therapy&quot; groups, suicide rates in these programs
&gt; are often higher than their &quot;success&quot; rates. And the few who
&gt; are able to &quot;cure&quot; themselves of homosexuality weren't gay
&gt; to begin with -- they were simply confused.

"/> Well, prove my point why don't you. Whether or not they are genetically
programed or they are &quot;confused&quot; has little bearing on the issue. Whether
it's a choice or not, it is an issue that has become hotly disputed. The
problem is, there is no way to prove that those doctors saying that it's a
genetic difference are not trying to advance some agenda any more than there
is to say that about doctors on the other side. It's one of those issues
that people will disagree with until there is solid, unmistakable evidence
of.

&gt; But don't take my word for it, read what the American

&gt;&gt; The number who choose and the number who are possibly
&gt;&gt; biologically compelled is also a difficult issue to determine.

&gt; It's difficult only for those who haven't done the research.
&gt; Whether it's determined before or shortly after birth, sexual
&gt; orientation is as hard-wired for homosexuals as it is for
&gt; heterosexuals. You can easily do your own research on this
&gt; by asking your gay friends or relatives (if you have any)
&gt; whether they choose to be gay. They'll likely respond by
&gt; asking you whether you choose to be heterosexual.

"/> That proves nothing. Their response, no matter how they have become that
way, is hardly likely to give credence to those claims that would work
against them in the public eye.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The GAY movement has done nothing to disassociate itself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from NAMBLA.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's an outrageous and completely false claim. First of all,
&gt;&gt;&gt; NAMBLA was never anything more than a few dozen men in
&gt;&gt;&gt; their forties and fifties with bad combovers who claimed child
&gt;&gt;&gt; molestation is somehow a protected civil right. No one except
&gt;&gt;&gt; the FBI ever took them seriously -- in fact their worst critics
&gt;&gt;&gt; are and always have been gay advocacy groups, since it
&gt;&gt;&gt; reinforces the erroneous/right-wing/hot button stereotype that
&gt;&gt;&gt; a greater percentage of gay people are pedophiles compared
&gt;&gt;&gt; to heterosexuals. The FBI tells us that claim is untrue.

&gt;&gt; NAMBLA is denounced by the gay community rarely enough to allow the
belief
&gt;&gt; to continue that they don't denounce them. This may be the fault of the
&gt;&gt; press, but it is still an issue that they should probably address
publicly
&gt;&gt; enough to get the word out.

&gt; Again, if you haven't heard denunciation of NAMBLA from
&gt; gay advocacy groups, it's because you haven't been listening.
&gt; Look up policy statements from GLAAD, P-FLAG or any
&gt; other major gay advocacy group.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Second of all, NAMBLA's issue is unrelated to same-sex
&gt;&gt;&gt; marriage, or homosexuality per se.

&gt;&gt; Other than NAMBLA would have to jump on the bandwagon that it is okay to
&gt;&gt; have sex with young boys, and marry them.

&gt; It's an age issue, not a gender issue. A group of men who were
&gt; claiming sex with minor girls is a protected civil right would be
&gt; laughed out of court the exact same way NAMBLA is.

"/> I'm not saying that it's not laughable and totally insane. I'm just saying
that they would have to support the homosexual agenda in order to advance
their own agenda.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Third of all, for all practical purposes they no longer exist as
&gt;&gt;&gt; an organization in the U.S. Last I heard they still have a
&gt;&gt;&gt; website, hosted on a foreign ISP, and a single mailbox which,
&gt;&gt;&gt; if I had to guess is directed to or at least monitored by the FBI.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And lastly, NAMBLA is far from being the world's largest
&gt;&gt;&gt; organization of pedophiles. That dubious honor goes to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Roman Catholic Church.

&gt;&gt; That's a low blow, and totally false. There is no church sanctioned
&gt;&gt; pedophelia in the Catholic Church. I've never been at a single Catholic
&gt;&gt; service and I can tell you that.

&gt; Whether it's sanctioned or not isn't the issue. The fact remains,
&gt; the Catholic Church contains the largest number of pedophiles
&gt; of any organization on Earth, and they've consistently protected
&gt; their pedophiles from civil prosecution.

"/> I would like to see statistics on that. The Catholic church is probably one
of the largest organizations on earth, if not THE largest, and therefore
it's safe to bet that there will be a higher number of pedophiles in their
ranks, but without converting that to a percentage, you are advancing
Democrat math again. That's like saying that group A which has 500,000
members and 10 pedophiles, when compared to group B which has 100 members
and 1 pedophile has a higher number of pedophiles when in reality group A
has 0.00002% of its members as pedophiles where group B has 1% of it's
members as pedophiles. That is an acceptable comparison for a Democrat, but
as for me, I rather like to deal in real numbers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once cause plan A is brought to realization then it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to plans B, C &amp; D for them. Major slippery slope, yes. But a slope
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nonetheless.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The bottom line is, there are no laws in America against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexuality. So even if it is deviant, it's also completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;legal. Being deviant therefore is not sufficient justification to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deny legal marriage rights to gay people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yup, land of the free, home of the brave. You are right that stand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alone it isn't sufficient justification. It is just a component we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are discussing now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As to why I believe the effect on society would be conservative,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all one has to do is look at any of the other countries that have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recognized same-sex marriages or civil unions. Or simply think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;about the issue logically. Why would the effect be anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other than conservative?

&gt;&gt; The pedophiles in the church are overwhelmingly man on boy- not man on

&gt; ...and that's because a much larger percentage of priests

&gt; It's not that homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles,
&gt; it's that homosexuals are found in much greater percentages
&gt; among Catholic priests.

&gt;&gt; I was not saying that the priests are overwhelmingly homosexual.

&gt;&gt; The church teaches that you can naturally be attracted to anything not
&gt;&gt; conducive to procreation whether it be same sex, children, animals,
&gt;&gt; inanimate objects, etc. They teach to ask a higher power to help you
&gt;&gt; spiritually to conquer your vice. You are not supposed to ACT on the
urge,
&gt;&gt; like you would restrain yourself from adultery, murder, etc. We all
have
&gt;&gt; different weaknesses that are our personal demons to deal with and
&gt;&gt; homosexuality is just that.

&gt; Maybe in your opinion, maybe in the opinion of the Catholic
&gt; Church, and maybe even in the opinion of a majority of
&gt; Americans. None of which makes any difference to the
&gt; issue at hand.

&gt; Unlike pedophilia, beastiality and most of the other things
&gt; you mention, homosexuality does not involve victimization
&gt; nor does it involve a lack of legal consent. In fact it doesn't
&gt; involve anything illegal. If it did, DOMA laws would be
&gt; easily justifiable and the entire question of legal recognition
&gt; of same-sex marriage would be moot.

"/> DOMA is constitutional as it allows the states to determine what it defines
as a legally binding marriage. The states already had that right, the
federal government should not have even weighed in. They did, and they just
made it known that it's stand was the same as what is constitutionally
allowable already.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Americans have the right to live their lives according to
&gt; whatever religious traditions they choose, or no religious

&gt; impose their beliefs on everyone else, and the majority does

&gt; violates the civil and/or constitutional rights of the minority.
&gt; So, if the state wants to deny recognition of marriage to any
&gt; group, it must justify this denial based on secular criteria
&gt; (equal protection and application of the law etc) and not
&gt; religious traditions.

"/> Yes, but public traditions that are secular are completely relevant. The
Supreme Court has regularly used the history and traditions argument to
define those rights that are fundamental. Since the history and traditions
of the world, much less the US are totally opposite of what the homosexual
agenda stands for, it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will find
that the right of homosexual marriage is a fundamental right, and therefore
a state only has to have a rational relation to its laws. That means that
any reason will work.

&gt; Pedophiles go for easy prey. Again, it's coincidental that a
&gt; larger percentage of &quot;these homosexuals&quot; are pedophiles.

"/> Without statistics to show heterosexual vs. homosexual pedophelia in the
Catholic Church, it's difficult to say who is right. You are assuming that
you are right because there is a high percentage of homosexuals, but unless
you have percentages of homosexual pedophelia and heterosexual pedophelia
compared with percentage of homosexual vs. heterosexual priests, it's
difficult to verify on either side of the argument. Since it's unlikely
that a homosexual priest is going to confess his homosexuality since it
would put him outside the teachings of his church, it's almost impossible to
get proper numbers to do such a comparison.

&gt;&gt; Bestiality isn't illegal, nor is adultery along with lots of other
vices.
&gt;&gt; Just cause it's not illegal doesn't make it moral or ethical. That is
why
&gt;&gt; you have so many convoluted laws already. People think if there is no
law
&gt;&gt; against it it must be ok.

&gt; Well, you'll need to explain why e.g. oral sex between opposite sex
&gt; couples is somehow less of a &quot;vice&quot; than sex between two people
&gt; of the same gender. You're being *very* selective about what you
&gt; deem immoral or unethical.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans have the right to live their lives according to
&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever religious traditions they choose, or no religious
&gt;&gt;&gt; tradition at all. One church does not have the right to
&gt;&gt;&gt; impose their beliefs on everyone else, and the majority does

&gt;&gt;&gt; group, it must justify this denial based on secular criteria
&gt;&gt;&gt; (equal protection and application of the law etc) and not
&gt;&gt;&gt; religious traditions.

&gt;&gt; I wasn't so much arguing the legal aspects as the moral. The fact
that we
&gt;&gt; can restrain ourselves from our primal urges is what separates us from
&gt;&gt; animals. Otherwise we wouldn't have laws against raping, killing,
stealing,
&gt;&gt; or anything else- we would have no soul or conscience to worry about,
and
&gt;&gt; these would be arbitrary restrictions. Homosexuality is acting on a
primal
&gt;&gt; urge.

&gt; And heterosexuality isn't?? Again your double standard is
&gt; absolutely ridiculous. And again, when it comes to denying
&gt; rights to a given group, the state must base the denial on
&gt; secular law, not on religious tradition. Homosexuality is legal,
&gt; unlike rape, murder, stealing etc. So if YOU believe it's
&gt; immoral, that is nobody's problem but your own. You do not
&gt; have the right to impose your belief on gay people, or on
&gt; society as a whole, or to base the denial of rights to gay
&gt; people on your belief.

&gt;&gt; If it were right it would promote life, it does not.

&gt; See above. According to your criteria the state should deny
&gt; marriage licenses to infertile opposite sex couples, and it
&gt; should outlaw oral sex and every other kind of sex that
&gt; doesn't produce pregnancy. Your double standard is
&gt; ridiculous, and obvious.

&gt;&gt; I believe you
&gt;&gt; can become attracted to someone that may not have been your first
impulse,
&gt;&gt; it is called conditioning. If you lived in Africa you might really dig
a
&gt;&gt; disk in the lip, in Japan the geisha look does it for many, and in the
&gt;&gt; carribean they are into tattooing. It may not be your initial choice
but
&gt;&gt; you can come to be attracted.

&gt; If you seriously believe gay people are &quot;conditioned&quot; to be
&gt; that way, you haven't been paying attention to what
&gt; psychiatrists, psychologists and others who know about
&gt; this issue have been telling us for the last 40 years. Read
&gt; the following, read it carefully, then kindly respond to it:
&gt; http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html

"/> Again with the APA. Maybe you could show us a website about what Stalin
believes and advanced. It would be just as believable.

What makes homosexual marriage any different than plural marriage as far as
whether or not it should be considered a fundamental right. It seems to me
that for your argument to hold up, laws barring plural marriage would also
have to fall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's true that nature makes at least 90% of us heterosexual,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and has always done so. As to why it makes the rest of us
&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexual and bisexual, your guess is as good as mine.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe its a natural form of population control. Who knows
&gt;&gt;&gt;for sure? In my view it's ridiculous for religion, the state or
&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone else to pretend to know the answer or answers to
&gt;&gt;&gt;the question.

&gt;&gt;&gt;BTW homosexuality has been observed in hundreds of
&gt;&gt;&gt;animal species. One rather humorous example:
&gt;&gt;&gt;http://www.sensualism.com/gay/

&gt;&gt;&gt;You can call it abnormal, but it's definitely not unnatural.

&gt;&gt; You might be right. Could be natures version of selection of the
&gt;&gt; species. Weed out the bad genetic material.

&gt; If that were true, homosexuality would have become
&gt; extinct a long, long time ago. The fact that gay sex
&gt; doesn't result in procreation doesn't seem to have had
&gt; any effect on the numbers of gay people.

&gt;&gt; Although I am not 100%
&gt;&gt; sure I buy into the &quot;born that way&quot; argument. More then likely a
&gt;&gt; combination of genetics, environment, and quite possibly low will
&gt;&gt; power.

&gt; I suspect it takes a lot more will power to be homosexual
&gt; in an overwhelmingly heterosexual society than it takes to
&gt; be heterosexual, and most of the gay people I know are as
&gt; genuinely disgusted by hetero sex as most heteros are by
&gt; gay sex. So I'm not sure why you believe will power has
&gt; anything to do with it.

"/> I don't know about that. It has become almost a fad to be gay in this
country. Years ago, it would be hidden to the point that it was difficult
to know if one was homosexual. Today, it has become almost as acceptable as
a tatoo. While not preferred by the majority, people generally don't say
much about it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In the past I think there may have been the same general
&gt;&gt; percentage of homosexuals in the population, but they weren't
&gt;&gt; practicing. I also don't buy into the 10% number. The Gays want that
&gt;&gt; % to be as high as possible to make it appear more frequently
&gt;&gt; occurring then it really is. Most current data on the subject says 2
&gt;&gt; - 3 % with an absolute maximum ceiling of 4%. Seems right based on
&gt;&gt; the number I've seen in my personal experience. My couple of years in
&gt;&gt; the Bay area aside.

&gt; For every gay person you've seen there are undoubtedly
&gt; others who're bisexual or gay, but either won't admit it or
&gt; won't give any indication of it in surveys. Kinsey's study
&gt; of male sexuality found 37% of men have had at least one
&gt; homosexual encounter to the point of orgasm. Most
&gt; credible studies I've seen put the number of people who
&gt; identify themselves as exclusively homosexual at around
&gt; 5%, with twice as many identifying themselves as bisexual.
&gt; In any case the total number of people who have gay sex
&gt; on a regular basis is likely around 10%.

"/> Gay sex and being homosexual aren't necessarily linked when we're talking
about gay marriage. Bisexual, or experimental men are hardly as likely
going to jump on the bandwagon to go get hitched to another man.

&gt;&gt; BTW Rick, you said you no longer had me on your blocked list. Why did
you
&gt;&gt; not reply to my proof that your 80% number supportive of abortion was
&gt;&gt; terribly incorrect? I figure that since you stated 80% as though it was
&gt;&gt; fact, you would have some evidence to back that number up.

&gt; I pointed you to my reference twice:
&gt; http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm

&gt; Almost every poll shows an outright ban on abortion is
&gt; supported only by 15-20% of the American people. The
&gt; other 80% want it kept legal in all or some cases.

"/> Okay, taking a look at that poll, it hardly supports your theory of 80%.
The first poll alone shows that only 54% believe it should be legal at all.

Then the second poll shows that 1/4 of the country believes it should not be
permitted at all, and 37% of people believe there should be stricter limits.
That's 62% that are probably more on my side than yours. Stricter limits
with most people means that it should be illegal except in cases of rape,
incest or life of the mother. I believe it should be only for the life of
the mother, but that doesn't show actually what they believe are good
reasons and which are not.

Then the third shows that 47% say they are more pro-life and only 44% are
pro-choice.

You have given me a page that has no support for an 80% claim. You also
have given a page with so much polling data that is all over the map that
it's hard to come to a real conclusion. Some say a higher percentage are
pro-life, while others state the opposite. It would appear that the
question of which way the public believe is more an issue of who takes the
poll than of what the people actually think. Just take a look at the
CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll compared to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.
The partial birth abortion part in particular is wholly indicative of what
I'm talking about. There was a difference in the numbers of people
questioned of 3. NBC shows that 47% are in favor of it, and 40% oppose it,
while one month earlier the CNN poll shows that only 25% believe it should
be legal while 68% oppose it. The ABC poll would seem to suggest that CNN
was right since their numbers are quite similar, but who is right? I don't
think any objective person could easily decide. But an objective person can
easily decide that not a singel poll on that page supports your 80% claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt; girl.

&gt;&gt; ...and that's because a much larger percentage of priests
&gt;&gt; (relative to the population as a whole) are homosexual.
&gt;&gt; It's not that homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles,
&gt;&gt; it's that homosexuals are found in much greater percentages
&gt;&gt; among Catholic priests.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was not saying that the priests are overwhelmingly homosexual.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The church teaches that you can naturally be attracted to anything not
&gt;&gt;&gt; conducive to procreation whether it be same sex, children, animals,
&gt;&gt;&gt; inanimate objects, etc. They teach to ask a higher power to help you
&gt;&gt;&gt; spiritually to conquer your vice. You are not supposed to ACT on the
&gt; urge,
&gt;&gt;&gt; like you would restrain yourself from adultery, murder, etc. We all
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; different weaknesses that are our personal demons to deal with and
&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuality is just that.

&gt;&gt; Maybe in your opinion, maybe in the opinion of the Catholic
&gt;&gt; Church, and maybe even in the opinion of a majority of
&gt;&gt; Americans. None of which makes any difference to the
&gt;&gt; issue at hand.

&gt;&gt; Unlike pedophilia, beastiality and most of the other things
&gt;&gt; you mention, homosexuality does not involve victimization
&gt;&gt; nor does it involve a lack of legal consent. In fact it doesn't
&gt;&gt; involve anything illegal. If it did, DOMA laws would be
&gt;&gt; easily justifiable and the entire question of legal recognition
&gt;&gt; of same-sex marriage would be moot.

&gt; DOMA is constitutional as it allows the states to determine what it defines
&gt; as a legally binding marriage. The states already had that right, the
&gt; federal government should not have even weighed in. They did, and they just
&gt; made it known that it's stand was the same as what is constitutionally
&gt; allowable already.

"/> Time will tell about your assumptions. Fifty years ago the
same thing was thought about interracial marriages. States
do not have the right to make or enforce laws which violate
the Constitution.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Americans have the right to live their lives according to
&gt;&gt; whatever religious traditions they choose, or no religious
&gt;&gt; tradition at all. One church does not have the right to
&gt;&gt; impose their beliefs on everyone else, and the majority does
&gt;&gt; not have the right to impose their will on a minority if this will
&gt;&gt; violates the civil and/or constitutional rights of the minority.
&gt;&gt; So, if the state wants to deny recognition of marriage to any
&gt;&gt; group, it must justify this denial based on secular criteria
&gt;&gt; (equal protection and application of the law etc) and not
&gt;&gt; religious traditions.

&gt; Yes, but public traditions that are secular are completely relevant. The
&gt; Supreme Court has regularly used the history and traditions argument to
&gt; define those rights that are fundamental.

"/> And just as often the Supreme Court has reminded us that
the Constitution is a living document, not a static one. Rules
change. It was historical and traditional in the U.S. to own
African-Americans as slaves. Didn't make slavery any more
constitutional. It was historical and traditional for women to
not have the right to vote. Didn't make the denial of this right
any more constitutional. It was historical and traditional to
deny marriage rights to interracial couples. Didn't make
miscegenation laws any more constitutional. And on and on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since the history and traditions
&gt; of the world, much less the US are totally opposite of what the homosexual
&gt; agenda stands for, it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will find
&gt; that the right of homosexual marriage is a fundamental right, and therefore
&gt; a state only has to have a rational relation to its laws. That means that
&gt; any reason will work.

"/> You must have a very strange notion of what the &quot;homosexual
agenda&quot; is. All they're asking for is equal protection and
application of the law, as promised by the 14th Amendment.
Do gay people have their share of radical fringe groups? You
bet. But judging this entire movement on the actions of these
few groups isn't fair, or even logical. It's like judging the equal
rights movement of African-Americans during the 1960's on
the actions of the Black Panthers. These fringe groups aren't
representative, and in most cases they're counterproductive.
But they're the ones who always, ALWAYS get the airtime
on Fox News.

&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW Rick, you said you no longer had me on your blocked list. Why did
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; not reply to my proof that your 80% number supportive of abortion was
&gt;&gt;&gt; terribly incorrect? I figure that since you stated 80% as though it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact, you would have some evidence to back that number up.

&gt;&gt; I pointed you to my reference twice:
&gt;&gt; http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm

&gt;&gt; Almost every poll shows an outright ban on abortion is
&gt;&gt; supported only by 15-20% of the American people. The
&gt;&gt; other 80% want it kept legal in all or some cases.

&gt; Okay, taking a look at that poll, it hardly supports your theory of 80%.
&gt; The first poll alone shows that only 54% believe it should be legal at all.

&gt; Then the second poll shows that 1/4 of the country believes it should not be
&gt; permitted at all, and 37% of people believe there should be stricter limits.
&gt; That's 62% that are probably more on my side than yours. Stricter limits
&gt; with most people means that it should be illegal except in cases of rape,
&gt; incest or life of the mother. I believe it should be only for the life of
&gt; the mother, but that doesn't show actually what they believe are good
&gt; reasons and which are not.

&gt; Then the third shows that 47% say they are more pro-life and only 44% are
&gt; pro-choice.

&gt; You have given me a page that has no support for an 80% claim. You also
&gt; have given a page with so much polling data that is all over the map that
&gt; it's hard to come to a real conclusion. Some say a higher percentage are
&gt; pro-life, while others state the opposite. It would appear that the
&gt; question of which way the public believe is more an issue of who takes the
&gt; poll than of what the people actually think. Just take a look at the
&gt; CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll compared to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.
&gt; The partial birth abortion part in particular is wholly indicative of what
&gt; I'm talking about. There was a difference in the numbers of people
&gt; questioned of 3. NBC shows that 47% are in favor of it, and 40% oppose it,
&gt; while one month earlier the CNN poll shows that only 25% believe it should
&gt; be legal while 68% oppose it. The ABC poll would seem to suggest that CNN
&gt; was right since their numbers are quite similar, but who is right? I don't
&gt; think any objective person could easily decide. But an objective person can
&gt; easily decide that not a singel poll on that page supports your 80% claim.

"/> The original point I made is that only 15-20% support the
current platform of the Republican Party, i.e. no abortions,
no exceptions. With the exception of one (taken of
Catholics, which showed 25% support), every one of the
polls show only between 15-20% support for that specific
position.

And the results of a poll have a lot more to do with the way
questions are asked than who's taking it. E.g. look at the
way Fox News phrases their poll questions. It obviously
leads respondants to answers they prefer to hear.

&gt; something wonderfully witty:
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; You might be right. Could be natures version of selection of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; species. Weed out the bad genetic material.

&gt;&gt;If that were true, homosexuality would have become
&gt;&gt;extinct a long, long time ago. The fact that gay sex
&gt;&gt;doesn't result in procreation doesn't seem to have had
&gt;&gt;any effect on the numbers of gay people.

&gt; That only gives more support to my argument that it isn't all genetic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Although I am not 100%
&gt;&gt;&gt; sure I buy into the &quot;born that way&quot; argument. More then likely a
&gt;&gt;&gt; combination of genetics, environment, and quite possibly low will
&gt;&gt;&gt; power.

&gt;&gt;I suspect it takes a lot more will power to be homosexual
&gt;&gt;in an overwhelmingly heterosexual society than it takes to
&gt;&gt;be heterosexual, and most of the gay people I know are as
&gt;&gt;genuinely disgusted by hetero sex as most heteros are by
&gt;&gt;gay sex. So I'm not sure why you believe will power has
&gt;&gt;anything to do with it.

&gt; Because I truly believe that an attraction is not a defining
&gt; characteristic. It is that action(s) that are. I could be attracted
&gt; to robbing that bank down on the corner. I could think about robbing
&gt; it daily. However, that doesn't make me a bank robber until I engage
&gt; in the activity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the past I think there may have been the same general
&gt;&gt;&gt; percentage of homosexuals in the population, but they weren't
&gt;&gt;&gt; practicing. I also don't buy into the 10% number. The Gays want that
&gt;&gt;&gt; % to be as high as possible to make it appear more frequently
&gt;&gt;&gt; occurring then it really is. Most current data on the subject says 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; - 3 % with an absolute maximum ceiling of 4%. Seems right based on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the number I've seen in my personal experience. My couple of years in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Bay area aside.

&gt;&gt;For every gay person you've seen there are undoubtedly
&gt;&gt;others who're bisexual or gay, but either won't admit it or
&gt;&gt;won't give any indication of it in surveys. Kinsey's study
&gt;&gt;of male sexuality found 37% of men have had at least one
&gt;&gt;homosexual encounter to the point of orgasm. Most
&gt;&gt;credible studies I've seen put the number of people who
&gt;&gt;identify themselves as exclusively homosexual at around
&gt;&gt;5%, with twice as many identifying themselves as bisexual.
&gt;&gt;In any case the total number of people who have gay sex
&gt;&gt;on a regular basis is likely around 10%.

&gt; I can provide you with all sorts of links to studies, theories, and
&gt; statistical charts, but I think that wouldn't do much to change your
&gt; mind. I 100% agree that there are more of anything then most people
&gt; come in contact with be it Gays or anything else. Hell look at the
&gt; twice married Governor of NJ. That is one out of fifty. How many
&gt; other Gay Governors are there out there?

&gt; With the exception of the Bay area, the number of Gays that I am
&gt; either aware of or have come in contact with is a whole lot closer to
&gt; 1%. If your primary association is with Gays you are going to think
&gt; the numbers are higher. There are major population centers with very
&gt; large Gay communities. However, they are not even close to a major
&gt; representation of the population on a whole. If an alien sociologist
&gt; was to land in San Francisco he would think the number of Gay's in our
&gt; population is quite high. He might draw a different conclusion after
&gt; landing in Salt Lake City. Even simply drawing a conclusion based on
&gt; a random sampling of the US would not give you a valid idea on
&gt; percentages of the world population.

"/> I had to laugh at that last paragraph. Did you know there
are more gay bars in Salt Lake City UT than there are in
San Jose CA? And San Jose has almost four times as
many people.

Being forced to marry is illegal whether or not it's a polygamist marriage,
and just because the group that was discriminated against at the time were
the Mormons, that was their choice to discriminate according to sex, but as
long as it is legal for a man or a woman to have multiple wives and
husbands, it is not unconstitutional. It is no more legal in this country
for a man to have 20 wives than it is for a woman to have 20 husbands. If

marriage. It's that simple. Like it or don't, I don't see any self
respecting Supreme Court finding a fundamental right to homosexual marriage.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who are overwhelmingly homosexual

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not overwhelmingly, but one study from 2001 showed almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half of the men in Catholic seminaries are active homosexuals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The pedophiles in the church are overwhelmingly man on boy- not
man on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; girl.

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...and that's because a much larger percentage of priests
&gt;&gt;&gt; (relative to the population as a whole) are homosexual.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not that homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles,
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's that homosexuals are found in much greater percentages
&gt;&gt;&gt; among Catholic priests.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was not saying that the priests are overwhelmingly homosexual.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The church teaches that you can naturally be attracted to anything
not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conducive to procreation whether it be same sex, children, animals,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inanimate objects, etc. They teach to ask a higher power to help
you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spiritually to conquer your vice. You are not supposed to ACT on
the
&gt;&gt; urge,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like you would restrain yourself from adultery, murder, etc. We all
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different weaknesses that are our personal demons to deal with and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuality is just that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe in your opinion, maybe in the opinion of the Catholic
&gt;&gt;&gt; Church, and maybe even in the opinion of a majority of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans. None of which makes any difference to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; issue at hand.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unlike pedophilia, beastiality and most of the other things
&gt;&gt;&gt; you mention, homosexuality does not involve victimization
&gt;&gt;&gt; nor does it involve a lack of legal consent. In fact it doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; involve anything illegal. If it did, DOMA laws would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; easily justifiable and the entire question of legal recognition
&gt;&gt;&gt; of same-sex marriage would be moot.

&gt;&gt; DOMA is constitutional as it allows the states to determine what it
defines
&gt;&gt; as a legally binding marriage. The states already had that right, the
&gt;&gt; federal government should not have even weighed in. They did, and they
just
&gt;&gt; made it known that it's stand was the same as what is constitutionally
&gt;&gt; allowable already.

&gt; Time will tell about your assumptions. Fifty years ago the
&gt; same thing was thought about interracial marriages. States
&gt; do not have the right to make or enforce laws which violate
&gt; the Constitution.

"/> That was not the same. Blacks have always had a fundamental right to marry,
and whites as well. There has always been interracial marriage, and there
is no reason to justify discrimination like that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans have the right to live their lives according to
&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever religious traditions they choose, or no religious
&gt;&gt;&gt; tradition at all. One church does not have the right to
&gt;&gt;&gt; impose their beliefs on everyone else, and the majority does
&gt;&gt;&gt; not have the right to impose their will on a minority if this will
&gt;&gt;&gt; violates the civil and/or constitutional rights of the minority.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So, if the state wants to deny recognition of marriage to any
&gt;&gt;&gt; group, it must justify this denial based on secular criteria
&gt;&gt;&gt; (equal protection and application of the law etc) and not
&gt;&gt;&gt; religious traditions.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but public traditions that are secular are completely relevant.
The
&gt;&gt; Supreme Court has regularly used the history and traditions argument to
&gt;&gt; define those rights that are fundamental.

&gt; And just as often the Supreme Court has reminded us that
&gt; the Constitution is a living document, not a static one. Rules
&gt; change. It was historical and traditional in the U.S. to own
&gt; African-Americans as slaves. Didn't make slavery any more

"/> Yes, but we are talking about those traditions and history that predate the
constitution itself. History and tradition from 10 years ago can hardly be
used to determine the fundamentality of rights. Slavery was not denied by
the courts, it was denied by the legislature and President Lincoln. In
fact, there are many cases where the Supreme Court upheld slavery in the US.
It wasn't until blacks were deemed free that their rights in this country
could be realized.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; constitutional. It was historical and traditional for women to
&gt; not have the right to vote. Didn't make the denial of this right
&gt; any more constitutional. It was historical and traditional to
&gt; deny marriage rights to interracial couples. Didn't make
&gt; miscegenation laws any more constitutional. And on and on.

"/> The right for women to vote was also not granted by the courts. Legislature
did it. Interracial marriage is an issue of equal protection. Where it was
already considered a fundamental right for a man to marry a woman of his
choosing, there was a disparity in discriminating against similarly situated
people. This is a far cry from condoning a right that never existed in the
history of man.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Since the history and traditions
&gt;&gt; of the world, much less the US are totally opposite of what the
homosexual
&gt;&gt; agenda stands for, it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will
find
&gt;&gt; that the right of homosexual marriage is a fundamental right, and
therefore
&gt;&gt; a state only has to have a rational relation to its laws. That means
that
&gt;&gt; any reason will work.

&gt; You must have a very strange notion of what the &quot;homosexual
&gt; agenda&quot; is. All they're asking for is equal protection and
&gt; application of the law, as promised by the 14th Amendment.

"/> That only holds true if they can prove that somehow two people of the same
sex are similarly situated to those of opposite sex. Where there is the
overwhelming majority of people of opposite sex who can procreate, and it is
a given that two homosexuals will not, that is a great weight on the side of
it not being a similarly situated class. It is not in the pervue of the
state to promote those social situations that do not result in procreation.
Thus the protection of marriage, and the dissimilarity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Do gay people have their share of radical fringe groups? You
&gt; bet. But judging this entire movement on the actions of these
&gt; few groups isn't fair, or even logical. It's like judging the equal
&gt; rights movement of African-Americans during the 1960's on
&gt; the actions of the Black Panthers. These fringe groups aren't
&gt; representative, and in most cases they're counterproductive.
&gt; But they're the ones who always, ALWAYS get the airtime
&gt; on Fox News.

"/> That's because they are the only ones who will appear on FOX news.

Anyway, I'm not judging anyone on the actions of a few. Stereotypes are not
why this issue is so debated. It has deep roots in the psychie of the vast
majority of people, and while they may not be opposed to civil unions, they
are very opposed to gay marriage. Given this, it is likely that most
non-agenda driven courts will find a very good reason to deny it, and most
likely it will be consistent with what I have said.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW Rick, you said you no longer had me on your blocked list. Why
did
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not reply to my proof that your 80% number supportive of abortion
was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terribly incorrect? I figure that since you stated 80% as though it
was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fact, you would have some evidence to back that number up.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I pointed you to my reference twice:
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm

&gt;&gt;&gt; Almost every poll shows an outright ban on abortion is
&gt;&gt;&gt; supported only by 15-20% of the American people. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; other 80% want it kept legal in all or some cases.

&gt;&gt; Okay, taking a look at that poll, it hardly supports your theory of 80%.
&gt;&gt; The first poll alone shows that only 54% believe it should be legal at
all.

&gt;&gt; Then the second poll shows that 1/4 of the country believes it should
not be
&gt;&gt; permitted at all, and 37% of people believe there should be stricter
limits.
&gt;&gt; That's 62% that are probably more on my side than yours. Stricter
limits
&gt;&gt; with most people means that it should be illegal except in cases of
rape,
&gt;&gt; incest or life of the mother. I believe it should be only for the life
of
&gt;&gt; the mother, but that doesn't show actually what they believe are good
&gt;&gt; reasons and which are not.

&gt;&gt; Then the third shows that 47% say they are more pro-life and only 44%
are
&gt;&gt; pro-choice.

&gt;&gt; You have given me a page that has no support for an 80% claim. You also
&gt;&gt; have given a page with so much polling data that is all over the map
that
&gt;&gt; it's hard to come to a real conclusion. Some say a higher percentage
are
&gt;&gt; pro-life, while others state the opposite. It would appear that the
&gt;&gt; question of which way the public believe is more an issue of who takes
the
&gt;&gt; poll than of what the people actually think. Just take a look at the
&gt;&gt; CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll compared to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal
poll.
&gt;&gt; The partial birth abortion part in particular is wholly indicative of
what
&gt;&gt; I'm talking about. There was a difference in the numbers of people
&gt;&gt; questioned of 3. NBC shows that 47% are in favor of it, and 40% oppose
it,
&gt;&gt; while one month earlier the CNN poll shows that only 25% believe it
should
&gt;&gt; be legal while 68% oppose it. The ABC poll would seem to suggest that
CNN
&gt;&gt; was right since their numbers are quite similar, but who is right? I
don't
&gt;&gt; think any objective person could easily decide. But an objective person
can
&gt;&gt; easily decide that not a singel poll on that page supports your 80%
claim.

&gt; The original point I made is that only 15-20% support the
&gt; current platform of the Republican Party, i.e. no abortions,
&gt; no exceptions. With the exception of one (taken of
&gt; Catholics, which showed 25% support), every one of the
&gt; polls show only between 15-20% support for that specific
&gt; position.

&gt; And the results of a poll have a lot more to do with the way
&gt; questions are asked than who's taking it. E.g. look at the
&gt; way Fox News phrases their poll questions. It obviously
&gt; leads respondants to answers they prefer to hear.

"/> What about the ABC poll? Similar results. ABC can hardly be called a right
wing news organization.

Anyway, the fact is that Republicans do not believe that all abortions
should be illegal. The majority of republicans that I speak to believe that
it should be legal in cases of rape and incest too. Since that's like
saying that the children of a mass murderer should sit right next to him in
the gas chamber, I cannot agree, but that is a separate issue. The fact
still remains that the radical leftist view that abortion should be
available to everyone in all cases is supported by a very small portion of
the country, as it should be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bestiality isn't illegal, nor is adultery along with lots of
&gt; other
&gt;&gt;&gt; vices.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just cause it's not illegal doesn't make it moral or ethical. That
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you have so many convoluted laws already. People think if there is
&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against it it must be ok.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, you'll need to explain why e.g. oral sex between opposite sex
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;couples is somehow less of a &quot;vice&quot; than sex between two people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the same gender. You're being *very* selective about what you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deem immoral or unethical.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In nature opposites are meant to attract for the continuation of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; species. I've read that only primates engage in sex for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lesiure/pleasure. Never seen one chimp giving another a toothy nobber
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, there are apes that regularly engage in activity that would be
&gt; more
&gt;&gt;&gt; accurately called bisexuality. I can't remember the name, but it
&gt; started
&gt;&gt;&gt; with a B. Binobo or something. Anyway, there is at least a form of
&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuality in the wild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All sex without the intent of procreation is a vice if you take the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so-called religious view of it. But is one hell of a great vice. So
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is the consumption of liquor to excess as well. But, what the hell a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; man needs vices. My Pops told me a long time ago to never trust a man
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who didn't have a vice or two.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick, if it's a fundamental right for anybody to marry anybody else,

&gt;&gt; No one's claiming that, or at least I've never heard anyone
&gt;&gt; claim that. Gay people are asking for the right to marry
&gt;&gt; somebody, not anybody.

&gt;&gt;&gt; why is
&gt;&gt;&gt; it illegal to have multiple wives? Laws making that illegal were upheld
&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Supreme Court a century ago, and that is a consentual relationship.

&gt;&gt; Far from it. The state was and is able to justify denial of
&gt;&gt; marriage rights to bigamists because bigamy is illegal -- it
&gt;&gt; discriminates on the basis of gender, it almost always entails
&gt;&gt; victimization of women and it in many cases is non-consensual.

&gt; Bigamy/polygamy itself does no such thing.

"/> It certainly does. Read the transcripts of the Smoot Hearings,
where we discover among other things that girls who have not
even reached the age of consent are often entered into
polygamous marriages.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The act of victimizing women or
&gt; anyone else for that matter is an issue wholly separate from marriage.
&gt; Being forced to marry is illegal whether or not it's a polygamist marriage,
&gt; and just because the group that was discriminated against at the time were
&gt; the Mormons, that was their choice to discriminate according to sex, but as
&gt; long as it is legal for a man or a woman to have multiple wives and
&gt; husbands, it is not unconstitutional. It is no more legal in this country
&gt; for a man to have 20 wives than it is for a woman to have 20 husbands. If
&gt; it were otherwise it would be a violation of equal protection.

"/> The Church of LDS practiced polygyny -- it was entirely one-way.
Men were allowed to have multiple wives but women were not
allowed to have more than one husband.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; What makes homosexual marriage any different than plural marriage as far
&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt; whether or not it should be considered a fundamental right. It seems to
&gt; me
&gt;&gt;&gt; that for your argument to hold up, laws barring plural marriage would
&gt; also
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to fall.

&gt;&gt; Nope. The state has to show a compelling interest in denying
&gt;&gt; marriage rights to any given group. It has had no problem
&gt;&gt; doing so with bigamists. It has had nothing but problems
&gt;&gt; doing so with gay people. Pointing to bibles, citing history
&gt;&gt; and simply saying &quot;it's icky and we don't like it&quot; doesn't cut it
&gt;&gt; in a court of law. In the case of bigamy the state has been

&gt; It sure does if it's not a fundamental right. You don't seem to understand
&gt; what the rational relation test is. As long as a state has a rational
&gt; reason, no matter what that reason is, it is legal unless it is considered a
&gt; fundamental right. Unless gays can get it declared a fundamental right for
&gt; them to marry, they are stuck with whatever whims the various state
&gt; legislatures decide to have on that particular day.

"/> And courts from Vermont to Hawaii have ruled that the right
to legal recognition of marriage to a person of one's choosing
is part of one's most fundamental and inalienable rights to
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Any moron knows as
much.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since your argument is that since they are adults and consent to be
&gt; together, they should have the same right to marry as any other couple, you
&gt; are incorrect in assuming that one man can't marry 12 women or vise versa.
&gt; Plural marriage is for all intents and purposes identical to what you are
&gt; talking about. The only difference is that it is with multiple people.

&gt;&gt; and will continue to be able to prove its compelling interest
&gt;&gt; because of the reasons stated above. History and religious
&gt;&gt; tradition has absolutely nothing to do with it. That's why
&gt;&gt; the &quot;defense of marriage&quot; camp has been losing court cases
&gt;&gt; from Massachusetts to Hawaii.

&gt; Apparently you didn't read my previous post about this. The nation's
&gt; history and traditions test is paramount in deciding what rights are
&gt; fundamental. You can't prove a history or tradition of gay marriage, so you
&gt; won't be able to prove a fundamental right exists, and therefore a
&gt; compelling interest is not necessary in order to find against homosexual
&gt; marriage. It's that simple. Like it or don't, I don't see any self
&gt; respecting Supreme Court finding a fundamental right to homosexual marriage.

"/> It happened in Vermont. And Massachusetts. And Hawaii.
And those are just the states where cases have gotten as far
as the respective states' Supreme Courts. Must be some kind
of mass insanity, eh?

&gt; sister or something. While we are on the topic isn't that illegal as
&gt; well? At least outside West Virginia anyhow.

&gt; If Gay marriage is finally recognized I do think some of these other

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not overwhelmingly, but one study from 2001 showed almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half of the men in Catholic seminaries are active homosexuals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The pedophiles in the church are overwhelmingly man on boy- not
&gt; man on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; girl.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...and that's because a much larger percentage of priests
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (relative to the population as a whole) are homosexual.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not that homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's that homosexuals are found in much greater percentages
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; among Catholic priests.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was not saying that the priests are overwhelmingly homosexual.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The church teaches that you can naturally be attracted to anything
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conducive to procreation whether it be same sex, children, animals,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inanimate objects, etc. They teach to ask a higher power to help
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spiritually to conquer your vice. You are not supposed to ACT on
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; urge,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like you would restrain yourself from adultery, murder, etc. We all
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different weaknesses that are our personal demons to deal with and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuality is just that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe in your opinion, maybe in the opinion of the Catholic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Church, and maybe even in the opinion of a majority of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans. None of which makes any difference to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue at hand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unlike pedophilia, beastiality and most of the other things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you mention, homosexuality does not involve victimization
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nor does it involve a lack of legal consent. In fact it doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involve anything illegal. If it did, DOMA laws would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easily justifiable and the entire question of legal recognition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of same-sex marriage would be moot.

&gt;&gt;&gt; DOMA is constitutional as it allows the states to determine what it
&gt; defines
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a legally binding marriage. The states already had that right, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; federal government should not have even weighed in. They did, and they
&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt; made it known that it's stand was the same as what is constitutionally
&gt;&gt;&gt; allowable already.

&gt;&gt; Time will tell about your assumptions. Fifty years ago the
&gt;&gt; same thing was thought about interracial marriages. States
&gt;&gt; do not have the right to make or enforce laws which violate
&gt;&gt; the Constitution.

&gt; That was not the same. Blacks have always had a fundamental right to marry,
&gt; and whites as well. There has always been interracial marriage, and there
&gt; is no reason to justify discrimination like that.

"/> It's a perfect example of how fundamental rights change
over time. Today is seems blatently obvious that there's
&quot;no reason to justify discrimination like that&quot;. But fifty years
ago public sentiment was quite different. Interracial marriage
was thought to be as perverse a &quot;threat&quot; to the institution of
marriage as same-sex marriages are today. Here's what one
judge said in deciding the case of Loving v. Virginia in 1959:

&quot;Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow,
malay and red, and He placed them on separate continents.
And but for the interference with His arrangement there
would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that He
separated the races shows that He did not intend for the
races to mix.&quot;

Utterly ridiculous? Yep. Was it a common belief for 150
years in America? Yep. This nonsense was finally overturned
by a unanimous decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans have the right to live their lives according to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever religious traditions they choose, or no religious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tradition at all. One church does not have the right to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impose their beliefs on everyone else, and the majority does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not have the right to impose their will on a minority if this will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violates the civil and/or constitutional rights of the minority.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, if the state wants to deny recognition of marriage to any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group, it must justify this denial based on secular criteria
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (equal protection and application of the law etc) and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religious traditions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but public traditions that are secular are completely relevant.
&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt; Supreme Court has regularly used the history and traditions argument to
&gt;&gt;&gt; define those rights that are fundamental.

&gt;&gt; And just as often the Supreme Court has reminded us that
&gt;&gt; the Constitution is a living document, not a static one. Rules
&gt;&gt; change. It was historical and traditional in the U.S. to own
&gt;&gt; African-Americans as slaves. Didn't make slavery any more

&gt; Yes, but we are talking about those traditions and history that predate the
&gt; constitution itself. History and tradition from 10 years ago can hardly be
&gt; used to determine the fundamentality of rights.

"/> U.S. history is replete with such examples. Miscegenation
laws. Women's right to own property. Women's right to vote.
And many others. As I mentioned earlier, and was pointed
out by both Vermont's and Hawaii's state Supreme Courts, a
history, however long or short of unjustifiable discrimination is
not a legally defensible reason to continue discriminating.
Instead, it is a compelling reason to stop discriminating.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In
&gt; fact, there are many cases where the Supreme Court upheld slavery in the US.
&gt; It wasn't until blacks were deemed free that their rights in this country
&gt; could be realized.

&gt;&gt; constitutional. It was historical and traditional for women to
&gt;&gt; not have the right to vote. Didn't make the denial of this right
&gt;&gt; any more constitutional. It was historical and traditional to
&gt;&gt; deny marriage rights to interracial couples. Didn't make
&gt;&gt; miscegenation laws any more constitutional. And on and on.

&gt; The right for women to vote was also not granted by the courts.

"/> Nonsense. There were numerous unsuccessful legal challenges
to this right, in Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and elsewhere around
the U.S.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Legislature
&gt; did it. Interracial marriage is an issue of equal protection. Where it was
&gt; already considered a fundamental right for a man to marry a woman of his
&gt; choosing, there was a disparity in discriminating against similarly situated
&gt; people. This is a far cry from condoning a right that never existed in the
&gt; history of man.

"/> Race is genetic. So is gender. With regard to such a basic
human right, ignoring the 14th Amendment on the basis of
either one is equally unjustifiable. State Supreme Courts
have reached that same conclusion in every case. That's
the exact reason why the &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot;
was proposed in the first place. If the &quot;defense of marriage&quot;
camp had a legal leg to stand on, such a proposal wouldn't
have been necessary.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the history and traditions
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the world, much less the US are totally opposite of what the
&gt; homosexual
&gt;&gt;&gt; agenda stands for, it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will
&gt; find
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the right of homosexual marriage is a fundamental right, and
&gt; therefore
&gt;&gt;&gt; a state only has to have a rational relation to its laws. That means
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; any reason will work.

&gt;&gt; You must have a very strange notion of what the &quot;homosexual
&gt;&gt; agenda&quot; is. All they're asking for is equal protection and
&gt;&gt; application of the law, as promised by the 14th Amendment.

&gt; That only holds true if they can prove that somehow two people of the same
&gt; sex are similarly situated to those of opposite sex. Where there is the
&gt; overwhelming majority of people of opposite sex who can procreate, and it is
&gt; a given that two homosexuals will not, that is a great weight on the side of
&gt; it not being a similarly situated class. It is not in the pervue of the
&gt; state to promote those social situations that do not result in procreation.
&gt; Thus the protection of marriage, and the dissimilarity.

"/> Then explain why the state does not deny marriage licenses
to infertile opposite sex couples, as a class. Ability to
procreate isn't a criteria for legally recognized marriage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Do gay people have their share of radical fringe groups? You
&gt;&gt; bet. But judging this entire movement on the actions of these
&gt;&gt; few groups isn't fair, or even logical. It's like judging the equal
&gt;&gt; rights movement of African-Americans during the 1960's on
&gt;&gt; the actions of the Black Panthers. These fringe groups aren't
&gt;&gt; representative, and in most cases they're counterproductive.

&gt; something wonderfully witty:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick, if it's a fundamental right for anybody to marry anybody else,

&gt;&gt;No one's claiming that, or at least I've never heard anyone
&gt;&gt;claim that. Gay people are asking for the right to marry
&gt;&gt;somebody, not anybody.

&gt; But the do have the right to marry somebody. Somebody of the opposite
&gt; sex. After that restriction is removed then you are moving into the
&gt; anybody territory.

&gt;&gt;&gt; why is
&gt;&gt;&gt; it illegal to have multiple wives? Laws making that illegal were
upheld by
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Supreme Court a century ago, and that is a consentual relationship.

&gt;&gt;Far from it. The state was and is able to justify denial of
&gt;&gt;marriage rights to bigamists because bigamy is illegal -- it
&gt;&gt;discriminates on the basis of gender, it almost always entails
&gt;&gt;victimization of women and it in many cases is non-consensual.

&gt; But biga,y was just another form/version of marriage practiced in many
&gt; countries. It is only from wrong from your perception. Now if that
&gt; is the case why is the perception that Gay marriage is wrong not
&gt; valid? Bigamy goes both ways. There are some societies that practice
&gt; the female version with multiple husbands.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What makes homosexual marriage any different than plural marriage as
far as
&gt;&gt;&gt; whether or not it should be considered a fundamental right. It seems
to me
&gt;&gt;&gt; that for your argument to hold up, laws barring plural marriage would
also
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to fall.

&gt;&gt;Nope. The state has to show a compelling interest in denying
&gt;&gt;marriage rights to any given group. It has had no problem
&gt;&gt;doing so with bigamists. It has had nothing but problems
&gt;&gt;doing so with gay people. Pointing to bibles, citing history
&gt;&gt;and simply saying &quot;it's icky and we don't like it&quot; doesn't cut it
&gt;&gt;in a court of law. In the case of bigamy the state has been
&gt;&gt;and will continue to be able to prove its compelling interest
&gt;&gt;because of the reasons stated above. History and religious
&gt;&gt;tradition has absolutely nothing to do with it. That's why
&gt;&gt;the &quot;defense of marriage&quot; camp has been losing court cases
&gt;&gt;from Massachusetts to Hawaii.

&gt;&gt;Rick

&gt; The only problem with that is there are no marriage rights. The
&gt; constitution and it's amendments do not address it at all. Repeat
&gt; after me &quot;No right to marriage.&quot; That is part of the reason this
&gt; issue is up for debate. Through the history of this country we have

"/> Actually there is a constitutional right to marriage. It is not spelled
out, but the courts have all determined that it is a fundamental right that
cannot be infringed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; had all sorts of restrictions on marriage. Some upheld under court
&gt; challenge, some not. The states don't even have laws in common
&gt; relating to marrying biological relatives. Some places first cousins
&gt; can marry, some not. However, the one thing that is universal, once
&gt; married, the marriage is legal in all states.

&gt; In some parts of the world, 20 to 60 percent of all marriages are
&gt; between close biological relatives.Twenty-four states have laws
&gt; forbidding first cousins from marrying, and seven states have limits
&gt; like requiring genetic counseling. But no countries in Europe have
&gt; such prohibitions, and in parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia,
&gt; marriages between cousins are considered preferable. SOme of those
&gt; same countries have also legalized Gay marriages.

&gt; Just like in Timm's question about plural marriages, once marriage is
&gt; defined as a right, what about those states with laws against cousins?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who are overwhelmingly homosexual

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not overwhelmingly, but one study from 2001 showed almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half of the men in Catholic seminaries are active
homosexuals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The pedophiles in the church are overwhelmingly man on boy-
not
&gt;&gt; man on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; girl.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...and that's because a much larger percentage of priests
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (relative to the population as a whole) are homosexual.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not that homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's that homosexuals are found in much greater percentages
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; among Catholic priests.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was not saying that the priests are overwhelmingly
homosexual.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The church teaches that you can naturally be attracted to
anything
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conducive to procreation whether it be same sex, children,
animals,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inanimate objects, etc. They teach to ask a higher power to
help
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spiritually to conquer your vice. You are not supposed to ACT
on
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; urge,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like you would restrain yourself from adultery, murder, etc. We
all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different weaknesses that are our personal demons to deal with
and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuality is just that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe in your opinion, maybe in the opinion of the Catholic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Church, and maybe even in the opinion of a majority of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans. None of which makes any difference to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue at hand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unlike pedophilia, beastiality and most of the other things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you mention, homosexuality does not involve victimization
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nor does it involve a lack of legal consent. In fact it doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involve anything illegal. If it did, DOMA laws would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easily justifiable and the entire question of legal recognition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of same-sex marriage would be moot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DOMA is constitutional as it allows the states to determine what it
&gt;&gt; defines
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a legally binding marriage. The states already had that right,
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; federal government should not have even weighed in. They did, and
they
&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; made it known that it's stand was the same as what is
constitutionally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allowable already.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Time will tell about your assumptions. Fifty years ago the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same thing was thought about interracial marriages. States
&gt;&gt;&gt; do not have the right to make or enforce laws which violate
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Constitution.

&gt;&gt; That was not the same. Blacks have always had a fundamental right to
marry,
&gt;&gt; and whites as well. There has always been interracial marriage, and
there
&gt;&gt; is no reason to justify discrimination like that.

&gt; It's a perfect example of how fundamental rights change
&gt; over time. Today is seems blatently obvious that there's
&gt;&quot;no reason to justify discrimination like that&quot;. But fifty years
&gt; ago public sentiment was quite different. Interracial marriage
&gt; was thought to be as perverse a &quot;threat&quot; to the institution of
&gt; marriage as same-sex marriages are today. Here's what one
&gt; judge said in deciding the case of Loving v. Virginia in 1959:

&gt;&quot;Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow,
&gt; malay and red, and He placed them on separate continents.
&gt; And but for the interference with His arrangement there
&gt; would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that He
&gt; separated the races shows that He did not intend for the
&gt; races to mix.&quot;

&gt; Utterly ridiculous? Yep. Was it a common belief for 150
&gt; years in America? Yep. This nonsense was finally overturned
&gt; by a unanimous decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans have the right to live their lives according to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever religious traditions they choose, or no religious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tradition at all. One church does not have the right to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impose their beliefs on everyone else, and the majority does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not have the right to impose their will on a minority if this will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violates the civil and/or constitutional rights of the minority.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, if the state wants to deny recognition of marriage to any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group, it must justify this denial based on secular criteria
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (equal protection and application of the law etc) and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religious traditions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but public traditions that are secular are completely relevant.
&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Supreme Court has regularly used the history and traditions argument
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; define those rights that are fundamental.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And just as often the Supreme Court has reminded us that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Constitution is a living document, not a static one. Rules
&gt;&gt;&gt; change. It was historical and traditional in the U.S. to own
&gt;&gt;&gt; African-Americans as slaves. Didn't make slavery any more

&gt;&gt; Yes, but we are talking about those traditions and history that predate
the
&gt;&gt; constitution itself. History and tradition from 10 years ago can hardly
be
&gt;&gt; used to determine the fundamentality of rights.

&gt; U.S. history is replete with such examples. Miscegenation
&gt; laws. Women's right to own property. Women's right to vote.
&gt; And many others. As I mentioned earlier, and was pointed
&gt; out by both Vermont's and Hawaii's state Supreme Courts, a
&gt; history, however long or short of unjustifiable discrimination is
&gt; not a legally defensible reason to continue discriminating.
&gt; Instead, it is a compelling reason to stop discriminating.

"/> You are again speaking of issues where similarly situated people were
treated dissimilarly, then comparing them to dissimilar people being treated
dissimilarly. There is a fundamental difference between a homosexual and a
gay couple. When you are speaking of two people instead of one, you no
longer stay in the same area. If there are fundamental differences between
those groups of people, in this case the complete lack of possibility to
reproduce, the groups are not similarly situated.

&gt;&gt; In
&gt;&gt; fact, there are many cases where the Supreme Court upheld slavery in the
US.

country

&gt;&gt;&gt; constitutional. It was historical and traditional for women to
&gt;&gt;&gt; not have the right to vote. Didn't make the denial of this right
&gt;&gt;&gt; any more constitutional. It was historical and traditional to
&gt;&gt;&gt; deny marriage rights to interracial couples. Didn't make
&gt;&gt;&gt; miscegenation laws any more constitutional. And on and on.

&gt;&gt; The right for women to vote was also not granted by the courts.

&gt; Nonsense. There were numerous unsuccessful legal challenges
&gt; to this right, in Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and elsewhere around
&gt; the U.S.

"/> That has nothing to do with it being decided in the courts. It was a
legislative action later upheld by the courts, not a court action later
upheld by the legislature.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Legislature
&gt;&gt; did it. Interracial marriage is an issue of equal protection. Where it
was
&gt;&gt; already considered a fundamental right for a man to marry a woman of his
&gt;&gt; choosing, there was a disparity in discriminating against similarly
situated
&gt;&gt; people. This is a far cry from condoning a right that never existed in
the
&gt;&gt; history of man.

&gt; Race is genetic. So is gender. With regard to such a basic
&gt; human right, ignoring the 14th Amendment on the basis of
&gt; either one is equally unjustifiable. State Supreme Courts
&gt; have reached that same conclusion in every case. That's
&gt; the exact reason why the &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot;
&gt; was proposed in the first place. If the &quot;defense of marriage&quot;
&gt; camp had a legal leg to stand on, such a proposal wouldn't
&gt; have been necessary.

"/> You start with the belief that the courts will see the widely varying expert
opinions of a genetic link to homosexuality the way you do. You forget that
if there is not conclusive evidence on one side or the other that the court
cannot make that determination

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the history and traditions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the world, much less the US are totally opposite of what the
&gt;&gt; homosexual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agenda stands for, it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will
&gt;&gt; find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the right of homosexual marriage is a fundamental right, and
&gt;&gt; therefore
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a state only has to have a rational relation to its laws. That
means
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any reason will work.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You must have a very strange notion of what the &quot;homosexual
&gt;&gt;&gt; agenda&quot; is. All they're asking for is equal protection and
&gt;&gt;&gt; application of the law, as promised by the 14th Amendment.

&gt; largest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; organization of pedophiles. That dubious honor goes
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roman Catholic Church.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who are overwhelmingly homosexual

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not overwhelmingly, but one study from 2001 showed almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half of the men in Catholic seminaries are active
&gt; homosexuals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The pedophiles in the church are overwhelmingly man on boy-
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt; man on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; girl.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...and that's because a much larger percentage of priests
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (relative to the population as a whole) are homosexual.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not that homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's that homosexuals are found in much greater percentages
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; among Catholic priests.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was not saying that the priests are overwhelmingly
&gt; homosexual.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The church teaches that you can naturally be attracted to
&gt; anything
&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conducive to procreation whether it be same sex, children,
&gt; animals,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inanimate objects, etc. They teach to ask a higher power to
&gt; help
&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spiritually to conquer your vice. You are not supposed to ACT
&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; urge,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like you would restrain yourself from adultery, murder, etc. We
&gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different weaknesses that are our personal demons to deal with
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; homosexuality is just that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe in your opinion, maybe in the opinion of the Catholic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Church, and maybe even in the opinion of a majority of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans. None of which makes any difference to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue at hand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unlike pedophilia, beastiality and most of the other things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you mention, homosexuality does not involve victimization
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nor does it involve a lack of legal consent. In fact it doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involve anything illegal. If it did, DOMA laws would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easily justifiable and the entire question of legal recognition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of same-sex marriage would be moot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DOMA is constitutional as it allows the states to determine what it
&gt;&gt;&gt; defines
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a legally binding marriage. The states already had that right,
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; federal government should not have even weighed in. They did, and
&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; made it known that it's stand was the same as what is
&gt; constitutionally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allowable already.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Time will tell about your assumptions. Fifty years ago the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same thing was thought about interracial marriages. States
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do not have the right to make or enforce laws which violate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Constitution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That was not the same. Blacks have always had a fundamental right to
&gt; marry,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and whites as well. There has always been interracial marriage, and
&gt; there
&gt;&gt;&gt; is no reason to justify discrimination like that.

&gt;&gt; It's a perfect example of how fundamental rights change
&gt;&gt; over time. Today is seems blatently obvious that there's
&gt;&gt;&quot;no reason to justify discrimination like that&quot;. But fifty years
&gt;&gt; ago public sentiment was quite different. Interracial marriage
&gt;&gt; was thought to be as perverse a &quot;threat&quot; to the institution of
&gt;&gt; marriage as same-sex marriages are today. Here's what one
&gt;&gt; judge said in deciding the case of Loving v. Virginia in 1959:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow,
&gt;&gt; malay and red, and He placed them on separate continents.
&gt;&gt; And but for the interference with His arrangement there
&gt;&gt; would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that He
&gt;&gt; separated the races shows that He did not intend for the
&gt;&gt; races to mix.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Utterly ridiculous? Yep. Was it a common belief for 150
&gt;&gt; years in America? Yep. This nonsense was finally overturned
&gt;&gt; by a unanimous decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans have the right to live their lives according to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever religious traditions they choose, or no religious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tradition at all. One church does not have the right to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impose their beliefs on everyone else, and the majority does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not have the right to impose their will on a minority if this will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violates the civil and/or constitutional rights of the minority.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, if the state wants to deny recognition of marriage to any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group, it must justify this denial based on secular criteria
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (equal protection and application of the law etc) and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religious traditions.

Ability or inability to procreate is irrelevant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a lot of propaganda being sent out from both sides of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; issue. The propaganda over marriage being a right is one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; largest. It simple is not. There are all sorts of laws. If it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; declared a right you could end up with plural marriages, cousins,
&gt;&gt;&gt; brothers &amp; sisters, and pet monkeys. The list is endless.

&gt;&gt;SO? How does this affect me or you?

&gt; Which part. Each has it's own undesirable impacts on society as a
&gt; whole. Now if you want to take stance that unless it affects you, you
&gt; could care less, what if I kill my next-door neighbor? How does that
&gt; affect you?

"/> Actually, it doesn't unless my neighbor sees what you did and decides to
become a copycat. But we're talking about what people are doing in their
bedrooms, not killing their neighbors. Does it bother you if my wife and I
get drunk and make love? I don't think so. Suppose we get high first?
Probably not, even though it's illegal.

Even though society frowns on these behaviors, I don't think that we want to
bring back prohibition. Kids grow up in world where they see people drink
and more. It doesn't mean that they'll all become alcoholics, and I don't
think that allowing gay marriage will make more gays.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are again speaking of issues where similarly situated people
were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treated dissimilarly, then comparing them to dissimilar people being
&gt;&gt; treated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dissimilarly. There is a fundamental difference between a
homosexual
&gt;&gt; and a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gay couple. When you are speaking of two people instead of one, you
no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; longer stay in the same area. If there are fundamental differences
&gt;&gt; between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those groups of people, in this case the complete lack of
possibility to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reproduce, the groups are not similarly situated.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The longer the &quot;defense of marriage&quot; camp continues to rely
&gt;&gt;&gt; on this argument, the better. It's been discarded by courts
&gt;&gt;&gt; outright and repeatedly, and there's no reason to believe it
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't continue to be discarded. Gay couples use the exact
&gt;&gt;&gt; same methods to start a family that are used by infertile
&gt;&gt;&gt; opposite sex couples, and the state doesn't seem to have any
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem with issuing marriage licenses to these couples.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ability or inability to procreate is irrelevant.

&gt;&gt; The problem is, you cannot legally force anyone to give them information
&gt;&gt; about their ability to reproduce, and it is often not able to be
determined
&gt;&gt; until after exhaustive testing. It's totally different to homosexuals.
It
&gt;&gt; is entirely impossible for a single homosexual couple to reproduce
between
&gt;&gt; them, and it is therefore not necessary to require intrusive tests.

&gt; The exact same thing is true for elderly opposite-sex couples.
&gt; And entire classes of disabled opposite-sex couples. Again,
&gt; the ability to procreate is not a litmus test for what marriages
&gt; are legally recognized by the state. The argument that it should
&gt; be has been and will continue to be one of the easiest to refute.

"/> That would be age discrimination and is illegal. There's also the point at
which to determine what age all women reach menopause. It's almost
impossible to put an age to it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Also,
&gt;&gt; it's highly debatable whether or not those lower court decisions will
hold.
&gt;&gt; It's well known that there are certain activist judges, and that will
most
&gt;&gt; likely be countered by higher court judges.

&gt; We've already heard from the supreme courts of Vermont,
&gt; Massachusetts and Hawaii, and soon California and
&gt; Washington. And this doesn't even address the issue of
&gt; other countries -- Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands,
&gt; Finland etc. Even assuming U.S. DOMA laws stand up
&gt; to constitutional scrutiny, they will eventually be irrelevant.

"/> Then there is the domestic relations exception in the federal courts. It
will likely be difficult to get a federal court to rule on this, and the
only way the federal government will weigh in on it will be if the Supreme
Court grants certiorari, which is a long shot until it becomes more of an
issue. The Supreme Court has determined that domestic relations such as
marriage are issues that should be the pervue of the states, and it will be
very difficult to get heard in the SC.

"/> Cable internet is not $9.95 per month, and most people are not on netzero or

pay only $40 for a 3 meg connection. My cable internet is the exception to

people pay for purely for entertainment. There is hardly anyone that cannot

&gt;&gt;Probably not, even though it's illegal.

&gt; Well this is part of my point. What you &amp; the misses do inside your
&gt; house I don't care about. The problem is that marriages don't happen
&gt; and stay in your bedroom. They become a very large part of your
&gt; public life. Your employer and insurers know about it, as does the
&gt; Taxman, school administrators and so on &amp; so forth. I have no problem
&gt; with civil unions or any other type of arrangement that does not give
&gt; state sanction to the union. I truly believe that all societies have
&gt; to have boundaries that are not crossed. Not all behaviors can be
&gt; legitimized and sanctioned by the state.

"/> Obviously. But you'll need to justify making such a boundary
in the case of same-sex marriage. Pointing to bibles, claiming
the sky will fall and saying &quot;it's icky and people don't like it&quot;
simply doesn't cut in in a court of law. None of those have
proven to be legally defensible arguments.

&gt; I really don't think it will make more Gays either. What I do think
&gt; is that as society begins to accept more &amp; more deviations from the
&gt; norm slowly but surely everything is expected to be accepted as the
&gt; norm. What you end up with is a completely morally corrupt society
&gt; with no boundaries. Look at children today. Many of their public
&gt; behaviors would have never been tolerated when I was that age.

"/> That's the same song people have been singing for 200 years
in this country. I can show you editorials written in 1820 that
lament the total moral corruption and imminent destruction of
American society.

It's also clear that gay people are gay, regardless of the level
of acceptance we choose to give them. I suppose it's possible
to make homosexuality a crime again, and throw 25 million
more Americans in jail, but short of that, nobody has been
able to show what benefit society accrues by keeping gay
people perpetually single. Back in 1996 Barney Frank
stood before the U.S. House and asked, &quot;How does the
fact that I love another man and live in a committed
relationship with him, threaten your marriage?&quot; Eight years
later and no one has been able to give a credible (or even
rational) answer to his question.

FREE again.

I always luck into these things. I coordinated expert testimony for a
dental/malpractice case (as a dentist), got a hefty fee, and the
laptop as a bonus because of the result.

I got the settlement reduced by $50K.

According to the Division of Labor Force Statistics (last 10 years):

1993 - 6.3
1994 - 6.1
1995 - 5.6
1996 - 5.4
1997 - 4.9
1998 - 4.5
1999 - 4.2
2000 - 4.0
2001 - 4.7
2002 - 5.8
2003 - 6.0

The rate clearly dropped continually during the 90's and has clearly
increased as a direct result of the poor Bush economic policies.

&gt; something wonderfully witty:
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well this is part of my point. What you &amp; the misses do inside your
&gt;&gt;&gt; house I don't care about. The problem is that marriages don't happen
&gt;&gt;&gt; and stay in your bedroom. They become a very large part of your
&gt;&gt;&gt; public life. Your employer and insurers know about it, as does the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Taxman, school administrators and so on &amp; so forth. I have no problem
&gt;&gt;&gt; with civil unions or any other type of arrangement that does not give
&gt;&gt;&gt; state sanction to the union. I truly believe that all societies have
&gt;&gt;&gt; to have boundaries that are not crossed. Not all behaviors can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; legitimized and sanctioned by the state.

&gt;&gt;Obviously. But you'll need to justify making such a boundary
&gt;&gt;in the case of same-sex marriage. Pointing to bibles, claiming
&gt;&gt;the sky will fall and saying &quot;it's icky and people don't like it&quot;
&gt;&gt;simply doesn't cut in in a court of law. None of those have
&gt;&gt;proven to be legally defensible arguments.

&gt; Think of it as a line in the sand. A stance that we have accepted all
&gt; the deviate behavior from our citizens that we are willing to. After
&gt; all that is what a boundary is all about. A stopping point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even though society frowns on these behaviors, I don't think that we want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bring back prohibition. Kids grow up in world where they see people drink
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and more. It doesn't mean that they'll all become alcoholics, and I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think that allowing gay marriage will make more gays.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I really don't think it will make more Gays either. What I do think
&gt;&gt;&gt; is that as society begins to accept more &amp; more deviations from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; norm slowly but surely everything is expected to be accepted as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; norm. What you end up with is a completely morally corrupt society
&gt;&gt;&gt; with no boundaries. Look at children today. Many of their public
&gt;&gt;&gt; behaviors would have never been tolerated when I was that age.

&gt;&gt;That's the same song people have been singing for 200 years
&gt;&gt;in this country. I can show you editorials written in 1820 that
&gt;&gt;lament the total moral corruption and imminent destruction of
&gt;&gt;American society.
&gt; And they have been right.

"/> Nope.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Do you think the people in 1820 faced any of
&gt; the things we do now at the level we do now?

"/> Yep, the wild west wasnt called the wild west for nothing, stupid.

And lets not forget the lynch mobs.

AND you've clearly forgotten the civil war as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;It's also clear that gay people are gay, regardless of the level
&gt;&gt;of acceptance we choose to give them. I suppose it's possible
&gt;&gt;to make homosexuality a crime again, and throw 25 million
&gt;&gt;more Americans in jail, but short of that, nobody has been
&gt;&gt;able to show what benefit society accrues by keeping gay
&gt;&gt;people perpetually single. Back in 1996 Barney Frank
&gt;&gt;stood before the U.S. House and asked, &quot;How does the
&gt;&gt;fact that I love another man and live in a committed
&gt;&gt;relationship with him, threaten your marriage?&quot; Eight years
&gt;&gt;later and no one has been able to give a credible (or even
&gt;&gt;rational) answer to his question.
&gt; I'm not advocating throwing anybody in jail. I am not advocating
&gt; stopping anyone from doing what they want to get their ya-yas off.
&gt; Nor do I think that Gay Marriage will impact my marriage in any
&gt; manner. I haven't used any of those arguments. What I am saying that
&gt; marriage isn't the ultimate goal. That there is a greater issue afoot
&gt; then the one in plain daylight. This is the case with almost every

&gt; small segment of our population, it isn't going to do anything
&gt; positive for our society as a whole. The ongoing cost to society from

&gt; Why isn't a civil union good enough?

like youre going to admit the &quot;reagan revolution&quot; years of the 80s was

and that reagans policies led to the recession under bush the first?

and the hot cup of squat bush the first did led to clintons success?

when the numbers look good, its all your guy's doing. when they look

There is no way that anyone can say that tax cuts hurt the economy, although

spending. The government needs to cut itself down to a skeleton crew and
put the majority of its power back in the states, that will help the economy

&gt;&gt;If that's what it shows as far as numbers go you are right. As far as

&gt;&gt;the early years of a presidency are more reflective of the past
&gt;&gt;administration as opposed to the current one. It takes a couple of
&gt;&gt;years for whatever action, or inaction for that matter, any given
&gt;&gt;administration does for it to have an impact on the economy. The
&gt;&gt;economy just doesn't react that fast. --

&gt; Actually, it has to do with perception. Just as the stock market tanked,
&gt; businesses stopped investing in expansion &amp; stopped hiring when GW got
&gt; elected.

&gt; It's true that Clinton got to ride the wave of prosperity that resulted

&gt; that 'W' squandered that prosperity with an unnecessary tax cut and
&gt; non-stop
&gt; war, and before you say that he had nothing to do with 9/11 (which is
&gt; probably true), my point is about what he's done in response. We could
&gt; have
&gt; had international cooperation and funding in our fight against terrorism.
&gt; We
&gt; could've avoided war. We could've not cut taxes but cut spending instead.
&gt; We
&gt; could've used the power of government to wean this country off of oil - oh
&gt; wait, I forgot that this entire administration came from the oil industry.
&gt; Now why is oil $50 a barrel? Why to &quot;encourage&quot; the Congress to give the
&gt; oil
&gt; companies every last concession they ever dreamed of, of course.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well this is part of my point. What you &amp; the misses do inside your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; house I don't care about. The problem is that marriages don't happen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and stay in your bedroom. They become a very large part of your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public life. Your employer and insurers know about it, as does the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with civil unions or any other type of arrangement that does not give
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state sanction to the union. I truly believe that all societies have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to have boundaries that are not crossed. Not all behaviors can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legitimized and sanctioned by the state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously. But you'll need to justify making such a boundary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the case of same-sex marriage. Pointing to bibles, claiming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the sky will fall and saying &quot;it's icky and people don't like it&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;simply doesn't cut in in a court of law. None of those have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;proven to be legally defensible arguments.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Think of it as a line in the sand. A stance that we have accepted all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the deviate behavior from our citizens that we are willing to. After
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all that is what a boundary is all about. A stopping point.

&gt;&gt; The law already has a stopping point. If a given activity
&gt;&gt; involves tangible harm: predatory behavior, victimization,
&gt;&gt; brutalization, non-consensual behavior etc then there are
&gt;&gt; legal grounds both to prohibit the behavior and also to
&gt;&gt; deny legal marriage rights because of it. But none of these
&gt;&gt; are relevant in the case of same-sex marriage, or at least
&gt;&gt; no one has yet been able to give a credible explanation of
&gt;&gt; who is harmed by it.

&gt; Who is harmed by spitting on the sidewalk? Who is harmed by fishing for
&gt; whales in the Great Salt Lake? Who is harmed by an almost countless number
&gt; of laws in every state in this country? Nobody! The fact is, the
&gt; legislature must only show a rational relation to its laws, and that could
&gt; be as unprovable as the possibility of rioting by heterosexuals in the
&gt; streets if laws were enacted. Would it happen? Probably not. Could it
&gt; happen? Absolutely. Therefore, the rational relation would stand. Since
&gt; there is no substantive fundamental right being implicated, there is no
&gt; remedy at law to force it. There need not be any &quot;credible&quot; explanation for
&gt; laws which do not infringe on our substantive federal liberties.

"/> And as three state supreme courts have found so far, if

if the state wishes to deny this right to a given group, the
burden is on the state to justify the denial.

I'm not simply making a claim here. Read the decisions.

"/> I understand that there are decisions in 3 states, but there are unpositive
decisions in other state supreme courts. Marriage certainly does qualify as
a substantive liberty right, but marriage of whom? The definition of
marriage is what must be taken into account. You cannot redefine what the
word marriage means. It has meant the same thing since its beginnings: the
state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in
a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law. Opposite sex
means a man and a woman and hardly means a man and a man or a woman and a
woman. This is obvious to everyone. So, in order to first find a right in
the liberty right of marriage for homosexuals, you must first find that
marriage means something totally different than it has for centuries. That
is the weakest argument you've laid out so far. Regardless of modern
definitions, the right that has been recognized throughout history is not
same sex marriage. The substantive right that is recognized by the Supreme
Court has always been between a man and a woman, and not a homosexual
marriage.

I will say it again, I support the freedom of same sex marriage, but I do
not believe it is a right, especially not a substantive right.

"/> Yes, but at least if it is a state, people will move and that way the
state's economy itself will force cutbacks. When the whole country must
live within its own borders, and you must jump through legal hoops in order
to leave the country, that is if you wanted to leave the country in the
first place, it is impossible to prohibit the money grab limbo.

On the other hand, there are candidates that would bring about such a
change, at least initially. Libertarians entire platform is to remove the
power from the federal government in all areas but the few necessary under
the constitution, such as interstate and international trade, and the
protection of the country. Other than that, there is little necessity for
the federal government other than to protect the rights of its citizens.

While I don't necessarily agree with things such as privatizing all land, I
do believe that the Federal government indeed needs to be put back in its
place.

of wage earners. If the purpose was to &quot;jump start&quot; the economy (as

lower / middle class. Very little of the tax cuts went for spending
on US goods. Most went into buying foreign goods (upscale cars, etc),
reducing debt &amp; investment - none of which significantly helps to
quickly improve the economy.

There is always the argument that more money for the rich spurs
investment. B.S. The federal reserve has much more effect on
investment by controlling interest rates. If GW had been serious
about improving the economy, he'd have put the money in the pockets of
those most likely to spend it quickly. In reality, his early agenda
was to reward his wealthy supporters, but when the economy turned sour
soon after his election, he put a different spin on the tax cuts. At
first, they were justified because the economy was doing so well. Then
then were justified to jump start the economy. How convenient. Too
bad he's squandered the reserves where now it's no longer possible to
use that money wisely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;administration as opposed to the current one. It takes a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;years for whatever action, or inaction for that matter, any given
&gt;&gt;&gt;administration does for it to have an impact on the economy. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;economy just doesn't react that fast. --

&gt;&gt;Actually, it has to do with perception. Just as the stock market tanked,
&gt;&gt;businesses stopped investing in expansion &amp; stopped hiring when GW got
&gt;&gt;elected.

&gt;It happened well before that. It started at the beginning of 2000, well
&gt;before November. How is that Bush's fault? Democrat math again.

"/> Huh? did you even read the full reply? Head in the sand or just
incapable of reading comprehension?

Since you are obviously a bit slow - once again, it's perception - much
like the stock market tends to predict the upcoming 6-12 months,
businesses tend to invest &amp; individuals tend to spend based on future
expectations, not on the past. GW's election obviously spooked most
confidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;All it will take is a change in perception, but GW continues to paint doom
&gt;&gt;and gloom - along with his boondoggled policies.
&gt;&gt;During the Clinton years, there was a perception (arguably false) that
&gt;&gt;there was no end to the good times &amp; guess what - most acted as if there
&gt;&gt;was no end. Along came GW &amp; well it's obvious that businesses had little
&gt;&gt;to no confidence &amp; began almost immediately to tighten their belts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something wonderfully witty:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well this is part of my point. What you &amp; the misses do inside
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; house I don't care about. The problem is that marriages don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and stay in your bedroom. They become a very large part of your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public life. Your employer and insurers know about it, as does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Taxman, school administrators and so on &amp; so forth. I have no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with civil unions or any other type of arrangement that does not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; give
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state sanction to the union. I truly believe that all societies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to have boundaries that are not crossed. Not all behaviors can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legitimized and sanctioned by the state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously. But you'll need to justify making such a boundary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the case of same-sex marriage. Pointing to bibles, claiming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the sky will fall and saying &quot;it's icky and people don't like it&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;simply doesn't cut in in a court of law. None of those have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;proven to be legally defensible arguments.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Think of it as a line in the sand. A stance that we have accepted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the deviate behavior from our citizens that we are willing to.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all that is what a boundary is all about. A stopping point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The law already has a stopping point. If a given activity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involves tangible harm: predatory behavior, victimization,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brutalization, non-consensual behavior etc then there are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legal grounds both to prohibit the behavior and also to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deny legal marriage rights because of it. But none of these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are relevant in the case of same-sex marriage, or at least
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no one has yet been able to give a credible explanation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who is harmed by it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Who is harmed by spitting on the sidewalk? Who is harmed by fishing for
&gt;&gt;&gt; whales in the Great Salt Lake? Who is harmed by an almost countless
&gt;&gt;&gt; number
&gt;&gt;&gt; of laws in every state in this country? Nobody! The fact is, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; legislature must only show a rational relation to its laws, and that
&gt;&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt;&gt; be as unprovable as the possibility of rioting by heterosexuals in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; streets if laws were enacted. Would it happen? Probably not. Could it
&gt;&gt;&gt; happen? Absolutely. Therefore, the rational relation would stand.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Since
&gt;&gt;&gt; there is no substantive fundamental right being implicated, there is no
&gt;&gt;&gt; remedy at law to force it. There need not be any &quot;credible&quot; explanation
&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; laws which do not infringe on our substantive federal liberties.

&gt;&gt; And as three state supreme courts have found so far, if
&gt;&gt; marriage doesn't fall within the scope of our inalienable (i.e.
&gt;&gt; not granted by the state) rights to liberty and the pursuit of
&gt;&gt; happiness, NOTHING ELSE DOES. Legally recognized
&gt;&gt; marriage IS a fundamental right. For everyone. Therefore,
&gt;&gt; if the state wishes to deny this right to a given group, the
&gt;&gt; burden is on the state to justify the denial.

&gt;&gt; I'm not simply making a claim here. Read the decisions.

&gt; I understand that there are decisions in 3 states, but there are unpositive
&gt; decisions in other state supreme courts. Marriage certainly does qualify as
&gt; a substantive liberty right, but marriage of whom? The definition of
&gt; marriage is what must be taken into account. You cannot redefine what the
&gt; word marriage means. It has meant the same thing since its beginnings: the
&gt; state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in
&gt; a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law. Opposite sex
&gt; means a man and a woman and hardly means a man and a man or a woman and a
&gt; woman. This is obvious to everyone.

"/> We're going around in circles in this discussion. Once again
you're using arguments which have no relevance. Historical
tradition and precedent, or a lack of it has zilch to do with
whether a given denial of rights to a given group will pass
constitutional scrutiny. For example, the fact it was &quot;obvious
to everyone&quot; that interracial marriages were perverted, a
danger to society, etc etc ad nauseam for 100+ years in this
country did not make miscegenation laws any more constitutional.
It simply took our courts 100+ years to finally recognize the right
of interracial couples to marry. And up until so-called &quot;defense
of marriage&quot; laws were passed a few years ago there was no
state definition of marriage that limited it to a man and a woman.
It is these laws which are coming and will continue to come under
legal challenge, for three main reasons. First, because marriage is
first and foremost a spiritual institution (gay couples already have
the right to marry); second, because as more and more countries
and individual states recognize these unions it will by all accounts
eventually become completely impractical and pointless for the
U.S. to enforce these laws; and third, because these laws serve
no purpose other than to bash gay people and create a permanent
status of &quot;citizen, second-class&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, in order to first find a right in
&gt; the liberty right of marriage for homosexuals, you must first find that
&gt; marriage means something totally different than it has for centuries. That
&gt; is the weakest argument you've laid out so far. Regardless of modern
&gt; definitions, the right that has been recognized throughout history is not
&gt; same sex marriage. The substantive right that is recognized by the Supreme
&gt; Court has always been between a man and a woman, and not a homosexual
&gt; marriage.

&gt; I will say it again, I support the freedom of same sex marriage, but I do
&gt; not believe it is a right, especially not a substantive right.

"/> See above. Gay people already have the right to marry, so
your point is entirely moot. What's at issue here is state
recognition of these marriages.

They're not blaming it on China. The spin in Washington is already that the
reason oil is $50 a barrel is because of the Congress and the
environmentalists. They want drilling allowed everywhere, high sulfur coal
mining and nuclear power plants. High oil prices are how they're going to
twist our arms to get it all without a fight. There are trillions of dollars
on the table, and don't think that our leaders are above back door dealing
to help their agenda, and don't tell me that there isn't an agenda.

For example: We've been trying to stage a coup in Venezuela (where we get
most of our oil) since 2001 and production has been cut in half due to the
strikes and political unrest. Could this have anything to do with prices?

The states are worse at it than the Fed. The media hardly bothers to watch
and report what's going on at the state level, so they can get away almost
anything. Even worse is the local level. It's like divide and conquer. My
own state of NJ is so corrupt because over 450 municipalities run as many
budgets and school districts, and there's nobody who can watch it all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not simply making a claim here. Read the decisions.

&gt;&gt;I understand that there are decisions in 3 states, but there are
&gt;&gt;unpositive
&gt;&gt;decisions in other state supreme courts. Marriage certainly does qualify
&gt;&gt;as
&gt;&gt;a substantive liberty right, but marriage of whom? The definition of
&gt;&gt;marriage is what must be taken into account. You cannot redefine what the

&gt;&gt;I will say it again, I support the freedom of same sex marriage, but I do
&gt;&gt;not believe it is a right, especially not a substantive right.

&gt; The problem is you are using logic. Simply cannot do that in this
&gt; argument. If Marriage was a right, one wouldn't have to get a
&gt; Marriage License. Remember that old argument back when you got your
&gt; drivers license over whether driving is a right or a privilege.
&gt; Similar situation, but the state can't take away your spouse.

&gt; As to your definition argument, which I happen to think is good, some
&gt; dictionaries have already begun changing their definition of marriage.

&gt; n 1: the state of being a married couple voluntarily joined for life
&gt; n 2: a union between two persons.

"/> That's why I qualified it with the &quot;Regardless of modern definitions.&quot;
statement.

Anyway, it is kind of pointless to argue this issue here. It will bear
itself out in the courts, and after reading hundreds of thousands of pages
of case law, I will guarantee that if the political mood is not ripe, the
Supreme Court WILL uphold the status quo. While that statement does not
always hold true, it does in the vast majority of cases. Look at the recent
Newdow decision. The Supreme Court went against the law in claiming that
Newdow had no right to protect his children since he did not have custody of
them. The fact that he did not have custody alone does not abrogate one of
their rights since responsibility still inures to them. In other words,
they looked for an abstention and found one where there should not have been
one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The rate clearly dropped continually during the 90's and has clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;increased as a direct result of the poor Bush economic policies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If that's what it shows as far as numbers go you are right. As far as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your analysis goes you are wrong. Numbers like these, especially in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the early years of a presidency are more reflective of the past
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;administration as opposed to the current one. It takes a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;years for whatever action, or inaction for that matter, any given
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;administration does for it to have an impact on the economy. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;economy just doesn't react that fast. --

&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, it has to do with perception. Just as the stock market
&gt;&gt;&gt;tanked, businesses stopped investing in expansion &amp; stopped hiring when
&gt;&gt;&gt;GW got elected.

&gt;&gt;It happened well before that. It started at the beginning of 2000, well
&gt;&gt;before November. How is that Bush's fault? Democrat math again.

&gt; Huh? did you even read the full reply? Head in the sand or just
&gt; incapable of reading comprehension?
&gt; Since you are obviously a bit slow - once again, it's perception - much
&gt; like the stock market tends to predict the upcoming 6-12 months,
&gt; businesses tend to invest &amp; individuals tend to spend based on future
&gt; expectations, not on the past. GW's election obviously spooked most

Read what I originally posted and then see who changed the rules. It
matters little which number I use to show the current unemployment rate
since I said that right now, the unemployment rate is lower than it was
during the majority of the Clinton years.

It has been for several months now anyway. If you take the last 12 months
and average them out, you will still have a number lower than the majority
of the Clinton years. Try it asshole and see who's pulling numbers out of
their ass.

&gt; year out of his ass, as you did?

&gt;&gt; The problem is you are using logic. Simply cannot do that in this

Even the recent &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot; nonsense
didn't propose to prohibit it.

And yet again the question needs to be asked: if committing
oneself in marriage to a person of one's choosing is not part of
one's inalienable rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
then what is? It's absurd to claim marriage isn't a right. Not

One issue worth mentioning is the fact that no federal case yet exists to
back up these claims to a gay marriage right. As well, there has been no
cert given by the Supreme Court. While the former is most likely because
nobody has yet drafted a proper complaint, but the latter is probably
because the political mood requires the Supreme Court to shy away from it

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who was sitting in the big chair, especially 9/11.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--

&gt;&gt;&gt;Another was the tax cuts. It's well known that 1/3 went to the top 1%
&gt;&gt;&gt;of wage earners. If the purpose was to &quot;jump start&quot; the economy (as
&gt;&gt;&gt;often claimed), it would have made much more sense to send that to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;lower / middle class. Very little of the tax cuts went for spending on
&gt;&gt;&gt;US goods. Most went into buying foreign goods (upscale cars, etc),
&gt;&gt;&gt;reducing debt &amp; investment - none of which significantly helps to
&gt;&gt;&gt;quickly improve the economy.

&gt;&gt;Yep, the lower classes certainly know how to make money. That's why they
&gt;&gt;are poor and not rich. It is wiser to give money to a person who knows
&gt;&gt;how to make money since in the act of making money, they create jobs and
&gt;&gt;income for the rest of us. Spending money only creates jobs and money in
&gt;&gt;the short term where investing it creats jobs and money in the long term.

&gt;&gt;If all you want is a short term shot in the arm, give it those who will
&gt;&gt;squander it.

&gt; So the purpose was NOT stimulate the economy? By your definition, it
&gt; was a total success. It did essentially nothing, except increase the
&gt; wealth help the top 1%, who got 1/3 of that borrowed money. Then there
&gt; are the GW sheep who actually believe they got something.

&gt;&gt; Maybe because when what you allege to be a &quot;Democrat&quot; gives *yearly*
&gt;&gt; rates in response to your untrue claim about unemployment during the

&gt;&gt; Who knows, but by incorporating a single monthly figure to dispute a

"/> The fact is, we already have about as one sided a tax system as you can get.
The tax cuts that bush enacted were not one sided. Everyone was taxed
exactly the same percent less as everyone else. The fact that Democrat math
would have you believe that the 1% less that Mr. Rich didn't have to pay is
somehow unfair because Mr. Poor didn't have to pay 1% less as well is just
pure stupidity. Democrats never seem to mention two facts, first is that
the rich pay more dollars for every percentage of tax increase/decrease than
the poor do. Add to that the fact that the rich are taxed at a
substantially higher rate percentage wise than the poor are and you have a
system where the very rich are always going to get what seems to be a higher
proportion of the money back in any tax cut that includes them. Democrats
rely on the fact that the majority of people just parrot what is said to
them without actually checking on where the numbers came from and it is
totally disingenuous.

I won't stand for facts being turned into something that they aren't. I
don't like it when anyone does it, and I will point it out when it happens.
It's called spin doctoring and it happens with both major political parties,
but as always has been the case to my recollection, Democrats are much more
apt to use such tactics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I will say it again, I support the freedom of same sex marriage, but I do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not believe it is a right, especially not a substantive right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is you are using logic. Simply cannot do that in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; argument. If Marriage was a right, one wouldn't have to get a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marriage License. Remember that old argument back when you got your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drivers license over whether driving is a right or a privilege.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Similar situation, but the state can't take away your spouse.

&gt;&gt;That's incorrect. A marriage license is simply a certification
&gt;&gt;that a given marriage is recognized by the state. It has zilch
&gt;&gt;to do with the institution itself, which is fundamentally spiritual
&gt;&gt;in nature. There are no laws against same-sex marriage.
&gt;&gt;Even the recent &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot; nonsense
&gt;&gt;didn't propose to prohibit it.

&gt; And that isn't what Gays are looking for; a recognized union? While
&gt; originally a spiritual institution it has now become nothing much more
&gt; then a legal contract.

"/> That legal contract carries with it over 1000 federal and
state rights and responsibilities. But I agree with your
point -- the very first couple who applied for a marriage
license when Gavin Newsom jumped the gun last year
was a lesbian couple who've been together for 75 years.
It's perfectly obvious their relationship consists of more
than a piece of paper from the government.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;And yet again the question needs to be asked: if committing
&gt;&gt;oneself in marriage to a person of one's choosing is not part of
&gt;&gt;one's inalienable rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
&gt;&gt;then what is? It's absurd to claim marriage isn't a right. Not
&gt;&gt;only is it a right, it's an inalienable right -- i.e. not granted by
&gt;&gt;the state. I've never read a single court decision that claimed
&gt;&gt;otherwise.

&gt; But again, &quot;an inalienable right&quot; according to whom. It certainly
&gt; isn't addressed in the constitution in any manner at all. The
&gt; constitution has been interrupted as implying that by some judges.
&gt; But exactly what does that mean? Not much more then an opinion that
&gt; either you or I have. It is not fact.

"/> You're treading into infamous Rick Santorum territory, i.e.
if a right isn't spelled out in the Consitution, it's not a right.
Read the Ninth Amendment, or any of the state supreme
court rulings on this issue. Everyone agrees that marriage
to a person of one's choosing is an inalienable human right.
Which means it doesn't matter whether it's specifically
outlined in the Constitution, since it's not a right that is
granted by the state in the first place.

As we've discussed before, the right to marriage is distinct
from the right to legally recognized marriage, and this latter
right is subject to state limitations and restrictions. But the
burden to justify the denial of this right to a given class or
group of people is and always has been on the state, and
so far they've failed to do so.

Rick,

A friend of mine submitted an amicus brief that explains rather well the
issues and the preclusions that should be noted when deciding an issue such
as this. You can see it at
http://bellsouthpwp.net/w/o/woodb01/011004_Mass_Brief.htm .

Bill is extremely knowledgable in these issues, and has a much better legal
foundation than I do. Take a look at that and then tell me that
Massachusetts didn't ignore the law as is understood for centuries by the
courts. I doubt you have seen this, and if there are any questions
regarding the issues presented, go ahead and ask them. I think I can field
them properly.

required to be wealthy in this country. One needs a good share of luck and
some old family money as well, and many people find themselves holding the

When the upper brackets get reduced, everyone else pays more. What's
happened is that the highest brackets have been eliminated, i.e. there's no
85% bracket any more, but many more people find themselves in the higher

&gt; the actions it is not deliberate or a goal.

&gt; There goal is a multi-tier long term plan. Phase one was to gain some

&gt; been fairly well accomplished. The next goal is acceptance of the
&gt;&quot;lifestyle&quot; as normal. The easiest way to accomplish this it to
&gt; legitimize it through the recognition of marriages. After that comes
&gt; protect class status to enact the same protections as currently
&gt; offered to other minority groups. End game goal completed complete
&gt; integration into main stream society with full legislative protections
&gt; and sanctions on gender preference as is with race, sex, religion and
&gt; so forth. The normalization of a &quot;lifestyle&quot; choice.

&gt; Now the problem comes in when society begins accepting &amp; normalizing
&gt; those things that it once found offensive it is easy for each
&gt; succeeding group to push forth the normalization of their behaviors.
&gt; After all that is what we are talking about her, behaviors.

"/> We've been through this topic already. The state has had
no problem proving a compelling interest in denying marriage
licenses in these other cases (such as incestual marriages,
bigamy etc), since the activities of these other groups involve
illegal activity. But the state has not proven its interest in
denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Actually
Bill Wood's amicus brief is a typical summary of the
ignorant and legally infensible arguments used by the state
so far.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to do with the institution itself, which is fundamentally spiritual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in nature. There are no laws against same-sex marriage.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even the recent &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot; nonsense
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't propose to prohibit it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And that isn't what Gays are looking for; a recognized union? While
&gt;&gt;&gt; originally a spiritual institution it has now become nothing much more
&gt;&gt;&gt; then a legal contract.

&gt;&gt;That legal contract carries with it over 1000 federal and
&gt;&gt;state rights and responsibilities. But I agree with your
&gt;&gt;point -- the very first couple who applied for a marriage
&gt;&gt;license when Gavin Newsom jumped the gun last year
&gt;&gt;was a lesbian couple who've been together for 75 years.
&gt;&gt;It's perfectly obvious their relationship consists of more

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's incorrect. A marriage license is simply a certification
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that a given marriage is recognized by the state. It has zilch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to do with the institution itself, which is fundamentally spiritual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in nature. There are no laws against same-sex marriage.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even the recent &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot; nonsense
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't propose to prohibit it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And that isn't what Gays are looking for; a recognized union? While
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; originally a spiritual institution it has now become nothing much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then a legal contract.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That legal contract carries with it over 1000 federal and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;state rights and responsibilities. But I agree with your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;point -- the very first couple who applied for a marriage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;license when Gavin Newsom jumped the gun last year
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was a lesbian couple who've been together for 75 years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's perfectly obvious their relationship consists of more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than a piece of paper from the government.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But again, &quot;an inalienable right&quot; according to whom. It certainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't addressed in the constitution in any manner at all. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; constitution has been interrupted as implying that by some judges.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But exactly what does that mean? Not much more then an opinion that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; either you or I have. It is not fact.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You're treading into infamous Rick Santorum territory, i.e.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if a right isn't spelled out in the Consitution, it's not a right.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Read the Ninth Amendment, or any of the state supreme
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;court rulings on this issue. Everyone agrees that marriage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to a person of one's choosing is an inalienable human right.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Which means it doesn't matter whether it's specifically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;outlined in the Constitution, since it's not a right that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;granted by the state in the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No territory other then my own. Regardless if someone else holds the
&gt;&gt;&gt; opinion or not, it is the one I developed on my own. You can say the
&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone agrees until the cows come home and that is not going to make
&gt;&gt;&gt; it true. Not only I, but 10's of thousands of other people don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; think it is an inalienable right. Many still look at it as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; privilege.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As we've discussed before, the right to marriage is distinct
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;from the right to legally recognized marriage, and this latter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right is subject to state limitations and restrictions. But the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;burden to justify the denial of this right to a given class or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;group of people is and always has been on the state, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so far they've failed to do so.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As I've said before, and I'll say again, all americans have the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; ability to marry under the current processes &amp; procedures. Thus
&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone is treated equally. Well that was until a couple of states
&gt;&gt;&gt; went rouge. There is no denial of rights. There just isn't the
&gt;&gt;&gt; creation of super-equal rights. As long as one man wants to marry one
&gt;&gt;&gt; woman, regardless of their sexual orientation they can do it. Never
&gt;&gt;&gt; has been a problem. Look at the Governor of NJ.

&gt;&gt;Again we're going around in circles in this discussion.
&gt;&gt;The state claimed the exact same thing when they tried
&gt;&gt;justifying miscegenation laws 50 years ago, i.e. &quot;everyone
&gt;&gt;is free to marry someone of the same race, therefore
&gt;&gt;miscegenation laws are constitutional&quot;. Turns out these
&gt;&gt;laws weren't constitutional after all. It simply took our
&gt;&gt;court system 100 years to figure it out.

&gt; Yeah but!

&gt; Those particular laws were not part of the legal, church and
&gt; dictionary based definitions of Marriage which has always been the
&gt; union of a Man &amp; Woman. The miscegenation laws were State based and
&gt; not all States had the same laws. In that particular case their were
&gt; 14th Amendment issues. In the current one there is not as the laws
&gt; are equally applied across all States. Even the fact that certain
&gt; rogue states have gone counter to law. These States are the ones that
&gt; are actually setting up Unequal application of laws. It is these
&gt; states that are actually closer to the miscegenation laws then the
&gt; ones who have stayed the course.

"/> You are misinterpreting the 14th amendment. It does not protect against
disparate treatment across state lines, but only under the particular law in
question. It is irrelevant what other state's laws say.

&gt; Nope. Rogue is a subjective term. What happens in 10, 20,

&gt; same-sex marriage? Is Uncle Sam still going to cower in a

"/> I don't think it really matters what this country does in relation to other
countries. This country is unique as should be every country. We are oft
touted as the only first world country to still employ the death penalty.
Well, I don't care what other countries think about it. I believe that the
death penalty is just punishment for murderers, as does the majority of the
rest of the country. If a person were to murder someone in my family, I
would not hesitate to pull the lever if asked.

I personally believe that, while a country should be responsible to the rest
of the world, its first priority is to protect the interests of itself and
those of its citizens. Unilateral action, although condemned by the liberal
whiners even when it's not unilateral, is wholly appropriate in many
situations.

If this country decides to keep gay marriage out of the laws, that's its
perogative. If homosexuals don't like it, they can go to some country that
will allow it.

I'm tired of all this tolerance and unity crap. That is not how life is.
People are intolerant, that's their nature. When you try to make them
tolerant, it only allows those that are intolerant to gain more power.

I don't believe that homosexuals should be banned from being married, but I
don't believe that it is or should be considered a right. I will not be
tolerant of those who seek to bastardize the laws and constitution of this
country in order to promote whatever societal views they have at the time.
All it takes is one supreme court decision to either put this issue to rest
one way or the other, and personally I don't fear it. I'm confident that
homosexuals will have to continue to convince people via Grimsci's method
that marriage is nothing but a contract.

the EXACT SAME PERCENTAGE in income taxes.

Your assertion that the wealthiest people pay less is totally uneducated.
It again uses Democrat math. You are not decreasing the amount of taxes
paid by that top bracket by increasing the amount of people who pay that top
bracket rate. In fact, you only increase the total percentage paid by that
top bracket by enlarging the bracket.

I guess that matters nothing to someone who is supportive of a war criminal

you can make the other person sound without actually having to rely on facts

TRANSACTION TAX - An interesting idea!

Joel

*****************

Posted on Fri, Aug. 27, 2004

The Economy | Real tax debate is MIA in 2004

By Andrew Cassel

Inquirer Columnist

If we weren't waist-deep in Vietnam-era mudslinging, we might be using
this presidential campaign season to debate some actual issues. Such
as tax reform.

The subject of taxes hasn't been entirely absent from the race, of
course. But the discussion has been pretty limited. President Bush
claims we just need to make his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent and
our problems will be over. John Kerry claims all we need to do is roll
the tax rates for high-income folks back to where they used to be.

Neither campaign is offering much depth or honesty. That's not
surprising when you recall what happened to other candidates who made
bold statements about taxes.

&quot;Let's tell the truth,&quot; Walter Mondale said in 1984. &quot;Mr. Reagan will
raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.&quot; Mondale
got trounced; 'nuff said.

Off the White House roller coaster, however, it's still possible to
find some interesting ideas. One that's been quietly percolating since
early this year comes from U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah of Philadelphia.

An undiluted liberal Democrat, Fattah nonetheless isn't interested
simply in rolling back Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy.

Starting over

Instead, he's among a number of people, many of them die-hard
conservatives, who want to &quot;reform&quot; the federal income tax by throwing
it out - all 4,000-plus pages - and starting over.

Fattah would replace the income tax with a &quot;transaction fee.&quot; Call it
a fee or a tax, what matters is it would dramatically shift the basis
for financing government.

Instead of taxing individual income or corporate profits, the feds
would take a piece every time money changed hands. Like a sales tax,
only broader, the transaction fee could apply to rents, loans, even
bank account deposits and withdrawals. Fattah likens it to the extra
fee charged at ATM machines, only on a much wider scale.

The advantage would be simplicity, he argues; no massive forms to fill
out, no complex rules to keep lawyers and accountants busy, and no
playing hide-and-seek with the IRS.

Since more than $53 trillion changes hands in our economy every year,
the tax rate could theoretically be quite low - less than 5 percent,
according to the Congressional Research Service. That's the kind of
tax economists like: a low rate on a broad base. The less time people
spend avoiding taxes, the better for the overall economy.

Coalition of the willing?

Fattah's proposal has echoes of some others that emanate from way
across the political spectrum. Steve Forbes pushed a flat tax during
his brief run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000.
House Majority Leader Tom DeLay has endorsed a national sales tax,
while others favor a version of the &quot;value-added&quot; taxes common in
Europe.

But Fattah's goal isn't to use tax reform as a back-door way to slash
federal spending. On the contrary, he contends his transaction fee
would raise enough to not only wipe out the federal deficit, but also
to replace half the school funding that now comes from state and local
property taxes.

It's a far-reaching, maybe even far-fetched, idea. Even a cursory
analysis turns up a host of questions and potential problems, such as:
Who would collect the tax? Would foreign transactions be covered?
Would it apply equally to goods and services, luxuries and
necessities, rich and poor? If so, is that fair?

But the fact that it raises serious questions doesn't disqualify
Fattah's plan from serious consideration; just the opposite, in fact.
Thinking about a radical change in the tax structure is an excellent
way to understand what's wrong - and right - with our current system.

Even if Fattah's idea isn't fully baked, it can help challenge some
old ideas - including the notion that only Republicans find the
current income-tax arrangement oppressive and cumbersome.

For that alone, it can be a welcome part of the discussion. Now if we
can only get the candidates to discuss it... .

&gt; earning 20k.

"/> You're misinformed. Other than fuel, there is hardly any necessity that the
poor pay federal taxes on. You can in no way tell me that the amount of
taxes paid in fuel somehow makes up percentage wise for what the rich pay in
income taxes. If it isn't fuel, it's for things such as alcohol and
cigarettes. You won't get me to feel sorry for people who pay more federal
taxes because they smoke 3 packs a day or want to go on a 3 week bender
every 3 weeks.

You are tossing out numbers with no figures to back them up. How about we
examine the numbers. The average person pays about $900 per year for fuel.
That's the per capita use of 8.8 gallons per week. They pay about $190 per
year in federal taxes on that fuel. A person making minimum wage, who would
never be expected to live on that wage anyway, would make $10,712 per year.
That means that they would pay an additional 1.7% of their income in federal
taxes, but then they wouldn't be responsible to pay but a small percentage
in taxes anyway, and probably nothing. That hardly makes up for the
difference.

You show me how there is no difference since you're the one making up these
mythical numbers.

that fuel.&quot; Then you say &quot;pay but a small percentages in taxes anyway,
and probably nothing.&quot; How can they pay &quot;$190/yr&quot; and &quot;probably nothing&quot;?

The gas tax was mentioned because someone earning say $200k is unlikely
to pay 10x in gas taxes as someone earning say $20k. The same holds
with food and many other items. The point being, as one earns more,
they spend less and less on a percentage basis for taxable items.
Consequently, although the poor pay less in income taxes, they often
times pay as much or more total tax on a percentage of their income vs.
the wealthy.

You are confusing income tax with total taxes. The biggest offset to
income tax are probably FICA taxes. The guy making $10k or 20k loses
about 7.65% in FICA taxes. The guy earning 200K pays less than half
that rate.

As I said previously, there is a sweet spot in the US tax code around
$100k. At that level, one gets to enjoy the reduced FICA tax rate (as a
% of total income) while getting nice tax subsidies on housing (tax
reduced interest &amp; property taxes) that ends up as tax free income (up
to 500k per sale), Roth IRAs that are tax free, 401ks (who at 20'30k/yr
can afford a 401k), highly subsidized, tax free heath care (the poor
are much less likely to have paid heath care and when they get it,
typically must pay with after tax dollars) and other benefits of long
form filing (the poor are much less likely to enjoy such deductions).

Bottom line, the % of total taxes paid is not all that different from
the lowest to highest paid - most are probably paying around 1/3 in
taxes +/- 5%.

"/>  All &quot;tax reform&quot; does is tinker with who pays taxes and when they pay them,
the government still needs to be financed. The issue of HOW MUCH (in aggregate)
we pay is a totally separate issue. If government collects less in taxes than
it is spending, then you are still being taxed by the reduction of the spending
power of things such as your earnings, savings, and (especially) your future
retirement earnings. We have a word for that: &quot;Inflation&quot;. In the face of a
continuing deficit, it is inevitable.

Eliminating the IRS and adopting a use or sales tax would be
interesting and would tax those who spend, instead of those who
invest. Some might say it is regressive, but it would beat the
current system. The market is usually up in an election year, and
probably will be this year too, but the factors of terrorism and
uncertainty about the election will dampen spirits until the results
are known. It is funny to read some of the polarized liberal and
conservative views this thread has generated. Someone has to remind
you the President really has very little to do with the economy's
performance, as it is cyclical and unemployment runs hand and hand
with recessions, which run hand and hand with binges. Boom and bust

&gt;&gt;You're misinformed. Other than fuel, there is hardly any necessity that
&gt;&gt;the poor pay federal taxes on.

&gt; Only you are stuck on federal taxes. Focusing on federal taxes misses a
&gt; good 2/3 of all taxes. Thus the fallacy in your claim - &quot;the rich are
&gt; taxed at a substantially higher rate percentage wise than the poor&quot;.

"/> Nope, if you live in Nevada, there are no income taxes. I don't believe
there is sales tax on food. In Oregon there is no sales tax period. In
Arizona there is no sales tax on food.

As state taxes are much different than federal taxes, and they differe
greatly from state to state, you cannot lump everyone together under that
envelope.

On top of all that, we were talking about federal taxes, as under the Bush
administration. State taxes have nothing to do with Bush's policies. You
were the one who started railing on about Bush's tax cuts and how they hurt
the economy, now you propose that your claims are valid based on what a
particular state withholds in taxes, whether sales tax or income tax.

Your argument is ridiculously off base, and nowhere near congruent with the
original topic. As well, your premise is absurd along with your math
skills.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;You are tossing out numbers with no figures to back them up. How about we
&gt;&gt;examine the numbers. The average person pays about $900 per year for
&gt;&gt;fuel. That's the per capita use of 8.8 gallons per week. They pay about
&gt;&gt;$190 per year in federal taxes on that fuel. A person making minimum
&gt;&gt;wage, who would never be expected to live on that wage anyway, would make
&gt;&gt;$10,712 per year. That means that they would pay an additional 1.7% of
&gt;&gt;their income in federal taxes, but then they wouldn't be responsible to
&gt;&gt;pay but a small percentage in taxes anyway, and probably nothing.

&gt; Huh? First you said &quot; They pay about $190 per year in federal taxes on
&gt; that fuel.&quot; Then you say &quot;pay but a small percentages in taxes anyway,
&gt; and probably nothing.&quot; How can they pay &quot;$190/yr&quot; and &quot;probably nothing&quot;?

"/> If you know what I meant, why do you ask stupid questions. I don't know why
you're trying to be so logical that simple errors cause you such a major
malfunction when your whole argument is about the least logical
conglomeration of nonsense ever put into tangible form. This is just like
the whole stupidity over the comma I left out in an earlier post.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The gas tax was mentioned because someone earning say $200k is unlikely to
&gt; pay 10x in gas taxes as someone earning say $20k. The same holds with
&gt; food and many other items. The point being, as one earns more,

"/> Where is the federal sales tax on food?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; they spend less and less on a percentage basis for taxable items.
&gt; Consequently, although the poor pay less in income taxes, they often
&gt; times pay as much or more total tax on a percentage of their income vs.
&gt; the wealthy.

"/> Wrong again. Where are these numbers? While I understand what you're
saying, I don't believe you are correct. It's one thing to make unfounded
assertions and an entirely different thing to back them up with actual
facts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; You are confusing income tax with total taxes. The biggest offset to
&gt; income tax are probably FICA taxes. The guy making $10k or 20k loses
&gt; about 7.65% in FICA taxes. The guy earning 200K pays less than half that
&gt; rate.

"/> So now you're back on federal taxes? Apparently you can't make up your
mind. Why don't you pick a topic to debate, get your evidence gathered and
then make your statement. Make sure that you are talking about the same
thing you are using your figures to support also. That tends to lend to the
confusion. You can't try and bolster an argument about whether or not
illegal immigrants should be allowed in the country by talking about the
total amount of floozelhoffers the US consumed last year. It's not logical.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; As I said previously, there is a sweet spot in the US tax code around
&gt; $100k. At that level, one gets to enjoy the reduced FICA tax rate (as a %
&gt; of total income) while getting nice tax subsidies on housing (tax reduced
&gt; interest &amp; property taxes) that ends up as tax free income (up to 500k per
&gt; sale), Roth IRAs that are tax free, 401ks (who at 20'30k/yr can afford a
&gt; 401k), highly subsidized, tax free heath care (the poor are much less
&gt; likely to have paid heath care and when they get it, typically must pay
&gt; with after tax dollars) and other benefits of long form filing (the
&gt; poor are much less likely to enjoy such deductions).

"/> Yeah, the poor pay after tax dollars for their medicaid. Roth IRA's are not
some windfall of a tax shelter that you seem to think they are. You are
limited greatly in the amount of money you can put in one and still have
that money remain tax free. As well, as soon as you take that money out,
just as with 401K, there is a tax levied on it. Not a single dime gets past
the federal government. I'm surprised they don't have tax enforcement
agents drop coins on the ground and then bust you when you don't claim that
you picked it up on your taxes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Bottom line, the % of total taxes paid is not all that different from the
&gt; lowest to highest paid - most are probably paying around 1/3 in taxes +/-
&gt; 5%.

"/> Assuming that is true, what in the hell does that have to do with Bush's tax
cuts that we were originally talking about. NOTHING!!!

"/> That's where your definitely wrong. Samuel Adams didn't have cable. Allow
people to buy a new stereo every so often, put enough sports on TV and march
them off to church every Sunday. They'll be quite content no matter how much
you tax them. This is the way it's been everywhere long before Machiavelli
spelled it out in detail for the Prince.

The Romans were taxed to the hilt to support a bloated military budget and
the people were given the likes of the Coliseum to show them how great Rome
was. It kept them paying those taxes in spite of the reality that Rome was
crumbling from the top down. Two thousand years later, we Americans are no
different.

I read an amusing exchange between Lord Faraday and a government official
who was questioning Faraday's research into high voltage electricity. The
British government was funding his pure research and the official, looking
at a large storage capacitor, asked Faraday to defend how such a device
could possibly benefit the Crown. Faraday replied, &quot;I have no idea, but I
am certain that one day you will tax it&quot;. A true genius.

although he spoke at rallies where hundreds of Soviet/North Vietnamese flags

this is not where you were going in the passage above. You wanted to
show that the same money in 74' is worth more than 04' dollars.

The point I'm doing my best to make is that the 2 paragraphs above are
sort of misleading, to me at least. In the 2nd paragraph you say that
the 04' obligation is much less using the same dollar amount and you
would be right except that what you would be getting now would only be
worth only around $278 a month in 1974 prices. My calculations are
taken from a NASA site. Want to buy a house with a $278 monthly
payment today?

"/> Being a Republican doesn't mean sitting by watching GW bring the country
to it's knees. He's made so many back-assward decisions, with
little-to-no thought of the outcome (shoot from the hip, cowboy
approach), that it's hard to imagine another four years like the last
four. Face it - the guy is a loser who has no idea as to what he's
doing. He has to be on the attack because he has nothing positive to
show for his term. Jobs are down (may the the first time of a net
loss in jobs during any president's term in 60 years) , investments have
poor returns (poorest in 60 years), the budget has been knocked out of
whack (squandered), he has alienated most all our allies (don't even
consider international travel), the war goes on and on with more US
deaths every day, etc.

Can it get worse? Hmm - GW may actually get elected.

Heard this morning that businesses have a record amount of cash sitting
aside - waiting for some sign of any future hope. Factor in all the
investments in 1% CDs &amp; low earning bonds &amp; there's a whole shitload of
cash available for some serious expansion. Now if only there was some
hope of progress. Hint - not as long as GW's in office.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So what you are saying is that 4 years of a miserable economy has nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;to do with GW? Heard yesterday that this may very well be the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;time in some 70 years that there will be less total jobs during any 4
&gt;&gt;&gt;year term.

&gt;&gt;Well, you heard wrong because it's not true.

&gt; Wong - yet again. &quot;Employment is 1.2 million (0.9%) below what it was
&gt; when the recession began in March 2001 (private-sector employment is down
&gt; 1.8 million, or 1.6%)&quot; -  http://www.jobwatch.org

"/> Go look again at when the recession began. The economic downturn began at
the end of 1998. It was not accepted as a recession until 2001. Bush saw
it coming as did anyone else who had been watching the economy. It started
under Clinton.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;The weak job growth of the last two months means that President George W.
&gt; Bush is now likely to stand for re-election with fewer jobs in the nation
&gt; than when he took office. The last president to see a jobs decline during
&gt; his term was Herbert Hoover during the Depression&quot; -

&gt;&gt;&gt;Once again, I'll say it all has to do with perception. Individuals &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;business leaders continue to believe there is little hope under Bush
&gt;&gt;&gt;leadership. A majority clearly began holding back upon his election &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;have not changed course yet. Meanwhile, there is a record amounts of
&gt;&gt;&gt;cash sitting aside for use, once there is any hope for the future.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Meanwhile......

&gt;&gt;A majority were holding back well before he got elected. The official
&gt;&gt;start of the recession was back in 1998.

&gt; ??? making up more data again? Or head in the ... sand.

"/> Nope, I have not made up a single shred of data, and in fact I have provided
proof of where my data comes from for almost everything. I shouldn't have
to do this much work for someone who has no clue about what reality is, nor
would they accept it if it flew up their ass. I don't get paid enough to
try to educate the insane.

to be a prevailing attitude that bond issues are free money so let's

spent for those same purposes is being poured down a rathole as fast as
it comes in.

Yeah like those airplane crashes into those two financial towers didn't have
a lot to do with the economy. If Clinton was still President the financial
woes would still be the same seeing that it was starting to recede while he
was still in office. So according to your thinking shouldn't we also blame
President Clinton for the recession as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The unemployment rate is lower than it was during the vast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;majority of the Clinton years, and it is only getting lower. As
well,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that may not be employed at those jobs anymore can easily find other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;work.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where do you such fictional data?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;According to the Division of Labor Force Statistics (last 10 years):

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1993 - 6.3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1994 - 6.1
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1995 - 5.6
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1996 - 5.4
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1997 - 4.9
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1998 - 4.5
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1999 - 4.2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2000 - 4.0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2001 - 4.7
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2002 - 5.8
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2003 - 6.0

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The rate clearly dropped continually during the 90's and has clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;increased as a direct result of the poor Bush economic policies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If that's what it shows as far as numbers go you are right. As far as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your analysis goes you are wrong. Numbers like these, especially in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the early years of a presidency are more reflective of the past
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;administration as opposed to the current one. It takes a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;years for whatever action, or inaction for that matter, any given
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;administration does for it to have an impact on the economy. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;economy just doesn't react that fast. --

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, it has to do with perception. Just as the stock market
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tanked, businesses stopped investing in expansion &amp; stopped hiring when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;GW got elected.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It happened well before that. It started at the beginning of 2000, well
&gt;&gt;&gt;before November. How is that Bush's fault? Democrat math again.

&gt;&gt; Huh? did you even read the full reply? Head in the sand or just
&gt;&gt; incapable of reading comprehension?
&gt;&gt; Since you are obviously a bit slow - once again, it's perception - much
&gt;&gt; like the stock market tends to predict the upcoming 6-12 months,
&gt;&gt; businesses tend to invest &amp; individuals tend to spend based on future
&gt;&gt; expectations, not on the past. GW's election obviously spooked most
&gt;&gt; confidence.

&gt; Spoken like a person who has never invested a dime in anything.
