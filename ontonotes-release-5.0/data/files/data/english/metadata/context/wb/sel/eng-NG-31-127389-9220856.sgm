Depends on your definition. Our (US) DoD and defense industry are very
happy with more bombs than they need, more military hardware than the rest

Most of the studies indicate that the USA is undergoing a slow but sure
decline in standard of living for people at the low end of the
socio-economic scale. And, the redistribution of wealth is going to a
small elite group at the high end of the socio-economic scale. Actually,
there are studies that indicate all of this is happening all over the
world, too.

Just one book that goes into some details of how this works:
(Please remember, however, that Europe (for two centuries), Japan (for
decades)  and now even China (going into Africa) and India (buying &amp;
setting up offices all over the world) are all getting into the
&quot;imperialism&quot; thing).

What Economic Hit Men (EHMs) do:

Quotes--

from page xvii of the Prologue:

&quot;...we build a global empire. We are an elite
group of men and women who utilize
international finance organizations to foment
conditions that make other nations subservient
to the corporatocracy running our biggest
corporations, our government, and our banks.
Like our counterparts in the Mafia, EHMs
provide favors. These take the form of loans
to develop infrastructure--electric generating
plants, highways, ports, airports, or
industrial parks. A condition of of such loans
is that engineering and construction companies
from our own country must build all of these
projects. In essence, most of the money never
leaves the United States; it is simply
transferred from the banking offices in
Washington to engineering offices in New York,
Houston, or San Francisco.&quot;

&quot;Despite the fact that the money is returned
almost immediately to corporations that are
members of the corporatocracy (the creditors),
the recipient country is required to pay it
all back, principal plus interest. If an EHM
is completely successful, the loans are so
large that the debtor is forced to default on
its payments after a few years. When this
happens, then like the Mafia we demand our
pound of flesh. This often includes one or
more of the following: control over United
Nations votes, the installation of military
bases, or access to precious resources such as
oil or the Panama Canal. Of course, the debtor
still owes us the money--and another country
is added to our global empire.&quot;

from page xiii of the Prologue:

&quot;Because of my fellow EHMs and me, Ecuador is
in far worse shape today than she was before
we introduced her to the miracles of modern
economics, banking, and engineering. Since
1970, during this period known euphemistically
as the Oil Boom, the official poverty level
grew from 50 to 70 percent, under- or
unemployment increased from 15 to 70 percent,
and public debt increased from $240 million to
$16 billion. Meanwhile, the share of national
resources allocated to the poorest segments of
the population declined from 20 to 6 percent.&quot;

from page xx of the Prologue:

&quot;For every $100 of crude taken out of the
Ecuadorian rain forests, the oil companies
receive $75. Of the remaining $25, three-
quarters must go to paying off the foreign
debt. Most of the remainder covers military
and other government expenses--which leaves
about $2.50 for health, education, and
programs aimes at helping the poor.&quot;

from page xxi of the Prologue:

&quot;We seldom resort to anything illegal because
the system itself is built on subterfuge, and
the system is by definition legitimate.&quot;

&quot;However--and this is a very large caveat--if
we fail, and even more sinister breed steps
in, ones we EHMs refer to as the jackals, men
who trace their heritage directly to those
earlier empires. When they emerge, heads of
state are overthrown or die in violent
&quot;accidents.&quot; And, if by chance the jackals
fail, as they failed in Afghanistan and Iraq,
then the old models resurface [meaning troops
are sent in].&quot;

from page 16, Chapter 2:

&quot;Claudine and I openly discussed the deceptive
nature of GNP. For instance, the growth of GNP
may result even when it profits only one
person, such as an individual who owns a
utility company, and even if the majority of
the population is burdened with debt. The rich
get richer and the poor grow poorer. Yet, from
a statistical standpoint, this is recorded as
economic progress.&quot;

from page 19, Chapter 2:

&quot;By the time I enrolled in BU's business
school, a solution to the Roosevelt-as-CIA-
agent problem had already been worked out.
U.S. intelligence agencies--including the NSA-
-would identify prospective EHMs, who could
then be hired by international corporations.
These EHMs would never be paid by the
government; instead, they would draw their
salaries from the private sector. As a result,
their dirty work, if exposed, would be chalked
up to corporate greed rather than to
government policy. In addition, the
corporations that hired them, although paid by
government agencies and their multinational
banking counterparts (with taxpayer money),
would be insulated from congressional
oversight and public scrutiny, shielded by a
growing body of legal initiatives, including
trademarks, international trade, and Freedom
of Information laws.&quot;

Around pages 84 and after, the author mentions
an agreement made with the government of Saudi
Arabia to build up its infrastructure. The
arrangements were a little different. Instead
of using US money which flowed to the foreign
country as debt but which in reality just
flowed to corporate bank accounts, Saudi oil
dollars came to the corporate bank accounts to
pay for those airports, malls, etc., and part
of the deal, which ran over a 25 year period,
was that the Saudi govt would guarantee a
minimum amount of oil production targeted for
delivery to the USA and within price ranges
acceptable to the USA and in return for this,
the US government would provide whatever
military assistance the Saudi royal family
would ever need to defend its dominion over
Saudi Arabia (the author says it was an offer
they could not refuse).

from page 102:

&quot;I brought a young MIT mathematician, Dr.
Nadipuram Prasad, into my department and gave
him a budget. Within six months he developed a
Markov method for econometric modeling.
Together we hammered out a series of technical
papers that presented Markov as a
revolutionary method for forecasting the
impact of infrastructure investment on
economic development.

next paragraph, same page:

&quot;It was exactly what we wanted: a tool that
scientifically &quot;proved&quot; we were doing
countries a favor by helping them incur debts
they would never be able to pay off. In
addition, only a highly skilled econometrician
with lots of time and money could possibly
comprehend the intricacies of Markov or
question its conclusion.&quot;

from page 160:

&quot;The Bechtel Group, Inc., was a prime example
of the cozy relationship between private
companies and the U.S. government. I knew
Bechtel well; we at MAIN often worked closely
with the company, and its cheif architect
became a close personal friend. Bechtel [there
is at least one whole book on Bechtel and its
secrecy and secret dealings] was the United
States' most influential engineering and
construction company. Its president and senior
officers included George Shultz and Caspar
Weinberger, who despised Torrijos [who later
died in a mysterious accident] because he
brazenly courted a Japanese plan to replace
Panama's existing canal with a new, more
efficient one.&quot;

The rest of the book gives details on the
author's involvment in EHM activities in many
other countries and reveals how the author's
conscience began to bother him to the point
where he vowed to expose this work by writing
the above book. For those people wishing to
delve more deeply into such issues, one need
only look at the bottom of the page after the
title page for hints on where else to look.
Here one will often find something like the
following (quoted from this book). Read it
carefully.

thanks for another superb review.

It is my view that with the advent of a new third world educated
class, that what we in the US have considered high end labor, and
professions will be compensated much as it is in the third world these
days, sparcely... driven to the lowest common denominator an over
taxed and driven to ruins middle class can afford.

In other words, it sounds like you're saying that everything in the USA
will be offshored, sooner or later. That will leave--I'm sure--the rich
people, who basically don't have to work. Just hire underlings to do the
work.

From all I can see and read about, uprisings are on the decline here in
the USA since everyone is mesmerized, pacified, obedientized, and

People are not likely to revolt when they're more interested in
watching television and eating junkfood all day.  The modern form of
&quot;bread and circuses&quot;.

If it's a small number of folks revolting and/or being annoying, then
it's mainly a law enforcement problem to deal with.  (ie.  Such as
white supremacists, survivalists, anti-tax protesters, marijuana
growers, mafia, biker gangs, etc ... types of folks). The main
exception seem to be the islamic terrorist + extremist types, which
they seem to like to deal with by military means.

Well, I guess I'd like to write a book about altruism. Of course, I'd have
to have a big section on selfish-greed, too, just for comparison.

I seem to recall some smug economist dared to publish a journal article on
altruism. Sure enough, he _proved_ -- just what you'd expect from an
economist -- that it all boiled down to, somehow, money AND the notion
that only an economist had the credentials and tools to talk about it,

Interesting endpoint. However, I have the feeling that kings/emperors--who
usually had a lot of concubines (and other trappings of
power/wealth)--also had to deal with &quot;problems of the day&quot; (eg. enemy
king/emperor in neigboring lands). But, there are rich people who don't
work and don't do anything useful (they do have playboy reputations), and
there are lazy people at the bottom of the socio-economic scale who &quot;just
get by&quot; too. What to do? Good question.

In the past, these sorts of folks typically ended up on the welfare
roles.  Though with welfare reform over the years making it harder and
harder to be on the dole, I suppose folks of this variety probably end
up either working menial jobs or they become homeless bums on the
streets.

If a severe economic recession ever happens again (ie. like the great
depression, or even the early 1980's), I wouldn't be surprised if they
expanded the welfare roles again.  They may also try other things
like:

- raising the legal high school dropout age to 18 or 19
- inflating college/university grades to keep young adults in school
- watering down admissions standards for graduate school
- send all ex-military folks to graduate school

largely to keep teenagers and young adults off the streets during the
day.

It seems like the easiest solution the government will pursue is to
keep young people cooped up in educational institutions, as a way to
keep them off the streets during the day.  Everybody knows what
happens when there's tons of young people and/or ex-military folks
running around the streets all day with nothing worthwhile to do.
(ie.  Weimar Republic of Germany between ww1 and ww2).

nothing but a downward mobility path as your only option.

This seems to have been around for a long time since the beginning of
the industrial revolution (or even before), with very few effective
solutions for the most part.  (ie. Outside of the failed marxist/

Unions seem to be less and less effective over the decades, especially
in professions which can be easily outsourced to other jurisdictions
where the particular unions have very little to no effective power.

ones where the jobs can't be moved somewhere else so easily, such as

A better question to ask is what can somebody &quot;retrain&quot; in.  Many
white collar type jobs which were once considered &quot;secure&quot;, are no

lucrative areas of law anymore, unless one becomes a &quot;superstar&quot;
attorney, like OJ Simpson's &quot;dream team&quot; attorneys, Senator John

The question is whether all that extra money will be spent on hiring
new folks for hard tenured type of faculty jobs, or if they're just
hiring temporary instructors on term-to-term teaching contracts.  Most
likely what will be the case is that the administrators will bring in
a few of their own buddies/cronies for the hard tenured jobs, and
spend the rest of the cash on hiring temporary instructors on term-to-
term contracts.

I'm not sure it was a total failure. China is evolving. Russia is back
pedalling towards &quot;govt control.&quot; You have to look at the criteria and ask
people what tradeoffs they prefer. Europe is substantially &quot;socialist&quot; and
has been &quot;stable&quot; for, like, 100-150 years. the USA, &quot;non-socialist&quot; had
its slump during the Great Depression as well as many earlier depressions

&quot;failure&quot; is if there is a massive and sudden &quot;regime change&quot; (such as
Castro in Cuba, 1917 in Russia, 1949 in China, etc). China is interesting

That's not the end. When the gap between the rich and the poor riches
an astronomical difference, then the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; will revolt. As
a result of the ensuing revolution, the societal order will change,
the rich will give up their riches, the poor will get the real
opportunities.

The change of the societal order also means that those poor bastards
who saved their pensions into the superannuation funds for the whole
life will get a shaft. (The new power -- coincidentially made up of
Gen X'ers will not honor the promises made by the previous power-to-
be.) This makes me wonder whether I should continue doing the
voluntary deposits into my superannuation fund... it all will get
burned anyway.

&gt;&gt; its slump during the Great Depression as well as many earlier depressions
&gt;&gt; as recorded in economic history.

&gt; Some folks will argue that America is socialistic in many ways, such
&gt; as:  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
&gt; Federal Reserve Bank, Department of Education, National Science
&gt; Foundation, etc ...

All comparatively recent, too.

&gt;&gt; The only time you can talk about a
&gt;&gt; &quot;failure&quot; is if there is a massive and sudden &quot;regime change&quot; (such as
&gt;&gt; Castro in Cuba, 1917 in Russia, 1949 in China, etc). China is interesting
&gt;&gt; since it calls itself communist, even today, is totalitarian, and yet has
&gt;&gt; had a whole string of reforms going back even into the 1950s. Would you
&gt;&gt; say communism in China has failed? Or, is it &quot;reverse-Marxism&quot;?

&gt; The Marxist style collective farms ended up as total failures in the
&gt; end in many communist countries.  Many were producing less food, than
&gt; before collectivization.  Even the Israeli kibbutz collective farms
&gt; have been falling out of favor.

That was in the EARLY history of the reforms. Starting around mid 1980s
Most of the reforms were geared to growth, industrialiszation, trade, and
makein money. And, look at them run with it. It was maybe over the last
few months that they expanded private ownership, too. Like it or not, they
are going to be a force to be reckoned with. Actually, they already are.

The present system in China these days, probably resembles places like
Mexico (under the quasi-monopoly of the PRI party) or Franco's Spain
after ww2.

China has very little to do with Marxist style economics these days.
Though I suspect one reason why the &quot;communist&quot; title is still used
today, is because the &quot;communist party&quot; doesn't want to give up or
share power with anyone else.  It's all about power, and very little
to do with &quot;textbook&quot; ideology.

No argument there. but, the point I was trying to make was that there were
many reforms taking place, at regular intervals, and in attempts to make
improvements (including trade, industrialization, etc.).

And, if the &quot;kids&quot; over there decide to foment unrest (aka the democracy
movement), and if this turns into a bandwagon, and it does not evolve
peacefully? Somehow people are going to have to resolve the &quot;disconnect&quot;

Most likely what happened is that they saw all the failures produced
by all their Marxist style &quot;5 year plans&quot;, and decided to reform
things more towards a partial capitalistic system via many baby steps
over several decades.  The reforms seem to have had more push after
Chairman Mao died.  They were probably also sick and tired of being
&quot;sick and tired&quot; by then, of the country moving backwards.  Only baby
steps were taken probably due to the fact that they had civil unrest
on their minds constantly.  A sudden change from marxism to capitalism
could have been worse, like what happened in Russia during the 1990's.

Well, I'm not sure about the &quot;partial capitalist&quot; part, but one book I
have had an appendix (I read the appendix, but not the book) showing the
dates of ther reforms and about a paragraph of what the reform was about.

I would view these reforms as akin to major laws passed by our own
congress; they abolished something percieved to be bad, and initiated
something they wanted to try.

The reforms seem to have had more push after

Obviously. Even in Russia, Stalin had to die, then a whole string of less
bad guys had to come and go. In the end, it was the non-Russian republics
that all went &quot;domino&quot; to declare independence. Along with the Berlin
wall, and E. Europe (the satellites).

They were probably also sick and tired of being

Russia had the &quot;oligarches&quot; who managed a &quot;palace coup&quot; of unprecidented
proportions: they got their hands, basicaly, on pre-existing monopolies
(kombinats) and almost instantly became multi-billionaires. I can see why
Putin and his KGB buddies organized to &quot;grab back&quot; these &quot;treasures&quot;. Now,
don't ask me where this is all going to end up in 10-20 years, either, but
I'll fall back on an old &quot;fall-back&quot;: &quot;if it ain't one &quot;clique&quot; that gets
into power, then it will be some other &quot;clique&quot; that gets into power&quot;
(meanwhile, CYA).

Yeah, more or less. But, since we have zero news here in the USA about the
internal _politics_ and sentiments in China (all I ever see is business
news), we don't know. I had given thought to the ideal of finding out if
there are any Chinese websites in english that talked about feelings in
China, but, what the hell, I'd have to spend 40-50 hours a week and also
monitoring Japan, too, and maybe Aljazeera (to get a unfiltered pulse beat
on the middle east jazz). And, I can't even do justice to the WSJ that I
get 6 days a week.
