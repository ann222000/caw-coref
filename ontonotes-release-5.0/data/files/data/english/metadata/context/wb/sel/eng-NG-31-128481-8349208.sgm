There are some pretty choice quotes from shockingly honest Zionists.  You
can find them in places like here and here.  A few samples (emphasis in red;
if you wonder about my continuing concerns about the Zionist Empire, see 12
to 16; 11 is so accurate a statement of Israeli negotiating procedure it is
almost funny):

a.. &quot;We came here to a country that was populated by Arabs and we are
building here a Hebrew, a Jewish state; instead of the Arab villages, Jewish
villages were established. You even do not know the names of those villages,
and I do not blame you because these villages no longer exist. There is not
a single Jewish settlement that was not established in the place of a former
Arab Village.&quot;  -  Moshe Dyan, March 19, 1969, speech at the Technion in
Haifa, quoted in Ha'aretz, April 4, 1969.

b..  &quot;Among ourselves, it must be clear that there is no place in the
country for both peoples together.                       With the Arabs we
shall not achieve our aim of being an independent people in this country.
The only solution is Eretz-Israel, at least the west part of Eretz-Israel,
without Arabs . . . And there is no other way but to transfer the Arabs from
here to the neighbouring countries. Transfer all of them, not one village or
tribe should remain . . .&quot;  -Joseph Weitz, entry in his diary for 1940
(quoted in his article: 'A solution to the Refugee Problem: An Israeli State
with a small Arab Minority', published in Davar, 29 September, 1967.

c.. &quot;I gathered all of the Jewish mukhtars, who have contact with Arabs in
different villages and asked them to whisper in the ears of some Arabs that
a great Jewish reinforcement has arrived in Galilée and that it is going to
burn all of the villages of the Huleh. They should suggest to these Arabs,
as their friends, to escape while there is still time . . . The tactic
reached its goal completely. The building of the police station at Halsa
fell into our hands without a shot. The wide areas were cleaned . . .&quot;  -
Yigal Allon, Ha Sepher Ha Palmach, Vol. 2, p. 268, 1948.

d.. &quot;...as uncontrolled panic spread through all Arab quarters, the
Israelis brought up jeeps with loudspeakers which broadcast recorded 'horror
sounds'. These included shrieks, wails and anguished moans of Arab women,
the wail of sirens and the clang of fire-alarm bells, interrupted by a
sepulchral voice calling out in Arabic: 'Save your souls, all ye faithful:
The Jews are using poison gas and atomic weapons. Run for your lives in the
name of Allah'.&quot;  - Leo Heiman, Israeli Army Reserve Officer who fought in
1948. Marine Corps Gazette, June 1964.

e.. &quot;Because we took the land this gives us the image of being bad, of
being aggressive. The Jews always considered that the land belonged to them,
but in fact it belonged to the Arabs. I would go further: I would say the
original source of this conflict lies with Israel, with the Jews - and you
can quote me.&quot;  - Yehoshofat Harkabi, former Israeli Chief of Military
Intelligence, in 'Peace Won't be a Plane Ticket to Cairo,' International
Armed Forces Journal, October 1973, p.30.

f.. &quot;It is unacceptable that nations made up of people who have only just
come down from the trees should take themselves for world leaders . . . How
can such primitive beings have an opinion of their own?&quot; - Yitzhak Shamir,
in reference to the black African nations who voted in support of the 1975
U.N. resolution, which denounced Zionism as a form of racism, in Yediot
Ahronot, November 14, 1975.

g.. &quot;The thesis that the danger of genocide was hanging over us in June
1967 and that Israel was fighting for its physical existence is only bluff,
which was born and developed after the war.&quot; - Israeli General Matityahu
Peled, Ha'aretz, 19 March 1972.

h.. &quot;Let us not today fling accusations at the murderers. Who are we that
we should argue against their hatred? For eight years now they sit in their
refugee camps in Gaza, and before their very eyes, we turn into our
homestead the land and the villages in which they and their forefathers have
lived.&quot;  - Moshe Dyan, 1953, quoted by Uri Avneri in Israel without
Zionists, p. 134.

i.. &quot;I don't understand your optimism. Why should the Arabs make peace? If
I was an Arab leader I would never make terms with Israel. That is natural:
we have taken their country.&quot; - David Ben Gurion, 1956, quoted by Nahum
Goldmann in The Jewish Paradox, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1978, p.99.

j.. &quot;We take the land first and the law comes after.&quot;  - Mr. Palmon, Arab
affairs adviser to the Mayor of Jerusalem, quoted in The Guardian, 26 April
1972.

k.. &quot;We must define our position and lay down basic principles for a
settlement. Our demands should be moderate and balanced, and appear to be
reasonable. But in fact they must involve such conditions as to ensure that
the enemy rejects them. Then we should manoeuvre and allow him to define his
own position, and reject a settlement on the basis of a compromise solution.
We should then publish his demands as embodying unreasonable extremism.&quot; -
General Yehoshafat Harkabi, Ma'ariv, 2 November 1973.

l.. &quot;To maintain the status quo will not do. We have to set up a dynamic
state bent upon expansion.&quot; - David Ben Gurion, Rebirth and Destiny of
Israel, The Philosophical Press, New York, 1954, p. 419.

m.. &quot;During the last 100 years our people have been in a process of
building up the country and the nation, of expansion, of getting additional
Jews and additional settlements in order to expand the borders here. Let no
Jew say that the process has ended. Let no Jew say that we are near the end
of the road.&quot;  - Moshe Dyan, Ma'ariv, 7 July 1968.

n.. &quot;Palestine is a territory whose chief geographical feature is this:
that the river Jordan does not delineate its frontier but flows through its
centre.&quot; - Vladimir Jabotinsky, at the 16th Zionist Congress (1929), quoted
by Desmond Stewart in The Middle East: Temple of Janus, p.304.

o.. &quot;Take the American Declaration of Independence for instance. It
contains no mention of the territorial limits. We are not obliged to state
the limits of our State.&quot; - Ben Gurion's diary, 14 May 1948, quoted by
Michael Bar Zohar in The Armed Prophet, p.133.

p.. &quot;The Achilles heel of the Arab coalition is the Lebanon. Muslim
supremacy in this country is artificial and can easily be overthrown. A
Christian State ought to be set up there, with its southern frontier on the
river Litani. We would sign a treaty of alliance with this State. Thus when
we have broken the strength of the Arab Legion and bombed Amman, we could
wipe out Transjordan; after that Syria would fall. And if Egypt still dared
to make war on us, we would bomb Port Said, Alexandria and Cairo. We should
thus end the war and would have but paid to Egypt, Assyria and Chaldea on
behalf of our ancestors.&quot; - Ben Gurion's Diary, 21 May 1948, quoted by
Michael Bar Zohar in The Armed Prophet, p.139.

q.. &quot;I shall not be ashamed to confess that if I had the power, as I have
the will, I would select a score of efficient young men - intelligent,
decent, devoted to our ideal and burning with the desire to help redeem
Jews - and I would send them to the countries where Jews are absorbed in
sinful self-satisfaction. The task of these young men would be to disguise
themselves as non-Jews, and plague Jews with anti-Semitic slogans such as
'Bloody Jew', 'Jews go to Palestine' and similar intimacies. I can vouch
that the results in terms of a considerable immigration to Israel from these
countries would be ten thousand times larger than the results brought by
thousands of emissaries who have been preaching for decades to deaf ears.&quot; -
Davar, 1952, Editor Sharan, quoted by Alfred Lilienthal in The Other Side of
the Coin, Devin-Adair, New York, p.47.

r.. &quot;We declare openly that the Arabs have no right to settle on even one
centimeter of Eretz Israel . . . Force is all they do or ever will
understand. We shall use the ultimate force until the Palestinians come
crawling to us on all fours.&quot;  - Rafael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli
Defense Forces - Gad Becker, Yediot Ahronot 13 April 1983, New York Times 14
April 1983.

s.. &quot;We must do everything to ensure they (the Palestinian refugees) never
do return.&quot; - David Ben-Gurion, in his diary, 18 July 1948, quoted in
Michael Bar Zohar's Ben-Gurion: the Armed Prophet, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.
157.

t.. &quot;We walked outside, Ben-Gurion accompanying us. Allon repeated his
question, What is to be done with the Palestinian population?' Ben-Gurion
waved his hand in a gesture which said 'Drive them out!'&quot; - Yitzhak Rabin,
leaked censored version of Rabin memoirs, published in the New York Times,
23 October 1979.

u.. &quot;There are some who believe that the non-Jewish population, even in a
high percentage, within our borders will be more effectively under our
surveillance; and there are some who believe the contrary, i.e., that it is
easier to carry out surveillance over the activities of a neighbor than over
those of a tenant. [I] tend to support the latter view and have an
additional argument: . . . the need to sustain the character of the state
which will henceforth be Jewish . . . with a non-Jewish minority limited to
15 percent. I had already reached this fundamental position as early as 1940
[and] it is entered in my diary.&quot;  - Joseph Weitz, head of the Jewish
Agency's Colonization Department. From Israel: an Apartheid State by Uri
Davis, p.5.

v.. &quot;Everybody has to move, run and grab as many hilltops as they can to
enlarge the settlements because everything we take now will stay ours . . .
Everything we don't grab will go to them.&quot; - Ariel Sharon, Israeli Foreign
Minister, addressing a meeting of militants from the Tsomet Party, Agence
France Presse, November 15, 1998.

w.. &quot;Spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it
employment . . . Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the
poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.&quot; - Theodore Herzl,
founder of the World Zionist Organization, speaking of the Arabs of
Palestine, Complete Diaries, June 12, 1895 entry.

x.. &quot;We will establish ourselves in Palestine whether you like it or not .
. .You can hasten our arrival or you can equally retard it. It is however
better for you to help us so as to avoid our constructive powers being
turned into a destructive power which will overthrow the world.&quot; - Chaim
Weizmann, in Judische Rundschau, No. 4, 1920.

y.. &quot;The Palestinians are like crocodiles, the more you give them meat,
they want more.&quot; - Ehud Barak, current Israeli Minister of Defense, in the
Jerusalem Post, Aug. 30, 2000.

z.. &quot;One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.&quot; -  Rabbi Yaacov
Perrin, Feb. 27, 1994 in N.Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1994, p. 1.

aa.. &quot;I'm a one-issue guy and my issue is Israel.&quot; - mega-political donor,
mostly to the Democratic Party, Haim Saban explaining how to make your
political donations go further in NYT, September 5, 2004.
