What's the proper way to remember a psychopathic tyrant whose lust to dominate and destroy was responsible for the deaths of 70 million or so of his countrymen?

You probably guessed it: Name a restaurant after him.

Mao Asian Bistro and Sushi Bar in Denver's tony Cherry Creek neighborhood, which opened in 2003, is named "after China's infamous Chairman Mao Tse-tung" and seats "nearly 220 people between its dining room, patio and lounge."

Charlie Huang, the owner "said the restaurant will feature an intricate design theme that includes a variety of images of the late dictator, including a custom-made bust of Mao and a ceiling mural of Mao's Red Army that leads diners into the Chairman's Room, a private dining room that seats 16 people. With its imported marble countertops, bamboo floor and emphasis on detail, Huang describes Mao as "eclectic, dramatic and fun."

A "designer working on the project, said the restaurant's interior will display a theme she calls 'a happy Mao.' It's done in a tongue-and-cheek way . . . centered around Gen. Mao Tse-tung. It's looking at him in a fun and unusual way."

I wonder whether Mao's clever "Little Red Book" menu features bark, compost, chlorella ("a disgusting substance that grew in urine and contained a little protein"), and, of course, Soylent Green , since these are the things the Chinese people (excluding the nomenklatura) subsisted on during the Great Leap Forward .

Here are a few ideas for new restaurant concepts: Hitler's L'il Hideaway, Uncle Joe's Tundra Bar &amp; Grille, Tokyo Tojo's Hibachi Steakhouse, and (simply) MUSSOLINI. All of these eateries should be eclectic, dramatic, and fun.

Thanks for the detail about chlorella. I see I'll be carrying that info to my grave. We should go there. I love sushi (which is Japanese) and not, therefore, a good mix with the restaurant's fun theme of a bloodthirsty, pedophile Chinese leader. I think I've been to Hitler's Hideaway.

I'm pretty sure that there should be an exclamation point in the Italian one:

MUSSOLINI!

Presumably with fasces on either side of the door.

And I quote from the Little Red Book that sits under the Mao statue (arm raised, a paternal smile on his face) that in turn sits on my desk:

"People of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs!"

Seems like it was written yesterday....

I haven't been to Hitler's Li'l Hideaway. My mistake. It was another Hitler themed restaurant.
