Ban on YouTube lifted after deal
Published on August 31, 2007

The government yesterday lifted its ban on the YouTube website after
the site's management agreed to block any video clips deemed offensive
to Thai people or those that violate Thai law.

Information and Communications Technology Minister Sitthichai
Pookai-yaudom said local Internet surfers would now be able to access
the YouTube site, which has been banned since April 3.

This follows an agreement between the Ministry of ICT and YouTube that
the site would curb any clips which have contents considered an
affront to Thai people or those that violate the Kingdom's laws.

Sitthichai said YouTube had just finished creating a program that
would block sensitive video clips from being accessed from Thai
Internet service providers (...)

Good one Morticia - you and Tchiowa are masters in telling half
truths! Why did you omit the reason You Tube was down in the LoS?

So please read:

The controversy sparked off earlier this year when a person from the
US, using the pseudonym &quot;Paddidda&quot;, posted several video clips
insulting the Thai monarchy. This happened when the political
situation in Thailand was tense, with an undercurrent of confrontation
between supporters of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and
those who backed the military regime.

Is that to much asked?

Carlos,

To be frank, I also prefer posts of yours like this one above.
I rarely agree with Tchiowa's opinion (I don't think that *any* European can
agree with his world's view) but I don't think he is a bad guy.
Morever, remember he is an 'oooold' scter and, in public, Thais respect
elderly people, even the senile ones ;-)

I suppose that it's a mere coincidence that the military approved ban
is lifted just *after*  the referendum. Or do you wanna preach that
it's God's will?
Anyway, I repeat that I don't want to discuss the *real* causes of the
military censorship with a fanatic like you.
I'm glad to know that (most) people in Thailand can now see something
different from the junta's propaganda and watch the speech of Thaksin
Shinawatra, if it's their wish.

Would you know that most of the Thais don't give a flying fart what
that Chinese Criminal says or not says, but are extremely upset if one
posts such demeaning movies like those from that US Thai Lady, about
our beloved King?
Now go back and send that Chinese a love letter you idiot and try to

Hey Deckard,

Can you shade a light on all this?

Your &quot;fag&quot; habit, your drug habit ......

(Hope that the Thai Cyberpolice is not watching).

&quot;I don't, but he seems like he's attractive. I don't mean that in a gay
way....&quot;
&quot;I wasn't high when that pic was taken...&quot;
&quot;I didn't say that, I just asked you if you think she's pretty&quot;... and on it
goes, you can imagine with him being nine years-old&quot;
&quot;She babysits my monsters once in a while and they both are crazy about her.
My oldest has a crush on her....&quot;
&quot;I tell my closest male friends that I love them, and they do the same, but
it's a &quot;guy&quot;

Are you applying nowfor a degree in prostitution as well?

Your arsehole is now stretched so heavy that you can sit on a billiard ball
and the billiard ball disappears into your arsehole.

POTSIE?! Ahhhhhhhhh! Dammit! (hehehe) Luke Perry... ok... that was nice. He
is a good looking guy, I mean... I bet women think he's handsome. I don't,
but he seems like he's attractive. I don't mean that in a gay way, just that
he... &lt;grin&gt;

I wasn't high when that pic was taken, but the person that took it was
pissing me off. She kept taking the picture *right before* I was ready. We'd
taken about eight and I was so ready to stop. My two boys can be seen in the
background, hugging each other in a picture on the wall. It isn't my office,
it's hers, she loves my two boys. She took that pic too, and hung it on her
wall all without me knowing. She babysits my monsters once in a while and
they both are crazy about her. My oldest has a crush on her, but you'd never
get him to admit that. He just says things like &quot;Do you think she's pretty
dad?&quot; To whit I'll say, &quot;Sure, she's pretty. You think she's pretty, huh?&quot;
He gets that 'look' on his face and says &quot;I didn't say that, I just asked
you if you think she's pretty&quot;... and on it goes, you can imagine with him
being nine years-old.

On the gay fear thing. It probably happens because when guys are in their
teens, *any* comment that is even a little bit &quot;gay&quot; sounding is met with
mass ridicule from your peers. I'm sure the Deluxe One and Durt have tons of
stories, which aren't a bit funny about that little bit of hatefulness.
This kind of conditions you to respond in a zealous (sometimes homo-phobic)
manner when things get &quot;mushy&quot;. Yea, it's stupid, and I try not to act that
way, but sometimes those deep habits surface.

I tell my closest male friends that I love them, and they do the same, but
it's a &quot;guy&quot; kind of comment - something like &quot;Alright, I'll see you at the
clubhouse at 4:00. Love ya bro.&quot; Or if someone is really hurting I might get
more intense and say &quot;I love you, and I'll do anything I can to help you get
though this shit&quot;. Well, I'm sure that's way more than you cared to know on
that subject.

Subject: Re: My (ex) Thai girlfriend

I don't want to give here too many details but FYI the trouble I got with my
three girl-friends is:
- infidelity with the first one,
- repetitive lies (&quot;white lies&quot;) with the 2d,
- disagreement about &quot;sin sod&quot; with my present friend.

The last one was not a problem of money, as you may think, but the
comparative importance of our (future) children and her parents.

My point is simply that you can find a Thai lady who is not only after your
money but still have trouble, often worsened by the culture difference.

I ask this question because as a Farang, I understand nothing about cultural
differences between people from different Asian countries.
My g/f is a Thai-Chinese from Bangkok and a divorcee from a Singaporian man.
She rarely speaks about her ex-husband.
But once she told me she was surprised at the differences between Latin men
and Singaporian men in ordinary life  ( she knew  your state pretty well ).

Despite my questions, she never explained this quote.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Good one Morticia - you and Tchiowa are masters in telling half
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;truths! Why did you omit the reason You Tube was down in the LoS?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;So please read:

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The controversy sparked off earlier this year when a person from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;US, using the pseudonym &quot;Paddidda&quot;, posted several video clips
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;insulting the Thai monarchy. This happened when the political
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;situation in Thailand was tense, with an undercurrent of confrontation
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;between supporters of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;those who backed the military regime.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is that to much asked?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Cheers

&gt;&gt;&gt; AH! AH! AH! AH! Still trolling, Chabby?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose that it's a mere coincidence that the military approved ban
&gt;&gt;&gt; is lifted just *after*  the referendum. Or do you wanna preach that
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's God's will?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, I repeat that I don't want to discuss the *real* causes of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; military censorship with a fanatic like you.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm glad to know that (most) people in Thailand can now see something
&gt;&gt;&gt; different from the junta's propaganda and watch the speech of Thaksin
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shinawatra, if it's their wish.

&gt;&gt;Our Morticia is becoming more and more like Tchiowa - demented?

&gt;&gt;Would you know that most of the Thais don't give a flying fart what
&gt;&gt;that Chinese Criminal says or not says, but are extremely upset if one
&gt;&gt;posts such demeaning movies like those from that US Thai Lady, about
&gt;&gt;our beloved King?

&gt; Ahem... Do you remember the a$$hole who lately posted here this gem:
&gt; &quot;Thaksin was never on YouTube&quot;
&gt; And now you pretend to let us *know* what most of the Thais think?
&gt; ROTFL!!!

&gt;&gt;Now go back and send that Chinese a love letter you idiot and try to
&gt;&gt;troll somewhat else!

&gt;&gt;Morticia: Idiot
&gt; Idiot?
&gt; &quot;One word of advise to you: better to be thought an idiot - then to
&gt; open your mouth and remove any doubt, confirming that you're even
&gt; worse then an idiot!&quot; - Psittacosaurus Songklae (senile Al Jezeera's

And you sir are a dumb Singaporean Chinese! Why would the official
Thaksin website be open and YouTube blocked? Only a low-class dumb
Singaporean cannot understand that the Thai Nation Loves the King.
But why to discuss with you you'll never learn, you probably have
already brown lips from kissing TEMASEK arses!
