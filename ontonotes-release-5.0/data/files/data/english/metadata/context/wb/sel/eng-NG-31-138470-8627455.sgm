To lay the whole issue of documentation to rest. Here is a book report
from the New England:
Evidence Explained
by Michael J. Leclerc

The reasons for citing sources for our research are twofold. First, it
is important that we be able to find that source again. One of my
colleagues has a particular piece of information on her grandfather's
place of birth that she found in the early years of her research.
Unfortunately, she did not document where she found it at the time.
She has spent the last 25 years trying to find the information again,
without success.The second reason is so that we can judge the
reliability of the information, weighing it against other information
found in different sources.

In 1997 renowned genealogist the Genealogical Publishing Company (GPC)
released Elizabeth Shown Mills' Evidence! Citation and Analysis for
the Family Historian. This 124-page book was divided into two roughly
equal-sized parts. The first dealt with the fundamentals of analysis
and citation, the second with specific citation formats. The book
quickly became a success, and has been the standard for citing sources
ever since.

Over the course of the last decade, Ms. Mills has been collecting
samples of even more citations, and expanding the ones she previously
published. Last month GPC published the long-awaited revised and
expanded version of that earlier work. Evidence Explained: Citing
History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace is a necessity for anyone
wishing to properly document their research. No longer will
researchers have to struggle with the question of how to cite a
particular source.

The new work tips the scales at just shy of 900 pages, providing
information on any kind of source imaginable. With such a large volume
of material, the organization and presentation of the material is
critical. The new work is laid out in a manner similar to the Chicago
Manual of Style, making it infinitely easier to locate information.
The book is grouped into fourteen sections with headings such as
Cemetery Records, Local &amp; State Records, National Government Records,
and Publications: Periodicals, Broadcasts, &amp; Web Miscellanea. The
first two sections give a detailed introduction to the Fundamentals of
Evidence Analysis and the Fundamentals of Citation.

Each section starts with a list of the subsections. That is followed
by QuickCheck Models. These models give specific examples from the
sources described in that section. This introductory matter is printed
on gray pages, making it easier to locate information. The
introductory matter is followed by the subsections giving detailed
information on specific types of sources. Once you have an
understanding of the types of resources, the QuickCheck Models will
make it easier for you to cite your information properly.

Evidence Explained is one of the most useful books a genealogist can
have on their shelf. You will always know how to cite your sources
properly so that you will be able to locate that information again. It
will be the best money you've spent on your research. It is available
from GPC for $49.95 at www.genealogical.com .
