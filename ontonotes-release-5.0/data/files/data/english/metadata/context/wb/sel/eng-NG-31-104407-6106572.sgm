AmericaSpeaks is recruiting facilitators for Town Meetings in New Orleans,
Philadelphia and Chicago. Volunteer facilitators will work with small groups
of ten people to deliberate about a series of questions that will be asked
over the course of the full day meeting. Via laptop computers and keypad
polling devices, individual tables will share the results of their
conversations with the hundreds of participants in the room. Facilitators
will be oriented to the program and are expected have experience with small
group face-to-face deliberation, comfort with diversity and difference of
opinion. For more about AmericaSpeaks and the 21st Century Town Meeting(R),
