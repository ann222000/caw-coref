Just need to vent. My in-laws call about once a month; however, they
always talk a few minutes and ask my wife to call back. Last month I had
a charge of $84.00 for a 22-minute call. What the? I am assuming that my
in-laws believe it is cheaper for us to call them. Should I ask my wife
to scale back the calls or should I just take the expense since it makes
my wife happy?

And, am I safe to assume that calling the states from Australia is more
expensive than vice versa?

No one should be paying almost 3 bucks per minute, I don't care where
you are calling. That just doesn't seem right. Are you using a
long-distance service or straight calling? My goodness I would have a
wild fit of rage if I saw that expense every month. My suggestion to you
is keep your wife happy and get yourself a service that provides service
to Australia for cheap. There are many companies out there, we use
OneSuite and have been happy with their service. Seriously, an 84 dollar
phone call is outrageous especially with so many phone companies out
there fighting for our dollars.

As far as I know, it would appear that calling the states from Australia
would be cheaper given your current long-distance service. ***Barry

oHello

OneSuite

To answer the OP's last question, it is almost always cheaper to call from
the US to an international destination if the caller is careful. There is
much more LD competition here than in most parts of the world. This is the
reason &quot;call back&quot; numbers are frequently used when traveling overseas and
calling back to the US.

To get the good rates, the caller needs to shop around. If the caller
simply picks up the phone and uses the default LD carrier, it is likely an
international call will cost a small forture. Places like OneSuite.com,
Yak.com and oHello.com all beat the standard rates of the &quot;big 3.&quot; There
are also good deals in prepaid phone &quot;cards,&quot; but read the fine print as
many have extra charges and often bill in increments as large as 3 minutes.
(Meaning a 3 minute 5 second call will cost you 6 minutes.) Note that the
&quot;cards&quot; are often just an account number sent to you via email.

The rates vary among the choices depending upon the country called. So
where OneSuite is lowest one place, Yak will the lowest to a different
country. If you make only a few short to medium duration calls any of the
discount places will save you money. If you make a lot of calls to one or
two countries, you need to check all of the above to see which best fits
your specific needs.

I bought a pre-paid card from a 99cent shop in NYC as a goof to play
with on a trip to Canada. After the first call there is a 79cents
weekly fee. So you better use the entire card in the first call or you
will have less the 20 cents left.

I like OneSuite.
Incredibly low long distance phone rates. As low as USA-Canada 1.9CPM!
Works as prepaid phone card. PIN not needed for calls from home or cell
phone. Compare the rates at  https://www.OneSuite.com/  No monthly fee or
minimum. Use Promotion/SuiteTreat Code: FREEoffer23 for FREE time.
Altho from USA payphones there is a surcharge, there is NONE from
Canadian payphones.

"/> I had to call my local phone company, SBC, the other day because my CC#
for auto-pay had to be updated. Naturally the CSR wanted to tell me
about their &quot;great&quot; long distance offers, when he noticed that I had no
long distance carrier associated with my number. They were so incredibly
expensive compared to OneSuite, that I wondered if there were actually
people dumb enough to buy their long distance through their local phone
company, or AT&amp;T. Besides the $2 monthly fee, the per minute rates were
more than 5x what OneSuite charges, and the calling card rate was more
then 7x what OneSuite charges, plus a $1.95 monthly fee.

Actually, I make most of my LD calls on my cell phone, after 8:00 p.m.,
since it's free. But OneSuite is great for the SF Bay Area where
intra-LATA calls are very expensive, i.e. to call from San Jose to San
Francisco is 6 cents per minute, versus 1.9 cents on OneSuite. I program
my landline phones with OneSuite's local access number, so it's a single
button press to access their system, then program in my frequently
called numbers into their system, which is three more button presses. So
in four presses I can make a call. Compare that with the PIN based
calling cards, where you may have to enter 35-40 digits to make a call.

"/> If you can use a landline to make the call, investigate use of a
phonecard to make the o/s call. In general, it seems cheaper to ring
ANY country from Australia than vice versa--provided you can use an
Oz phonecard. I think you should be able to get a call cost of about
AU 1.5 c/min, with no connection fee, for Oz to USA. However, if your
inlaws make only about one call per month, then the typical 3 to 4
month expiry of most phonecards will wipe out any savings. What time
of the day would these calls be made? Perhaps the Global Gossip phone
card might be viable as it has no expiry date. I think Telstra's cards,
the Super Buzz and SayG'Day have 12 month expirys after first use.
Consider buying a suitable card as a gift for your inlaws!

&gt;&gt; One of the few ways to run up a bill like that would be for this guy's
&gt;&gt; in-laws to call Australia collect from the US. That can run up quite a
&gt; bill
&gt;&gt; if you're unwary - courtesy of Telstra, which appears to monopolise the
&gt;&gt; incoming 'Collect Call' business.

&gt; We call it &quot;Reverse Charges&quot; here, you seppo wannabe

"/> Not the point. The US inlaws would call it Collect - and that's what they
may need to be interrogated about.

&gt; so I guess it rests with Telstra

"/> No. Others want to provide the service but they also have more pressing
issues, like sorting ULL.
