Much love and thanks to llaras for the quicker than whoa beta. For the Worst
Case Scenario Disaster challenge

My scenario? How to Create an Entry Alarm

***

There is a thief on board Serenity.

Kaylee can't find her hairbrush and her favorite spanner. But nobody believes
her when she says that someone must have taken them. &quot;No one's going to take
your spanner, Kaylee,&quot; Mal mutters. &quot;No one even knows what a spanner is. If
you can't fix the problem, just say so. I know you do your best.&quot;

Inara's sympathy is just as bad somehow. &quot;I can brush your hair for you,&quot; she
offers.

Kaylee stomps away. &quot;I just want my own brush back!&quot;

No one believes Kaylee until the sign on her room disappears. Wash and Jayne
snicker all day long until Kaylee decides it's a good day to hammer out some
dents in the deck plating with enthusiasm. The banging relieves her frustration
and shushes the snickerers. They both know better than to tease a woman with a
weapon. Zoe winks at Kaylee as she passes by, and Kaylee narrows her eyes
considering, but she can't think of a reason Zoe would take her hairbrush.

She wakes one morning to find that someone snuck into her room in the middle of
the night and turned everything around back to front before making off with her
recorder.

Not tonight, Kaylee decides, clutching the box of boysenberries she bought with
her pay. She hides the box under her bed, but decides that it's precious enough
to require extra measures. Before bed, she rigs a string of clattery things to
her door. If someone pushes it open, the string will jangle. No one comes
between Kaylee and fresh fruit.

The clang of a cowbell jars Kaylee from sleep. &quot;Caught you!&quot; she mumbles
delightedly, springing from her bed. She should have turned on the light, she
thinks, but she's got to hurry, hurry. The thief will be backing out of the
doorway, running down the hall, disappearing into some other part of the
ship.

She gropes for the ladder in the dark, squeaking when her seeking hands grasp
something infinitely softer than a ladder. Something small and round and warm.
Kaylee's not a blusher, but she feels an overwhelming urge to apologize,
instantly recognizing that she's just tweaked River's breast.

&quot;You're the thief?&quot; Kaylee asks. Of course, River's the only one who could have
gotten into Kaylee's room quiet enough to move everything. She should have
thought of it before. Kaylee smells berry juice in the air, and realizes that
River has already made it to the box and back to the ladder. She rang the bell
deliberately. &quot;Wha -- why?&quot;

River steps closer in the dark, pressing against Kaylee. She feels wet
fingertips against her lips. Her tongue flicks out automatically, licking
lovably soft hands that taste of sugar and salt, catching the juice that drips
along them. River pulls her hand away. Wrapping it around Kaylee's neck, she
pulls them flush against each other. Kaylee's mouth angles, seeking, and she
moans as River nibbles at her lip: tiny, tiny kisses that leave Kaylee
breathless.

With a shock, Kaylee realizes that River tastes better than berries. &quot;Caught
you,&quot; River whispers against Kaylee's mouth. &quot;Caught you.&quot;
