Come on Stuart,  My world is falling apart, I thought I knew what
Plate Tectonics was saying but I didn't know it was like this.  Tell
me Mr Bercovici is wrong and that the subducting slab is not pulling
the world apart (because it's cold ) (because it's dense). The slab,
that is.   Tell me the subducting slab doesn't  really drive Plate
Tectonics after all.    I always thought the earth being hot inside
and making convection currents had something to do with it, but now I
learn, No, ..there is no need for potassium or any other 'um' in the
core, ..that convection is a poloidal-toroidal motional thing, driven
by the subducting slab, and the energy for driving is because the
subducting slab is cold, ..that it sinks, ..dragging the whole ocean
floor with it, creating pull-apart at the ridges, which are intruded
by sheeted dyke swarms, because of partial melting, ... and transform
faults cutting them as complementary results of slab-pull  half a
world away, due to minimisation of stress release in toroidal
flow., ..

This is mind-blowing stuff.  I don't think I will sleep tonight, nor
maybe tomorrow night either, ..till I digest this.  The Earth is
falling in on itself, ..because it is getting cold, ..Asia is
wrestling with India,
http://users.indigo.net.au/don/nonsense/sumo.html
...pinning it to the concrete underneath, ...pulling all the sediments
off the ocean floors and piling them up around the continental
margins, all the whilst making the ocean floors sink...  Which throws
up mountain belts in the middle of the oceans, .. by pressure-release
partial melting.

Jonathan's probably climbing into his bath as I write.    Come
on...  !!

..I have to go away in a few days, ..Don't leave me in suspense.   How
can we stop this catastrophe?   Can we reverse it?  Can we drill a
hole to the core and pour some molten iron down to reverse this
process?

Sheesh. Such a silly diatribe. Or is it really a plea for help?

Of course heat sources are needed. If the Mantle was not hot, there
wouldn't
be any subduction. Slabs have buoyancy because the mantle is hot.

I explained the basic physics of this mode of convection in posts
to Timberwoof. I suggest you review it.

Once again you've gone off half cocked and made a fool of yourself.

Again.

'
Is that all you took out of it?  And all you have to say in reply:-
&quot;The mantle is hot and the 'slab' has 'buoyancy'&quot;  Not much value is
there?  - a concoction of fluid mechanics with no reference to
geological parameters.  Not very illuminating.

Geologically speaking it's not worth a zack, really.   (Transform
faults as zones of minimum dissipation of stress -  Is that so?)  And
a model that begins by *assuming* the 'source-sink' cycle.   Value out
equates with value in.  ('If's and Coulds')

Apparently you're  not even getting the point of your own
construction, which is that in Plate Tectonic 'reality'  the 'source'
is subsidiary to the 'sink',. therefore there *is* no 'cycle'.   The
slab sinks because of gravity, pulls the plate creating pressure
reduction and the partial melting at the ridges.  The 'heat' at the
ridges is therefore a 'gap-filler'.  What follows is a one-way
street.  The mantle sinks once and that's it.  Moreover your
'volumetric heat' considerations ignore that most of the heat is very
quickly on the outside of the system; the radioactive elements are not
something that are divorced from the rock and can remain at depth to
heat the next batch of cold slab.  The heatsource  must rise with the
rock it is heating.  It's a once-only turn.  That's what the original
differentiation of core mantle and crust was all about.  If things
were as you say that distinction would not be there.)

You ridicule what consensus says about the slab being &quot;forced down&quot;,
but avoid giving any reason yourself for the location of subduction on
continental margins.  You offer no criticism of the popular consensus
views of crustal crumpling by plate collision.
And you offer nothing on how the Plate Tectonic cycle  (the 'source-
sink' cycle)  begins.

You virtually avoid all questions that include geology.

You don't offer much, Stuart, ..beyond saying the mantle is hot and
slabs are buoyant (negatively).  The less you say the less you run the
risk of saying something stupid?  (The mark of the bad scientist is
lack of adventure, ..being afraid to make mistakes.   Consensus suits
many people.  No matter how silly it is, it is safe.

(Moribund cadavers with their leaden feet in leaden ruts.  &quot;We are
the footsoldiers of consensus.  Convince us - if you can!)

The wave speed anomalies associated with subducted can be
truned into temnperature anomalies and hence density
using equations of state determined from actual rocks.

Hence the buoynacy of the slab can be determined.

So, ..the zone is more foliated than the surrounds (say), and the ray
is slower or faster depending which way the fabric is.  How do you

What I do understand is that the process of how you arrive at your
destination is very much &quot;IF-Could&quot; / hypothetical, and includes
virtually zilch of geological input.

Let me ask you something.   A hypothetical (since you're good at
numerical ones, lets see you you go on the qualitative ones.)  Suspend
your belief for a moment, and consider that the Pacific may be closed
in the same way as the Atlantic and other oceans, ..and in the same
time-frame. (That's a given, say.)   How would you then regard
subduction zones?  There is no dispute that this zone of earthquakes
exists.  How would you deal with it ?

That's what it boils down to, doesn't it, ..whether the Pacific was
closed in the same time-frame.  If it can be shown (geologically) that
the Pacific was closed in the same time-frame as the other oceans then
that would have to take precedence over your  hypothetical fluid
mechanics model that underpins your denial.

In other words, this is a geological argument, not one of fluid
mechanics.  So being rational you should put your fluid mechanics and
cold slabs and dissipative flow  aside, and deal with the question
geologically.  ?Can the continental crust be retrofitted across the
Pacific or not.

That's the core  argument in a nutshell.   Isn't it.

Here we have Desperate Don. So very keep to prove his little
brainstorm resembles reality - but then he turns round as says
measurements aren't needed????

What sort of reality do you live in Desperate Don? A reality where the
Earth is expanding but man doesn't need to measure it? A reality where
you rely on magic to produce the extra mass needed? Even a reality
where you are a respected scientist and a contributor to usenet that
isn't constantly laughed at and pilloried?

Well, I live in the real world. One where plate tectonics has the
answers and if you even want to bring it into doubt then you have to
first come up with the measurements that show the Earth is actually
expanding, then you have to explain where the extra mass is coming
from, and only then will people stop laughing at you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; is we can then apply an equation of state which relates the variables
&gt; &gt; &gt; of wave
&gt; &gt; &gt; speed, pressure and temperature. The pressure is easily determined,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and since the wave
&gt; &gt; &gt; speed is found form the tomographic analysis, the temperature can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; calculated.

&gt; &gt; Sure you can. And what do you get?   A great big *IF-COULD*.

&gt; No &quot;COULD&quot;. &quot;CAN&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;then turned into temperature anomalies&quot;: (how do you know what the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temperature  anomaly is for that particular sector without the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Earthquakes in the first place)

&gt; &gt; &gt; The temperature of the material is the temperature of the material,
&gt; &gt; &gt; earthquakes
&gt; &gt; &gt; or no earthquakes. Stop grasping for straws to throw and try to learn
&gt; &gt; &gt; something.

&gt; &gt; I'm not doubting your process, ..I'm sure you're very good at it.  How
&gt; &gt; do you determine the temperature, independently of Earthquakes?

&gt; I'm afraid I don't understand what it is you don't understand.

&gt; Stuart

&gt; &gt; &gt;  &quot;and hence density&quot; - But that's the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; real bit isn't it:- &quot;using equations of state from actual rocks&quot;..

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yup.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You know, &quot;hard data&quot;. Something ee lacks.

&gt; &gt; EE certainly lacks the crutch of  Fluid mechanics to help it along.
&gt; &gt; Based as it is on solid geological observation (Something Plate
&gt; &gt; Tectonics lacks (being entirely founded as it is on a convenient
&gt; &gt; assumption), Earth Expansion doesn't need any crutch.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I said, it's all iffy-couldy-abracadabra, a manipulated concoction
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bears about as much relation to geological reality as a holey
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swiss cheese.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately you are simply trying to put down what you don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have no rebuttal, just say so. Its better then looking like  a
&gt; &gt; &gt; kook.

&gt; &gt; What I do understand is that the process of how you arrive at your
&gt; &gt; destination is very much &quot;IF-Could&quot; / hypothetical, and includes
&gt; &gt; virtually zilch of geological input.

&gt; &gt; Let me ask you something.   A hypothetical (since you're good at
&gt; &gt; numerical ones, lets see you you go on the qualitative ones.)  Suspend
&gt; &gt; your belief for a moment, and consider that the Pacific may be closed
&gt; &gt; in the same way as the Atlantic and other oceans, ..and in the same
&gt; &gt; time-frame. (That's a given, say.)   How would you then regard
&gt; &gt; subduction zones?  There is no dispute that this zone of earthquakes
&gt; &gt; exists.  How would you deal with it ?

&gt; &gt; That's what it boils down to, doesn't it, ..whether the Pacific was
&gt; &gt; closed in the same time-frame.  If it can be shown (geologically) that
&gt; &gt; the Pacific was closed in the same time-frame as the other oceans then
&gt; &gt; that would have to take precedence over your  hypothetical fluid
&gt; &gt; mechanics model that underpins your denial.

&gt; &gt; In other words, this is a geological argument, not one of fluid
&gt; &gt; mechanics.  So being rational you should put your fluid mechanics and
&gt; &gt; cold slabs and dissipative flow  aside, and deal with the question
&gt; &gt; geologically.  ?Can the continental crust be retrofitted across the
&gt; &gt; Pacific or not.

&gt; &gt; That's the core  argument in a nutshell.   Isn't it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Shame be upon you for your contribution to enlightenment here.

&gt; &gt; Ever though about just growing up Desperate Don? Get yourself an
&gt; &gt; education, learn about real science, real geophysics and real geology.
&gt; &gt; Then, when you have the proper grounding in the subjects you want to
&gt; &gt; talk about, you can go and find the real data - the detailed
&gt; &gt; measurements of the Earth. You will then find that the Earth is NOT
&gt; &gt; expanding.

&gt; &gt; Go on, with a bit of effort you could get the necessary education in
&gt; &gt; say ten years. It will give you something better to do that making a
&gt; &gt; fool of yourself on usenet.

&gt; &gt; You see Desperate Don. Unless you can find some measurements that
&gt; &gt; actually show the Earth is expanding you have no case. You cannot go
&gt; &gt; around claiming the Earth is expanding and expect people to even
&gt; &gt; entertain the idea when you don't have a single measurement to back
&gt; &gt; you up. It is no wonder you are treated with such contempt and
&gt; &gt; ridicule on usenet when you cannot even fact the FACT that you have no
&gt; &gt; measurements to back you up, in fact you don't even seem to be
&gt; &gt; looking.

&gt; &gt; Face it Desperate Don, you don't have a case and at this rate never
&gt; &gt; will. Give up, you have lost.

&gt; Pong off with your fixation on measurement,

If we're allowed to ignore measurements we don't like, how about we
just pretend the Atlantic isn't expanding. Then we'll all be happy,
right?

&gt; What do you mean how the firast ridge related to the first subduction
&gt; zone?
">

Like Adam and Eve, smart guy, ..you know, ..Ridgie -didge: a great big
ridge developing (that's Adam), and a great big swallower (That's Eve)
of a subdiction zone.   Come on, you know perfectly well what I mean.
The two are paired, ..and  not just 'one-and-one', ..but 'one_*ON*_
one'.  A certain ridge has to go with a certain subduction zone - you
can't just have any old ridge going with any old subduction zone.
otherwise you break the convection cycle.  But that's just an anyway-
by-the-by, not really germane to the argument.

So leave creationists out of it, because if you're going to raise
creation as means of scoring points then with your primary convenient
assumption of subduction in the first place
&lt; http://users.indigo.net.au/don/nonsense/subass.html &gt;
...and all that subsequent IF-COULD wonky finagling (your posts)  to
make it work (and still fail; brittle failure is NOT ductile flow -
not even on geologically long time scales), then you don't have  a leg
to stand on.

The question is the chicken and the egg one - What determines where a
subduction zone will first form? How far must this newly created
oceanic lithosphere travel from the ridge (where it's only as thick as
the crust - 8-12km or so) before it sinks?  Does a ridge form first so
that you can get spreading, so you can get cooling and thickening, so
you can get subduction?  (How do you thicken 8km to 200km, just by
cooling?  Underplating? (as in Earth expansion?).

Or is the Subduction zone created first so that it can sink and so
cause pressure reduction 'somewhere', so that a ridge forms and  the
cycle starts moving?  How was the ridge / spreading centre fixed in
the first place, if it is the pull of the subducting slab that creates
it? ( If anything is going to create 'asymmetrical spreading at the
ridges' - as you were arguing with Florian about, ..' then that will.)

You are faced with the conundrum that the first thing to form is a
subduction zone, But how?  How does a slab begin to sink, so that a
ridge can begin to form?   And more importantly, where?

In other words, that you have a 'source-sink' mechanism installed in
the first place is very much an assumption, and one that is at best
suspiciously sleight of hand, and at worst just wrong-headed.  You
can't just say, &quot;In the beginning there was a subduction zone and a
spreading centre&quot;,  Or is it your whole point that you can?

If you do then *THAT IS*  very Creationist, you have to admit..

So far as your unanswerable problems of how and where are concerned,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very funny Don. And any way the above measures specific gravity, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; density.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a geologist you should know the difference.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...then we might have gotten somewhere, but &quot;wave speed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anomalies&quot; (how do you know they're anomalous in the first place)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anomalous in this case, means different that surrounding mantle? How
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we know? By measuring the travel times for a bazillion ray paths and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same procedure that a CAT scan uses, we can work out the detailed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; velocity structure of the medium through which these rays passed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, ..the zone is more foliated than the surrounds (say), and the ray
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is slower or faster depending which way the fabric is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This has nothing to do with foliation or in this case &quot;anisotropy&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Guess again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How do you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know whether to attribute time to fabric or temperature (/density/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coldness).

&gt; &gt; &gt; You pass rays perpendicular to the strike of the slab as well as
&gt; &gt; &gt; parallel.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;There's all that shearing and partial melting going on, of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course there's going to be some sort of fabric.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Once again Don is desparately grasping for straws and
&gt; &gt; &gt; hoping for something, anything that sticks.

&gt; &gt; In Plate Tectonics, and your way of presenting it, there are  no
&gt; &gt; straws to grasp at.  It's hot air Ifs and coulds.  Try answering the
&gt; &gt; question about how the first ridge related to the first subduction
&gt; &gt; zone. And if you feel up to it, try to say where it was.

&gt; This is incredible. Its amazing the number of parallels between eers
&gt; and creationists..

&gt; When shown evidence for evolution creationists babble about
&gt; abiogenesis.

&gt; What do you mean how the firast ridge related to the first subduction
&gt; zone?

&gt; I guess it was a long distance relationship.
">

You guess it was a long-distance relationship?  Sounds pretty
dysfunctional to me.  Hardly what you would call a relationship at all
in fact.

So it's your &quot;guess&quot;.   Another 'guess' .   First of all GUESS  that
the Earth can't get bigger (because we don't know how it can - thereby
abrogating your responsibility to carefully assessing theinformation
that led to that conclusion in the first place rather than dismissing
it out of hand as impossible (because we don't know how)), and
therefore the CONVENIENT ASSUMPTION that subduction zones are paired
with the spreading zones in that Adam-and-Eve sort of way (which they
are not), and then all that IF-COULD FINAGLING to make it work, and
now the GUESS that it was a &quot;long distance relationship&quot;.  The more
distant the better, on account of COOLING, but there is no intrinsic
reason why a 'big boat' should be more sinkable than a smaller one.
In fact if it's a question of getting sunk by crustbergs, the smaller
boats (thinknesses of oceanic lithosphere) should go down like
ninepins, shouldn't they.

There's an awful lot of guesses and iffy-couldy finagling masquerading
under the guise of 'fact', about this Plate Tectonics of yours.

Here's one for you to think about.  If the oceanic lithosphere sinks
because it's cold and thick (the colder and thicker the better), why
do you keep insisting in saying that the East Pacific spreading ridge
(which is hottest and thinnest) is subducting beneath North America
(rather than being overriden)?   What have you got against
overriding?  Everybody else talks about overriding, why don't you?
What does 'overrding' on that scale imply to you?  (tell us, do..)

Are we going to get an answer from you how this Adam-and-Eve source-
sink system of yours starts up?
http://tinyurl.com/2qfqqv
...Or don't you have a clue?
(Go on, ..tell us it was always there..)

So EARTH STEADILY EXPANDED from the cretaceous  to now but is not now
expanding currently?  if you have the MASS (bogus method) of 2 million
tons  a day say.  it would be noticeable because Celestial Mechanics
would change. and the earth's mass is known to 8 or 9 places. should the
earth increase in mass, the moon would collide with the earth. instead
of 1/81.3000588  that is the ratio of the two masses. When the earth
increases the moon accelerates.  its orbit will become highly elliptical
and strike the earth.

If we shrink the EARTH, the moon will fly away. because the current
velocity will exceed escape for the new mass.. if we decrease the earth
mass slowly then the moon will oscillate more and more until it
intersects with the earth.

You can read
Bates, Mueller and White &quot;ASTRODYNAMICS&quot; 1971
A.E. Roy &quot;orbital Motion&quot; 1983
M. Forrest &quot; Celestial Mechanics) 1910
or if you are more adept mathematically Julina Green  &quot;Spherical
Astronomy&quot;. 1985  (relativistic astronomy)

for QM I suggest Messiah &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot;.  Mass generation takes
large ENERGY.

all of these kinds of science refute EE.

Well not so fast. The moho is the boundary between crust and mantle,

thank you  I was winging it. i know kind of how it works but
specifically not so much. I only remember the general shape from 50
years ago.

I observe that the temperature and pressure may only be 5 to 7 thousand

be some insulating effect?.

could you email me some information about the ridge being suborned by
NA. please.  I need to know just how bozo I have been I have been trying
and I really find EE distasteful.

And for irritation we should remind them that they have NO METHOD to
generate MASS.  It is too cold even in the CORE.

if the EARTH increases in MASS the MOON will not speed up but be going
too slow and will collide with the EARTH.   WHY ARE WE STILL HERE?

The moon is so big and so close -- we are a double planet.

We get quite a bit of consistent HEAT out of the CORE. this HEAT
provides energy for all kinds of things.  the Ridges creation has not
been discussed by Don or even Stuart. The Fact is Don says &quot;the
continents are static rooted&quot;  and if that is so then now did NA get on
top of the eastern pacific ridge.  I note that eyeballing the distances
it seems that the distance from NA to the Mid Atlantic ridge is about
the same as the distance the WEST Coast moved toward the East Pacific
Ridge.   That is PT ,  EE does not do this. expansion would preserve the
relationships of the ridges to  North America.

the problem with what you say is that it does not apply directly to
any subject you mention.  how does UPL explain the upwelling at the
ridges all over the world.  amid there are subduction zones EVERYWHERE.
The NA continent on the WEST is sub ducting the San Juan De Fuqua PLATE.
it drives the  CASCADES in the USA. Further more the plate is basically
stationary and the EARTH is overriding it. The Marianas Trench is pure
subduction and the direction is 89 degrees straight down. In fact there
is NO sea floor created that does not go down somewhere.

I would trust Stuart before I ever trust any thing a EE has to say.

you talk as if the oblate spheroid of the earth was a mystery.

Mate,
Good points to which I will reply more lenghtly tonight.
Of course the crust is not swallowed by the mantle presently although
it has been ... this is not a matter of Uniformism or Catastrophism
but Uniformism AND Catastrophism indeed !
.. as for Stuart although I appreciate him very much as an individual
&amp; as Don's  personal friend, and do trust himas well blindly in
matters of art, antiques and as well as a connaisseur in good wines,
unfortunately as far as Geology is concerned he has not mind of his
own and repeat blindly was he has been taught since freshman
years !!! ... like so many by the way !

Before one should condamn dear Stuart's  lack of free will though, one
should understand the underlying dogmas behind his certitudes ( belief
or faith ) and consider as the poor man is in fact a slave of his
thought Masters ( as poor George by the way ) Do you have any idea
concerning these ? Do you have any idea re the underlying dogmas of
the present Geology ? Do you have any idea further regarding where it
diverges from the True Geology ?

Kind regards jpt

- I am saying that the EE stuff is part of a greater scheme which in
True Geology is called the PE or Planetary Expansion concept. It holds
sense that if a process is valid on that planet it cannot be unique
since that planet is not a special case in the whole Universe indeed.

geological issue with some freedom of mind and hence are highly

are in a fact plain &amp; tunnel vision Rock Surveyors, unfit hence in the

That is a view held by many. It is not the only view, some people
favour much smaller convection &quot;bubbles&quot; which actually form a much
more complex &quot;conveyor&quot; system.

See, we have to start it from scrap and question indeed the very basis

Many people have seen Glaciers but however Glaciers have nothing to do
with Glaciations.
This is at this point a free affirmation but to go further on the
subject could you tell me what is the basis both physical &amp; historical
of that theory, since it is indeed only a theory as the Continental
Rafting held true by Stuart &amp; the others.

The drama is that people go into the extreme of the Geology arcane and
want immediate answers to nagging &amp; important questions,  while being
unable to come to term to obviously fraudulent theories ( such as the
Glaciations ) which never match the reality of possible engineering
models. From the Engineering point of view the Glaciations tale is an
impossibility indeed.

If you are so certain of the soundness of your beliefs could you
please bring forth the Historic chaining of events which has led to
such idiocy indeed, with its direct implication on the mental &amp;
intellectual possibility of alleged scientists to distinguish facts
from fiction.

EE,  or PE which is the global process which explains the local
phenomena of EE, belongs altogether to another realm of
understanding,  and if you cannot understand indeed the folly of
Glaciations &amp; other prevalent theories ( such as generation of
carbonates bedding through fossils reduction, Orogenesis through
wrapping of solid rocks, strata piling by varving etc ) , it is
impossible to reach on such unstable grounding of fabricated beliefs
other levels of understanding of  based admittedly on more hermetic
concepts.

You want to discuss Glaciations faith ?  jpturcaud

I didn't quite say that. For example hotspots are plumes are another
kind of convection going on.

However PT is the surface manifestation of mantle convection, with
slabs forming the  descending limbs of convection cells.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very funny Don. And any way the above measures specific gravity, not
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; density.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a geologist you should know the difference.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...then we might have gotten somewhere, but &quot;wave speed
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anomalies&quot; (how do you know they're anomalous in the first place)

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anomalous in this case, means different that surrounding mantle? How
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we know? By measuring the travel times for a bazillion ray paths and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same procedure that a CAT scan uses, we can work out the detailed
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; velocity structure of the medium through which these rays passed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, ..the zone is more foliated than the surrounds (say), and the ray
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is slower or faster depending which way the fabric is.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This has nothing to do with foliation or in this case &quot;anisotropy&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Guess again.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; How do you
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know whether to attribute time to fabric or temperature (/density/
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coldness).

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You pass rays perpendicular to the strike of the slab as well as
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; parallel.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;There's all that shearing and partial melting going on, of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course there's going to be some sort of fabric.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Once again Don is desparately grasping for straws and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hoping for something, anything that sticks.

&gt;&gt; &gt; In Plate Tectonics, and your way of presenting it, there are  no
&gt;&gt; &gt; straws to grasp at.  It's hot air Ifs and coulds.  Try answering the
&gt;&gt; &gt; question about how the first ridge related to the first subduction
&gt;&gt; &gt; zone. And if you feel up to it, try to say where it was.

&gt;&gt; This is incredible. Its amazing the number of parallels between eers
&gt;&gt; and creationists..

&gt;&gt; When shown evidence for evolution creationists babble about
&gt;&gt; abiogenesis.

&gt;&gt; What do you mean how the firast ridge related to the first subduction
&gt;&gt; zone?

&gt;&gt; I guess it was a long distance relationship.

&gt;You guess it was a long-distance relationship?  Sounds pretty
&gt;dysfunctional to me.  Hardly what you would call a relationship at all
&gt;in fact.

&gt;So it's your &quot;guess&quot;.   Another 'guess' .   First of all GUESS  that
&gt;the Earth can't get bigger (because we don't know how it can - thereby
&gt;abrogating your responsibility to carefully assessing theinformation
&gt;that led to that conclusion in the first place rather than dismissing
&gt;it out of hand as impossible (because we don't know how)), and
&gt;therefore the CONVENIENT ASSUMPTION that subduction zones are paired
&gt;with the spreading zones in that Adam-and-Eve sort of way (which they
&gt;are not), and then all that IF-COULD FINAGLING to make it work, and
&gt;now the GUESS that it was a &quot;long distance relationship&quot;.  The more
&gt;distant the better, on account of COOLING, but there is no intrinsic
&gt;reason why a 'big boat' should be more sinkable than a smaller one.
&gt;In fact if it's a question of getting sunk by crustbergs, the smaller
&gt;boats (thinknesses of oceanic lithosphere) should go down like
&gt;ninepins, shouldn't they.

&gt;There's an awful lot of guesses and iffy-couldy finagling masquerading
&gt;under the guise of 'fact', about this Plate Tectonics of yours.

&gt;Here's one for you to think about.  If the oceanic lithosphere sinks
&gt;because it's cold and thick (the colder and thicker the better), why
&gt;do you keep insisting in saying that the East Pacific spreading ridge
&gt;(which is hottest and thinnest) is subducting beneath North America
&gt;(rather than being overriden)?   What have you got against
&gt;overriding?  Everybody else talks about overriding, why don't you?
&gt;What does 'overrding' on that scale imply to you?  (tell us, do..)

&gt;Are we going to get an answer from you how this Adam-and-Eve source-
&gt;sink system of yours starts up?
&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2qfqqv
&gt;...Or don't you have a clue?
&gt;(Go on, ..tell us it was always there..)

You need measurements Desperate Don. Without measurements that
actually show the Earth is expanding you do not have a case.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Shame be upon you for your contribution to enlightenment here.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ever though about just growing up Desperate Don? Get yourself an
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; education, learn about real science, real geophysics and real geology.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Then, when you have the proper grounding in the subjects you want to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; talk about, you can go and find the real data - the detailed
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; measurements of the Earth. You will then find that the Earth is NOT
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; expanding.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Go on, with a bit of effort you could get the necessary education in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; say ten years. It will give you something better to do that making a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fool of yourself on usenet.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You see Desperate Don. Unless you can find some measurements that
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; actually show the Earth is expanding you have no case. You cannot go
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; around claiming the Earth is expanding and expect people to even
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; entertain the idea when you don't have a single measurement to back
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you up. It is no wonder you are treated with such contempt and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ridicule on usenet when you cannot even fact the FACT that you have no
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; measurements to back you up, in fact you don't even seem to be
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; looking.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Face it Desperate Don, you don't have a case and at this rate never
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will. Give up, you have lost.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Pong off with your fixation on measurement,

&gt;&gt; If we're allowed to ignore measurements we don't like, how about we
&gt;&gt; just pretend the Atlantic isn't expanding. Then we'll all be happy,
&gt;&gt; right?

&gt;&gt; &gt;  Megadick,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Do yourself a favour - Eat some spam, ..see if it helps.
&gt;&gt; &gt; You'll find offers of viagra and pink medicament all-sorts.

&gt;&gt; You really don't like it when people point out that EE is contradicted
&gt;&gt; by direct measurement of the size of the Earth, do you? Makes you all
&gt;&gt; tetchy.

&gt;Don't be daft.  It's not an issue.  Stop trying  to make it one.
">

So you claim the Earth is expanding, but we can ignore the fact that
there are no measurements that show this expansion? Rather a silly
standpoint isn't it Desperate Don?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Those other two old goats can be excused because sometimes they get
&gt;out of their paddock, but what's your excuse?

&gt; Direct measurement of the Earth contradicts nothing of Earth
&gt;expansion, unless you are prepared to wait around for a few million
&gt;years.
">

Not needed. We can make detailed measurements and they show the plate
movements that prove PT. They do not show any expansion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What makes you think that the Earth must have expanded today?
&gt;Or last week for that matter? Or even in the last twenty years? or in
&gt;this century?   What assumptions are you making to assert that the
&gt;process must be continuous and inexorable enlargement when everything
&gt;of the geological record denies it?
">

So you still want to claim that the process has gone on for the last
200 million years - only to stop, dead, as soon as man comes along to
measure it? You know Desperate Don, you could almost get away with
that except for one minor point - PT goes on happening day after day
after day. So all the plate movements that you claim are the result of
expansion still happen, even though you mythical expansion has
stopped???

You really are nuts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So, you have a piece of string, ..and you know how to tie knots in
&gt;it.  Big deal.

We know how to measure plate movement to millimeter accuracy. We can
measure the mass of the Earth very closely. Nothing is changing - no
expansion and no extra mass. Learn to live with reality Desperate Don
- you just don't have a case.

In your imagination, Stuart !

You have not a single case of mantle convection leading to tangential
generation of constant force vectors over your alleged millionzz of
years !!! No point of origin and no point of application,  and you
still dare to call this Science ? Hey ?
... and all this taking place on a 1600 km/h spinning thin hard rock
surface underlain by molten material

What about admitting that you know nothing about the real world once
an for all ( as your mate George )  and that you are making a living
out of being a con man selling dream schemes conceived out of thin
air !

A few people here are trying to sieve the Truth out of a 6000 years

supporting incoherent theories without rime nor reasons indeed. Is it
not a fact that you are sterile too without any clue even regarding
