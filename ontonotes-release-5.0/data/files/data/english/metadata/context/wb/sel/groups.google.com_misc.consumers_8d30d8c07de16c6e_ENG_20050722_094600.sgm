The New Litigation Against Teflon Won't Stick

By Elizabeth M. Whelan, Sc.D., M.P.H.

The plaintiffs want DuPont to spend $5 billion to replace the cookware
that is allegedly dangerous and provide medical monitoring for the
plaintiffs who used the cookware. The suit also demands that
Teflon-coated products in the future carry health warning labels.

The suit charges that the &quot;Teflon chemical&quot; PFOA is a&quot; carcinogen&quot; --
defined here as a chemical that causes cancer in rodents.

This lawsuit and its charges are ludicrous on two different levels:

First, PFOA, a chemical used to create Teflon, poses no known hazard to
human health. Myriad chemicals -- both of natural and synthetic origin
-- are carcinogenic when fed at high doses to rodents. Such laboratory
observations are of no relevance in predicting human cancer risk.

Second, Teflon-coated cookware does not even contain PFOA...

Teflon accusation doesn't stick
Michael Fumento
July 21, 2005
Teflon has long been a godsend in the kitchen. It's easier to cook
with, since foods don't stick. It's easier to wash - and easier
on the environment - since it requires less detergent and no
dishwasher energy. And it's easier on the heart and the waistline,
since it eliminates the need for cooking in lots of oil, butter or
margarine.
Yet Teflon has recently gone from the frying pan into the fire, thanks
to some money-hungry lawyers. They've cooked up a scary story, adding
a dollop of hyperbole for good measure. Unfortunately, they left out
common sense and science....

This is just more ACSH/junkscience.com Propaganda ... similar to the
disinformation they've spread for years on breast implants and MCS ...

ACSH is a corporate front group ...

The Junkyard Dogs of Science
by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton

http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1998Q4/dogs.html

For the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), the &quot;phthalate
issue&quot; (pronounced &quot;THAL ate&quot;) is just another &quot;scare as
usual&quot;--another media fire needing to be extinguished.

The issue has been simmering for several years, but it reached a flash
point in the United States in November 1998 when the environmental
group Greenpeace issued a report showing that soft vinyl children's
toys contain significant levels of toxic chemicals--up to 41 percent by
weight. Greenpeace warned that children may ingest the chemicals, known
as phthalates, if they put the toys in their mouths. &quot;When children
suck and chew on soft vinyl toys, it is similar to squeezing a sponge.
Water comes out of a sponge, just as these toxic softeners can leach
out of a toy,&quot; explained Joe Di Gangi, the author of the Greenpeace
report.

Greenpeace was not alone on the issue. Health authorities in several
other countries, including Austria, Denmark and Sweden, had already
issued regulations banning phthalates. Similar measures were under
consideration, along with warning advisories to parents and requests
for retailers to voluntarily recall vinyl toys, in half a dozen other
European countries and Canada.

ACSH responded to the &quot;scare&quot; the way it has responded on many similar
past occasions, by announcing that it was forming a committee to study
the question, headed by former U.S. Surgeon-General Dr. C. Everett
Koop.

&quot;Dr. Koop will oversee the blue ribbon committee's work and ensure that
the most qualified scientists are recruited to look at the science on
phthalates,&quot; said ACSH president Elizabeth Whelan. &quot;We know that people
want to hear from independent scientists and physicians on important
safety issues. The committee's report will provide an authoritative
point of view on the safety of phthalates in vinyl products.&quot;

Most people who read the news probably concluded that ACSH--described
in numerous stories as a &quot;health advocacy group&quot;--was some sort of
impartial consumer organization that could be expected to look
seriously at the issue. Some reports noted vaguely that ACSH &quot;gets some
funding from industry.&quot; Overall, however, the media did such a thorough
job of obscuring ACSH's identity as an industry front group that
Plastics News, an industry trade publication, mistakenly credited ACSH
for beginning the &quot;barrage&quot; against the plastics industry over the
phthalate issue.

In fact, ACSH is anything but a critic of industry. Since its founding
in 1978, it has actively courted industry support, offering itself as
an off-the-shelf, available-on-demand source of &quot;sound scientific
expertise&quot; in defense of virtually every form and type of industrial
pollution known to the 20th century.

Following the Money
For public consumption, ACSH calls itself &quot;a science-based, public
health group that is directed by a board of 300 leading physicians and
scientists . . . providing mainstream, peer reviewed scientific
information to American consumers.&quot;

When appealing to industry, ACSH uses a different pitch. A revealing
reference crops up, for example, in the minutes of a March 16, 1978
meeting of the board of directors of the Manufacturing Chemists'
Association (today known as the Chemical Manufacturers Association).

Written in the same month that ACSH began operating, the minutes record
an appeal by MCA director William J. Driver, who noted that Whelan had
founded &quot;a tax-exempt organization composed of scientists whose
viewpoints are more similar to those of business than dissimilar. . . .
ACSH is being pinched for funds, but in the interest of independence
and credibility will not accept support from any chemical company or
any company which could even remotely be concerned with the aims of the
council.&quot;

Notwithstanding this desire to make ACSH appear independent, Driver
added that &quot;Dr. Whelan would be happy to hear from&quot; MCA members who
&quot;are interested in the work of the council and know of possible sources
of funds.&quot;

Shortly after its founding, ACSH abandoned even the appearance of
independent funding. In a 1997 interview, Whelan explained that she was
already being called a &quot;paid liar for industry,&quot; so she figured she
might as well go ahead and take industry money without restrictions.

Today, some 40 percent of ACSH's $1.5 million annual budget is supplied
directly by industry, including a long list of food, drug and chemical
companies that have a vested interest in supporting Whelan's message.

Stacking the Deck
ACSH claims to be an &quot;independent, nonprofit, tax-exempt organization&quot;
that adds &quot;reason and balance to debates about public health issues.&quot;
Whatever &quot;balance&quot; means, however, it definitely doesn't mean
ideological neutrality. ACSH is unabashedly right-wing and
pro-industry. Whelan makes no bones about her political leanings,
describing herself as a lifelong conservative who is &quot;more libertarian
than Republican.&quot; ACSH's board of directors is also heavily stacked
with right-wing ideologues.

Take, for example, ACSH board chairman A. Alan Moghissi. A former
official with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Moghissi
characterizes environmentalism as a belief that &quot;members of endangered
species deserve protection and that, because there are billions of
humans, humanity does not qualify for protection.&quot;

As an &quot;expert on risk assessment,&quot; Moghissi appears regularly on
rosters of industry-supported &quot;expert panels&quot; that work to undermine
environmental regulations. He serves on the advisory board of numerous
anti-environmental organizations and right-wing &quot;think tanks,&quot;
including the American Policy Center's &quot;EPA Watch,&quot; the Committee for a
Constructive Tomorrow, the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, and
the National Wilderness Institute, a &quot;wise use&quot; anti-environmental
organization that calls for abolition of the Endangered Species Act.

In 1990, Moghissi served on a panel created by the far-right
Competitive Enterprise Institute, in league with Consumer Alert and the
National Consumer Coalition to challenge the EPA's policy requiring
asbestos removal from schools and other public buildings.

Moghissi also chairs the Science Advisory Committee of the
Environmental Issues Council (EIC), which was established in 1993 by
industry trade associations including the Association of American Farm
Bureaus, the Association of General Contractors, the National
Cattleman's Association, the American Pulpwood Association, the Natural
Gas Supply Association, the United States Business and Industrial
Council, the Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF), as well as the
Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

The purpose of the EIC was to serve as a &quot;new ally against
ill-conceived environmental regulation&quot; according to Petroleum
Independent, an IPAA trade publication. &quot;The industries represented
face common problems,&quot; it explained. &quot;The spotted owl might seem to be
an active threat only to the timber industry but is in actuality a
direct threat to agriculture, mining and virtually any land user. In
addition to the Endangered Species Act, all industries are seriously
threatened by federal policies regarding wetlands, hazardous waste, and
a multitude of other environmental issues.&quot;

Other members of the ACSH board of directors include:

Attorney Jerald Hill, a former long-time president of the Landmark
Legal Foundation, which appears in the Heritage Foundation's list of
conservative &quot;resource organizations.&quot; A recipient of funding from
right-wing gazillionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, Landmark has a $1
million annual budget and a reputation as a &quot;conservative's American
Civil Liberties Union.&quot; It has filed lawsuits against labor unions and
school desegregation and has fought for legislation that would allow
parents to direct public education funding toward their children's
private schools. (Whitewater special investigator Kenneth Starr also
has ties to Landmark, which has focused heavily in recent years on
hyping the Clintongate scandals.)
Fredric Steinberg of Mainstreet Health Care, a private HMO in Atlanta,
Georgia, who regards Canada's single-payer healthcare system as &quot;the
socialized road to medical oblivion.&quot;
Henry Miller, a former FDA official now at the Hoover Institution, who
regularly grinds an ax against what he considers the FDA's
&quot;extraordinarily burdensome regulations&quot; regarding genetically
engineered foods and new drugs. In 1996, Miller also editorialized
against the FDA's proposal to regulate tobacco. &quot;The FDA's anti-tobacco
initiative . . . has not been without its own costs to American
consumers and taxpayers,&quot; he stated, describing FDA commissioner David
Kessler as &quot;personally consumed by this single issue.&quot;
In addition to the board of directors, ACSH also has a 300-member
&quot;board of scientific and policy members.&quot; As journalist Beatrice Trum
Hunter observes, however, &quot;Many of the advisory board members from
academia serve in departments of food science and technology, mainly
supported by the generosity of commercial food interests.&quot;

Other advisors include familiar names from the list of &quot;usual suspects&quot;
who appear regularly as scientific experts in a variety of
anti-environmental, pro-industry forums: Dennis Avery, Michael Gough,
Patrick J. Michaels, Stephen Safe, and S. Fred Singer, to name a few.
Several, including Floy Lilley and J. Gordon Edwards, as well as
Moghissi, have written articles for 21st Century and Technology, a
publication affiliated with lunatic-fringe conspiracy theorist Lyndon
LaRouche.

PR Connections
The 17-member ACSH board of directors also includes representatives
from two PR and advertising firms: Albert Nickel of Lyons Lavey Nickel
Swift (their motto: &quot;We change perceptions&quot;), and Lorraine Thelian of ...

&gt;For the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), the &quot;phthalate

&gt;report.

"/>  Obvious exaggerations, since vinyl is mostly vinyl and waterproof.

I do admit that it's true that some significant traces of toxic
chemicals existed in and leached out of some vinyl, and this was indeed
a somewhat significant hazard of the worst-offending soft vinyl toys, but
not any 41% of weight!
I suspect this is the best example to be given as to how Greenpeace and
their likes are more right than &quot;corporate front groups&quot;!

And Teflon and other PTFE, on the other hand, is much more inert. PTFE
coatings get baked on (I have a vfriend who used to do this), and
contaminants mostly gas out.
The complaints of overheating Teflon cookware producing fumes that are
bad for pet birds (widely noted and true to some extent) is not from
contaminants, but from the a small percentage of the Teflon breaking down
and producing new chemicals.

Conclusion: Don't overheat your Teflon cookware to/past 500-550 or
whatever degrees F, and not only won't you hurt canaries, but even more so
you won't hurt yourself!

It's getting to the point that I distrust chemophobes even more than
industry front groups. In a random issue between these two, it appears to
me that 60-65% of the time the industry front group, or even those not
hiding their working for industry, will be closer to the truth.

I want to cite one example of a chemical easily showable to be not as
bad as chemophobes want us to believe: Formaldehyde!
So bad, that formaldehyde stuff! Enough people want us to believe that
we should have zero tolerance of this stuff; that very slight traces do
Bad Things!
In general, traces of formaldehyde are present in live green plants
being exposed to light. In general all cellulose in/from green plants
including wood and paper, vegetable starches and vegetable sugars were
formed from formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is the first intermediate step of
photosynthesis forming carbohydrates from CO2 and water. The reaction is:

H2O + CO2 + light ==&gt; O2 + CH2O

This was in 10th grade biology textbooks when I was in 10th grade.

I do suggest the luddites scale back their activities that are one of
the reasons why nowadays by a 51.4%-48.6% split of Americans who voted
for major party candidates (in November 2004) the voters decided to
keep the White House in Republican hands!

at sufficiently elevated temperatures, whether polymerized or not.
