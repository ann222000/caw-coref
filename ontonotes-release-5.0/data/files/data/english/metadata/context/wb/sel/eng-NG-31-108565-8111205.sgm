Creationism rests largely on a false dichotomy: &quot;We do not believe
evolution; therefore creation must be true.&quot;  But there are many, many
different explanations for origins besides evolution and traditional
creationism.  If creationism is to be considered scientific, it must
propose a testable model of its own.

The expanding earth (EE) appears, at first, to rest on the same sort of
false dichotomy.  It proponents say little besides complaining that
plate tectonics (PT) must be wrong, as if that supports their EE views.

Such first appearances, however, would be deceiving.  The expanding
earth theory really is a scientific model, with real evidence behind it.
In fact, it is instructive to look at it as an example of how a real
scientific model works.

The Model

First, let us briefly review the model: The earth has expanded, roughly
doubling its radius over the last 200 to 400-million years.  Its density
has remained approximately constant; new mass has been added through an
as-yet unknown mechanism.  As with the plate tectonics theory, the
earth's surface expands by the addition of new material at mid-ocean
ridges.  The two theories differ, though, in that the EE model includes
little if any subduction, so that ocean floor, once formed, stays
formed.  Volatiles, including water, also form along with the earth's
volume, so the earth's oceans have increased in volume over time.

Like a good scientific model, the EE model has impications for what
evidence we should see.  Let us turn, then, to that evidence.

Evidence for Expansion

Both EE and PT predict seafloor spreading, but there is a difference.
With PT, the plates move directly apart, so the isochrons (areas of same
age) are parallel over time.  With the seafloor on an expanding sphere,
one instead gets wedge-shaped isochrons, as the seams burst (so to
speak) more in some places than in others.  The age maps of the ocean
floor show evidence of such wedge-shaped isochrons.

Such wedge-shaped rifts must appear also on the continents.  As the
earth expands, the continents become more and more flattened.  Since
their circumferences are forced to increase, large wedge-shaped cracks
originate at the continents' perimeter and extend radially towards the
center.  For a continent the size of North America, these rifts, and the
material which has filled them, must account for about 10% of the
continent's coastline.  The presence of these rifts should be obvious
without my pointing them out.

Since seafloor spreading is still occurring and (according to the
model), no seafloor is being subducted, the earth must still be
expanding, by a fractional increase in mass of roughly 10e-8 per year.
Earth's gravity, therefore, must be increasing by the same rate, and
changes in gravity this small are detected by satellites, especially
those designed to detect gravitational anomalies.

Evidence for Past Low Gravity

According to the EE model, the earth spent its first 4 billion years at
about half its present size, and thus had half the surface gravity.  One
implication of this is that the earth's atmosphere must have escaped
much more rapidly.  Since there is evidence for an atmosphere all
through earth's history, some mechanism must have been replacing it.
What this mechanism may be is unknown but may be related to the unknown
mechanism increasing the overall mass.  Since this latter mechanism did
not contribute significantly until relatively recently, we may postulate
that the earth went through periods with little water or oxygen or
nitrogen gas.  Such variation may be detectable, but since it is
uncertain exactly what we are looking for, it would be understandable
that we miss it.  EE does not allow predictions about either mechanism.

However, another form of evidence should be clear.  Plants and animals
would have adapted to the lower gravity, so trees could have longer
branches and animals could have thinner legs for their mass.  An
analysis of bone thickness and density vs. body weight over geological
time should reveal this evidence.

The change in gravity should affect animals' flight, too, which may be
inferred from their wings.  Here, though, we again run into the problem
of an unknown atmosphere.  A thin atmosphere could offset the advantage
of a lesser gravity.  However, thin atmosphere and lesser gravity would
work together to allow trees to grow higher, so if we do not see a
change in wing area, we should see a change in tree height, and vice
versa.

Conclusions

We see in EE the hallmarks of a sound scientific model -- one which
allows multiple predictions to be made along multiple lines of
argument.  Other predictions might be made, too.  It would be
interesting, for example, to see an analysis of how much andesite would
be predicted by EE, or how effects of cratering would change over time.

Any model which does not allow predictions, such as creationism, may be
dismissed as nonscientific and, worse, useless.  Of course, if predicted
observations are not seen, one may dismiss the model, too.  For example,
if one does not see wedge-shaped rifts on oceans and continents; if no
increase in the earth's mass is detected; if plants and animals do not
show evidence of an increasing gravity, then we can conclude that EE is
wrong.  Still a sound model, just wrong.

Scientists, as a community if not as individuals, eagerly adopt changes
when a better theory comes along.  It took less than 100 years for plate
tectonics to come out of nowhere and achieve virtually universal
acceptance.  An objective consideration of the evidence for EE should
prove equally decisive.

Hey, this is not Mark's position, he was trying to present a synopsis
of the issue.

You really need to read the whole thread to get the context.

Sorry Mark, appreciate your honest effort, but the view from this side
is not something I would wish on any one, and even worse, have no idea
if it is the correct one.  It just allows you to see the main stream
and for myself has been a real eye opener.

Mark, I'm afraid that this is mistaken.  Plate tectonics predicts
wedge-shaped isochrons, and here's why:  There is a theorem in geometry,
due to Euler, that states that the motion of one point moving on teh
surface of a sphere with resepct to another point on the sphere can be
expressed as a rotation of one point with respect to the other about an
axis through the sphere - that is, plate motions on a sphere are not
rectilinear translations, they are rotations.  As such, if you consider
the spreading boundary between two plates, it should be clear that the
spreading rate is greatest at a distance 90 degrees from the axis of
relative motion between teh two plates, and steadily decreases as one
approaches that axis.  This gives you wedge-shaped isochrons.

An expanding earth should give you curved isochrons, with the convex
side facing the ridge.  As the diameter of the earth increases, the
length of the spreading axis increases.  Thus, the ratio of length of
spreading center (ridge axis) to continental margin length should give
us the factor by which the earth has expanded.  Further, it should be
constant - i.e. the figure for the Atlantic should agree with the global
figure, more or less.

I must be really dense, because I can't for the life of me figure out
where these might be.  There is nothing on the west coast - that's as
smooth as a baby's bottom from Baja to Bering; the Arctic Coast seems to
lack any such basins (we note that Hudson's Bay is simply a relict
depression from glaciation, and is getting smaller by the day).  When we
get around to the east coast, we see all kinds of nice wedge-shaped
inlets, none of which are structural, all of which  are drowned valleys
(thank you, post-glacial sea level rise), and none of which extend the
margin of the continenetal crust.  Gulf Coast?  Well, there is the
famous Mississippi Embayment, but that is mostly Pleistocene, right?
And, fatally, it lacks any sign of extension occurring on its margins.
Mexico?  Nope, unless you want to count the Gulf of California, which is
indeed an extensional feature, but, alas, is nowhere near radial to the
center of the continent.  We *do* see old extensional features - the
Connecticut Valley is extensional,for example, but that a) hasn't moved
in a long time, and b) doesn't give much extension.

No, I think it was intended exactly as he said, and FWIW I

This is of course excellent, fully reasonable, and worthy of
scientific inquiry. Since the expansion appears to have stopped
(according to laser measurements from space-based satellites), the
mechanism for the expansion must also include the current pause.

I thought crystals' matrixies can be measured to show how much
gravity there was when they were formed. If that recollection is
currebt, then examining various crystals found on Earth ought to
show how strong gravity was when those crystals grew.

The major objection I have to the &quot;expanding Earth&quot; video on
YouTube is that the producer insists that sciences DO NOT WANT TO
&quot;ADMIT&quot; Earth expanded. The video's description even says
scientists are AFRAID to admit it.

Yeah. But if CD had been asked to provide support for his position, he could
have produced rather more than a single page of numbers in two tables. Which
is all that the EE people can produce. Or at least is all that they have
produced, despite repeated requests for data.

Let me again request that data. I don't need the actual mechanism, not right
now. I just need something which shows what the Earth's radius was, way back
before the expansion, and what the Earth's mass and/or gravity was then.
(Gimme the radius and the mass, and I'll get the gravity myself. Or gimme the
gravity and the mass, and I'll get the radius. Or the gravity and the radius,
and I'll get the mass. Unless the EE boys can prove that Newton was wrong,
that is.) Gravity info should easily determined, assuming that the
cube-square law still holds... and if it doesn't, well, let's see why it
doesn't. (The cube-square law will affect _all_ lifeforms, including plants
and fungi, which are larger than a few cells. In particular it will affect
trees or other large plants, and animals in general, land animals in
particular, and flying animals especially. The lower gravity would have major
implications for air pressure and composition, too.)

I thought I'd do some rough figures on this just to see what comes out:

The radius of the earth is (currently :-)  = 6378km
Volume1 = (3/4) * pi * 6378 ^ 3 = 6.113e11 cubic km

The earth weighs 5.972e24 kg so on average
1 cubic km weight = 5.972e24 kg / 6.113e11 =  9.769e12 kg

If the radius were halved it would be 3189 km
Volume2 = (3/4) * pi * 3189 ^ 3 = 7.641e10 cubic km

Growth = Volume1 - Volume2
Growth = 6.113e11 - 7.641e10  =  5.349e11 cubic km

Growth weight = 5.349e11 * 9.769e12 kg = 5.225e24 kg

(so growth accounts for over 87% of the current weight!)

If the growth period is over 400,000,000 years (at max) it gives:

Growth rate = 5.225e24 kg / 400,000,000 = 1.306e16 kg per year
Which is 13,062 billion tonnes per year
Which is  413,926 metric tonnes per second

To put that it perspective the sun converts about 4,260,000 tonnes of
mass into energy per second, so the earth would be gaining roughly one
tenth of the amount of mass that the sun is losing per second.

Plate Tectonics rests on a false dichotomy too: &quot;We do not believe

of movement of 'plates'  is simply doumenting the way that the crust
is skating on the mantle across the dislocation of the transition

continents is symmetrical with spin (in more ways than just the
Atlantic).   The whole of the western Pacific exhibits spin

Earth expansion and let's test it.  Very easily.  Forget the false

mantle and see how else the circum-Pacific may be interpreted.  See
how the data fits.  Does it explain things more simply?

&gt; The expanding earth (EE) appears, at first, to rest on the same sort of
&gt; false dichotomy.  It proponents say little besides complaining that
&gt; plate tectonics (PT) must be wrong, as if that supports their EE views.

This is completely wrong.  Earth expansion stands on its own legs.  If
at the same time attention has been drawn to the fact that Plate
Tectonics doesn't have any, then that is a separate issue.  It is
merely to pre-empt the clever Dicks who are going to want to try to
shove Expansion somehow, someway, into the square holes of Plate
Tectonics, and claim that, well, ..The EArth is getting bigger?  Well
of course it is, ..a little bit, ..&quot; &quot;We'll admit the bigger bit
later, once we adjust the terminology a bit more - so we can confuse
the issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Such first appearances, however, would be deceiving.  The expanding
&gt; earth theory really is a scientific model, with real evidence behind it.
&gt; In fact, it is instructive to look at it as an example of how a real
&gt; scientific model works.
">

It's not a theory, or a model at all, ..it's an observation every bit
as empirical as the Earth is round.  But we'll let that one pass
here.  It's all about how you interpret the subduction zone, not just
as a zone in itself, but in relation to the whole of global
structure.  Plate Tectonics only sees it in relation to the spreading
ridges.  Not even transform faults are seen as having anything to do
with it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Model

&gt; First, let us briefly review the model: The earth has expanded, roughly
&gt; doubling its radius over the last 200 to 400-million years.  Its density
&gt; has remained approximately constant; new mass has been added through an
&gt; as-yet unknown mechanism.
">

Yes, now, right.  Make sure people understand that very well.   We
understand that there is a world of  atoms and  a still smaller world
of atomic particles.  It's a nonsense to be addressing this question
of Earth expansion, which is potentially of mass creation by talking
in terms of density mass and volume.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As with the plate tectonics theory, the
&gt; earth's surface expands by the addition of new material at mid-ocean
&gt; ridges.  The two theories differ, though, in that the EE model includes
&gt; little if any subduction, so that ocean floor, once formed, stays
&gt; formed.  Volatiles, including water, also form along with the earth's
&gt; volume, so the earth's oceans have increased in volume over time.
">

Exactly what the geological record says - that the production of water
has kept pace with the production of mantle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Like a good scientific model, the EE model has impications for what
&gt; evidence we should see.  Let us turn, then, to that evidence.

&gt; Evidence for Expansion

&gt; Both EE and PT predict seafloor spreading, but there is a difference.
&gt; With PT, the plates move directly apart, so the isochrons (areas of same
&gt; age) are parallel over time.  With the seafloor on an expanding sphere,
&gt; one instead gets wedge-shaped isochrons, as the seams burst (so to
&gt; speak) more in some places than in others.  The age maps of the ocean
&gt; floor show evidence of such wedge-shaped isochrons.
">

No, ..the wedging goes for Plate Tectonics as well (Euler poles)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Such wedge-shaped rifts must appear also on the continents.
">

No.  It's like if you slit your belly (or have a hernia) the guts keep
coming out of the same split.  They don't stop and come out of another
one, or come out of many.  &quot;Once a fracture, ..always a fracture.&quot;
Once the crust split to the mantle, deformation effectivly moved to
the oceans (spreading).   Deformation on the continents (as it was
previously known)  stopped. The last remnants are on the continental
shelves.  Now, they just shuffle adjustment.  They are effectively
'fossilised'.  Local subsidence is virtually the only thing you
get, ..maybe the odd volcano..(Though I can't think of any in the
central cratons) (Erebus?)   And somebody's dunny settling in the back
yard.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As the
&gt; earth expands, the continents become more and more flattened.
">

Yes, around the equatorial region.  That's why we have the
circumglobal mountain belt, a high plateau, of flat-lying strata
(except where it's collapsing and crumpling up at the edges. It
flattens off by erosion and collapse, ..whichever is fastest).  It's
the opposite way around the poles where there are large depressions
(Russian steppes, Antarctia (crust several kilometres deep under the
ice) (copmmensurate with the high equatorial parts)  (You're
forgetting the oblate shape of the EArth and it becoming more
spherical) (as it gets bigger)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since
&gt; their circumferences are forced to increase, large wedge-shaped cracks
&gt; originate at the continents' perimeter and extend radially towards the
&gt; center.  For a continent the size of North America, these rifts, and the
&gt; material which has filled them, must account for about 10% of the
&gt; continent's coastline.  The presence of these rifts should be obvious
&gt; without my pointing them out.
">

Certainly expansion makes for large wedge-shaped cracks.  The largest
one of all is the dilation of the Pacific about the Caribbean.  It's
much more dilated than the Atlantic wedge, but is masked because it's
180 degrees!  It doesn't look like a wedge any more.   (But look
out, ..the crust and the mantle are detached, ..the wedge in the crust
is different from the wedge in the mantle.) There is the equivalent on
land on the Eurasian side.  (Different structural levels)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since seafloor spreading is still occurring and (according to the
&gt; model), no seafloor is being subducted, the earth must still be
&gt; expanding, by a fractional increase in mass of roughly 10e-8 per year.
&gt; Earth's gravity, therefore, must be increasing by the same rate, and
&gt; changes in gravity this small are detected by satellites, especially
&gt; those designed to detect gravitational anomalies.
">

Be careful.  Don't make the mistake that it is rolling along like
'whispering tumbleweed'.  The erosion surfaces of the world show it to
be discontinuous and highly periodic, ..at least in its surface
expression.  (These by the way have no explanation in Plate Tectonics.
- but it is the essence of Earth Expansion - a lot of work there to be
ironed out.  Plate Tectonics doesn't even look at them.
&quot;What do you call it when the whole land surface rises up without any
apparent deformation?&quot;
&quot;That's epeirogenic uplift&quot;
&quot;And what's that?&quot;
&quot;It what you get when the whole land surface rises up without any
apparent deformation&quot;

the erosion surfaces of the world will be correlated and clinch

&gt; Growth weight = 5.349e11 * 9.769e12 kg = 5.225e24 kg

&gt; (so growth accounts for over 87% of the current weight!)

&gt; If the growth period is over 400,000,000 years (at max) it gives:

&gt; Growth rate = 5.225e24 kg / 400,000,000 = 1.306e16 kg per year

No you can't.   You can measure the lateral movement of the plates.
That's a different thing, and what you expect on a spinning Earth with

No you can't.  You can see the edge of the lithosphere being made into
rubble (earthquakes) as the mantle shears the edge and rises to fill
the gap in the zone of separation.   And then only along the Western
Pacific.   Along the Eastern Pacific it's too flat to be called
subduction.  So what do they call it?  &quot;Flat subduction&quot;, which is a

Oops, that should be (4/3) * pi (not that Don spotted that).

Lets try again:

Radius of earth = 6378 km
Volume          = (4/3) * pi * 6378 ^ 3
Volume          = 1.087e+12 km3

1/2 radius      = 3189 km
Volume          = (4/3) * pi * 3189 ^ 3
Volume          = 1.358e+11 km3

Difference      = 1.087e+12 - 1.358e+11
Difference      = 9.512e+11 km3

Mass of earth   = 5.96e24 kg
Mass of 1km3    = 5.96e24 / 1.087e+12
Mass of 1km3    = 5.483e+12 kg

Weight of diff  = 9.512e+11 * 5.483e+12
Weight of diff  = 5.215e+24 kg
Number of years = 4.0e+8
Per year        = 5.215e+24 / 4.0e+8
Per year        = 1.304e+16 kg
Per second      = 1.304e+16 / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60)
Per second      = 413,212,665 kg

13,040 billion tonnes added per year on average
413,213 tonnes added per second on average

To put that it perspective the sun converts about 4,260,000 tonnes of

&gt; false dichotomy.  It proponents say little besides complaining that
&gt; plate tectonics (PT) must be wrong, as if that supports their EE views.

&gt; Such first appearances, however, would be deceiving.  The expanding
&gt; earth theory really is a scientific model, with real evidence behind it.
&gt; In fact, it is instructive to look at it as an example of how a real
&gt; scientific model works.

&gt; The Model

&gt; First, let us briefly review the model: The earth has expanded, roughly
&gt; doubling its radius over the last 200 to 400-million years.  Its density
&gt; has remained approximately constant; new mass has been added through an
&gt; as-yet unknown mechanism.
">

We don't know if the density remained constant. We can just assume that
the expansion was not the result of a density decrease, because a
smaller Earth with the same mass would have unbearable gravity (3 times
larger) for say dinosaurs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  As with the plate tectonics theory, the
&gt; earth's surface expands by the addition of new material at mid-ocean
&gt; ridges.  The two theories differ, though, in that the EE model includes
&gt; little if any subduction, so that ocean floor, once formed, stays
&gt; formed.  Volatiles, including water, also form along with the earth's
&gt; volume, so the earth's oceans have increased in volume over time.

&gt; Like a good scientific model, the EE model has impications for what
&gt; evidence we should see.  Let us turn, then, to that evidence.

&gt; Evidence for Expansion

&gt; Both EE and PT predict seafloor spreading, but there is a difference.
&gt; With PT, the plates move directly apart, so the isochrons (areas of same
&gt; age) are parallel over time.  With the seafloor on an expanding sphere,
&gt; one instead gets wedge-shaped isochrons, as the seams burst (so to
&gt; speak) more in some places than in others.  The age maps of the ocean
&gt; floor show evidence of such wedge-shaped isochrons.

&gt; Such wedge-shaped rifts must appear also on the continents.  As the
&gt; earth expands, the continents become more and more flattened.  Since
&gt; their circumferences are forced to increase, large wedge-shaped cracks
&gt; originate at the continents' perimeter and extend radially towards the
&gt; center.  For a continent the size of North America, these rifts, and the
&gt; material which has filled them, must account for about 10% of the
&gt; continent's coastline.  The presence of these rifts should be obvious
&gt; without my pointing them out.
">

No, it does not work like that (radial rifts). What happens is the
formation of graben and basin. Besides the surface of continents is
significantly reshaped by the phenomenon of plume/tectonic
transport/overthrusting. The Alps are a good example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since seafloor spreading is still occurring and (according to the
&gt; model), no seafloor is being subducted, the earth must still be
&gt; expanding, by a fractional increase in mass of roughly 10e-8 per year.
&gt; Earth's gravity, therefore, must be increasing by the same rate, and
&gt; changes in gravity this small are detected by satellites, especially
&gt; those designed to detect gravitational anomalies.
">

Not sure about that. It depends on where the matter is created in the
mantle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Evidence for Past Low Gravity

&gt; According to the EE model, the earth spent its first 4 billion years at
&gt; about half its present size, and thus had half the surface gravity.
">

A misconception here. Maxlow suggests an exponential growth. SO the
Earth was supposed to be less than half its present size 4 billions
years ago. You may have a look at chapter 2 of his PhD thesis:

http://adt.curtin.edu.au/theses/available/adt-WCU20020117.145715/

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One
&gt; implication of this is that the earth's atmosphere must have escaped
&gt; much more rapidly.  Since there is evidence for an atmosphere all
&gt; through earth's history, some mechanism must have been replacing it.
&gt; What this mechanism may be is unknown but may be related to the unknown
&gt; mechanism increasing the overall mass.  Since this latter mechanism did
&gt; not contribute significantly until relatively recently, we may postulate
&gt; that the earth went through periods with little water or oxygen or
&gt; nitrogen gas.
">

sidenote: oxygen is not a a product of devolatilization of the mantle.
Oxygen comes from CO2 via photosynthesis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Such variation may be detectable, but since it is
&gt; uncertain exactly what we are looking for, it would be understandable
&gt; that we miss it.  EE does not allow predictions about either mechanism.

&gt; However, another form of evidence should be clear.  Plants and animals
&gt; would have adapted to the lower gravity, so trees could have longer
&gt; branches and animals could have thinner legs for their mass.
">

Or longer neck :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; An
&gt; analysis of bone thickness and density vs. body weight over geological
&gt; time should reveal this evidence.
">

Better. Lower gravity should be a valid parameter in biomechanics
studies. For example, what would be the blow pressure in a large
sauropod if gravity was twice less?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The change in gravity should affect animals' flight, too, which may be
&gt; inferred from their wings.  Here, though, we again run into the problem
&gt; of an unknown atmosphere.  A thin atmosphere could offset the advantage
&gt; of a lesser gravity.  However, thin atmosphere and lesser gravity would
&gt; work together to allow trees to grow higher, so if we do not see a
&gt; change in wing area, we should see a change in tree height, and vice
&gt; versa.
">

There would be also a significant impact on the climate. The climate on
a smaller Earth should me much more homogenous, with less extreme
weather  necessary to carry heat from the equator to the poles. Less
extreme weather means less strong winds and an easier life for the
fragile pterosaurs :-)

&gt; Conclusions

&gt; We see in EE the hallmarks of a sound scientific model -- one which
&gt; allows multiple predictions to be made along multiple lines of
&gt; argument.  Other predictions might be made, too.  It would be
&gt; interesting, for example, to see an analysis of how much andesite would
&gt; be predicted by EE, or how effects of cratering would change over time.

&gt; Any model which does not allow predictions, such as creationism, may be
&gt; dismissed as nonscientific and, worse, useless.  Of course, if predicted
&gt; observations are not seen, one may dismiss the model, too.  For example,
&gt; if one does not see wedge-shaped rifts on oceans and continents; if no
&gt; increase in the earth's mass is detected; if plants and animals do not
&gt; show evidence of an increasing gravity, then we can conclude that EE is
&gt; wrong.  Still a sound model, just wrong.

&gt; Scientists, as a community if not as individuals, eagerly adopt changes
&gt; when a better theory comes along.  It took less than 100 years for plate
&gt; tectonics to come out of nowhere and achieve virtually universal
&gt; acceptance.  An objective consideration of the evidence for EE should
&gt; prove equally decisive.
">

Global extension tectonics is probably the most important theory in
geosciences, because it is universal, it should apply to any massive
body.

&gt;&gt;I thought I'd do some rough figures on this just to see what comes out:

&gt;&gt;The radius of the earth is (currently :-)  = 6378km
&gt;&gt;Volume1 = (3/4) * pi * 6378 ^ 3 = 6.113e11 cubic km

&gt; Oops, that should be (4/3) * pi (not that Don spotted that).

&gt; Lets try again:

&gt; Radius of earth = 6378 km
&gt; Volume          = (4/3) * pi * 6378 ^ 3
&gt; Volume          = 1.087e+12 km3

&gt; 1/2 radius      = 3189 km
&gt; Volume          = (4/3) * pi * 3189 ^ 3
&gt; Volume          = 1.358e+11 km3

&gt; Difference      = 1.087e+12 - 1.358e+11
&gt; Difference      = 9.512e+11 km3

&gt; Mass of earth   = 5.96e24 kg
&gt; Mass of 1km3    = 5.96e24 / 1.087e+12
&gt; Mass of 1km3    = 5.483e+12 kg

&gt; Weight of diff  = 9.512e+11 * 5.483e+12
&gt; Weight of diff  = 5.215e+24 kg
&gt; Number of years = 4.0e+8
&gt; Per year        = 5.215e+24 / 4.0e+8
&gt; Per year        = 1.304e+16 kg
&gt; Per second      = 1.304e+16 / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60)
&gt; Per second      = 413,212,665 kg

&gt; 13,040 billion tonnes added per year on average
&gt; 413,213 tonnes added per second on average

&gt; To put that it perspective the sun converts about 4,260,000 tonnes of
&gt; mass into energy per second, so the earth would be gaining roughly one
&gt; tenth of the amount of mass that the sun is losing per second.

Yep.

Let me quote from the doctoral 'thesis' of one EE (I gotta get a doctorate
from that school. Should be hard...):

&quot;Present annual variations in radius, circumference, surface area and volume
are derived using Equation 2.6 (Appendix A1.3). The present annual
incremental
rates of potential Earth expansion are:
Radius dR/dt0 = 22 mm/year
Circumference dC/dt0 = 140 mm/year
Surface area dS/dt0 = 3·5 km2/year
Volume dV/dt0 = 11,000 km3/year
Present annual incremental rates of mass and surface gravity as a function of
constant
density are:
Mass dM/dt0 = 60 x 1012 tonnes/year
Surface gravity dg/dt0 = 3·4 x 10-8 msec-2/year&quot;

If you want, I've got the 'thesis' right here. (Well, except for some of the
figures, which inexplicably aren't available at the school's site. One
wonders why.) I'm reading it and trying to resist the giggles.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do hope that this was an attempt at getting some Loki points...

&gt;&gt; No, I think it was intended exactly as he said, and FWIW I
&gt;&gt; agree. The model may be dead wrong (and I think it is, but
&gt;&gt; I'm a layman), but unlike Creationism it *is* a properly
&gt;&gt; constructed (given Mark's formalization and corrections by
&gt;&gt; others) and testable scientific model.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First, let us briefly review the model: The earth has expanded, roughly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doubling its radius over the last 200 to 400-million years.  Its density
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has remained approximately constant; new mass has been added through an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as-yet unknown mechanism.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's interesting. Tell me more about this mechanism.

&gt;&gt; Ummm, he specifically said there *is* no known mechanism. A
&gt;&gt; known mechanism, while desirable, is hardly necessary for a
&gt;&gt; rigorous hypothesis, or Charles would have been SOL.

&gt;Yeah. But if CD had been asked to provide support for his position, he could
&gt;have produced rather more than a single page of numbers in two tables. Which
&gt;is all that the EE people can produce. Or at least is all that they have
&gt;produced, despite repeated requests for data.
">

Yep, I looked at the on-line thesis by Maxlow, although you
dug quite a bit deeper than I did. I didn't see any data
either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Let me again request that data. I don't need the actual mechanism, not right
&gt;now. I just need something which shows what the Earth's radius was, way back
&gt;before the expansion, and what the Earth's mass and/or gravity was then.
&gt;(Gimme the radius and the mass, and I'll get the gravity myself. Or gimme the
&gt;gravity and the mass, and I'll get the radius. Or the gravity and the radius,
&gt;and I'll get the mass. Unless the EE boys can prove that Newton was wrong,
&gt;that is.) Gravity info should easily determined, assuming that the
&gt;cube-square law still holds... and if it doesn't, well, let's see why it
&gt;doesn't. (The cube-square law will affect _all_ lifeforms, including plants
&gt;and fungi, which are larger than a few cells. In particular it will affect
&gt;trees or other large plants, and animals in general, land animals in
&gt;particular, and flying animals especially. The lower gravity would have major
&gt;implications for air pressure and composition, too.)
">

Desertphile made an interesting point, which IIRC is
correct: crystal structure reflects the gravity field in
which the crystal formed. And crystals, unlike living cells,
aren't subject to any sort of hand-waving dismissal (&quot;life
was different then to accommodate the gravitational
difference&quot;). Unless this requires really *massive&quot;
differences to be detectable (which it might; that's info I
*don't* recall) this would allow a test of the hypothesis.

&gt; &gt;&gt;First, let us briefly review the model: The earth has expanded, roughly

&gt; &gt;&gt;has remained approximately constant; new mass has been added through an
&gt; &gt;&gt;as-yet unknown mechanism.

&gt; &gt;I thought I'd do some rough figures on this just to see what comes out:

&gt; &gt;The radius of the earth is (currently :-)  = 6378km
&gt; &gt;Volume1 = (3/4) * pi * 6378 ^ 3 = 6.113e11 cubic km

&gt; Oops, that should be (4/3) * pi (not that Don spotted that).

&gt; Lets try again:

&gt; Radius of earth = 6378 km
&gt; Volume          = (4/3) * pi * 6378 ^ 3
&gt; Volume          = 1.087e+12 km3

&gt; 1/2 radius      = 3189 km
&gt; Volume          = (4/3) * pi * 3189 ^ 3
&gt; Volume          = 1.358e+11 km3

&gt; Difference      = 1.087e+12 - 1.358e+11
&gt; Difference      = 9.512e+11 km3

&gt; Mass of earth   = 5.96e24 kg
&gt; Mass of 1km3    = 5.96e24 / 1.087e+12
&gt; Mass of 1km3    = 5.483e+12 kg

&gt; Weight of diff  = 9.512e+11 * 5.483e+12
&gt; Weight of diff  = 5.215e+24 kg
&gt; Number of years = 4.0e+8
&gt; Per year        = 5.215e+24 / 4.0e+8
&gt; Per year        = 1.304e+16 kg
&gt; Per second      = 1.304e+16 / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60)
&gt; Per second      = 413,212,665 kg

&gt; 13,040 billion tonnes added per year on average
&gt; 413,213 tonnes added per second on average

&gt; To put that it perspective the sun converts about 4,260,000 tonnes of
&gt; mass into energy per second, so the earth would be gaining roughly one
&gt; tenth of the amount of mass that the sun is losing per second.
">

Two remarks:
- empirical models show that the growth is exponential not linear as
assumed in your calculations
- Global expansion is supposed to be universal. Every massive body
should grow; including the sun. Now, the mechanism being unknown, you
may speculate that the rate would differ depending on the properties of
the massive body (composition, temp, etc...)

Mr O'Shea, rather than being sarcastic of seeking minds searching for
answers to incoherent theories,  you should question your own
certitudes and in particular the origin of such Eskers, Drumlins, Peat
etc  in the country where you or forebears originate....indeed rather
than going into the very elevated arcane of the True Geology,  why not
coming down to the more mundane observations of such features and
reasoning onto their origin from the engineering point of view ! You
will find then that such Glaciations theories are completely
ridiculous &amp; mutatis mutandi, you will discover than the whole
establishment of Geological Theories is a castle of cards built on
very unscientific dogmas indeed !

Tell me more about True Geology. Is it anything like True Scotsmen?

Cool. What's the current radius of the Earth, what was the radius of the
Earth 200 million years ago, what's the rate of change (if any), and where do
I go to get data supporting your assertions?

This would seem to make for another testable item. The age of the
seafloor should be the same on both sides of a ridge at a given
distance. For every location on one side of a ridge there should exist
its twin on the other.

It holds up except in the Eastern Pacific where we are missing about

Who cares.

Most kooks are kooks out of a need to prove that they
are smarter than other people.  In this they are usually
guided by their sense of personal incredulity.

Example:  I don't believe in plate tectonics therefore
the earth must be expanding to account for the cracks.

And sometimes their incredulity is born out of a need to
have a source of certainty, such as the Bible, Karl Marx,
or the CIA.  No matter that all are often misinterpreted
and misunderstood, not to mention just being often wrong.
Once you are a true believer then anything becomes a
subject for personal incredulity.

So we have flat earthers (they think it says so in the
Bible), creationists (they believe one of the two creation
stories in the Bible), and so on.

After a while they all grow a bit boring.  They can't
actually present any evidence for their point of view other
than &quot;I just can't believe that ...&quot;, and don't understand
that science operates on evidence, not theory.

&gt; First, let us briefly review the model: The earth has expanded, roughly
&gt; doubling its radius over the last 200 to 400-million years.  Its density
&gt; has remained approximately constant; new mass has been added through an
&gt; as-yet unknown mechanism.
">

The proper way to treat expanding Earth ideas is, as a fun notion
that isn't yet a fully formed scientific model. And the big reason is
right there, the &quot;as-yet unknown mechanism.&quot;

The problem is, different possible mechanisms produce drastically
different results. Just to pluck two to illustrate the issue:
- If matter were added from objects from space burning up in the
atmosphere, you'd get a blanket of dust.
- If matter were added through some kind of &quot;cosmological&quot; means,
such that matter showed up through spontaneous generation
at locations preferentially where matter already existed, then you'd
get swelling.

These two would clearly be very different in their consequences.
So, until you pick a mechanism and build a theory on that one,
it's hard to make any headway with such notions.

That last &quot;spontaneous generation&quot; notion may look pretty cracked.
However, there is some (admittedly pretty nebulous) support for
the idea. The notion is, as space expands, it makes energy
available. (That's a long, long trail to walk, but the buzz-words
are &quot;false vacuum&quot; and &quot;spontaneous symmetry breaking.&quot;
No, I don't think I've really supported the notion.) And this energy
would be available to produce particles, and these would be most
likely to be produced near existing matter. People have looked for
such things, and, so far, the results have all been null. People
have examined old crystals for evidence of atoms that don't belong,
in numbers that are too large to be accounted for by other means.
So far, nothing unusual. Certainly nothing that looks like it could
even remotely account for a doubling of size of the Earth.

I'm *guessing* that a steady rain of dust from space has fairly
tight limits. That is, I'm guessing we'd notice if there was enough
dust falling from space to double the mass of the Earth in only
200 million years or so. But this is *way* out of my area.

It's not _double_ the mass if you double the radius of the planet, is a
factor of _eight_. Mass goes up by _volume_. If the Earth had a radius of
half what it does now (present: 6,378 km. Half that: 3,189 km) it'd have a
mass of one-eighth what it does now (present: about 6 x 10^24 kg. one-eighth
of that: 750 x 10^21 kg) so that we'd need to get 5.25 x 10^24 kg in 200
million years, or 26.25 x 10^15 kg/year, on average. Note that according to
the EEs, the rate of increase in radius (and therefore in mass) is
_increasing_, so that the rate _now_ is higher than it's ever been before.
Note that even if you just use the average, I rather suspect that someone
would notice a little thing like 26 petatonnes of dust and debris falling
from the sky each year... That's something like _twenty tonnes per second_.
That's one hell of a lot of shooting stars...
