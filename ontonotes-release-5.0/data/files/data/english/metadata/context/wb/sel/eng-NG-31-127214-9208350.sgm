According to Matt's blog, the Giants offered a 6th round draft pick
and the Niners wanted a fifth, conditional to a fourth.  The trade
never went anywhere, so Kwame will be a Niner for the rest of the
season.

The way the OL has fared so far, it might be good to give him some playing
time.

What do you do with Staley?  Move him left and sit Jennings?

That is a tough call.  One of the things that I have noticed about
Nolan, and one of the few things I dislike about him is how he works
with younger players.  In the days of Walsh and Seifert the rule
seemed to be, and was often written as such, that if there were two
players that were roughly equal in talent, play the younger player
because he may improve, and may improve substantially.  Nolan seems to
want to see the younger guys who are not high draft choices beat out
the experienced guys.  Why is Hannibal Navies getting more playing
time than all of the younger linebackers, combined?  Why is Tully
Banta-Cain in on likely running plays and why aren't some odf the
younger guys getting more playing time?

With the OL one has to figure that the team needs to replace Jennings
as he cannot seem to stay healthy for three games in a row but does
moving Staley to left tackle mean that  Staley's learning curve gets
set back to the starting point?  Harriss and Smiley are gone after
this season so start getting their replacements playing some more and
eventually starting and playing the whole game.  Allen is likely gone
after this season and Jennings needs someone to take over his
position.  I have never been one of the &quot;take Harriss out and shoot
him&quot; types but the way this pre-season and regular season have gone I
don't see him having any possible role except to replace Staley and
only that if Staley is injured, or regressing,  it makes no sense to
take Staley out otherwhise even if one suspects, as I do, that the way
Kwame lost that job lost the coaches the trust of the OL.

Nolan's big on the experience thing, but don't forget that Walsh
brought in a lot of veterans as well as rookies and he melded them
into good teams.  From the get-go, I didn't like Navies or Banta-Cain.
I'm for fresh legs and speed in the middle.  Has Haralson done much to
distinguish himself when he's been in the game?  What the hell
happened to Moore?

When you consider how they've played so far, the defense doesn't need
a lot of work. Maybe one good DE and another ILB and things would be
sown up tight.

Even so, they are playing very well and the only negatives they face
are getting repeatedly screwed over by the offense and forced to
remain on the field for excessive lengths of time.

Ah Willis! Doesn't he just make ya grin from ear to ear, every time
you see him playing out there?   Speed, sure tackling, hard hitting
and that non-stop motor.  We need more like him.

You don't have to move Staley to left if it means starting over, but
he played over on that side in college, so it's not a total do over.
Snyder can play left tackle since he's done it before and acquited
himself well.  The next draft is loaded with tackles and guards, as I
mentioned before, some of whom passed on last year's draft.

Bet Kwame gets in the game on Sunday.  Gulp!
