Two pregnant women giving birth = two babies (Unless the &quot;polyjuice
baby&quot; disappears when the potion stops working  :-)   )

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

When is the baby due?
When does the potion stop working?
Answer those two questions, and we'll take it from there  :-)

Imagine a couple about to be parents. Just when her water breaks,
they'll each make a polyjuice potion containing a hair from the other.

HE can experience the pain while SHE gets to watch/videotape/pass out!
:-)

I must go now; I'm about to run out of smileys  :-)

If I knew, I wouldn't be asking.  I am imagining the Polyjuice Potion (with
the hair of a pregnant woman) creating a fetus in the body of the drinker, or
temporarily eliminating the fetus of a pregnant woman in the opposit
situation.

Maybe there's a disclaimer like on those medicine adds you see on TV that
goes something like:

&quot;Do not use Polyjuice if you are pregnant, you think you are pregnant, if
you are menstruating (that is for guys as it might freak us out), if you
have just given birth or if you have had a Vasectomy in the last seven days.
Do not mix with other medication, potions, and elixirs -- especially with
Felix Felicis.  Do not operate flying carpets, flying brooms and
time-turners as it may cause drowsiness and the mistaken belief that you can
fly a broom at recklessly high speeds just because you changed into a
world-famous Quiddich player.  You can't so don't even try.   Do not have
any sexual contact with anyone while under the influence of the polyjuice
potion 'cause you're only asking for trouble if you do.  Additional side
effects include stomach aches, nausea, vomiting, along with black eyes, a
broken nose and sore butt as the person you morph into beats the living crap
out of you when he/she finds out, then has you arrested and chucked into
Azkaban where you become an ex-death eater's bitch.&quot;

If the guy keeps taking it, maybe it could be.  Also, what if a girl takes

IMHO, we must remember PP transforms one person in the exterior of
another *at the time the sample was taken*, although retaining their
individual consciousness.

Since the sample (let's stick with hair, to simplify matters) should
NOT contain genetic material from the baby:

Pregnant -&gt; non-pregnant: the baby would be magically concealed while
the potion lasted, I believe no harm done;

Non-pregnant -&gt; Pregnant: it would look like the stage of pregnancy at
the time the sample was taken; continuing to take it, even for
extended periods of time, would simple look like the pregnancy was
frozen in time. Only resampling as time went by would show the
advance.

[snip funny excerpt]

That was the first thing that crossed my mind while I read this and
another thread by Tim (aging potion): most potions could be bad for
pregnant women.

Probably not, because each time he renewed the potion he would be in
the same condition the girl from who the sample was taken; even if she
was ovulating, he would return to the same state = no enduring
pregnancy.

That's the hardest one, well thought! And I have an even harder one:
if a man takes polyjuice from another guy and impregnates the woman,
who would be the father?

I mean, imagine Harry as Goyle in CoS, deciding a quickie with Pansy
Parkinson wasn't out of the place.... [shudders, stops and goes for a

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What happens if you put the hair of a pregnant woman in Polyjuice Potion
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and then drink it?  What happens if a pregnant woman drinks Polyjuice
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Potion containing hair from a non-pregnant person?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Don't know! :-)
&gt;&gt; &gt; Supplementary question:- when did Polyjuice stop being just for an
&gt;&gt; &gt; hour and suddenly start lasting for much longer periods?
&gt;&gt; &gt; (Easy answer - In HPatDH)
&gt;&gt; &gt; OK why?

&gt;&gt; Maybe it lasts longer if you use a lot of hair?

&gt;I thought of that when they used several hairs in the MoM scene in DH
&gt;But why didn't Barty Crouch Jr do that in GoF. DD was quite specific
&gt;that the effects were due to wear off.

&gt;&gt; What happens if you use hair from more than one person?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What happens if you put the hair of a pregnant woman in Polyjuice Potion

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Potion containing hair from a non-pregnant person?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe there's a disclaimer like on those medicine adds you see on TV that
&gt; &gt;&gt; goes something like:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Do not use Polyjuice if you are pregnant, you think you are pregnant, if
&gt; &gt;&gt; you are menstruating (that is for guys as it might freak us out), if you
&gt; &gt;&gt; have just given birth or if you have had a Vasectomy in the last seven days.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Do not mix with other medication, potions, and elixirs -- especially with
&gt; &gt;&gt; Felix Felicis.  Do not operate flying carpets, flying brooms and
&gt; &gt;&gt; time-turners as it may cause drowsiness and the mistaken belief that you can
&gt; &gt;&gt; fly a broom at recklessly high speeds just because you changed into a
&gt; &gt;&gt; world-famous Quiddich player.  You can't so don't even try.   Do not have
&gt; &gt;&gt; any sexual contact with anyone while under the influence of the polyjuice
&gt; &gt;&gt; potion 'cause you're only asking for trouble if you do.  Additional side
&gt; &gt;&gt; effects include stomach aches, nausea, vomiting, along with black eyes, a
&gt; &gt;&gt; broken nose and sore butt as the person you morph into beats the living crap
&gt; &gt;&gt; out of you when he/she finds out, then has you arrested and chucked into
&gt; &gt;&gt; Azkaban where you become an ex-death eater's bitch.&quot;

&gt; &gt;I have also wondered what would happen if a man used Polyjuice Potion to turn
&gt; &gt;into a woman, then had sex with a man.  Could Polyjuice Man get pregnant?
&gt; Not unless he grew a uterus

I assume that he would grow a uterus under the influence of Polyjuice Potion.

Does Polyjuice Potion change your bloodtype, retina print, and fingerprints to
match those of the hair donor?
