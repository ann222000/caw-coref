This just in : Hezbollah rammed an Israeli warship with an unmanned aircraft rigged with explosives Friday, setting it ablaze after Israeli warplanes smashed Lebanon's links to the world one by one and destroyed the headquarters of the Islamic guerrilla group's leader.

The Israeli army said the ship suffered severe damage and was on fire hours later as it headed home. Without any question the pundits and politicians will soon be braying (if they aren't already) about this technology must have been provided to Hizballah by Iran. Curiously, you will never, and I mean never , read in the American corporate press about the American origin of the planes, helicopters, and missiles being flown and fired by Israel.

Hezbollah wanted the war, and now they got it.
Who cannot recall another cry for war : "Wollt ihr den totalen Krieg?"

All this blood, and so much glee.
If Iran's holy warriors in Lebanon had not "captured" those two IDF guys, would any of this be taking place?
But who cares? Israel got bloodied and there's joy in Leftland.

Only one eye weeps there. Traurig.

I'm familiar with the long and tortured history of Palestine, including the Zionist sins.

Israel does inflame the passions, doesn't it. On no other topic, so much hate, Schadenfreude, dehumanization. Both sides are human, not devils and angels. But on this topic, comment is useless. Zionisten raus. tot oder lebendig!

The following post is dedicated to ronaldo.

It is titled:

OR

GUESS WHAT?

LIED TO AGAIN!!!

Six years now, and mainstream media reports from the Middle East turn out to be factually incorrect. Every initial neocon war assertion ultimately proves to be untrue...

Breaking News : History repeats...

It appears the initial report of Hezbollah entering Israel to attack and capture IDF forces is just more spin. Here's the omitted part of the story, according to the Asia Times (not nearly as self-censored as US corporate media): it was Hezbollah that caught an Israeli military incursion INSIDE Lebanon's border , which led to Hizbollah's crossing into Israel.

Excerpt:

It all started on July 12 when Israel troops were ambushed on Lebanon's side of the border with Israel. Hezbollah, which commands the Lebanese south, immediately seized on their crossing. They arrested two Israeli soldiers, killed eight Israelis and wounded over 20 in attacks inside Israeli territory.

Of course, western media omitted this crucial fact. Lied to. Yet again.

Hizbollah didn't start it, the IDF PROVOKED IT! Not too surprising: we were lied into war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now we're being drawn into WWIII.

Gee, my html tags must have missed a bold tag somewhere and everything's in big, black, and white. Well, sorta fitting as it was dedicated to Mr. big, bold, black-and-white-issue ronaldough, for his Nobel Award in Hyperbole.

Anyway, before the nukes go off...

Tell us on the eve of armageddon, ronaldo, how inflamed are your passions? Is it the blood and glee that makes you so excited?

All we need is for the people of a couple of the Arab countries to break out from under their depotic, tyrannical, decidedly non democratic rulers to bring about a rethink amongst the US regime and their wildchild pit bull terrier proxy in the Middle East.
Also read today that the 500lb bomb dropping game has been initiated in Afghanistan to ensure the reconstruction there doesn't fall behind that in Iraq. And the targets ? a market and a school.According to a British army spokesman : No civilian casualties. Thes smart bombs must be getting as smart as it gets. Way to go !! This'll really win those hearts and minds not alredy won.

As Juan Cole mentioned earlier today, without the '82 Israeli invasion and 20+ year occupation of southern Lebanon, there wouldn't be a Hezbollah. How much hatred had the Jews sown in those years?

What seeds does the U.S. plant now all across the globe? How many Hezbollahs will rise to face us 20+ years from now?

As predicted, the Israeli government claims that their warship came under attack from an Chinese designed, Iranian manufactured missile and further claim that Hizbollah couldn't have fired this missile all by themselves, they must have Iranian soldiers with them to operate it.

Which means that Israel can treat this attack on their warship (inside Lebanese territorial waters) as an act of war by the state of Iran. It looks like the Israeli government has become worried now that the USA wants to avoid a direct confrontation with Iran over the nuclear issue. This gives them a pretext for a military attack on Iran.

I am touched to have a whole post dedicated to me, and in bold yet!

For a blog looking critically at how US news media present the ME:
1. Why no eye on the Asia Times story? Why have Arab papers not told this story?
2. Why, earlier on, take the word of Chomsky without checking?

On Israel, I'll let it be. On my trip there in 1984 I sat in a cafe with an Israeli writer who shared with me his hope of helping the Palestinians develop technology, assist them in agriculture and education, and ultimately see the two peoples in a loose sort of federation, working together and thriving.
For me, Israel was not the only villain who killed his dream. For many of you, it is. No sense going on about this.

An article in Ha'aretz that would never see print in an American paper. If we in the US could see this much truth in our media, we would have much less support for the aggression of Israel.

" A black flag hangs over the "rolling" operation in Gaza. The more the operation "rolls," the darker the flag becomes. The "summer rains" we are showering on Gaza are not only pointless, but are first and foremost blatantly illegitimate. It is not legitimate to cut off 750,000 people from electricity. It is not legitimate to call on 20,000 people to run from their homes and turn their towns into ghost towns. It is not legitimate to penetrate Syria's airspace. It is not legitimate to kidnap half a government and a quarter of a parliament.

A state that takes such steps is no longer distinguishable from a terror organization. The harsher the steps, the more monstrous and stupid they become, the more the moral underpinnings for them are removed and the stronger the impression that the Israeli government has lost its nerve. Now one must hope that the weekend lull, whether initiated by Egypt or the prime minister, and in any case to the dismay of Channel 2's Roni Daniel and the IDF, will lead to a radical change.

Everything must be done to win Gilad Shalit's release. What we are doing now in Gaza has nothing to do with freeing him. It is a widescale act of vengeance, the kind that the IDF and Shin Bet have wanted to conduct for some time, mostly motivated by the deep frustration that the army commanders feel about their impotence against the Qassams and the daring Palestinian guerilla raid. There's a huge gap between the army unleashing its frustration and a clever and legitimate operation to free the kidnapped soldier.

I just want to comment on Ronaldo's use of the word Schadenfreude . Schadenfreude means taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. I take no pleasure in the mis fortunes of the Israeli State, rather, I put this post up because I take pleasure in the fortunes of those who are resisting the arrogantly applied terror of that state, just as I rejoice when U.S. forces in Iraq or Afghanistan or elsewhere are bloodied. Not because I want Israeli or American or British soldiers to die, but because I want the resistance to those arrogant imperialists and colonialists to strike a blow which will eventually bring imperialism and colonialism to heel, and I rejoice for them and for the entire world when they have small successes.

Eli:
1. "not because I want...to die..."
But, they do. You can't divorce one from the other. As you have pointed out, when an Israeli missile hits the house of a "militant" responsible for a suicide bombing, civilians in the house die too. No carriage without the horse.
2. Why not acknowledge Islamic colonialism and imperialism? Because its leaders and followers are third-world and not white? Why is their desire for a world-wide caliphate different from American imperialism or Zionist expansionism? Why is the fanatic who killed the Dutch film director not like the settler in Israel who shoots a Palestinian farmer? I say they are alike, and the difference is that many Islamic leaders and peoples support Islamic superiority and conquest--by violence or by immigration. Remind you of anything?
And the body count they are racking up, from Bali to Bombay to...
A segment of the Left has come to share a characteristic with the Right: a neat division of the world into good guys and bad guys.
The Left sees only with the left eye, the Right only with the right. You deliberately miss a lot that way.

Forgot to address your point about "What Goes Around Comes Around," or you deserved what you got.

1.Under what circumstances does that apply, and when does this weak cousin of Schadenfreude not apply?
In July and August of 1943 when the RAF firebombed Hamburg and killed 50,000 civilians, most in the working class sections of the city, was that a case of WGACA? After all, the Germans had bombed Warsaw, Rotterdam, London etc. So, sorry Frau Schulz that your little girl got cooked alive in the air raid shelter, but your Luftwaffe started it. WGACA?
2. Too much firebombing? Or, proportional to the German attacks? How do you measure? The suicide bomber in Tel Aviv who killed 34 (or...) civilians, the "proportional" response to Israeli oppression, or not the right one, or too much? And the Israeli response--always "disproportional?
3. WGACA--the problem is that once you buy into it, you can't control the details or the "morality" of it.
What Goes Around often Comes Around in unexpected and -- for some--unacceptable ways.
4. Returning to the phrase itself--if "they got what they deserved" is indeed the meaning, don't you hear a "ha, ha" or at least one hand clapping in its echo? It may not be a vicious version of Schadenfreude, just a sweet one.

Can't read? I've got a problem with American imperialism, Zionist expansionism and Islamic conquest--all three want to impose their "system" (economic, religious, social) on others. I have no problem with Americanism, Zionism or Islam when they don't do that.
Seems to me you're the bigot here because you exempt Islam, although some of its practices and adherents are no different from those of the American or Zionist colonizers or conquerors.
Notice I said "some."
But my impression is that none of this matters to you. Other side of the coin from LGF. You want Islam-hating, go there for a look. It ain't me.

ronaldo im certainly not going to apologize for taking a side, what are you doing, making a paeon to centrism? you blame people here for exempting islam yet you still continue to put all the blame there, saying that they and they alone wanted the war, that they are irans holy soldiers, therefore extending the bushie, olmert line that they are using to demonise iran and syria. What about Israel undermining the democratically elected hamas goverment from day 1? what israels desire to overthrow it, using the deaths and capture of soldiers for that end? what about those in israel who still greedily eye southern lebanese territories. Lebanon, syria, iran may all have ambitions yes, but none, not even iran, have anywhere near the firepower to back it up, certainly not against israel. So I don't think Im missing anything here, I think its logical to place Israel as the real aggressor.
Btw, Chomsky is usually pretty reliable in my experience. I do btw think that the fire bombings, and atomic bombings of japan, were wrong, despite the nobility of fighting fascism, and i have always been opposed to the suicide bombings, for both moral and tactical reasons, but now soldiers are the main targets, fair game in a conflict situation, yet we are seeing the most 'inflamed' yes thats a good word, inflamed sentiments, it seems that attacking soldiers really does tick some people off, not so easy to dehumanize the arabs then.

Quick point, 'cause I gotta run.
I do nut put "all" the blame on Islam. {Read my posts.) Plenty of that to go around--Saudis, etc. But neither do I put all the blame on Israel. Which, it seems to me, is the major sport here.
I despise the hateful stuff coming out of fundamentalist Christian churches, Orthodox Jewish synagogues, and Islamic mosques. Hate, dehumanize, etc. What I'm suggesting is you look at all three with the same humanist critical eye.

Makes sense. When Israel captures two soldiers crossing its border, and in retaliation Iran obliterates every piece of Israeli infrastructure one by one, fires rockets into houses and at beach parties using the criteria of being Israeli, then pledges to send Israel back 50 years, saying they'll "have to pay heavily for their acts", I'll keep that in mind.
