Would four weeks and 20 megatons be enough (to evacuate all still-thinking
Texans and nuke the rest, respectively)?

Who needs Texas anyway?

Seriously.  The U.S. should have let them remain their own country
back in 1850^*^*^*whatever.  The rest of the country could get along
just fine without them.

What really frosts me is that Texas was at one point the home of a
large colony of German free-thinkers.  Modern Texans do everything
they can to cover up that fact.

I have a first hand incident to report.

In 1961, when I was just finishing the 2nd grade, my parents moved
from
Massachusetts to Texas (job transfer).   I entered the third grade.

I very rapidly became a 'discipline problem'.   However, what
'discipline problem'
meant was NOT that I was misbehaving, but rather that I was not doing
everything
exactly the way the teacher told me.  Most of what I was being taught
was a repeat
of what I had learned the prior year.  And especially in math, I did
not do things the
way the teacher said they should be done.  I kept being given bad
grades by the teacher.

There were several rounds of conferences with my parents, whose
position was that
'there is more than one way to do things', while the position of the
school was
'in Texas students shut up and do exactly what they are told'.
Furthermore, at one
point the teacher complained that I kept 'interupting class with
questions'.  She then
told my parents:

WE DON'T LIKE SMARTASS YANKEE JEWS INTERUPTING OUR CLASSES WITH
QUESTIONS.

Of course now there would be a lawsuit over such a remark and the ACLU
would get
involved.  But this was Texas in 1962.

This may actually be the start of a great job boom in  Texas for private tutors.
