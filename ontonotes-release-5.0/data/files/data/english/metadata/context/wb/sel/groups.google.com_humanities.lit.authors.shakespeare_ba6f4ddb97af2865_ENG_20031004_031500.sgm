King, Rowling, and Shakespeare
By 0, 9/29/2003

AROLD BLOOM'S condemnation of Stephen King is a glaring example
of what is wrong with academia when it takes itself too seriously
and looks down on the rest of us. William Faulkner once said of
Ernest Hemingway, ''He has never been known to use a word that
might send a reader to the dictionary.'' To which Heminway
replied, ''Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come
from big words?'' Bloom scolds King and J.K. Rowling for being
popular writers who don't necessarily use big words. Perhaps he
has forgotten another writer, popular for his time, who wrote
audience-pleasing material. His name was William Shakespeare. I
can attest to the ability of King, Rowling, and Shakespeare to
craft a story.

I can't say the same for Don DeLillo, whose ''White Noise'' was
likely as self-absorbed as it was critically acclaimed by Bloom.

The Boston Globe
The loss of truly great literature
By 0, 10/1/2003

UNLIKE MOST READERS who have responded to Harold Bloom's Stephen
King ''bashing'' by bashing Bloom, I heartily agree with him.
Stephen King's fiction is cheap, as King himself readily admits.
It's pulp, basically, and he knows it. At best, reading it is a
guilty pleasure for mature, more demanding readers. To compare
him to Shakespeare based on his popularity, as one letter writer
did (Sept. 29), shows the kind of muddled thinking that rightly
horrifies Bloom. What Shakespeare shows us is that great writing
can be popular and accessible, not that all writing that is
popular and accessible is great.

Great writing transforms the reader and his world. It opens the
mind to new possibilities. But it's not sheer escapism. It
demands (to paraphrase the poet Rilke) that you change your life.

What Bloom mourns is not only the lack of truly inspiring,
transformative work these days but the hostility its very
existence garners. The unwillingness or inability to distinguish
between truly great books and merely mediocre ones is not just a
matter of mental hygiene; it is vital to the care of the soul.

The Boston Globe
Stephen King is a wonderful writer
By 0, 9/29/2003

AS A 20-YEAR-OLD woman attending the University of Massachusetts
in Amherst who has been an avid reader since elementary school, I
was greatly insulted by Harold Bloom's Sept. 24 op-ed article
''Dumbing down American readers.'' I was insulted by his bashing
of Stephen King as an author, claiming that he is an immensely
inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence,
paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis. I began my life as a
reader as an unabashed fantasy/sci-fi junkie and now adoringly
read the classics: Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan
Poe, etc. Robert Louis Stevenson is, in fact, my favorite author.

However, I also find Stephen King to be a wonderful writer who
brings the reader into his text and never lets him/her go. Would
Bloom prefer a person never read at all? Would he prefer a
student to read about Romeo lamenting over the fact that Rosaline
would not have sex with him (''Romeo and Juliet,'' William
Shakespeare), or how alcoholism destroys families (''The
Shining,'' Steven King)?

And let us not forget that in his own century, Shakespeare was
considered entertainment only for the uneducated drudges of
society.

I also would like to extend my congratulations to Stephen King
for achieving the National Book Foundation's annual award for
distinguished contribution. He has earned it.

She considers that creditable?

By the way, has anyone here read &quot;Postmodern Pooh&quot;? Has Bloom ever
flirted with Shakespeare denial? Crews' portrait of &quot;Orpheus Bruno&quot;
seems to suggest it.

Can I call Bloom bad names--since he's not an HLASer?

Actually, I wrote this post to ask it Stephen King has ever been
positively reviewed by any respected critic. I'm not big on horror
novels, so don't read him, but I'm sure he's at least a passable
writer. I doubt he's much less a writer than the many genre writers
who have lasted, like Scott and Stevenson. Rowling is definitely a
good, if limited, novelist--and better, in my opinion, than some of
the writers Bloom praises (along with all the other proper critics).

"/>

To judge from his ability to misrepresent Bloom's words, Joshua Lerner
should be posting to hlas. Bloom didn't scold King or Rowling for being
popular or failing to use big words: he scolded them for being bad
writers -- in his words, King &quot;is an immensely inadequate writer on a
sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis&quot; and
&quot;Rowling's mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that she
has no other style of writing.&quot;

A more pointed critic of Bloom's might have noted that Bloom starts his
piece by criticizing King but swiftly turns it into yet another diatribe
against women writers: after crabbing about Rowling, he goes on to
complain that &quot;in the 1950s and early 1960s, it was understood that the
great English romantic poets were Percy Bysshe Shelley, William
Wordsworth, Lord Byron, John Keats, William Blake, Samuel Taylor
Coleridge. But today they are Felicia Hemans, Charlotte Smith, Mary
Tighe, Laetitia Landon, and others who just can't write. A fourth-rate
playwright like Aphra Behn is being taught instead of Shakespeare in
many curriculums across the country.&quot;

It is notable that King is the only male author Bloom criticizes in the
article. He has praise for many other authors besides the poets named
in the paragraph above: he likes Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Arthur
Miller, Kipling, Thurber, Kenneth Grahame, Lewis Carroll, Thomas
Pynchon, Cormac McCarthy, and Don DeLillo. A reader of Bloom's piece
could be forgiven for concluding that there are two things wrong with
modern literature and academia: (1) Stephen King and (2) women.

Scott I haven't read, but I have read both Stephen King and Robert Louis
Stevenson, and King is much, much less a writer than Stevenson. Hell, he
isn't even as good as H.P. Lovecraft. His prose is unrelievedly pedestrian
and graceless; he used to have some talent at delineating character, but
that fell by the wayside many years ago.

In his nonfiction book _Danse Macabre_, King acknowledge his inferiority to
writers like Hawthorne, but he seemed to think the principal difference lay
in the fact that Hawthorne sought to evoke terror in his supernatural
fictions, while King was willing to settle for evoking horror or just
grossing out the reader. I doubt if he ever has figured out that Hawthorne
was using terror and the supernatural as tools to dramatize his alarming
perceptions about human nature.

Pish-posh! Though Aphra Behn is certainly not on Shakespeare's level,
she is just as certainly not &quot;fourth-rate&quot;. Few Restoration comedies
are as good as &quot;The Rover&quot; or &quot;The Lucky Chance&quot;, and, despite the
mutilated state in which we have it, &quot;The Widow Ranter&quot; is eerily

You sure seem to be going out of your way to put me in my place of
late, Mark. Even though I've been a good girl for several days now.

I'm sure King is a passable writer because (1) he's very popular; (2)
I've seen okay movies based on his work; (3) I've read a little about
him, and have read interviews of him; and (4) people whose opinions I
respect have told me he was a passable writer. Oh, and Bloom despises
his writing. All these reasons would be enough, but when I said I
don't read him, I meant something less specific than that I have never
read a word by him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I like Stevenson as a stylist and assume I would think much of King as
one, but whether that makes King much less a writer than Stevenson is
a moot point, it seems to me. Stevenson, whom I like a good deal,
isn't much for delineating character, either.

word passable. It makes no more sense to me to accept something simply
because it's popular than it does to dismiss it because it's popular.
Tom Clancy is a very popular writer, yet I find his books unreadable; on
the other hand, Colin Dexter is a popular writer, and I enjoy his books
quite a bit.

Again, this suggests a different definition of passable. Jaws was a
more than okay movie, but the book it was based on was rubbish, albeit
very popular rubbish. On the other hand, Demi Moore's 'adaptation' of
The Scarlet Letter was less than okay, but it detracted not a whit from
the value of Hawthorne's original.

What work of his have you read?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt he's much less a writer than the many genre writers
&gt;&gt;&gt; who have lasted, like Scott and Stevenson.

&gt;&gt; Scott I haven't read, but I have read both Stephen King and Robert
&gt;&gt; Louis Stevenson, and King is much, much less a writer than Stevenson.
&gt;&gt; Hell, he isn't even as good as H.P. Lovecraft. His prose is
&gt;&gt; unrelievedly pedestrian and graceless; he used to have some talent at
&gt;&gt; delineating character, but that fell by the wayside many years ago.

&gt; I like Stevenson as a stylist and assume I would think much of King as
&gt; one, but whether that makes King much less a writer than Stevenson is
&gt; a moot point, it seems to me. Stevenson, whom I like a good deal,
&gt; isn't much for delineating character, either.

Stevenson created a few characters who remain popular to this day, even
among people who've never read his work, e.g., Long John Silver. It
remains to be seen whether any of King's characters will outlive him,
but I wouldn't hold my breath.

It seems that I understand the meaning of passable differently from you
and Bob. If I say a writer is at least passable, I'm going solely by my
own assessment of his work; I find the work's popularity or lack of same
irrelevant. I've tried to read Tom Clancy's work and found it much less
than passable (and considerably worse than Stephen King's), but Clancy
is certainly popular. My point was simply that I wouldn't assume that a
writer's work was passable without reading it first.

All this is super-subjective. I find it hard to believe the Benchley
novel was worse than the movie, as writing. But I consider your point
reasonable. Note that I'm not arguing that if an okay movie is made
from a book, the book's author must be a passable writer, but that if
an okay movie is made from a book, and the book's author sounds
intelligent in interviews, and the book was popular, etc., I'm willing
to say I'm sure the author is a passable writer--meaning a lot less
than you, I assume.

I was mostly joking. I think that the writing Bloom adores is
probably all good, for I don't think he's capable of liking any
writing that a huge number of critics superior to him have previously
certified. I'm also sure he despises some writing that was bad. I
strongly suspect that most of the writing he condemns in print,
though, is passable or better, going from what he says about Rowling,
and my vague memory of what he's said negatively about other writers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Good grief.

The computer I'm usually hooked up to which, among other things,
records the title of everything I have ever read, won't tell me, for
some reason. But (ha ha) I didn't say anything about a work, just a
word. I'm pretty sure I read an essay of his. I've read patches of
his novels. I believe I read a short story of his. He is simply
someone I don't claim to read.

Yes. You can find the entire Elegaic Sonnets at
&lt;&gt;. Favorites
include XLIII, XLIV, and LXX. See also the longer, and unfinished poem,
Beachy Head &lt; ),
which is an intriguing response to the view of nature in &quot;Tintern
Abbey&quot;. Where Wordsworth's nature is distant and impressionistic, Smith
delights in its specificity and immediacy.

&lt;bibliography regretably snipped&gt;

: An interesting footnote: Smith's father-in-law was the cause of the Chancery
: case that ended up in _Bleak House_.

I was aware that the lawsuit, which lasted her whole life, greatly
resembled Jardyce and Jarndyce, but I had never heard that it was
Dickens' source. Are you sure of this?

Is this entirely so? My understanding is that sonnets continuedto be
written in the 18th century, but only as part of a separate genre
known as 'women's poetry'. All the women poets of the period wrote
them (more or less) including Anna Sewell.

Of course, designating them as 'women's poetry'would add to
Wordsworth's problems in getting recognition for his own.

I don't know what makes her a &quot;marvelous poet&quot;, but it ain't her

Here's one early variation from The Passionate Pilgrim. This

28 lines only):

As it fell upon a day
In the merry month of May,
Sitting in a pleasant shade
Which a grove of myrtles made,
Beasts did leap and birds did sing,
Trees did grow and plants did spring;
Every thing did banish moan,
Save the nightingale alone:
She, poor bird, as all forlorn,
Leaned her breast up-till a thorn,
And there sung the dolefull'st ditty,
That to hear it was great pity.
'Fie, fie, fie', now would she cry;
'Tereu, Tereu!' by and by;
That to hear her so complain,
Scarce I could from tears refrain;
For her griefs so lively shown
Made me think upon mine own.
Ah, thought I, thou mourn'st in vain!
None takes pity on thy pain:
Senseless trees they cannot hear thee;
Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee:
King Pandion he is dead;
All thy friends are lapped in lead;
All thy fellow birds do sing,
Careless of thy sorrowing.
Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled,
Thou and I were both beguiled.

Interesting, Jim. Pretty similar. So, one more under-studied poet to
add to the list.

I think at least part of this nightingale thing must go back to some
classical source, but I don't know what it is.

The nightingale is sometimes associated with night and melancholy,
but not always. Here in Shakespeare's MSND, the nightingale is
thought to be something that sings softly:

Bottom:
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out
of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us;
but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently
as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale.
(1.2.79-84)

And again in Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew the
nightingale is merely something that sings sweetly:

Petruchio:
Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
(2.1.170-171)

Getting closer to the mother of all nightingale poems now.
Here are excerpts from two of George Gascgoine's poems
from 1576, both of which begin with something about
nightingales.

George Gascgoine &quot;The Steel Glass&quot;, published 1576.
Here Gascgoine portrays the nightingale as
having a cheerful song, which relieves the depressing
thoughts of the poet, much like Keats' nightingale.
First stanza:

The Nightingale, (whose happy noble heart,
No dole can daunt, nor feareful force affright,
Whose cheerfull voice, doth comfort saddest wights,
When she her self, hath little cause to sing.
Whom lovers love, because she plains their griefs,
She wraies their woes, and yet relieves their pain,
Whom worthy minds, always esteemed much,
And gravest years, have not disdaind her notes:
(Only that king proud Tereus by his name
With murdring knife, did carve her pleasant tongue,
To cover so, his owne foul filthy fault)
This worthy bird, hath taught my weary Muse,
To sing a song, in spight of their despite,
Which workemy woe, without cause or crime,
And make my back, a ladder for their feet,
By slandrous steps, and stairs of tickle talk,
To climb the throne, wherein my selfe should sit.
O Phylomene, then help me now to chant:
And if dead beasts, or living birds have ghosts,
Which can conceive the cause of carefull moan,
When wrong triumphs, and right is overtrod,
Then help me now, O bird of gentle blood,
In barren verse, to tell a fruitfull tale,
A tale (I mean) which may content the minds
of learned men, and grave Philosophers.

Gascgoine Philomel 1576
In this poem the nightingale has a sad song. Keats
wonders whether he is awake or dreaming in his poem,
while Gascgoine here actually falls asleep and dreams.

IN sweet April, the messenger to May,
When honey drops, do melt in golden showers,
When every bird, records her lovers lay,
And western winds, do foster forth our flowers,
Late in an even, I walked out alone,
To hear the descant of the Nightingale,
And as I stood, I heard her make great moan,
Lamenting much, And thus she told her tale.

These thriftless birds (quoth she) which spend the day,
Are costly kept, and finely fed alway
With dainty food, whereof they feed their fill.
But I which spend, the dark and dreadful night,
In watch and ward, when those birds take their rest,
Forpine my self, that Lovers might delight,
To heare the notes, which break out of my brest.
I leade a life, to please the Lovers mind,
(And though god wot, my food be light of charge,
Yet seely soul, that can no favor find)
I beg my bread, and seek for seeds at large.
The Throstle she, which makes the wood to ring
With shreeching loud, that loathsome is to hear,
Is costly kept, in cage: (O wondrous thing
The Mavis eke, whose notes are nothing clear,
Now in good sooth (quoth she) sometimes I weep
To see Tom Tyttimouse, so much set by.
The Finch, which singeth never a note but peep,
Is fed as well, nay better far than I.
The Lennet and the Lark, they sing aloft,
And compted are, as Lordes in high degree.
The Brandlet saith, for singing sweet and soft,
(In her conceit) there is none such as she.

Canara birds, come in to bear the bell,
And Goldfinches, do hope to get the goal:
The tattling Awbe doth please some fancy well,
And some like best, the birde as Black as coal.
And yet could I, if so it were my mind,
For harmony, set al these babes to school,
And sing such notes, as might in every kind
Disgrace them quite, and make their courage cool.
But should I so? non no will I not.
Let brutish beasts, hear such brute birds as those.
(for like to like, the proverb saith I wot)
And should I then, my cunning skill disclose?
For such unkind, as let the cuckoo fly,
To suck mine eggs, whiles I sit in the thick?
And rather praise, the chattering of a pie,
Than her that sings, with breast against a prick?
Nay let them go, to mark the cuckoo's talk,
The jangling jay, for that becomes them well.
And I the silent night then let them walk,
To heare the Owl, how she doth shreech and yell.
And from henceforth, I will no more constrain
My pleasant voice, to sound, at their request.
But shroud my self, in darksome night and rain,
And learne to couche, full close upon my nest.
Yet if I chance, at any time (percase)
To sing a note, or twain for my disport,
It shall be done, in some such secret place,
That few or none, may therunto resort.
These flatterers, (in love) which falsehood mean,
Not once aproach, to hear my pleasant song.
But such as true, and steadfast lovers been,
Let them come near, for else they do me wrong.
And as I guess, not many miles from hence,
There stands a squire, with pangs of sorrow pressed,
For whom I dare, avowe (in his defence)
He is as true, (in Love) as is the best.

Him will I chear, with chanting all this night:
And with that word, she gan to clear her throat.
Yet never heard I such another note.
It was (thought me) so pleasant and so plain,
Orphæus harp, was never half so sweet,
Tereu, Tereu, and thus she gan to plain,
Most piteously, which made my heart to grieve,

Her second note, was fy, fy, fy, fy, fy,
And that she did, in pleasant wise repeat,
With sweete reports, of heavenly harmony,
But yet it seemd, her gripes of grief were great.
For when she had, so long and taken breath,
Then should you heare, her heavy heart so throb,
As though it had been, overcome with death,
And yet always, in every sigh and sob,
She showed great skill, for tunes of unison,
Her Jug, Jug, Jug, (in grief) had such a grace.
Then stinted she, as if her song were done.
And ere that past, not full a furlong space,
She gan again, in melody to melt,
And many a note, she warbled wondrous well.
Yet can I not (although my heart should swelt)
Remember all, which her sweet tongue did tell.

But one strange note, I noted with the rest
And that said thus: Nêmesis, Nêmesis,
The which me thought, came boldly from her brest,
As though she blamed, (thereby) some thing amiss.

Short tale to make, her singing sounded so,
And pleasd mine ears, with such variety,
That (quite forgetting all the weary woe,
Which I my self felt in my fantasy)
I stood astound, and yet therwith content,
Wishing in heart that (since I might advant,
Of all her speech to know the plain intent,
Which grace herselfe, or else the Gods did grant)
I might therewith, one further favor crave,
To understand, what her sweet notes might mean.
And in that thought, (my whole desire to have)
I fell on sleep, as I on staff did lean.
And in my slumber, had I such a sight,
As yet to think thereon doth glad my mind.
Me thought I saw a darling of delight,
A stately Nymph, a dame of heavenly kind.
Whose glittring gite, so glimpsed in mine eyes,
As (yet) I not, what proper hue it bear,
Ne therewithal, my wits can well devise,
To whom I might her lovely looks compare.
But truth to tell, (for all her smiling cheer)
She cast sometimes, a grievous frowning glance,
As who would say: by this it may appear,
That just revenge, is Pressed for every chance,
In her right hand, (which to and fro did shake)
She bare a scourge, with many a knotty string,
And in her left, a snaffle Bit or brake,
Bebost with gold, and many a jingling ring:
She came apace, and stately did she stay,
And whiles I seemd, amazed very much,
The courteous dame, these words to me did say:
Sir Squire (quoth she) since thy desire is such,
To understand, the notes of Phylomene,
(For so she hight, whom thou calst Nightingale)
And what the sound, of every note might mean,
Give ear a while, and hearken to my tale.

The Gods are good, they hear the hearty prayers,
Of such as crave without a craftie will,
With favour eke, they further such affairs
As tend to good, and mean to do none ill.
And since thy words, were grounded on desire,
Wherby much good, and little harm can grow,
They granted have, the thing thou didst require,
And lovingly, have sent me here below,
To paraphrase, the piteous pleasant notes,
Which Phylomene, doth darkly spend in spring,
For he that well, Dan Nasoes verses notes,
Shall find my words to be no fained thing.
Give ear (sir Squire quith she) and I wil, tell
Both what she was, and how her fortunes fell.

[After this follows the fable of Philomela in a
different verse form, then a conclusion in
iambic pentameter as above]

So it is. However, I still wonder if this isn't a mistake. I spoke to
Michael Gamer and Stuart Curran, two prominant scholars of Smith (the

was aware of any evidence that the Smith litigation was Dickens' source,
though both said that it was one of many cases in the 18th and 19th
centuries that cannibalized its participants much like Jarndyce and
Jarndyce. I've recalled Loraine Fletcher's critical biography of Smith
from the library, so when I get it, I'll see if it has anything to say on
the matter.

: &gt;

: Thanks. I just read one of her sonnets, &quot;To A Nightingale.&quot;
: Interesting how many of its ideas Keats repeats--and how much better
: he uses them than she. It reminds me of the way Shakespeare
: transformed the work of lesser writers.

Sorry to be slow in getting back. Yes, this is one of the earlier sonnets
and it is rather conventional, and not really among my favorite Smith.
And given that Keats' Nightingale Ode is one of my two or three favorite
poems in the language, I'd certainly agree that this poem doesn't
accomplish nearly as much. But let me suggest Sonnet XLIV:

WRITTEN IN THE CHURCH YARD AT MIDDLETON IN SUSSEX.

PRESS'D by the Moon, mute arbitress of tides,
While the loud equinox its power combines,
The sea no more its swelling surge confines,
But o'er the shrinking land sublimely rides.
The wild blast, rising from the Western cave,
Drives the huge billows from their heaving bed;
Tears from their grassy tombs the village dead,
And breaks the silent sabbath of the grave!
With shells and sea-weed mingled, on the the shore
Lo! their bones whiten in the frequent wave;
But vain to them the winds and waters rave;
_They_ hear the warring elements no more:
While I am doom'd -- by life's long storm opprest,
To gaze with envy, on their gloomy rest.

Or Sonnet LXXX.

TO THE INVISIBLE MOON.

DARK and conceal'd art thou, soft Evening's Queen,
And Melancholy's votaires that delight
To watch thee, gliding thro' the blue serene,
Now vainly seek thee on the brow of night --
Mild sorrow, such as Hope has not forsook,
May love to muse beneath thy silent reign;
But I prefer from some steep rock to look
On the obscure and fluctuating main,
What time the martial star with lurid glare,
Portentous, gleams above the troubled deep;
Or the red comet shakes his blazing hair;
Or on the fire-ting'd waves the lightnings leap;
While thy fair beams illume another sky,
And shine for beings less accurst than I.

Admittedly Smith's language sounds more archaic than Wordsworth's, but I
think I'd call her content more modern. She was legally excluded from
fully participating in legal and financial matters (even after seperating
from her husband, she had to use her publishers rather like a bank to
earmark payments to creditors, lest her spendthrift husband should
confiscate the money she made from her books and waste it), and as such,
she could write of a sort of an existential vacuum. Consider the way the
absense of presence emerges in Sonnet XLIII:

THE unhappy exile, whom his fates confine
To the bleak coast of some unfriendly isle,
Cold, barren, desart, where no harvest smile,
But thirst and hunger on the rocks repine;
When, from some promontory's fearful brow,
Sun after sun he hopeless sees decline
In the broad shipless sea -- perhaps may know
Such heartless pain, such a blank despair as mine;
And, if a flattering cloud appears to show
The fancied semblance of a distant sail,
Then melts away -- anew his spirits fail,
While the lost hope but aggravates his woe!
Ah! so for me delusive Fancy toils,
Then, from contrasted truth -- my feeble soul recoils.

This sort of community constructed around common exclusion is also the
subject of her longer poem, &quot;The Emigrants&quot;, which is concerned with the
women and their children who had left France after the Revolution and whose
husbands had been killed in returning to France for counterrevolutionary
action. Although Smith was generally connected with pro-Revolution
figures (Blake, Cowper, the printer Joseph Johnson, Godwin and
Wollstonecraft), that poem expands the range of ways in which people are
dispossessed so that it includes women more aligned with Ancien Regime
France.

Finally, I think I alluded earlier to the way in which her view of nature
is considerably more modern than Wordsworth's. Stuart Curran calls hers
&quot;an alternate Romanticism that seeks not to transcend or to absorb nature
but to contemplate and honor its irreducible alterity.&quot; Consider this
passage from her late (and unfinished) poem, &quot;Beachy Head&quot;:

An early worshipper at Nature's shrine;
I loved her rudest scenes--warrens, and heaths,
And yellow commons, and birch-shaded hollows,
And hedge rows, bordering unfrequented lanes
Bowered with wild roses, and the clasping woodbine
Where purple tassels of the tangling vetch
With bittersweet, and bryony inweave,
And the dew fills the silver bindweed's cups--
I loved to trace the brooks whose humid banks
Nourish the harebell, and the freckled pagil;
And stroll among o'ershadowing woods of beech,
Lending in Summer, from the heats of noon
A whispering shade; while haply there reclines
Some pensive lover of uncultur'd flowers,
Who, from the tumps with bright green mosses clad,
Plucks the wood sorrel, with its light thin leaves,
Heart-shaped, and triply folded; and its root
Creeping like beaded coral; or who there
Gathers, the copse's pride, anémones,
With rays like golden studs on ivory laid
Most delicate: but touch'd with purple clouds,
Fit crown for April's fair but changeful brow.

Ah ! hills so early loved ! in fancy still
I breathe your pure keen air; and still behold
Those widely spreading views, mocking alike
The Poet and the Painter's utmost art.
And still, observing objects more minute,
Wondering remark the strange and foreign forms
Of sea-shells; with the pale calcareous soil
Mingled, and seeming of resembling substance.
Tho' surely the blue Ocean &quot;from the heights
Where the downs westward trend, but dimly seen&quot;
Here never roll'd its surge. Does Nature then
Mimic, in wanton mood, fantastic shapes
Of bivalves, and inwreathed volutes, that cling
To the dark sea-rock of the wat'ry world ?
Or did this range of chalky mountains, once
Form a vast bason, where the Ocean waves
Swell'd fathomless ? What time these fossil shells,
Buoy'd on their native element, were thrown
Among the imbedding calx: when the huge hill
Its giant bulk heaved, and in strange ferment
Grew up a guardian barrier, 'twixt the sea
And the green level of the sylvan weald.

Ah ! very vain is Science' proudest boast,
And but a little light its flame yet lends
To its most ardent votaries; since from whence
These fossil forms are seen, is but conjecture,
Food for vague theories, or vain dispute,
While to his daily task the peasant goes,
Unheeding such inquiry; with no care
But that the kindly change of sun and shower,
Fit for his toil the earth he cultivates.
As little recks the herdsman of the hill,
Who on some turfy knoll, idly reclined,
Watches his wether flock; that deep beneath
Rest the remains of men, of whom is left
No traces in the records of mankind,
Save what these half obliterated mounds
And half fill'd trenches doubtfully impart
To some lone antiquary; who on times remote,
Since which two thousand years have roll'd away,
Loves to contemplate. He perhaps may trace,
Or fancy he can trace, the oblong square
Where the mail'd legions, under Claudius, rear'd,
The rampire, or excavated fossé delved;
What time the huge unwieldy Elephant
Auxiliary reluctant, hither led,
From Afric's forest glooms and tawny sands,
First felt the Northern blast, and his vast frame
Sunk useless; whence in after ages found,
The wondering hinds, on those enormous bones
Gaz'd; and in giants dwelling on the hills
Believed and marvell'd--

And this, I believe, is one of the points at which it breaks off. An
interesting alternative to Tintern Abbey, though. The opening of this
passage is surely set up to answer Wordsworth's &quot;I, so long / A
worshipper of Nature,&quot; and it proceeds (complete with a number of
botanical footnotes that I've dropped, but which occur throughout her
poems) to offer &quot;Nature&quot; in its specificity rather than in Wordsworth's
distant nature that matters not in itself but in his impressions of it.
(For Wordsworth, I suppose the following will do:)

Once again I see
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!
With some uncertain notice, as might seem
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire
The Hermit sits alone.

Mind you, I love Wordsworth too, but I think Smith offers a fascinating,
and ultimately more sensible alternative reading of nature. In any
event, Smith is surely very much worth teaching because she, like so many
other long-ignored writers, adds another literary perspective, and one
that was enormously popular at the time, and I think in that way also
helps us understand other poets of the time. And I'm curious what you think
of the stuff I've quoted.

I don't know of any in the 18th century (other than that single Grey sonnet)
before the publication of Smith's &quot;Elegaic Sonnets&quot; in 1784. After that,
yes, there were quite a few, most of them by women until Wordsworth.

You mean of _Black Beauty_ fame? Sure, but she's a good deal later.

: Of course, designating them as 'women's poetry'would add to

Sure. I suppose by the time of his 1807 volume (I think the first of
his volumes of poems in which he included any*), he was well enough known
to be able to appropriate the genre. I think that's part of the way in
which you can see Wordsworth him as emerging, more than anything else,
from Women writers of the 1780s and 90s.

*Note to above. The first poem Wordsworth published anywhere was also a
sonnet. At the age of seventeen, he published (with the schoolboyishly
&quot;clever&quot; pseudonym &quot;AXIOLOGUS&quot;) in __European Magazine_ the delightfully
awful &quot;Sonnet on seeing Miss Helen Maria Williams Weep at a Tale of
Distress&quot; (Helen Maria Williams was another popular sonnateer.) The
Wordsworth sonnet runs thus:

She wept.--Life's purple tide began to flow
In languid streams through every thrilling vein;
Dim were my swimming eyes--my pulse beat slow,
And my full heart was swell'd to dear delicious pain.
Life left my loaded heart, and closing eye;
A sigh recall'd the wanderer to my breast;
Dear was the pause of life, and dear the sigh
That call'd the wanderer home, and home to rest.
That tear proclaims--in thee each virtue dwells,
And bright will shine in misery's midnight hour;
As the soft star of dewy evening tells
What radiant fires were drown'd by day's malignant pow'r,
That only wait the darkness of the night
To cheer the wand'ring wretch with hospitable light.

Magnificently bad, isn't it?

Random note to Jim: Wordsworth evidently liked Smith's &quot;dewey eve&quot;...

I don't have time to jump at length into the Nightingale discussion, but
I can think of several other poems prior to Keats. There are a couple of
other sonnets by Smith that involve a nightingale. Mary Robinson wrote
an &quot;Ode to the Nightingale&quot; (Which, if I recall correctly, is actually
the title on Keats MS. Robinson also, by the way, wrote an &quot;Ode to
Melancholy.&quot;) There's also Coleridge's poem &quot;The Nightingale&quot; (which I
want to say is in _Lyrical Ballads_, but I can't remember for sure). See
also an early Keats sonnet, &quot;To one who has been long in city pent&quot;
&lt;&gt;.

A quick check in the Chadwick-Healy database turns up 73 poems published
prior to 1820 that have the word &quot;Nightingale&quot; in the title or first
line. A random example that I had never previously heard of:

Dyer, George, 1755-1841: ODE XII. TO THE NIGHTINGALE. [from Poems (1801)]

I

1 Sweet songstress, that unseen, unknown,
2 Dost strain thy little heaving breast,
3 Why dost thou wander still alone,
4 Wakeful, while other songsters rest?

II

5 Oft have I linger'd in the grove,
6 Charm'd with thy soothing, melting song;
7 It told---or seem'd to tell---of love---
8 Nor was the night, tho' darksome, long.

III

9 &quot;Yet oh! sweet bird, why shun the light?
10 &quot;Why warble still the lonesome lay?
11 &quot;Those notes that smooth the brow of night,
12 &quot;Might wake the genial smile of day.

IV

13 Thus have I cried; yet cried in vain:
14 And still the songstress of the grove
15 Warbled her unambitious strain,
16 As tho' her only care was, love.

17 But tho' she shun'd my wistful sight,
18 So mildly, sweetly would she sing,
19 I deem her not the bird of night,
20 But hail the poet of the spring.

There appear to be many more where that came from...

Procne

Aedon was the wife of king Zethus of Thebes and mother of their son
Itylus. Because she only had one child, she was so jealous of her
sister-in-law Niobe, who had seven sons, that she tried to kill
Niobe's elder. By mistake she killed her own son, and Zeus transformed
her into a nightingale forever crying for her son.

Aedon also figure in other stories under the name Procne. She is in
this version the daughter of the king of Athens, Pandion, and has a
sister by the name of Philomela. Procnes husband was the Thracian hero
Tereus, with whom she had the son Itys. Tereus one day raped Philomela
and cut out her tounge, so she would not tell on him, but she
embroided what had happened, revealing everyhting to Procne. The
sisters conspired a terrible revenge: they killed Itys and served him
as stew to hid father. Outraged with horror when he relized the truth,
Tereus chased the two sisters with an axe. The gods took mercy on them
though, at Procne was turned into a nightingale and Philomela into a
swallow. Tereus was transformed to a hoopoe.

According to another version Procne became a swallow and Philomela a
nightingale.

It occurs to me that you presumably mean Anna Seward (1702-1809). She
published her influential volume of sonnets in 1799, though you are right
that many of them are from much earlier.

Many thanks, Terry. Apart from &quot;1840s&quot;, which should be &quot;1740s&quot;, you're
quite right. I knew that factoid of mine sounded suspicious when I said
it. Still, I think it's fair to claim the publication of Smith's
_Elegaic Sonnets_ (which was enormously popular and went through 11
editions) as the most important moment in spawning the proliferation of
sonnets of the Romantic period. The published output of sonnets in the
18th century was comparatively quite small until the publication of
_Elegaic Sonnets_ in 1784, after which came a very large outpouring of
sonnets from Anna Seward, Cowper, Wordsworth, William Lisle Bowles, Helen
Maria Williams, Ann Radcliffe, Coleridge, Mary Robinson, the Della Cruscans,
and others prior to 1800. Of these, I think only Seward, who published
her sonnets in 1799, had been writing them before 1784.

"/>

My impression is that the legends are spin-offs from myths and
there is something evolving as they're shaped in folk lore oral
and written versions. So the Philomela/Phylomene/Philomel/Procne
myth gets different form through incarnations. I assume the main
broadside influence for Shakespeare was Ovid's Metamorphosis.
By the time T.S. Eliot uses &quot;Tereu&quot; in The Wasteland, we know
enough to associate the plaintive cry the nightengale/Philomel
makes in voicing her fate with symbolizing the whole archetypal
action.

According to one source I find, the Tereus/Procne/Philomela myth
is an example of several Freudean themes: cannibalism,
matricide, fathers unwilling to give up authority over daughters,
and female initiation involving beautiful girl and kingly father,
showing 1) separation between daughter and father, 2) loss of
adolescent identity, and 3) reintegration of identity in ritual.
So, there is maybe some risk involved in the poet identifying
with the nightengale? bookburn

Chaucer, Hoccleve, Lydgate, Gower, Langland, Skelton, Wyatt and the other

Shakespeare isn't exactly the first person I'd think of in discussing the

Although I don't know as much about the original rise of the sonnet in
English, I wouldn't have any problem calling Sidney a momentous figure in
it. But he's surely building very much on Wyatt and Surrey (who are
building on, and indeed translating from Petrarch).

of Sidney's significance on sonnets of the Romantic period? I don't

Very late, perhaps?
How should we call this modus of pure romantic expression today? Then it was
a purer art than the often artificed presentations on especially religion,
catholic or protestant themes, or less avowable expressions of magick.

Although Johnson is much cited [especially in this newsgroup] as perhaps an
unimpeachable source on Shakespeare, his views, manner and works were often
antithetical, and Jonson a different creature in public and private. A
darker horse than is supposed, and certainly an opportunist.

Compare The Alchemist to The Tempest. Written not incidentally at the same
time.

Since so much seems to be known or infered about Shakespeare from Jonson's
pen or vouchsafed opinion, we must admit the possibility of misconstruing WS
deliberately, or by lack-wit.

It was difficult for WS to get going as a playwright - active and antic
opposition from the university men who resented the upstart, esp Greene who
wrote considerably parodies and deprecations. There was also much argy-bargy
around the time when a still-acceptable catholic interest, if suitably
subdued, was permissable, and the subsequent out-and-out pure Protestant
'vision' of the Palatine. Spenserian-revivalism was also attacked by parody.
Lots of politics, severe repercussions - a battle of philosophies.

Sorry. Although there were many writers commenting on the great changes in
social life in England, the principal ones were Eliot and certainly
Dickens - not to exclude Hardy a bit later, with Tess representing the
pattern of the past, compared with all the disastrous new angels....

The good reception given Eliot is generally accepted as preparing later
ground for Dickens, Lawrence, Hardy... and Byatt. (You concur?) These are
certainly Byatt's own views - there is an interesting title of conversations
with a psychologist (S. American? Inez...S?) which I think emerged from a
succession of conversations at the Cheltenham Festival.

I'm afraid that my subject is different from yours - in any case - I have
also been providing you here with the opinions of Yates, Ackroyd, Rowse,
Trevor-Roper.

Well, if it's non-heroic stature you're after, you can find lots in
Chaucer, for instance. Or there's Don Quixote, which appears in 1605,
and Cervantes surely had no knowledge of what was going on on the London
stage. If the argument is that Shakespeare is the first to create
characters with a modern internal psychology, that's more or less Bloom's
thesis, and while you and Bloom are on better ground for that argument, I'm
still not particularly impressed. First, I think you can find analogous
characters prior to Shakespeare in, for instance, Dante and Chaucer and
Ovid. Perhaps it doesn't happen to quite the same extent, but I think
Shakespeare has a certain artificial advantage here in that as a
playwrite, his characters become embodied by actual humans, so that it's
difficult for most of us to know a &quot;pure&quot; textual Hamlet without having
in our minds Scofield or Gielgud or Branagh or Jacobi or Russel Beale or
Burton or Olivier or whatever Hamlets you know.

But I think the primary drawback to Bloom's argument is that modern,
psychologized characters aren't even that common in Shakespeare. Bloom
himself only has a half-dozen or so whom he offers (Hamlet, Falstaff,
Rosiland, Cleopatra, and a few others). The late plays (including some
of my favorites like Cymbaline and Winter's Tale) tend to be more
artificial in some ways, as though the author is retreating to create a
more telescopic amalgamation of human passions and artifice. It's really
bizarre, and to my mind, hugely successful. And even among those few
characters Bloom does think &quot;invent the human,&quot; I'm not sure they're as
internal as Bloom would have us believe. Take that supposedly most
internal of characters, Hamlet, and his supposedly most internal
utterance, the &quot;To be or not to be&quot; soliloquy, for instance. It's termed
entirely in generalities (whithout a single reference to himself or to
anyone else until he turns to Ophelia at the end). Moreover, these dualing
discourses are exactly the sorts found in so many printed books of the
time. We already know Hamlet is a constant reader from his entrance in
Act II scene ii, and Peter Stallybrass has thus described the soliloquy
as more of a hodgepodge (albeit a tour de force hodgepodge) of public
discourse than an internal and personal monologue. The evidence we have
of reception to the play prior to the civil war seems also to encourage a
more &quot;public&quot; reading. In performance, soliloquies seem to have been among
the first things cut, and from diaries, marginalia, commonplace books,
and printed quotations from the text, it seems that people remembered
Hamlet the character less than they remembered, say, the aphorisms of
Polonius. Indeed, the centrality of the internality of Shakespeare's
characters seems to date more from the mid eighteenth century to the turn
of the twentieth, and I think that it's during that period that the &quot;four
great tragedies&quot; become fixed (and fixed around their central characters
- see for instance Bradley's hugely popular 1904 book &quot;Shakespearen Tragedy&quot;
from (which despite its title, centers on only four, or rather on five
characters)). Of the late plays, Cymbaline and the Winter's Tale lose
out to the Tempest, largely, I suspect, because the latter can be
centered around a character who can be identified with the great Author
himself.

You mean the re-emergence of Shakespeare's sonnets? Yes, they seem to

the man (or of his works?). I wouldn't doubt it, but can you be more
