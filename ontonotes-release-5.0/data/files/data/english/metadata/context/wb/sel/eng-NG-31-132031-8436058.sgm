You do one more step than I do.  I don't collect the data on a spreadsheet.  I just remember
them in my head, hahaha.  But I like your method better.  Normally I look for good threads like
the FunJet one you mentioned, but I filter through them.  I look for reputable people that seem to
know their chit.  I look for the number of post, how they present their data, and crunch it to the
best of my knowledge.  I use the search function alot also.  The search feature gives you lots of
info.  Usually enough to make an informed decision.

The Himax 2815-3000 has very similar specs as the Mega 3.  I'm not sure it will be able to handle
the 4s on the APC 6 x 4.  According to the calculations it's close to 500 watts already.  Again the
site is fairly conservative, so your number will probably be higher on a bench test.  Even propping it
down a bit to the APC 5.5 x 4.5 is still very good.  Very high thrust, and pitch speed.  Perhaps
fly the 4s in the colder months will be okay.

To satisfy your boner with a 500+ watt Jet you'll have to go at least 4s, which you are already doing.

Ok, enough chat.  Gotta finish my planes, so I can do some testing.

Oh, here's a pic of my goodies http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q213/jt_redmist/IMG_3496.jpg

From: &quot;Patrick Schindler&quot; &lt;deviantmeth ... @gmail.com&gt;

&gt; I was using that calculator yesterday, it is nice. I linked to it
&gt; from the Nue site. Good choice I think.

&gt; I am comfortable calculating what I will draw, my only real concern is
&gt; knowing how much is too much (know what I mean?) I guess I will just
&gt; buy the motors and start cranking up the juice. We will see what we
&gt; see. I appreciate what you went through to collect the data that you
&gt; do have. I know how long it takes to make an informed decision. . .

&gt; My method is to start on a thread that I know has quality people in it
&gt; (like the funjet thread). I then copy and paste every single motor
&gt; setup that I see along with comments. After a few hours one or two
&gt; setups always start to surface as the preferred method. What is your
&gt; method? Do you just keep a running list in you head?

&gt; on another note, all this talking got me thinking about my HB2815 - 3000

&gt; 3000kv inrunner
&gt; 275W
&gt; 16/15 direct replacement

&gt; All this time I have been running a 5x5 because that is what the dude
&gt; I bought it from said was the &quot;max prop&quot;. (silly me)

&gt; I was dicking around on the himax site and I found the documentation
&gt; on the motor. Calls out 4x4 to 6x4 on 3S. (and that is &quot;within
&gt; spec&quot;, not even going crazy)

&gt; well sheeeeeeeiiiiiit ------

&gt; I have been running this POS on my FunJet for a month on 5x5 and it SUCKS.

&gt; I swapped over to a 6x4 and HELL YEA!

&gt; The FunJet punches straight up into the sky just like the 500T with
&gt; the 7x7 prop. Thrust is great though at the cost of a little speed.
&gt; Anyhow, I love how a model can be reborn by just swapping a prop. I
&gt; tend to get stuck in a rut and every now and again I pop out.

&gt; Wonder how this Himax motor will like 4S?

&gt; I have the biggest boner for a 2Lb 500W+ jet. . .

&gt; &gt; Always use your EagleTree logger to verify before you fry your chit. I have
&gt; &gt; yet to see someone fry their Mega. I'm not saying this is the best motor,
&gt; &gt; but it's been out for a couple of years now, and it's proven. If you want
&gt; &gt; to spin a 6&quot; prop, than you might want to stick with lower kv (1800 - 2500).
&gt; &gt; The lower kv motors seem more forgiving when going to 4s or 5s as far as
&gt; &gt; spinning a larger prop. The high kv motors tend to be more for small props.
&gt; &gt; I also have the Mega 16/15/3, but when putting a 6&quot; prop with above
&gt; &gt; calculator even with a 3s the amp draw is up there. Sorry I can't give you
&gt; &gt; more concrete data, but this is all from hours a nd hours of reading and
&gt; &gt; gathering data from RCGroups.

&gt; &gt; I'm curious to see the Nue motor perform. I'm pretty sure you'll like it.
&gt; &gt; At 130 bones it better be good.

&gt; &gt; I've only seen pictures of the Mega with the 5mm shaft, but never in person.
&gt; &gt; It sounds pretty stout. People tend to use it for Wing battles.

&gt; &gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you found any one place where they attempt to put
&gt; &gt; &gt; realistic specifications on the Mega 16/15/4 or the 16/25/3 ? I dont
&gt; &gt; &gt; like the idea of not having a limitation when tuning with a given
&gt; &gt; &gt; prop. The trouble with having batteries that can source 100A at 4S is
&gt; &gt; &gt; you no longer get the luxury of your battery setting your limits for
&gt; &gt; &gt; you. Very easy to blow chit up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I finally found a place that sells the Nue 11102Y that I want. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; also sell the TP22004S packs. They are in Atlanta so no tax but
&gt; &gt; &gt; expensive shipping. I am going to order today with the 3.2mm shaft
&gt; &gt; &gt; option.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think I will order a mega as well but I am not sure which one yet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe 1 6/15/4 but also maybe a 16/25/4 or 16/25/3. I have to do the
&gt; &gt; &gt; calculations to see how the kv acts at the higher rpm. I want to run
&gt; &gt; &gt; around 6&quot; props on all my stuff. Any smaller runs into thrust
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems (think stuck behind the funjet with no air) and anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; bigger gets in the way for landings (I do NOT want to bend the shaft
&gt; &gt; &gt; on a $130 motor!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Did you see the combat version of the 16/15/4 with the 5mm shaft?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds cool but then you have to drill all your props.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The price on the other hand makes me very weary. . . $36 is too cheap
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a 40 amp ESC with t hat many goodies.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can tell from the burst current that this ESC is rated at MAX so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is probably equivalent to something between a PH25 and PH35. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would not run that thing over 40A for long.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For $36 you just cant go wrong though. . . I cant imagine that it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will cook a motor or an ESC so tell us how it works.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. What brand is it? If you know the brand, how do they rate the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BABBLE SESSION BELOW:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have ordered from Hobby Lobby and they were fine. I dont like
&gt; &gt; their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;hype&quot; style of advertising but they do honest business .

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, &quot;no&quot;, most manufactures do not design margin into their
&gt; &gt; motors.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are two distinct types of manufactures.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motors from China are most likely over rated so overdriving them
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be risky. A 300W motor is probably 300W max or 250 cont. They are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cheap though so take the risk if you want.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motors that are &quot;high quality&quot; are quality exactly because they
&gt; &gt; design
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; margin into the motor. The case of the mega is an extreme situation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and should be co nsidered the exception to the rule. The 450TH from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JGF is also under rated as well. You can easily run that motor 100W
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over its rating. Now, that said, the 500T (as I personally know) is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not as tolerant to abuse. My 500T is all worn out. The bearings are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loose, the motor doesnt have the kick it used to, and it just feels
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; busted (like your moms p****). That was just from going over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; current rating by 20%

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rules of thumb:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is wise to respect the power and current ratings of motors unless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you know (as in the case of the mega) that it is under rated. Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motors will degrade slowly with abuse and some others will just pop
&gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a given point. A good motor should have (at a minimum) 5 criteria:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cont. Power
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cont. Current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Max Power (for X number of seconds)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Max Current (for X number of seconds or at max voltage)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RPM (do not pass this!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Feel free to exercise into the maximum area. With good cooling you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can probably pass the max current/power by a good deal so long as
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respect the time limits. The time limits are simply a factor of heat
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buildup. The better you cool the motor the farther you can go.

Sweeet!

You are shaping up to be a serious enthusiast.  When I first met you I
wasnt sure if you were going to be hardcore or not.  I think that
question is answered.  So what is up with the two packs on the right?
Are they dual 2S packs?  Might make for more mounting options.  I saw
some lipo's on a jet page that could fold up or be laid out flat.
cool.

After the work you did with your easystar I am sure your funjet will
come out tits.  Take extra time while joining the wings.  That was the
hardest part.  I found it difficult to apply pressure along the entire
joint while keeping things level.  I ended up steering away from the
directions and installing the carbon spar after the first wing.  It
made the second wing easier.  I played with them for a long time
finding just the right finger grip that would apply pressure in all
the right places.  I have never been the type to use straight edges
and presses. . .  I always end up screwing up like that.  I like to
freehand it.

After 50 something flights my funjet is almost ready to be retired.  I
am wondering what to get next.

I am thinking about buying one of those giant twister boats and trying
to swap the edf out for something better.  I am sure people will have
it figured out a month after they hit the mainstream.

oh yea. . .  If I had it to do over I might consider doing a slight
canopy mod.  Maybe not all the way back, but a little ways.

another thing:  After you build your funjet (but before you install
electronics) notice how it balances perfectly!  You can actually throw
the thing and it will glide right out of the box with no ballast.  I
like that!

another another thing:  Weakpoint is the hinges.  Mine are all
ripping.  I have been shoring them up with kite repair tape (good
stuff).

&gt; feature gives you lots of
&gt; info.  Usually enough to make an informed decision.

&gt; The Himax 2815-3000 has very similar specs as the Mega 3.  I'm not sure it
&gt; will be able to handle
&gt; the 4s on the APC 6 x 4.  According to the calculations it's close to 500
&gt; watts already.  Again the
&gt; site is fairly conservative, so your number will probably be higher on a
&gt; bench test.  Even propping it
&gt; down a bit to the APC 5.5 x 4.5 is still very good.  Very high thrust, and
&gt; pitch speed.  Perhaps
&gt; fly the 4s in the colder months will be okay.

&gt; To satisfy your boner with a 500+ watt Jet you'll have to go at least 4s,
&gt; which you are already doing.

&gt; Ok, enough chat.  Gotta finish my planes, so I can do some testing.

&gt; &gt; I was using that calculator yesterday, it is nice. I linked to it
&gt; &gt; from the Nue site. Good choice I think.

&gt; &gt; I am comfortable calculating what I will draw, my only real concern is
&gt; &gt; knowing how much is too much (know what I mean?) I guess I will just
&gt; &gt; buy the motors and start cranking up the juice. We will see what we
&gt; &gt; see. I appreciate what you went through to collect the data that you
&gt; &gt; do have. I know how long it takes to make an informed decision. . .

&gt; &gt; My method is to start on a thread that I know has quality people in it
&gt; &gt; (like the funjet thread). I then copy and paste every single motor
&gt; &gt; setup that I see along with comments. After a few hours one or two
&gt; &gt; setups alway s start to surface as the preferred method. What is your
&gt; &gt; method? Do you just keep a running list in you head?

&gt; &gt; on another note, all this talking got me thinking about my HB2815 - 3000

&gt; &gt; 3000kv inrunner
&gt; &gt; 275W
&gt; &gt; 16/15 direct replacement

&gt; &gt; All this time I have been running a 5x5 because that is what the dude
&gt; &gt; I bought it from said was the &quot;max prop&quot;. (silly me)

&gt; &gt; I was dicking around on the himax site and I found the documentation
&gt; &gt; on the motor. Calls out 4x4 to 6x4 on 3S. (and that is &quot;within
&gt; &gt; spec&quot;, not even going crazy)

&gt; &gt; well sheeeeeeeiiiiiit ------

&gt; &gt; I have been running this POS on my FunJet for a month on 5x5 and it SUCKS.

&gt; &gt; I swapped over to a 6x4 and HELL YEA!

&gt; &gt; The FunJet punches straight up into the sky just like the 500T with
&gt; &gt; the 7x7 prop. Thrust is great though at the cost of a little speed .
&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I love how a model can be reborn by just swapping a prop. I
&gt; &gt; tend to get stuck in a rut and every now and again I pop out.

&gt; &gt; Wonder how this Himax motor will like 4S?

&gt; &gt; I have the biggest boner for a 2Lb 500W+ jet. . .

&gt; &gt; &gt; Always use your EagleTree logger to verify before you fry your chit. I
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet to see someone fry their Mega. I'm not saying this is the best
&gt; motor,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but it's been out for a couple of years now, and it's proven. If you
&gt; want
&gt; &gt; &gt; to spin a 6&quot; prop, than you might want to stick with lower kv (1800 -
&gt; 2500).
&gt; &gt; &gt; The lower kv motors seem more forgiving when going to 4s or 5s as far as
&gt; &gt; &gt; spinning a larger prop. The high kv motors tend to be more for small
&gt; props.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I also have the Mega 16/15/3, but when putting a 6&quot; prop with above
&gt; &gt; &gt; calculator even with a 3s the amp draw is up there. Sorry I can't give
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; more concrete data, but this is all from hours a nd hours of reading and
&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering data from RCGroups.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm curious to see the Nue motor perform. I'm pretty sure you'll like
&gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; At 130 bones it better be good.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've only seen pictures of the Mega with the 5mm shaft, but never in
&gt; person.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds pretty stout. People tend to use it for Wing battles.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have you found any one place where they attempt to put
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realistic specifications on the Mega 16/15/4 or the 16/25/3 ? I dont
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like the idea of not having a limitation when tuning with a given
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prop. The trouble with having batteries that can source 100A at 4S is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you no longer get the luxury of your battery setting your limits for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you. Very easy to blow chit up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I finally found a place that sells the Nue 11102Y that I want. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also sell the TP22004S packs. They are in Atlanta so no tax but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expensive shipping. I am going to order today with the 3.2mm shaft
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; option.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I will order a mega as well but I am not sure which one yet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe 1 6/15/4 but also maybe a 16/25/4 or 16/25/3. I have to do the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calculations to see how the kv acts at the higher rpm. I want to run
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around 6&quot; props on all my stuff. Any smaller runs into thrust
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems (think stuck behind the funjet with no air) and anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bigger gets in the way for landings (I do NOT want to bend the shaft
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a $130 motor!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did you see the combat version of the 16/15/4 with the 5mm shaft?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds cool but then you have to drill all your props.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Its heavy weight is offset by the fact that most external bec's are

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The price on the other hand makes me very weary. . . $36 is too

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can tell from the burst current that this ESC is rated at MAX so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is probably equivalent to something between a PH25 and PH35. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would not run that thing over 40A for long.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For $36 you just cant go wrong though. . . I cant imagine that it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will cook a motor or an ESC so tell us how it works.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. What brand is it? If you know the brand, how do they rate the

Hey Patrick,
Thanks for all the heads on the FunJet build.  It always helps to get pointers from someone
with experience and has built and flown one already.  Prior to getting into this hobby I had
no experience whatsoever building models, let alone models with electronics.  Actually I take
that back.  I have built those wooden ones with rubber bands.  Of course the more I build,
the more tricks I learn and ideas I come up with.  It takes me a long time to build a model,
cuz I'm kind of a perfectionist.  Even the extreme tape enforcements on the elevator and
rudder are measured and evenly spaced.  Yeh I know it's anal, but that's me.  This is how
I see it.  If it makes me feel better, it probably flies better.

About the two batteries on the right.  You're right, those are two 2s batteries taped together.
It's from my first EZ when I flew 2s.  The one in the middle is actually two 2s 2070mah
TP extreme.  The one on the outer right is some cheap Epyaya 2s 20C 2050mah .  Both
were used flying the EZ on 4s pulling 35amps, and I honestly could not tell the difference
in performance.

So, what did you end up ordering?  I'm afraid to hear your total, hahaha.

&gt; Hey Patrick,
&gt; Thanks for all the heads on the FunJet build.  It always helps to get pointers from someone
&gt; with experience and has built and flown one already.  Prior to getting into this hobby I had
&gt; no experience whatsoever building models, let alone models with electronics.  Actually I take
&gt; that back.  I have built those wooden ones with rubber bands.  Of course the more I build,
&gt; the more tricks I learn and ideas I come up with.  It takes me a long time to build a model,
&gt; cuz I'm kind of a perfectionist.  Even the extreme tape enforcements on the elevator and
&gt; rudder are measured and evenly spaced.  Yeh I know it's anal, but that's me.  This is how
&gt; I see it.  If it makes me feel better, it probably flies better.

&gt; About the two batteries on the right.  You're right, those are two 2s batteries taped together.
&gt; It's from my first EZ when I flew 2s.  The one in the middle is actually two 2s 2070mah
&gt; TP extreme.  The one on the outer right is some cheap Epyaya 2s 20C 2050mah .  Both
&gt; were used flying the EZ on 4s pulling 35amps, and I honestly could not tell the difference
&gt; in performance.

&gt; So, what did you end up ordering?  I'm afraid to hear your total, hahaha.

&gt; &gt; Sweeet!

&gt; &gt; You are shaping up to be a serious enthusiast. When I first met you I
&gt; &gt; wasnt sure if you were going to be hardcore or not. I think that
&gt; &gt; question is answered. So what is up with the two packs on the right?
&gt; &gt; Are they dual 2S packs? Might make for more mounting options. I saw
&gt; &gt; some lipo's on a jet page that could fold up or be laid out flat.
&gt; &gt; cool.

&gt; &gt; After the work you did with your easystar I am sure your funjet will
&gt; &gt; come out tits. Take extra time while joining the wings. That was the
&gt; &gt; hardest part. I found it difficult to apply pressure along the entire
&gt; &gt; joint while keeping things level. I ended up steering away from the
&gt; &gt; directions and installing the carbon spar after the first wing. It
&gt; &gt; made the second wing easier. I played with them for a long time
&gt; &gt; finding just the right finger grip that would apply pressure in all
&gt; &gt; the right places. I have never been the type to use straight edges
&gt; &gt; and presses. . . I always end up screwing up like that. I like to
&gt; &gt; freehand it.

&gt; &gt; After 50 something flights my funjet is almost ready to be retired. I
&gt; &gt; am wondering what to get next.

&gt; &gt; I am thinking about buying one of those giant twister boats and trying
&gt; &gt; to swap the edf out for something better. I am sure people will have
&gt; &gt; it figured out a month after they hit the mainstream.

&gt; &gt; oh yea. . . If I had it to do over I might consider doing a slight
&gt; &gt; canopy mod. Maybe not all the way back, but a little ways.

&gt; &gt; another thing: After you build your funjet (but before you install
&gt; &gt; electronics) notice how it balances perfectly! You can actually throw
&gt; &gt; the thing and it will glide right out of the box with no ballast. I
&gt; &gt; like that!

&gt; &gt; another another thing: Weakpoint is the hinges. Mine are all
&gt; &gt; ripping. I have been shoring them up with kite repair tape (good
&gt; &gt; stuff).

&gt; &gt; &gt; You do one more step than I do. I don't collect the data on a spreadsheet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just remember
&gt; &gt; &gt; them in my head, hahaha. But I like your method better. Normally I look
&gt; &gt; &gt; for good threads like
&gt; &gt; &gt; the FunJet one you mentioned, but I filter through them. I look for
&gt; &gt; &gt; reputable people that seem to
&gt; &gt; &gt; know their chit. I look for the number of post, how they present their
&gt; &gt; &gt; data, and crunch it to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; best of my knowledge. I use the search function alot also. The search
&gt; &gt; &gt; feature gives you lots of
&gt; &gt; &gt; info. Usually enough to make an informed decision.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The Himax 2815-3000 has very similar specs as the Mega 3. I'm not sure it
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be able to handle
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 4s on the APC 6 x 4. According to the calculations it's close to 500
&gt; &gt; &gt; watts already. Again the
&gt; &gt; &gt; site is fairly conservative, so your number will probably be higher on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bench test. Even propping it
&gt; &gt; &gt; down a bit to the APC 5.5 x 4.5 is still very good. Very high thrust, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; pitch speed. Perhaps
&gt; &gt; &gt; fly the 4s in the colder months will be okay.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To satisfy your boner with a 500+ watt Jet you'll have to go at least 4s,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which you are already doing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, enough chat. Gotta finish my planes, so I can do some testing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was using that calculator yesterday, it is nice. I linked to it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the Nue site. Good choice I think.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am comfortable calculating what I will draw, my only real concern is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowing how much is too much (know what I mean?) I guess I will just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buy the motors and start cranking up the juice. We will see what we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see. I appreciate what you went through to collect the data that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do have. I know how long it takes to make an informed decision. . .

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My method is to start on a thread that I know has quality people in it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (like the funjet thread). I then copy and paste every single motor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setup that I see along with comments. After a few hours one or two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setups alway s start to surface as the preferred method. What is your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method? Do you just keep a running list in you head?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on another note, all this talking got me thinking about my HB2815 - 3000

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3000kv inrunner
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 275W
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 16/15 direct replacement

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All this time I have been running a 5x5 because that is what the dude
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bought it from said was the &quot;max prop&quot;. (silly me)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was dicking around on the himax site and I found the documentation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the motor. Calls out 4x4 to 6x4 on 3S. (and that is &quot;within
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spec&quot;, not even going crazy)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well sheeeeeeeiiiiiit ------

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have been running this POS on my FunJet for a month on 5x5 and it SUCKS.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I swapped over to a 6x4 and HELL YEA!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The FunJet punches straight up into the sky just like the 500T with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 7x7 prop. Thrust is great though at the cost of a little speed .
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyhow, I love how a model can be reborn by just swapping a prop. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tend to get stuck in a rut and every now and again I pop out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wonder how this Himax motor will like 4S?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have the biggest boner for a 2Lb 500W+ jet. . .

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only site I've seen is this one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://brantuas.com/ezcalc/castlecalc.aspBut the
&gt; &gt; &gt; numbers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calculations seem pretty conservative, so take it with a grain of salt.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Always use your EagleTree logger to verify before you fry your chit. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet to see someone fry their Mega. I'm not saying this is the best
&gt; &gt; &gt; motor,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but it's been out for a couple of years now, and it's proven. If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; want
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to spin a 6&quot; prop, than you might want to stick with lower kv (1800 -
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2500).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The lower kv motors seem more forgiving when going to 4s or 5s as far as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spinning a larger prop. The high kv motors tend to be more for small
&gt; &gt; &gt; props.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also have the Mega 16/15/3, but when putting a 6&quot; prop with above
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calculator even with a 3s the amp draw is up there. Sorry I can't give
&gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more concrete data, but this is all from hours a nd hours of reading and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering data from RCGroups.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm curious to see the Nue motor perform. I'm pretty sure you'll like
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At 130 bones it better be good.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've only seen pictures of the Mega with the 5mm shaft, but never in
&gt; &gt; &gt; person.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds pretty stout. People tend to use it for Wing battles.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have you found any one place where they attempt to put
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realistic specifications on the Mega 16/15/4 or the 16/25/3 ? I dont
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like the idea of not having a limitation when tuning with a given
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prop. The trouble with having batteries that can source 100A at 4S is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you no longer get the luxury of your battery setting your limits for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you. Very easy to blow chit up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I finally found a place that sells the Nue 11102Y that I want. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also sell the TP22004S packs. They are in Atlanta so no tax but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expensive shipping. I am going to order today with the 3.2mm shaft
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; option.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I will order a mega as well but I am not sure which one yet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe 1 6/15/4 but also maybe a 16/25/4 or 16/25/3. I have to do the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calculations to see how the kv acts at the higher rpm. I want to run
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around 6&quot; props on all my stuff. Any smaller runs into thrust
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems (think stuck behind the funjet with no air) and anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bigger gets in the way for landings (I do NOT want to bend the shaft
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a $130 motor!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did you see the combat version of the 16/15/4 with the 5mm shaft?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds cool but then you have to drill all your props.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also have the Mega 16/15/3, but when putting a 6&quot; prop with above
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calculator even with a 3s the amp draw is up there. Sorry I can't give
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more concrete data, but this is all from hours a nd hours of reading
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering data from RCGroups.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm curious to see the Nue motor perform. I'm pretty sure you'll like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At 130 bones it better be good.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've only seen pictures of the Mega with the 5mm shaft, but never in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds pretty stout. People tend to use it for Wing battles.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have you found any one place where they attempt to put
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realistic specifications on the Mega 16/15/4 or the 16/25/3 ? I dont
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like the idea of not having a limitation when tuning with a given
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prop. The trouble with having batteries that can source 100A at 4S
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you no longer get the luxury of your battery setting your limits for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you. Very easy to blow chit up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I finally found a place that sells the Nue 11102Y that I want. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also sell the TP22004S packs. They are in Atlanta so no tax but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expensive shipping. I am going to order today with the 3.2mm shaft
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; option.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I will order a mega as
