I'm going with PJ Parks. (Well, I'm not actually &quot;going&quot; with her, I

If you've formed that conclusion by perusing my Web site, by chance, that's

pounds, have hair growing on my chin (not a beard, mind, but close), and a
nasty scar from an old knife fight running down the left side of my face.

&gt; &gt; This has nothing to do with you. It's our thread now. Go take bets or

&gt; &gt; And I have a better personality, too.

&gt; No, I do.

&gt; &gt; Plus I'm kind to the poor.

&gt; I do too.

&gt; &gt; I give them my cast-offs. Whether they want them or not.

&gt; I give them my cast-offs AND I rob my neighbors' houses and take things I
&gt; think would be nice cast-offs for the poor, and I barely keep any for
&gt; myself.

&gt; &gt; I can't sew, though.

&gt; Heh. I can sew, knit, bake, grow vegetables, can vegetables, shoot animals
&gt; and carve them up with a paring knife, roast the meat, and set a lovely
&gt; table that Martha Stewart would die for.

&gt; So I win.

I was going to tell you what I *can* do that rhymes with &quot;sew&quot; but I'm
too ladylike even though I would never wear argyle socks while doing
it.

Every other Friday, I volunteer at the Salvation Army.  One of my jobs
is to help Pete empty the collection bins.  You know, the bins where
people drop off stuff for the poor.

I will no longer empty the bins without wearing full protective gear,
including safety goggles.  I put that vapor stuff around my nostrils.
It would be no more distasteful to retrieve a mouldering body from a
shallow grave.

People toss their garbage in there.  But I can deal with the burger king
bags.

People donate their old underwear to the poor.  A vintage 40's bra is
kinda cool, and sells quickly.  Moldy, unwashed, streaked panties are
not.  Crusty nursing bras should not be donated to the poor.

I stand and shriek that we should simply call The Dump Guy and have him
take the entire bin to the dump.  But it has been explained that we must
not do that because:

*  There just might be a diamond ring in there.  It's happened before.
*  There is usable stuff in there, and people cared enough that they
went to the effort to dump it in there, and they deserve to have their
decent possessions sold and the money used for good works.

I've been told that I can go back inside and alphabetize the books,
first by genre then author then title.  That's what I signed up to do.
But I persist.

Because:

*  I'm so freaking good.  I'm that good.
*  I'm trying to do good works to get into heaven.
*  There's something about these Salvation Army people that brings out
good in people who, frankly, aren't that damned good.  Like me.  Not the
volunteers.  Not the ones who are working to pay a bit of room and board
at the homeless shelter.  The real, true people who join the Salvation
Army.  They call it The Army, and they're . . . bizarrely special.  It's
a life of &quot;Well, okay!  Now that I've spent the morning emptying these
bins, I'll need to freshen up and go down to the jail house and see if
any of their long term residents who can't bail out need someone to talk
to.  Any books?  They need books at the jail house.  Remember -- no true
crime!  And I'm honored that I'm allowed to do this.  And that one girl
will be bonded out next week, and she has absolutely no where to go, and
even though she's addicted to several kinda drugs, I'll be honored to
ask her to come and live with me.&quot;

No shit.  An attitude of, &quot;I am being blessed to serve.  Lucky me.&quot;

There's no sarcasm in them.  Or in me with I talk about them.  None.
They live their entire lives respecting people who don't deserve their
respect.

Me?  When I'm Doing Good at the Army?  I wanna audience.  I want it
recognized, Bubba.  Them?  Those people?  They could care less.

My dark side told me that I would get first dibs on cool things donated,
and cool things are donated every single week.  But it was explained to
me that if the volunteers (all 2 of us.  The other lady is doing the
dusting and alphabetizing and running the cash register, but in her
defense, she has asthma and can't report for empty the bins work.  Or so
she says.) snap up the treasures, then people will not come to shop, and
they'll make less money.  And poor, hungry people will not eat.  And,
although she cannot enforce it, it's considered The Thing To Do to wait
one month, 30 days, before you scarf up the treasures.

I'm telling you, even a truly bad person like me can't be bad around
those people.  I let a kidney-shaped vanity from the 40's slip away from
me because people can't be selfish around those Salvation Army people
just because I refuse to let that sweet old lady Salvation Army person down.

Every Salvation Army thrift shop (not the bins -- inside the shop) is a
monument to bad taste.  Some stuff so tacky that you cringe.  Or laugh.
Some stuff so wonderful that you wonder at the stupidity of someone
who would give away a Loretta Young looking negligee from the 40's (I
was 18 hours away from getting it, too.)  70's furniture is now
considered cool by kids furnishing their own apartments.  Orange shag
carpet reminents fly outta there.  You gimme a Granny looking pillow
that says &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; and I'll sell it in one day.

They continue to work on me.  They haven't given up hope.  They've
prayfully asked me to quit shirking, &quot;You're really gonna buy that
shit??&quot; when I ring up a purchase.  They get downright stern with me
with I explain that the addict I know personally, who has been stopped
six times for DUI, ain't gonna change.  They think he will change.  They
don't think *they* will change him.  They simply think that no human
being is beyond redemption.  They'd bring Ted Bundy home to live with
him, and they'd feed him and cloth him and pray with him and over him,
and treat him with respect, even though, let's just be honest here, Ted
Bundy didn't deserve respect.

Amazing people, those Salvation Army people.

shift that she needs to go in the back room and pray for me.)

&gt;&gt; And I have a better personality, too. Plus I'm kind to the poor. I
&gt;&gt; give them my cast-offs. Whether they want them or not.

&gt;Every other Friday, I volunteer at the Salvation Army.  One of my jobs
&gt;is to help Pete empty the collection bins.  You know, the bins where
&gt;people drop off stuff for the poor.

&gt;I will no longer empty the bins without wearing full protective gear,
&gt;including safety goggles.  I put that vapor stuff around my nostrils.
&gt;It would be no more distasteful to retrieve a mouldering body from a
&gt;shallow grave.

&gt;People toss their garbage in there.  But I can deal with the burger king
&gt;bags.

&gt;People donate their old underwear to the poor.  A vintage 40's bra is
&gt;kinda cool, and sells quickly.  Moldy, unwashed, streaked panties are
&gt;not.  Crusty nursing bras should not be donated to the poor.

&gt;I stand and shriek that we should simply call The Dump Guy and have him
&gt;take the entire bin to the dump.  But it has been explained that we must
&gt;not do that because:

&gt;*  There just might be a diamond ring in there.  It's happened before.
&gt;*  There is usable stuff in there, and people cared enough that they
&gt;went to the effort to dump it in there, and they deserve to have their
&gt;decent possessions sold and the money used for good works.

&gt;I've been told that I can go back inside and alphabetize the books,
&gt;first by genre then author then title.  That's what I signed up to do.
&gt;But I persist.

&gt;Because:

&gt;*  I'm so freaking good.  I'm that good.
&gt;*  I'm trying to do good works to get into heaven.
&gt;*  There's something about these Salvation Army people that brings out
&gt;good in people who, frankly, aren't that damned good.  Like me.  Not the
&gt;volunteers.  Not the ones who are working to pay a bit of room and board
&gt;at the homeless shelter.  The real, true people who join the Salvation
&gt;Army.  They call it The Army, and they're . . . bizarrely special.  It's
&gt;a life of &quot;Well, okay!  Now that I've spent the morning emptying these
&gt;bins, I'll need to freshen up and go down to the jail house and see if
&gt;any of their long term residents who can't bail out need someone to talk
&gt;to.  Any books?  They need books at the jail house.  Remember -- no true
&gt;crime!  And I'm honored that I'm allowed to do this.  And that one girl
&gt;will be bonded out next week, and she has absolutely no where to go, and
&gt;even though she's addicted to several kinda drugs, I'll be honored to
&gt;ask her to come and live with me.&quot;

&gt;No shit.  An attitude of, &quot;I am being blessed to serve.  Lucky me.&quot;

&gt;There's no sarcasm in them.  Or in me with I talk about them.  None.
&gt;They live their entire lives respecting people who don't deserve their
&gt;respect.

&gt;Me?  When I'm Doing Good at the Army?  I wanna audience.  I want it
&gt;recognized, Bubba.  Them?  Those people?  They could care less.

&gt;My dark side told me that I would get first dibs on cool things donated,
&gt;and cool things are donated every single week.  But it was explained to
&gt;me that if the volunteers (all 2 of us.  The other lady is doing the
&gt;dusting and alphabetizing and running the cash register, but in her
&gt;defense, she has asthma and can't report for empty the bins work.  Or so
&gt;she says.) snap up the treasures, then people will not come to shop, and
&gt;they'll make less money.  And poor, hungry people will not eat.  And,
&gt;although she cannot enforce it, it's considered The Thing To Do to wait
&gt;one month, 30 days, before you scarf up the treasures.

&gt;I'm telling you, even a truly bad person like me can't be bad around
&gt;those people.  I let a kidney-shaped vanity from the 40's slip away from
&gt;me because people can't be selfish around those Salvation Army people
&gt;just because I refuse to let that sweet old lady Salvation Army person down.

&gt;Every Salvation Army thrift shop (not the bins -- inside the shop) is a
&gt;monument to bad taste.  Some stuff so tacky that you cringe.  Or laugh.
&gt;  Some stuff so wonderful that you wonder at the stupidity of someone
&gt;who would give away a Loretta Young looking negligee from the 40's (I
&gt;was 18 hours away from getting it, too.)  70's furniture is now
&gt;considered cool by kids furnishing their own apartments.  Orange shag
&gt;carpet reminents fly outta there.  You gimme a Granny looking pillow
&gt;that says &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; and I'll sell it in one day.

&gt;They continue to work on me.  They haven't given up hope.  They've
&gt;prayfully asked me to quit shirking, &quot;You're really gonna buy that
&gt;shit??&quot; when I ring up a purchase.  They get downright stern with me
&gt;with I explain that the addict I know personally, who has been stopped
&gt;six times for DUI, ain't gonna change.  They think he will change.  They
&gt;don't think *they* will change him.  They simply think that no human
&gt;being is beyond redemption.  They'd bring Ted Bundy home to live with
&gt;him, and they'd feed him and cloth him and pray with him and over him,
&gt;and treat him with respect, even though, let's just be honest here, Ted
&gt;Bundy didn't deserve respect.

&gt;Amazing people, those Salvation Army people.

&gt;Donna (The Head Army Lady?  She says about four times during my six-hour
&gt;shift that she needs to go in the back room and pray for me.)
">

Me, I made a killing in the futures market. Little boy kidneys: the
demand is so strong that not even India can supply enough. And
tomorrow I'm off to the church to pray. Not one of those annoying good
works denominations, mind you, but the kind where you get into the
cloud place by saying &quot;Jee-sus!&quot; a lot. I'm not sure about that pink
Billy Graham Cadillac, though: I'm thinking that a more upscale
denomination would get me a BMW.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, I do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I give them my cast-offs. Whether they want them or not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I give them my cast-offs AND I rob my neighbors' houses and take things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think would be nice cast-offs for the poor, and I barely keep any for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can't sew, though.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. I can sew, knit, bake, grow vegetables, can vegetables, shoot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; animals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and carve them up with a paring knife, roast the meat, and set a lovely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; table that Martha Stewart would die for.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I win.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was going to tell you what I *can* do that rhymes with &quot;sew&quot; but I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; too ladylike even though I would never wear argyle socks while doing
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So I win.

Not only can I sew, I can knit, too.

No, no.  I'm not good.  Not even better.  It's a cold-blooded tradeoff.
Sometimes I do bad things, and you gotta go put good on the other side
of your scale, or else you'll go to hell.

That's what I think.  I figure helping to empty those bins when I do not
have to, 'cause I could fake asthma, too, allows me to be bad more often.

Plus there is this bizarre pride that I'm the only volunteer of a girl
type that can handle bin emptying.  Once, Pete lifted me into the bin to
get the dregs.

In September, when it cools down, it's bin cleaning day.  Twice a year,
they scrub the bins out.  I'm so there because:

*  It will be more pleasant to empty the clean bins.
*  When I drop this little bomb at work, &quot;No, didn't do much this
weekend.  JUST SCRUBBED OUT THE SALVATION ARMY BINS WITH MY BARE HANDS&quot;,
they'll step back and say, &quot;Damn.  That Donna's good.&quot;

It's an evolution.  One day, I'll be good enough that I won't give a
damn that I've done good but no one saw.

On that day, perhaps I'll join the Salvation Army.  I figure it's gonna
take about 34 years to get there, to reach that stage of goodness.  I'll
be 90.  There's no age limit.  I've explained to my girls that I'm
funding my retirement until I'm 90, and on that day, my 90th birthday,
I'll be outta money, and will have to go and live with them.  But not if
I join the Salvation Army.  I'll get free room and board, and probably
medical, and no one will expect a 90-year old woman to muck out bins . . .

This has to be an urban legend. How tall is a stack of $100,000 in
$100.00 bills? Probably around 6 inches tall. pajama pockets don't
look that large. Maybe in Captain Kangaroo's jacket?

People put money in the pocket of their pajamas because they never wear
them (who wears pajamas? raise your hand!) and they think it's a safe
place that burglars would never think to look.

People die without telling their heirs and assigns that they've stashed
serious change in the pocket of a pair of pajamas in the upper left
drawer of the bureau that Aunt Sadie left them.

Heirs and assigns are clearing out a house loaded with mildewed books,
kitchen cupboards full of rinsed out margarine bins, kitchen drawers
full of twisties and rubber bands, a 14&quot; black and white TV and bedroom
bureaus full of never-worn pajamas.

The heirs and assigns don't wear pajamas. They don't need the ones in
the drawers even if they did.

THEY DON'T THINK TO LOOK IN THE POCKETS OF PAJAMAS FOR $100,000.

They take the cleaned margarine tubs and the scratched Teflon frying
pans and the Tupperware bins without their lids and the black and white
TV and the pajamas to the Salvation Army drop off ...

... and *that* is how $100,000 gets left in the pocket of a pair of
pajamas left in the bin that Ms Donna is going through.

Now you know.

&gt;&gt; myself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't sew, though.

&gt;&gt; Heh. I can sew, knit, bake, grow vegetables, can vegetables, shoot animals
&gt;&gt; and carve them up with a paring knife, roast the meat, and set a lovely
&gt;&gt; table that Martha Stewart would die for.

&gt;I can bring home the bacon
&gt;fry it up in a pan
&gt;and never let you forget you're a man…
&gt;'cause I'm a woman

&gt;Oh, sorry. Don't know what came over me.

Erm... I'm not sure this is the right thread for discussing &quot;what came
over me&quot; since some people (unnamed of course) might take the wrong
meaning and suggest a quick shower.

&gt; &gt;   If I got the attributions right, it appears as though you just suggested

&gt; Yep. Sal's trolling me. She knows that since the sex change operation, I
&gt; often forget that I'm supposed to be a woman now. Cruel. So, so cruel.

Which, for some reason I probably am MUCH better off not knowing,
brings to mind that classic WKRP episode where Johnny Fever tells Herb
the &quot;Secret&quot; that Jennifer is really the most spectactularly successful
sex-change operation of all time.

The Salvation Army is one of two charities to which I give money.

About fifty years ago, my mother's oldest brother lost everything he had
in the way of worldly goods --and a son-- in a house fire.

Literally, before the firemen were rolling up their hoses, the Sally had
a) arranged a place for the family to say for as long as they needed
(turned out to be about seven months); b) found clothes and even toys
for the surviving kids (there were nine of them); offered my uncle cash
to get him through to his next paycheck (his wallet was in the house)
and in short took care of these people, quickly, efficiently, and --this
was important-- did it without making them feel like they were getting
charity.

A week later the Red Cross offered to loan my uncle money, if he'd
promise to pay it back in ninety days.

When I dabbled professionally in other peoples' lives --i.e. worked in
social services-- on the Great American Tundra --i.e. in Minnesota-- the
Salvation Army in the Twin Cities ran a rehab center for alcoholics and
addicts that charged nothing, and happily accepted clients everyone else
in the world had given up on.  They were as effective as any other
insurance-funded place, more effective than many.

Go Sally.

Oh patooey, you could've found a nonambiguous synonym if you hadn't
wanted to leave a little crevice where a lech could peek in.  You may
have meant SEWer but your mind is in the SEWer, I see it right over
