Why do sons/daughters always find the first possible time to get money for
their parents
collectables? I went to an estate sale the other day and I was talking with
the daughter of a
collector of old pocket watches. I perused through the wares and I couldnt
help but ask the
daughter about them.

she spouted out &quot;Yes my father spent about 30-40 years collecting
these.&quot; Why on
Gods green earth would a loving daughter want to get rid of a collection
which was obviously
one of the main joys of her fathers life...... I mean these arent like a
collection of proverbial
birthday/christmas/fathersday ties.... this was something he worked long and
hard at from
the pieces she was selling

I see this all the time.... I mean, if my parents were to leave me with
their collections, I would
sure as heck find a place some where in the house to show them off, not try
to open my own
little personal pawn store to sell their collection.

just a random thought.

--------------------------------------------------------
This is the main reason that the disbursement of my personal collection is
in the will -- not going to #1 son -- who will get the other stuff - cash,
house, cat &amp; dog, dish washer, etc. I guess you can't expect your spawn to
have the same passion for the same things as you do.

I see this happening. Parents die or get moved to a &quot;old folks home&quot; and the
kids think all the money is in the sale of the house, and not the CRAP the
parents collected all these years.

Just goes to show the kids have little to no interest in the parents. They no
doubt are the ones that put them in their grave or in the home to begin with.

I think the thing that chaps me the most is when you see them selling the
family photo albums with the damn photos in them. THAT is short for &quot;thanks
for nothing mom!&quot;

UGH

"/> I've thought about this a lot, especially because I have no children.
But ponder this ... if everyone kept their parents' collections, how
many generations would pass before every home would be a museum? How
much would it cost to insure? What would maintenance cost? How much time
would each person have to spend maintaining the treasure trove left them
by their ancestors?

Most folks just don't have the time/money it would take to do that - nor
do they have the particular passions of their parents.

Ownership is a transient thing - always. I have been researching a
composer who died in 1951. When his widow died in 1976, she willed his
&quot;memorabilia&quot; to the Library of Congress. Guess what? They don't even
know if they have it or not! Everybody sells collections, or certain
items from collections, even the Smithsonian.

I was particularly grateful to be the benefactor of a collection of this
composer's music not too long ago. The gentleman who was collecting it
died and his wife had absoultely no interest in it. I was able to
acquire it, fill in some gaps in my own collection and donated the
balance to a historical society in the county in which the composer was
born, which is what the collector wanted anyway.

I think perhaps it is a good thing that children do sell their parents'
collections to those who will treasure those items. Hate to say it, but
often the higher the price, the greater chance that such items will be
preserved and passed on to future generations. I would also think,
though, that keeping a small item or two would serve to honor the parent
or benefactor, if only for sentimental reasons.

&gt;&lt;had to snip&gt;
&gt; In the same vein, I can't understand why there are so many photos and
&gt; large albums, diaries, letters and so forth for sale at nearly every
&gt; auction. Surely, there can't be that many &quot;last of the family&quot;
&gt; persons, can there? And this stuff certainly doesn't usually have
&gt; much monetary value.

&gt; N.

"/>  I have been in both of these positions. I had a box of photos, ect. that
landed at my house from my Grandmothers second husband. They were of him and
his first wife and her family. All of these people were long gone and I had no
luck finding a better home for these things. Actually, my house fire took care
of the problem, but they would have ended up at Goodwill eventually.
The other situation was when an aunt died. Her collections were sold off
and good riddance! I never liked her and she didn't like me, so her things were
better off going to new owners who could like them with out the bad vibes.
Yea, it felt a little wierd....but I don't have regrets. Tina

"/> Before you go forming too many judgments....let me tell you a story...I was at
the fair grounds flea market in Saginaw Michigan buying some thing from a
woman. We started discussing dolls and the woman said she had collected dolls
for years nd had over 50 good bisques in her collection but she had never been
able to find a Bru. I told her I had a friend who had one for sale. While she
was eagerly giving me her address asking me to have the friend correspond with
her, her daughter walked up. The poor child had teeth growing in every
direction but straight. They were so bad they made her look deformed. She said
&quot;Mom don't by another doll! You've got plenty of dolls. I need braces. Oh your
teeth aren't nearly as bad as your sisters. (I couldn't even imagine it. The
sight must have been bad enough to make grown men faint.) She really needs
braces. And I can't afford them.
The bru of course cost about as much as two sets of braces at the time. I
edged my self away and threw the address in the nearest trash can. If I had
been that girl when Mom kicked it, I would not have cared about the money, I
would have smashed each one of those dolls to dust.

Granted her response gets my vote for the one that was the most heartfelt,
however, Smorgass Bored's response to hers nearly killed me... Don't try to
drink coffee and read some of these....
