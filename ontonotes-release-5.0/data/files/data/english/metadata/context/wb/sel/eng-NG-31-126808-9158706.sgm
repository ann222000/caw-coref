UK. RNLI awards Padstow lifeboat crew following dramatic yacht rescues
Thursday, 08 November 2007

Alan  Tarby, the Coxswain of the Padstow lifeboat, is to be awarded the
Thanks of the  Institution on Vellum following two dramatic yacht rescues in June
this year.  Two crew volunteers, Luke Chown and Christopher Murphy will receive
framed  letters of thanks from the Chairman of the RNLI for their part in the
incidents.
Both  rescues happened on the same day, 25 June 2007, when weather and sea
conditions  off Padstow were extreme. The Tamar class lifeboat was launched to
assist the 40  foot yacht, Cawesande that was taking on water and unable to
sail because her  foresail had blown out. In heavy, rolling seas Coxswain Tarby
transferred two of  his volunteer crew to the yacht to evacuate the couple
onboard. However, after  the lifeboat had come alongside a total of fifteen times,
it became clear the  skipper and his wife, who were in their sixties, would
not leave the boat.  Eventually all four were airlifted by rescue helicopter
and the yacht was towed  to safety.
As the  first yacht was being taken to Padstow, a second yacht was seen,
anchored in a  dangerous position off Stepper Point. The 30 foot sloop, Fly, had
fouled her  anchor and was in a treacherous position, made worse by the falling
tide, gale  force winds and rough sea conditions. The yachtsman was persuaded
to abandon his  vessel, but during the lifeboats approach, the lively motion
of the yacht led it  to impact with the lifeboat. The force of the impact
caused the yachtsman to  fall overboard and though he remained secured by his
safety harness, it took  several minutes to recover him. It was too rough to cross
the infamous Doom Bar  so the rescue helicopter returned to airlift him to
shore.
Tom  Mansell, RNLI Deputy Divisional Inspector, says Alan Tarby and his
volunteer  crew ensured the 11 hours spent at sea were used to best effect in
rescuing all  three people:
'This was  a long, dangerous and difficult service in which Coxswain Alan
Tarby displayed  first class seamanship, decision making, determination and
courage. He was well  supported by the excellent teamwork of his volunteer crew,
two of whom, Chris  Murphy and Luke Chown, transferred to the first yacht. These
two showed  considerable courage in undertaking this task willingly in such
dangerous  conditions.'
RNLI  Mechanic Michael England and volunteer crew members, Neil Simpson,
Steven  Nicholas, Ian Kitto, David Flide and Thomas Norfolk will each receive an
individual letter of appreciation signed by the Chief Executive of the
charity,  Andrew Freemantle.
Full rescue  scenario
Royal  National Lifeboat Institution
Padstow lifeboat station - 25 June  2007
One craft  and one life saved
At  11.08am on 25 June 2007, Falmouth Coastguard requested the launch of the
Padstow  all weather lifeboat to go to the aid of a yacht reported to be in
difficulties  four miles north of Trevose Head.
The wind  was north westerly, force 8-9 but had been increasing all day.
Michael England, Padstow Station Mechanic telephoned Falmouth Coastguard  and
was told that the yacht was 40ft long with two people on board.  They had a
blown out fore sail, were taking on water and unable to sail.  He informed
Falmouth that they were waiting for crew and would be launching in  about ten
minutes.  The Coastguard said that the yacht might  not have ten minutes.  The
lifeboat and slipway were made  ready for an immediate launch.
At  11.20am, Spirit of Padstow, a Tamar class lifeboat, launched on  service.
On board were; Coxswain Alan Tarby, Mechanic Michael  England, Second
Mechanic Chris Murphy, and Crew Members Neil Simpson, Steve  Nicholas, Luke Chown,
Ian Kitto, David Flide and Tom Norfolk.
On  rounding Trevose Head, the lifeboat met the full force of the  weather.
Best speed was made towards the casualty averaging  15 knots over the ground
as they travelled the four miles to the yacht. The  waves were estimated to be
3 - 4 metres high many of them breaking, with a heavy  10metre ground swell
running from the west.
At  11.42am, the lifeboat arrived at the casualty which was lying towards the
west  with the wind approximately 45° off her starboard bow. No sails were
set and she  was rolling heavily. The yacht's crew were both in the cockpit. The
female crew  was wearing a lifejacket and the male skipper had what appeared
to be a  floatation jacket on. They said that they had water just above the
cabin sole  and that the pump had stopped working. They were not injured or
unwell but they  could not sail due to the shredded jib.
Coxswain  Alan Tarby decided that he would place two crewmen on board the
yacht and take  off her crew prior to attempting to save the boat.  The tow  back
to Padstow would be difficult.  The tide was still  flooding but there would
be breaking seas across Doom Bar.  The lifeboat crew were briefed and Crew
Members Luke Chown and Chris  Murphy volunteered to transfer to the yacht.
Coxswain  Alan Tarby manoeuvred the lifeboat alongside the casualty yacht and
Crewman  Chris Murphy transferred. The lifeboat then backed away. The
manoeuvre was  repeated and on the second attempt crewman Luke Chown jumped aboard.
As  Coxswain Tarby held the lifeboat off the yacht, the two RNLI volunteers
assessed  the yacht's crew and explained the process of transferring to the
lifeboat. They  asked the skipper if he was wearing a lifejacket and he stated
that his coat was  a floatation device.  Both of the yacht's crew were in their
sixties and looked quite tired, so it was decided best to attempt the
transfer  from the cockpit.
The crew  positioned themselves along the starboard deck of the lifeboat and
when the  yacht crew signalled that they were ready, Alan Tarby brought the
lifeboat back  alongside, placing the starboard shoulder as close to the yacht's
cockpit as he  dared.  The yacht was rolling heavily and the unpredictable
breaking waves made this manoeuvre extremely difficult.  On  many occasions the
lifeboat was placed right alongside and a transfer would have  been possible
but the yacht crew were reticent to step across. After  approximately 15
approaches the yacht skipper said no and waved the lifeboat  off.
Coxswain  Tarby decided that it would be possible to tow the casualty over
the bar but not  with anyone on board as there was a severe risk of the yacht
broaching in the  conditions.  He felt that the best option would be to lift the
casualties off by air and at 12.13pm Falmouth Coastguard were informed of
the  situation and asked for a helicopter.
During  this time Luke Chown realised that he had hurt the index finger of
his left  hand, and that it was either broken or dislocated.  He was not  sure
how it happened but he was in considerable pain and realised that the only
assistance he could give fellow crewman Chris Murphy would be radio
communications with the lifeboat. The lifeboat was informed of the  situation.
Coxswain  Tarby decided to attach a tow to the yacht, she was drifting to
leeward at  approximately 3 knots and was now only 2.5 miles from the lee shore
of Trevose  Head.
The  rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose arrived on scene at 12.45am.
Coxswain Tarby  realised that it would be easier for 'Rescue 193' to lift all four
on the yacht  rather than attempt to go back alongside to pick up his crew.
The  10metre swell made the lifts very difficult.  One hi-line was  cut by
the helicopter crew because it became snagged on the yachts self steering  gear
and having been lifted from the yacht, crewman Chown was dunked in the sea
before finally getting into the helicopter.
The  lifeboat altered course for Padstow with the yacht in tow.  The casualty
yacht towed very well due to her traditional design and long  keel.
The  lifeboat arrived at the Doom Bar at 2.20pm, right on high water.  Waves
were breaking regularly right across the bar and on many occasions  the yachts
hull was not visible behind a breaking wave.  However the lifeboat crew
spotted a yacht anchored approximately 2 cables  south of Stepper Point in a
shallow area where local fishermen keep their store  pots. They commented to
themselves that it was a poor choice of anchorage with  the wind now more in the
North and with the tide about to be ebbing that area  was going to become rough.
It was decided to check on the  anchored yacht on their return.
Alan  Tarby was then asked to check on the yacht anchored south of Stepper
Point. The  lifeboat proceeded at best speed.
All crew  were now down below and strapped in, as with the tide now ebbing,
Coxswain Tarby  knew that the bar would be treacherous. At approximately 3.00pm
the lifeboat  crossed the bar, which was a mass of breaking dumping waves.
Coxswain Tarby knew  it would be far too dangerous to tow a boat across in these
conditions and the  only option if the yacht was in trouble would be to take
the yachtsman off and  leave the boat.
At 3.15pm  the lifeboat approached yacht 'Fly', a modern 30ft sloop, which
was facing  northwest with the tide running slightly against the wind. The wind
was still  north gale force 8 and 1.5 metre waves were breaking about 10metres
in front of  the yacht. The situation was rapidly worsening, as the tide
dropped the force of  the ebb increased and it was starting to slew the yacht
making her motion  unpredictable.
Secured  by their safety harnesses, Crewmen Neil Simpson and Steven Nicholas
made their  way to the fore deck of the lifeboat to talk to the skipper. The
yacht's anchor  was fouled and the skipper did not feel that his engine was
powerful enough to  work the yacht clear of the shore.
Although  the boats were rolling, a transfer at this time seemed easy.  Neil
Simpson suggested to the yachtsman that he leave his boat and come  off in the
lifeboat.  The yachtsman readily agreed with this  but for some reason went
back to the cockpit, possibly to retrieve his  camera.
During  this delay the lifeboat was blown away from the yacht and Alan Tarby
had to back  away and re-position the lifeboat. She was in approximately 2.5
metres of water;  surrounded by a lot of broken water and he found it very
difficult to manoeuvre  in the shallow confined space.  The lifeboat's motion
rendered  the bow thrusters ineffective and the force of the wind was making it
very  difficult to bring the bow round to the weather.
At 3.40pm  the yachtsman had made his way back to the yacht's port rigging.
He was wearing a lifejacket and safety harness, which was attached to the
yacht's jackstay. The lifeboat started to turn into the wind and it appeared
that she would go alongside nicely.
As the  manoeuvre was half completed a wave broke against the starboard side
of the  yacht pushing it down towards the lifeboat.  Alan  Tarby applied
astern power but the delayed reaction of the controls meant  that the engines were
still going ahead as the two boats collided, the lifeboats  stem hitting the
yacht's port amidships. The combined result of the roll of the  yacht and the
sudden impact from the lifeboat caused the yachtsman to loose his  footing and
fall overboard.
Alan  Tarby immediately backed away and Steven Nicholas threw a rescue line
to the  yachtsman who was still attached to his yacht by his safety line. He
passed the  line through the 'D' ring on his lifejacket and attempted to tie a
bowline to  himself. However the motion of the yacht was forcing him under the
water and the  lifeboat crew were very concerned for his safety. The yachtsman
managed to tie a  bowline onto himself and the lifeboat crew threaded the
'Perry Buoy' onto the  rescue line and sent it down to the yachtsman to give him
more support.
After  approximately two minutes the yachtsman managed to undo his safety
harness and  was hauled to the lifeboat's starboard well deck where Crewmen Neil
Simpson and  Steven Nicholas hauled him onboard. Alan Tarby took the lifeboat
to deeper water  while the yachtsman's condition was assessed.  After a couple
of minutes the yachtsman said he was unhurt but shaken so crewmen Ian Kitto
and  Steven Nicholas assisted him back to the wheelhouse where he was wrapped
in a  thermal blanket and given oxygen therapy.
It was by  now too rough to attempt to cross the bar so at 4.00pm  Falmouth
Coastguard were contacted and asked for helicopter assistance to  transfer the
yachtsman.
At 4.30pm  the yachtsman was lifted from the lifeboat and taken to The Royal
Cornwall  Hospital, Treliske.
At 4.52pm  just as the lifeboat reached her mooring, Falmouth Coastguard
called to say  there had been reports of a yacht going aground inside the estuary,
at Daymer  Bay.
At 5.05pm  the crew of the lifeboat could see the yacht high and dry and
confirmed to the  Coastguard that it was the yacht 'Fly' and there was nothing
they could do. They  headed back towards the boathouse picking the mooring up at
5.20pm.
At 7.05pm  the wind was still northerly but had eased to force 7 and the tide
had started  to flood.  The seas around the mooring were very bad and the
motion of the lifeboat was very uncomfortable.  It was decided  to slip the
mooring and head for deeper water and stand off until there was  enough water on
the bar to allow passage to Padstow or the wind to ease enough  so that a
slipway recovery could be attempted.
At 8.30pm  Coxswain Tarby called the boathouse to ask what the conditions
were like on the  slipway. Two of his crew were suffering from the effects of
seasickness and all  of the crew were tired after what had been a stressful day.
Second Coxswain  Richard Pitman was at the boathouse and said that it was
marginal. At this point  Alan Tarby thought it would be prudent to wait for the
tide and go to the  mooring in Padstow.
At 9.30pm  the tide had been flooding for 1.5 hours and the wind had eased to
force 7. Alan  Tarby crossed the bar and headed for the fuel berth in
Padstow.  .
At  11.35pm both engines were stopped, after 11 hours and fifteen minutes
running.
