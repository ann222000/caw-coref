There have been several postings recently requesting information about
telling real from fake scrimshaw. Real scrimshaw as defined here is
hand-etched designs on ivory, bone or antler -- some natural organic
material. Fake scrimshaw falls into two categories (as far as I am
concerned): hand-etched designs on man-made materials (epoxies and
plastic polymers, for the most part) made to resemble ivory, and molded
replicas. The latter, especially, are often made to resemble real whale
teeth or walrus tusks, and are cast from molds made of either very good
real scrim (the Barlow stuff) or historical pieces from the 19th and
eearly 20th centuries (the Artek line).

You can tell natural materials from plastic in several ways: (1) the hot
pin test: heat a pin over a flame and touch it to an inconspicuous place.
If it sinks in and smells like plastic, it is. If it scorches the
surface and smells like a dentist's office or burning hair, it's the real
thing. (2) the base: The Artek teeth and tusks all have a flat, darkly
stained base, with an artificial tooth hollow in some of them. They also
have arc-shaped parallel grooves, as though they were cut off with a
circular saw (they were!). (3) Some of the polymers are made from either
ivory dust or ground shell. Tapping these on your tooth, or dropping
them on the floor (not really recommended) give a sound like glass. (4)
The magnifier inspection. All old scrim on real teelth or tusks has tiny
cracks parallel to the length of the tooth. Look for these with a hand
lens to see if they intersect any of the etched lines. This is a sure
way of telling a) that you have real ivory, and b) that the piece was
scrimmed when reasonably fresh, and has some age to it. If the ink has
gone into some of the cracks, it's a sure sign that it's modern scrim on
an older tooth.

Learn more about how to tell real from fake, and how to tell different
ivories (whale, walrus, narwhal, elephant, mammoth, wart-hog and hippo)
apart, as well as how to care for your scrimshaw at my website,
