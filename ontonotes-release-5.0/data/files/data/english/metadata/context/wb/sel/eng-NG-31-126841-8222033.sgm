Bill Kristol.

Not so long ago, the Republican right expected to dominate American politics
for generations to come. Karl Rove, the balding “boy genius” of the G.O.P.,
believed that his generation had achieved a partisan realignment that would
relegate Democrats to irrelevance and overturn the progressive achievements of
the past century.
Now those confident predictions have been proved false, amid  the crashing
failure of George W. Bush and the rise of a new progressive  politics powered by
the Internet. What traditional pundits once dismissed as the  unwashed
peasantry of the blogosphere have risen up to raise millions of  dollars, elect
Democratic candidates, and demand real change in domestic and  foreign policy.
Having inflicted a terrible defeat on the Republicans in last  year’s midterm
election, the “netroots” progressives are preparing to achieve  historic
victories in 2008.
Naturally, the would-be bullies of the right have not taken  this development
very well. As reactionaries tend to do, they have reacted with  fear, anger,
and attempted intimidation.
The Murdoch empire, operating as the Fox News Channel, has mounted  a crusade
against DailyKos.com, the largest progressive political Web site, and
YearlyKos, the site’s annual blogger convention, which will take place in  Chicago
next month. On his nightly broadcast, Fox News sage Bill O’Reilly  charged that
the proprietors of Daily Kos are “hatemongers” like the Ku Klux  Klan or the
Nazis—and targeted JetBlue for serving as a sponsor and the official  airline
of YearlyKos. Not surprisingly, Mr. O’Reilly’s ranting and raving
frightened the JetBlue suits into withdrawing their sponsorship, or at least  asking
Daily Kos to remove the airline’s name from the YearlyKos promotion.
Then came Weekly Standard editor William Kristol,  another Murdoch minion,
who tried to frighten the Democrats away from Daily Kos.  “Every Democratic
presidential nominee is going to the Daily Kos convention,” he  sniffed. “That’s
the left-wing blogger who was not respectable three or four  years ago.… Now
the whole party is going to pay court to him and to left-wing  blogs.” Clearly
he meant to warn that the Democrats would suffer from their  association with
those disreputable leftists—and that the netroots are a fringe,  extremist
element.
The most obvious answer to these reactions from Messrs.  O’Reilly and Kristol
is to urge them both to look in the mirror. To listen to  the Fox News host—
who has publicly urged the destruction of the entire city of  San Francisco and
the entire nation of Iran, among thousands of other equally  charming remarks—
is to hear corrosive hatred distilled into a nightly dose of  poison. The
occasional outburst on a liberal blog, almost always in the  anonymous comments
section, cannot compare with the daily outpouring of vitriol  on Fox.
As for Mr. Kristol, he is no longer in a position to accuse anyone  else of
extremism, if he ever was. His chief allies have long been among the
theocratic evangelical rightists. For many years he has provided the worst  possible
advice to the Republicans, habitually promoting divisive and violent  policies.
During the Clinton administration, he led the neoconservative drive  for
impeachment, urging the Congressional majority to ignore public disapproval  and
vote to remove the president. This stupidity led to a Republican rout in the
1998 midterm election.
Having failed to learn that lesson, the Republicans listened to  Mr. Kristol’
s intense advocacy of invading Iraq, back when he assured everyone  that war
would be easy and fun and that any talk of Shia-Sunni conflict was mere  “pop
sociology.”
Liberals can only hope that crackpots like Mr. Kristol  maintain their
influence over the Republicans for a few more years, reducing the  right-wing party
to a permanent minority.
But are the bloggers somewhere on the opposite extreme? For  those who have
yet to make his acquaintance, the creator of Daily Kos is Markos  Moulitsas—an
Army veteran of Salvadoran and Greek extraction who grew up in the  Midwest
and now lives in the Bay Area with his wife and two children. He is a  business
entrepreneur and a serious sports fan. He also happens to be a liberal
Democrat with a determination to win and occasionally a hot temper.
He and the other leading voices in the netroots seek a Democratic  politics
that is both pragmatic and principled. Antiwar, but certainly not
anti-military, they have fostered alliances with veterans of Iraq. They avoid  rigidity,
dislike identity politics, and apply few litmus tests. In 2006 the  bloggers
raised money for many of the candidates deemed conservative by the  Washington
press corps.
In truth, the bloggers share the values of most Americans, who  also want to
end the war in Iraq, establish universal health insurance, reduce  global
warming, increase the minimum wage and preserve Social Security. It is  the
ideologues such as Messrs. O’Reilly and Kristol whose opposition to those  values
locates them on the fringe, despite their loud megaphones and corporate
backing. And what Murdoch bullies prove whenever they try to stigmatize the  citizen
bloggers is how much they fear a fair (and balanced) fight.
