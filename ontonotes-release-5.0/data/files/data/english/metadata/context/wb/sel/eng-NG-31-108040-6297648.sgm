That's an excellent little summary of what ought to be done to make Jedi
characters truer to the Jedi ideal - in theory - but I don't think it would
have worked as well in practice. For example, if a character's cash supply
is limited in an online game, the common response is to stockpile treasure
that can be converted to cash as needed. The typical 'Jedi' would end up
filling his limited storage space with platinum ingots or something. Because
these games rarely take account of the ease of selling this stuff, you would
usually find that the character can still easily convert his platinum ingots
into cash whenever needed.

And while what you propose is just right for a Light Side Jedi, /in an
on-line game/ I don't see a strong reason why Dark Side Jedi characters
should be forbidden. And Dark Side Jedi would not face anywhere near such
strict limitations. I certainly wouldn't permit Dark Side Jedi in my own
games, but then I'm not charging people actual real money for the privilege
of playing.

In fact, while computers may make it easy to track every last credit a
character has, I'm not sure that's necessarily such a good thing for
roleplaying, especially in settings with a presumably heroic tone like Star
Wars or high fantasty D&amp;D. I feel that characters in these settings
shouldn't care how much money they have, and they shouldn't really need to
care either. Even Han Solo didn't care that much how much money he had - he
just wanted to be rich. I hope you see what I mean.

Golden Heroes (superhero) characters had a Financial Resource Level stat
which quantified what resources a character had without needing to track
every last bit of cash. I'm wondering if this way of managing things might
be a better way of doing it. (n.b. having used gleichman's on-line example
to make my point, I want to switch perspective to consider conventional
off-line RPGs as well)

Briefly, a character with a very low resource rating owned the clothes on
his back, ate cheap food, sometimes had to sleep rough, and so on. A
character with a very high rating would have his own chauffeur and private
helicopter, would fly everywhere business class or on chartered flights,
would own multiple houses and the occasional chateau, and so on.

When a character needed something out of the ordinary - such as adventuring
gear - then the richer they were the easier it would be for them to obtain
what they wanted at short notice. Our poor character has to make do with a
rusty second-hand sabre, while the rich character has a jewelled rapier made
by his personal armourer. In extreme cases, a wealth 'skill roll' might be
needed, and getting too greedy might permanently depress a character's
wealth skill.

This way means you don't have to keep track of every last penny -
characters' living standards and available resources automatically 'track'
their current level of wealth, which can fluctuate a bit as time goes on.

Provided characters keep their wealth to themselves, the system seemed
to work well. It's also reasonably easy to grade items in terms of value and
rarity (as a first-pass approximation, just use a rough formula based on its
price), and that means you can produce a game mechanic that determines who
can obtain what, how easily, and how long it takes to be delivered. I would
also suggest that buying a 20GCr 2000-man battlecruiser ought to have a lead
time of six months or so even if you're so rich you can pay for it out of
petty cash, and that's another thing few games if any bother to model.

Problems may also come when a rich character obtains a job lot of goodies
and makes them freely available to other poorer party members - or indeed to
all comers. Perhaps one also needs a 'Party resource level', which is
roughly the average of the PCs' individual wealth. This represents a degree
of sharing, but without the rich character having to bankroll the entire
operation. IRL there are limits to the amount of largesse people feel able
to offer (or accept) and I think there should be some way to represent that
in-game.

Another issue which has to be handled is what happens when a poorer
character obtains a valuable item outside his normal price range. If it's a
fantastically jewelled sword, he may be able to sell it and possibly even
bump his wealth level up a notch (although doing so could also get him in
trouble), or keep it for the combat bonuses (and that could get him into
trouble too). OTOH if it's a starship with ongoing running costs, he may not
be able to afford to keep it and it may even impoverish him further.

This trick can also work well for characters like Jedi and paladins; you can
have a Jedi with a high resource 'skill' meaning he can get the items he
needs when he needs them, while still living a relatively simple existence.
So a rich Jedi and a poor Jedi can both live like monks, money does not need
to be explicitly tracked, and yet there is still some sense that financial
or material wealth are available resources.

I'd be interested in comments on running a game using generic wealth
'skills' rather than tracking every last coin, particularly how other GMs
would handle abuses and characters obtaining items outside their normal
financial means.

I shall also mention the RQIII wealth rules, which quantify the costs of
differing standards of living, and the resources characters have at each
level, something like:

360 per year - peasant, simple clothes, no armour, knife/club, plain food
...
3600 per year - journeyman, good clothes, leather armour, shortsword/cudgel,
good food
...
3600000 per year - king, sumptuous clothes, jewel-encrusted armour,
jewel-encrusted weapons, regular banquets

This too works well, because if a PC decides to literally 'live like a king'
for a few weeks, it's easy to tell roughly what it will cost him to do so.

When I played Golden Heroes, we used the game's wealth levels, and they
worked nicely for us. But like most superhero settings, GH is very
unconcerned with money, and I do wonder how well the same idea would work
elsewhere. Has anyone tried it?

The thread didn't last long enough for debate of this type to show up,
but I don't think this objection would be difficult deal with. As I
recall it already mentioned limiting the inventory space of the Jedi
significantly and that would reduce his ability to store things
greatly. Coverting it to cash would be impossible, as the moment he did
so- he would lose the excess for the month (which depending upon when
he did it, could be all of it).

He'd still have some significant barter PC to PC perhaps, but even that
can be limited. Just restrict what a Jedi can and cannot have in
inventory (or equiped)- from looting or any other resource.

Sadly SWG galaxies did have a number of Jedi items that could be used
as a sort of black market under such restrictions- but that was a fault
of the game design and should be removed as well. Jedi don't 'upgrade'
their lightsabers or get new cloaks. And such should be removed.

The core concept is to cut the Jedi player off from entire sections of
the game world and activities- those a Jedi shouldn't do anyway.

In game terms this means that you lose the character, although perhaps
it should happen over a certain time span.

HERO handles weath in a similar manner, it's brought as a Perk.

While I use in a Superhero setting, I don't anywhere else. Money is too

There are some problems with this.

For instance, in modern systems (as opposed to age-of-dinosaur systems)
character creation is a process that consists of the player making a
series of choices, with each choice having (fully!) knowable
consequences[1], and with the player being free to tweak a large amount
of axes of variation, including the axis of wealth - in other words, he
can choose to pay character creation currency in exchange for starting
out richer, or he can chose to take on the burden of poverty in exchange
for recieving a character creation currency *bribe*.

The second problem is how to handle wealth fluctuation. A character's
wealth is not at all guaranteed to remain constant throughout the entire
campaign...

[1] Notice that being smacked down by the GM with accusations of
munchkinry (e.g. if you buy too much DX or IQ in GURPS), in public, is
an example of a surprise consequence, which therefore violates the
"fully knowable" requirement.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; care either. Even Han Solo didn't care that much how much money he had - he
&gt; just wanted to be rich. I hope you see what I mean.
">

...However, there are solutions.

One is Lifestyles, which has existed at least since the publication of
the previous (3rd) edition of Shadowrun, and probably they're much older
than that. It consists of the player paying a specific amount of cash
every month, which includes costs for food, rent, and replacement
clothes (i.e. to replace your clothes as they are worn out, or
increasingly with higher standards of lifestyle, to replace them in
order to keep up with fashion).

Sagatafl uses (or will use) something similar. I'm not sure how radical
Shadowrun's implementation is, but Sagatafl's Monthly Lifestyles also
include such things as drinks and snacks at bars, brothel visits (if
appropriate for the setting), other entertainments (purchasing a few
novels per month, or going to the cinema), personal services (hair
cuits, or even hired servants, mais and a butler if the Lifestyle is
high enough). All without giving the player the power to micromanage
(i.e. you can't reduce your Lifestyle cost by a few percent by going
celibate, so as to remove the cost of going on dates or visiting
brothels). In exchange for this, players are empowered to buy drinks at
bars without the GM going "you want a single malt whisky? OK, subtract
60 cents."

Probably Shadowrun's implementation is equally "radical", but I don't
know this for a fact, that's why I've explained Sagatafl's
implementation instead.

There'll be a range of lifestyles. I believe Shadowrun has 5 or 6.
Sagatafl will need a few more, to cover true extremes of wealth
(Shadowrun makes some assumptions about the PCs never reaching wealth
levels appropriate for Decadent Galactic Emperors, for instance - it
would be a crime for Sagatafl to assume something like that).

Certain character traits, such as being addicted to a non-cheap
substance, will include a modifier to the Lifestyle's cost (a flat
multiplier, rather than a percentage multiplier. If you're a
multi-billionaire, your heroin habit won't cost hundreds of thousands
times more than if you were a "street" criminal.)

Now, on to the really neat part, which is how the Modern Action RPG
(the former Action Movie RPG) handles wealth.

During character creation, each character is given a basic Wealth
rating. This is always at least Normal, because MA RPG is not a "fully
flexible" system in the style of GURPS, Sagatafl, Hero System, Ars
Magica, or so forth. (Although make no mistake: It is still *vastly*
more flexible than the majority of systems in existence). Thus players
can only chose to increase starting Wealth, they cannot chose to
decrease it in exchange for a bribe (they can, in theory, chose to
decrease it in exchange for *no* bribe, but if I address that at all
it'll be in one of the Advanced sections, and the main point will most
likely be a warning to the GM to put a stop to "underbid duels" among
the players).

The game has 7 wealth levels (which is insufficient to cover the "high
end". Nevermind Galactic Emperor (Decadent or otherwise) - MA RPG can't
even get withing rifle range of Bill Gates[2]). They are:

Destitute, Very Poor, Poor, Normal, Wealthy, Very Wealthy and Extremely
Wealthy.

All PCs have a default Wealth Level of Normal, except for one subtype
(out of a total of - so far - 41 subtypes) which has a default Wealth
Level of Wealthy. The player may then pay a modest amount of character
points (character creation currency) to increase Wealth by one level, or
a large amount of points to increase Wealth by two levels.

Wealth has no use in itself, but instead divides into six
sub-attributes: Home, Lifestyle, Direct Spending (Cash), Equipment,
Vehicle and Legal Counsel.

The player can chose to pay a small amount of points to increase one of
these sub-attributes by one level. This means that a player can buy up
general Wealth one level (to Wealthy) and then buy up Equipment a
further level, so that with regards to Home, Lifestyle, Direct Spending,
Vehicle and Legal Counsel, he is Wealthy, whereas with regard to
Equipment he is *Very* Wealthy.

Lifestyle covers clothing, food and entertainment, accessories (jewelry
and so forth) and traveling (coach class, first class, Concorde, or
private jet), including standards of accomodation when travelling
(quality of hotel and food). Lifestyle matters little (except for speedy
travelling), and so is mostly for "roleplay flavour".

Direct spending is the character's ability to spend cash, primarily on
bribes and on incidental purchases (but of course only those purchases
that are not already covered by one of the other five sub-attributes of
Wealth).

The standard Wealth level, Normal, gives a specific amount of "free"
direct spending, which requires no dice roll. This is always safe. The
character may chose to try to spend 10 times as much, which involves the
GM making a roll of 2d6 *against* the player. Or he can try to spend 100
or 1000 times as much, which involves the GM making a roll of 4d6 or 6d6
(respectively) *against* the player.

If the GM's roll goes "well" (i.e. "badly" from the character's
perspective), then the character suffers a temporary reduction of wealth
level, of one step (this is cumulative, if it happens several times in a
row), for a period of time depending on how "well" the roll went.

Equipment, Home and so forth are not lost, but direct spending suffers
and the character may have to change travel arrangements and downshift
to a cheaper hotel.

Home defines the character's permanent accomodations, the size and
degree of luxury. It matters even less than Lifestyle (which at least
matters in some cases), and hence is mostly for "flavour" (the standard
advice for players is to never chose Home as the "specific Wealth
upgrade", and to think twice before chosing Lifestyle).

Vehicle controls the quality of vehicle that the character may own.
Normal allows one "normal" vehicle, whereas ships, large boats, luxury
cars or airplaines will require above-Normal wealth.

Legal Counsel controls the quality of the legal counsel available to the
character when (*when* - not if. MA RPG assumes that the PCs will
frequently get involved in exciting sitautions) the character gets in
trouble with the law (poor characters get to make a roll on the "pro
bono" table, to see how poor their free legal counsel is).

Equipment controls the quality of the character's equipment. I'm not
clear on the specifics yet, but each Equipment Wealth level will
probably say something along the lines of "start with 3 class F items
and up to 20 class E items, and an unlimited quantity (within reason) of
class A-D items, or start with 4 class F items, 4 class E items, 4 class
D items, and an unlimited quantity (within reason) of class A-C items".
During the campaign, the character can then re-supply as he wishes,
provided that "outlets" are available (i.e. he may need Contacts, either
his own or provided by a friend, in order to be able to buy black market
weaponry).

[2] I've been thinking about adding one or two additional wealth levels,
but there are some reasons, not all entirely rational, for why I have
not done this yet and may never do it.

As for the second problem, wealth fluctuation, I have decided that it is
not an issue given the period scope of MA RPG. People don't stumble over
buried treasure, with any measurable frequency, in the 18th century or
later (the focus period of MA RPG is roughly 1920 to 1990, but it can be
used for earlier, or for near future, or with expansions for science
fiction). You might find a nuclear warhead, or some pounds of cocaine,
in a modern era campaign, but then you just write that down on your
character sheet, and then you start looking for an opportunity to
"barter" your treasure for something that is useful for you (i.e.
something which is normally outside of your financial means). It is not
like it is trivial to "translate" such "treasure" into comfortably
flexible money bills.

Increases in wealth are handled strictly metagame (as are increases in
skill), in that the players have to pay experience points for them. The
downside of this is that it is highly abstract (as is the larger issue:
That the characters cannot never actually tell their players how much
money they have in their wallets!!), but the upside is that a player can
always chose to pay points to make his character wealthier (between
sessions, that is). The GM is not empowered to prevent this or to even
object to it. At most (I think this will be
