POD:  Shapur II of Persia is one of history's great morons who refuses
to admit how military inept his is, takes personal command, and loses
battle after battle to Julian the Apostate until the Romans manage to
take the Persian capital in 363 AD.  The Roman Empire gets some more
land and Julian returns home in triumph, more secure in power than
ever thanks to a decisive victory over an ancient Roman foe.

Now what?

Well, Julian is a young man, only 32 at the time, and while he could
very well easily die in another battle or from an assassin, let's have
him live and reign until his death at the age of 62, an additional 30
years.  That's a long reign, but not that much longer than his
predecessor Constantius II.

What is the Roman Empire going to be like at this time if given a 30
year reign of a stability under a strong Emperor?

How successful will Julian's efforts at creating a more powerful pagan
church be if given 30 years to work with?

Will his efforts at splitting the Christians bear fruit?

Is he likely to be succeeded by another pagan emperor?

Thoughts?

One big question is how Julian deals with the
Goths in 375. If Julian can defeat them...

Also, of course, Julian's defeat avoids
the fall of Mesopotamia to Persia.

A third point: Julian's successor Jovian
died eight months later of a surfeit of
mushrooms. He was succeeded by the brothers
Flavius Valentinianus and Flavius Iulius Valens,
who re-established the division of the Empire
into West and East.

That too may be avoided.

He might not ever allow them to settle in, period.  Rome has more
resources if Persia got a sound defeat.

But who knows, he might and even if they did still revolt, I think he
would have a pretty good chance of defeating them.  Julian seems to
have been a decent enough general, even if trying to take Persia was
more than he could chew in OTL, he'd have been Emperor for almost 20
years before this TL *Battle of Adrianople, in his late-40's so he'd
be experienced yet still have energy,  and most important he would be
more secure in his power than the OTL Emperors were.  For one thing,
the army was pretty pagan, and would be more so in this TL, so the
Army would be pretty firmly behind him; on the whole I'd say he has a
good a chance at keeping the Goths from being a serious problem, one
way or another.

What could the Romans be expected to get if Julian had soundly
defeated the Persians and took their capital?

Maybe . . . the Roman Empire seems awfully unweildly to me at this
point, and I have trouble seeing it kept united even if Julian is
another Augustus, and while I think he could do a good job if given 30
years, I don't think he's on that level.

The usual. They keep their provinces, a ton of loot, the Persians do
their usual rounds of civil war.

I wonder if this brekas up the Sassanid Empire? They are about to have
their own barbarian troubles, after all.

Why?

Okay, this is plausible; but he could simply appoint a viceroy in one
part of the Empire, or something; it was governed like this once,
after all.

But I agree; it's more probable he'll ultimately appoint some one
else.
