<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Board of Governors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Atomic Energy Agency</ENAMEX> , which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35</ENAMEX> countries , is meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , with the full board in attendance , to examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> request for help in the nuclear project as one application of a recommendation presented at a meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Technical Affairs Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Atomic Energy Agency</ENAMEX> to the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agency</ENAMEX> .
Diplomats said that most <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Western</ENAMEX> and developing countries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agency</ENAMEX> have temporarily agreed to freeze the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> request , because of fears that it might result in the subsequent production of plutonium ; this in response to the fears of the developing countries that this will set a precedent to deprive technical assistance to the peaceful nuclear energy programs of these countries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Seven</ENAMEX> other requests submitted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX> are seen as not constituting any risk for the proliferation of atomic bombs , since they basically address the medical and civilian aspects of atomic energy , and which most members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Board of Governors</ENAMEX> are convinced will not increase <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's capacity to enrich uranium and recycle the spent fuel to extract materials for the manufacture of weapons .
The construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Arak reactor</ENAMEX> , which operates with heavy water , and for which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX> is requesting technical assistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Atomic Energy Agency</ENAMEX> pertaining to radiation safety measures for the reactor , will be the focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Agency</ENAMEX> 's meeting today , in spite of the fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Western</ENAMEX> countries , particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States of America</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> might use this reactor to produce plutonium to make nuclear weapons ,
noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX> must not receive special assistance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arak</ENAMEX> project .
