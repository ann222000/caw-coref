I will come back once more %pw uh , to listen to , uh , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elie Ferzli</ENAMEX> and uh , he is with us again .
Your Excellency , Minister , %pw the , the government warned against descending into the street , uh , previously , that there would be another street and there might be provocations and friction that may lead to disastrous consequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> .
Why has n't the government brought its supporters to the street after this opposition crowd went out ?
We , in our personal judgment , to threaten one street with another street , which was issued by some , uh , mouthpieces of the authorities and some figures , uh , of the parliamentary majority , uh , its purpose was to stir up agitation in the path of the opposition and , as a result , to be satisfied and not resort to expressing itself through this huge phenomenon that is taking place in the , uh , well known squares of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> .
Uh , however , when they sensed the seriousness , uh , of going out and they sensed the seriousness of this popular flood , the seriousness of this popular presence , and the seriousness of the existing division , they felt %pw , they had to be satisfied , uh , uh , because their descent into the street , uh , would have been a descent against the authorities , because demonstrating usually is one .
Is it permissible for the government to lead a riot among the people , to push people against people ?
Usually in all the countries of the world , we know that the opposition descends to express its opinion within the confines of the constitution in a peaceful and civilized way , and this is what happened against , against the existing authorities .
Our authorities here make people descend unless their objective is to push things towards an internal riot , and this I think is something that will leave very negative fingerprints on it .
Um .
Yes .
Thank you very much , Your Excellency , Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elie Ferzli</ENAMEX> , thank you for participating with us and for expressing your opinion with us on this topic .
