Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdel - Hussein</ENAMEX> , I mean , today , after the bombing that occurred at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Al - Tayaran Square</ENAMEX> leaving dozens of innocent civilians victims , I mean , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> issued a statement and said that the terrorists and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Takfiris</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saddamist</ENAMEX> allies are behind this crime and most of the crimes that take place , which target <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> citizens daily in the capital and the other governorates .
He also said that it reveals that the terrorist groups that stand behind it seek to spread the anarchy of killing and crime and to drag the country or to drag <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> into the crucible of war and sectarian sedition .
I mean , there were indications that the conference , the National Reconciliation Conference , would pave the way for a national dialogue with some of the armed groups .
First , do you expect that the Conference will meet the demands of these groups ?
The truth is , when , when the %pw %pw objective is either I rule over you or I kill you , or the objective is either I take hold of everything I can without consideration %pw of national interests , or without consideration %pw , uh , of the complexities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> circumstances , then , %pw in reality , I mean , uh , I think that continuing in this situation wo n't wo n't wo n't change anything in , in the reality of situation , uh , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
The issue is , either there is a sincere patriotic intention to transcend this situation towards a better situation , transcend , uh , the phase of dictatorship %pw that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> experienced , then the phase of the mistakes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> occupation whose price the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people are paying .
Actually , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> people are paying for mistakes they have nothing to do with .
