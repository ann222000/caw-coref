How accurate is the revelation of armed groups leaders or gunmen who direct armed activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> from neighboring countries ?
And uh , some of them have been captured with coordination between the intelligence services of the two sides .
Have you gotten to the point of revealing the papers , what was paid , the price ?
I can say that coordination was not sufficiently adequate .
But recently , there has been a degree of coordination in the area of information ,
It may have helped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> security services in capturing some of them or exposing some terrorist organizations .
But allow me to say : you did not ask about this , but what gave us the ability to pursue the terrorists , and specifically those who are foreigners or from neighboring countries , is the feeling and awareness among many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> who , uh , apparently out of well - meaning and good intentions , joined these organizations -- or out of carelessness .
Now they have begun to feel guilty in their conscience and accountable because they harmed their nation , they harmed their families , they harmed their country .
This is why they came back , and brought back a lot of information , which gave our security services huge capabilities in hunting the terrorists .
And this operation will continue .
And the awakening will continue , the awakening of our citizens opens for us a new horizon every day , they who were led astray by lies , religious slogans or political deceptions .
