Following the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Party</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> in the midterm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">congressional</ENAMEX> elections , which were considered a referendum on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">US</ENAMEX> involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , came the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Study Group</ENAMEX> report on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">US</ENAMEX> policy options in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , which is co-chaired by former Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> , and former Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hamilton</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> .
It is assumed that this report , drawn up by the group composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> , will serve as a political cover for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">US</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> to reconsider his policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> at a time when security chaos is on the rise in the country .
Although the group 's work was entirely confidential , leaks published by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Times</ENAMEX> newspaper said that the group agreed on the need for a regional conference including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's neighboring countries to discuss means of putting an end to the violence in the country . As well as to urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to abandon his reservations regarding talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> , who neighbor this country .
Despite the group 's division on the issue of setting a timetable for the withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">US</ENAMEX> occupation forces from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrat</ENAMEX> Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Reed</ENAMEX> expressed his belief that the group may reach an agreement to provide general recommendations rather than specific ones in this regard .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Times</ENAMEX> said that the group defined its mission as providing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the US government</ENAMEX> with proposed solutions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> situation .
