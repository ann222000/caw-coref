Let me shift to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> , to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fayyad Habib</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fayyad</ENAMEX> , I mean , after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amr Moussa 's</ENAMEX> talks today , can we say there is any progress in the air ?
Well , matter of fact , is that if the decision were left to the ruling party in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , perhaps there would be a possibility of success for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> initiative .
But unfortunately , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> crisis at this time in particular defies resolution , because the key to the solution is not in the hands of any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> .
Instead , the key to the solution right now is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States of America</ENAMEX> .
And since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> orientation so far has not been completely elaborated , especially after , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> report , in my estimation , the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> will remain pending the clarification of perceptions that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> administration wants to adopt at the level of the region as a whole .
Consequently , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> in this situation does not , you know , represent an independent issue for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> administration as much as it is an arena or a pressure card through which it wants to deal with the other relevant parties in the region .
