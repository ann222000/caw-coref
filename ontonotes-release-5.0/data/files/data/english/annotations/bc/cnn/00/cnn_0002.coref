Well it has happened again /.
Even years later <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">the names</COREF> *ICH*-1 still raise a chill <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">Paducah Jonesborough Columbine</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">Tonight</COREF> <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">a new town</COREF> ano- <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">another boy</COREF> /.
but the terror is just the same /.
<COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Mattingly">CNN 's David Mattingly</COREF> joins us now /.
<COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Mattingly">David</COREF> what 's *T*-1 happening /?
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anderson_Cooper">Anderson</COREF> about a little after <COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">two o'clock <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun</COREF> <COREF ID="451" TYPE="IDENT">shot</COREF> and killed <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">an assistant prinicpal</COREF> then badly wounded <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="262" TYPE="IDENT">the principal</COREF> and <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">another assistant principal</COREF></COREF> /.
and uh the su- <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the suspect</COREF> was taken *-1 into custody after <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was subdued *-2 by staff here at the at <COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">the high school</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was taken *-1 to a hospital where <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was treated *-2 for what *T*-3 appeared *-4 to be a gun shot wound to <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own hand *PRO* suggesting 0 there might have been some uh a struggle going on afterwards *T*-5 /.
But <COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">police</COREF> here <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> are continuing *-1 to look for any bit of evidence that <COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can *T*-2 /.
As soon as <COREF ID="451" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> happened <COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> went into <COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT">a lockdown</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="299" TYPE="IDENT">the students</COREF> were not allowed *-1 to leave <COREF ID="299" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> classes /.
<COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> ha- went on for about two hours before <COREF ID="299" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were finally let *-1 out and everyone was finally able *PRO*-2 to figure out what *T*-3 had happened here /.
So many people shocked *RNR*-1 and absolutely stunned *RNR*-1 by what *T*-2 happened /.
so many times we have heard <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> that I ca n't believe 0 <COREF ID="315" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> happened in <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">our small town</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="315" TYPE="IDENT">this tragdey</COREF> definitely has come *PRO*-1 to roost here after *PRO* taking the life of <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">a very popular assistant principal</COREF> here <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anderson_Cooper">Anderson</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is Jacksborough Tennessee 0 we 're talking about *T*-1 /.
H- how big a place is <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">Jacksboro</COREF> *T*-1 /?
Um not very big at all /.
In fact when <COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Mattingly">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="335" TYPE="IDENT">the sheriff</COREF> exactly how many people *T*-1 were here *T*-2 <COREF ID="335" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="335" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could n't really tell <COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Mattingly">me</COREF> that it 's just that <COREF ID="335" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave <COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Mattingly">me</COREF> the <COREF ID="344" TYPE="IDENT">the county at large</COREF> but there were thirteen hundred students here at <COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is the one big high school for <COREF ID="344" TYPE="IDENT">this county</COREF> /.
So not many people at all /.
Everyone knew uh the people at <COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">this school</COREF> particularly this <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">administrator and assitant principal Ken Bruce</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="378" TYPE="IDENT">Students</COREF> <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> saying 0 <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was very well - liked very approachable the kind of teacher who *T*-1 would actually give you <COREF ID="372" TYPE="IDENT">lunch money</COREF> if you forgot *PRO*-2 to bring <COREF ID="372" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with you that day /.
So <COREF ID="378" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're talking about <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="378" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're going *-1 to be missing <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> very much in the future <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anderson_Cooper">Anderson</COREF> /.
About a little after <COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">two o'clock <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun</COREF> <COREF ID="451" TYPE="IDENT">shot</COREF> and killed <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">an assistant principal</COREF> then badly wounded <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="262" TYPE="IDENT">the principal</COREF> and <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">another assistant principal</COREF></COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Mattingly">David</COREF> do we know what time of day <COREF ID="451" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> happened *T*-1 /?
Shortly after <COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">two o'clock <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="451" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> happened near <COREF ID="406" TYPE="IDENT">the office of <COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">this school</COREF></COREF> /.
In fact <COREF ID="410" TYPE="IDENT">some witnesses at <COREF ID="406" TYPE="IDENT">the office</COREF></COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="451" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> happened just right there next to <COREF ID="410" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> while <COREF ID="410" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were t- there *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to conduct some business at <COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> /.
Uh police are still trying *PRO*-1 to figure out what *T*-2 led up to <COREF ID="451" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , why <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the student</COREF> was there at <COREF ID="406" TYPE="IDENT">the office</COREF> *T*-3 and what exactly *T*-4 transpired between <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and the administrators before <COREF ID="451" TYPE="IDENT">those shots</COREF> were fired *-5 /.
All right *PRO* appreciate that /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anderson_Cooper">I</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Mattingly">you</COREF> uh just got to the scene /.

Here 's where the story and the backstory really start *-1 <COREF ID="457" TYPE="IDENT">coming</COREF> together *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="457" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's very much an involving process as <COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Mattingly">David</COREF> just said *?* /.
<COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">The young man</COREF> has spoked to the police but no one is saying what <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 /.
There 's a closed crime scene out there <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> evidence still to be gathered * people questioned * statements taken * /.
At some point the picture 's going *-1 to snap into focus <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> though we only have sketches /.

<COREF ID="m_19" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anderson_Cooper">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to talk a little bit more now on why not why in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> because frankly we do n't know <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> and we do n't want *PRO*-2 to speculate , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's unknowable Wh- but why in so many other cases because even though it is too soon *PRO* to tell whether <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> fits a pattern there <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">a pattern</COREF> and we have seen <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> time and time again /.
Bitter experience has taught us <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
Here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="m_3" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Heidi_Collins"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">CNN 's</COREF> Heidi Collins</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Columbine</COREF> <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Springfield</COREF> <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Pearl</COREF> <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Red Lake Minnesota</COREF> this past March and now Jacksboro Tennessee /.
It is a list that *T*-1 conjures up images of screaming children injured victims and gun - wielding kids /.
Different towns with tragically similar stories /.
What *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">these young men</COREF> snap /.
and what qualities if any do <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">school shooters</COREF> share *T*-2 /?
According to <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> there are dozens of risk factors when it comes to school violence *T*-1 /.
but there is no one definitive profile of this type of criminal /.
Most often the perpetrator is <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">a white male age eleven to eighteen who *T*-1 was described *-2 as *PRO*-3 feeling *PRO*-4 picked on *-5 *RNR*-6 or bullied *-5 *RNR*-6 by <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> peers</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> allow <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">boys</COREF> to be angry and aggressive /.
but <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't allow <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to express fear and sadness and other more vulnerable emotions /.
so hence when they -- when <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get rejected *-1 or <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get disappointed *-2 *T*-3 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a harder time *PRO* <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">dealing</COREF> with that /.
and <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> often comes out in anger /.
Most of <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the shooters</COREF> like you see *?* in this video of <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Dylan Clebold</COREF> and <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Eric Harris</COREF> from <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Columbine High School</COREF></COREF> had a fascination with firearms or violent video games /.
/.
And while there were <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">signs or warnings about <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> intentions</COREF> <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were not taken *-1 seriously at the time /.

Classmates say 0 <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Clebold</COREF> and <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Harris</COREF> who *T*-1 brought terror to Littleton Colorado in nineteen ninety - eight</COREF> and <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="145" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jeff Weiss</COREF> <COREF ID="145" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Red Lake Minnesota</COREF> teen who *T*-2 killed nine people and wounded seven before *PRO*-3 fatally shooting <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF> wore dark trenchcoats and were fans of <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">Marilyn Manson</COREF> /.
Kip Kinkel who *T*-1 killed two students in <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Springfield Oregon</COREF> was a fan of <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">Manson 's</COREF> music as well /.
According to <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">all of the shooters</COREF> may have felt the desire *PRO* to defend narcissitic views of <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> and had very low self - esteem /.

<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> projecting that <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Tim Kaine currently the lieutenant governor</COREF> will be the next governor of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the state of Virginia</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tim Kaine</COREF> <COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a democrat</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">winning</COREF> in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Virginia</COREF> <COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a state 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> carried *T*-1 a year ago</COREF></COREF> /.
And in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">New Jersey</COREF> another democratic victory /.
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">John Corzine currently a member of the United States Senate</COREF> will be the next governor of <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">New Jersey</COREF> according to <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> projections /.
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">One republican victory</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is in <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</COREF> the Associated Press projects 0 *?* will be re-elected *-1 as the mayor of <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">A democrat turned republican /.</COREF>
so that a frustrating race for <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">the democrats</COREF> /.
but democrats will celebrate those two state - wide victories <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> of course the most significant /.
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> carried <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">that state</COREF> a year ago /.
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">campaigned</COREF> for the republican candidate just last night <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">an election eve appearance</COREF> /.
Democrats will certainly make the case that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> troubles are continuing in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the state of Virginia</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_King">I</COREF> will say though <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anderson_Cooper">Anderson</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_King">I</COREF> think 0 the bigger national question out of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the state of Virginia</COREF> might be that <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> helps <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="166" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the current incumbant governor</COREF> <COREF ID="166" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mark Warner</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is leaving office and <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">thinking</COREF> about *PRO*-1 running for president /.
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> party 's</COREF> strength there <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> will only encourage <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jeff_Greenfield.">Jeff</COREF> any surprises to <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jeff_Greenfield.">you</COREF> /?
No uh the most startling thing which we do n't often talk about *T*-1 is the sheer amount of money that these people have *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Mike Bloomberg</COREF> is a five billion dollar man who *T*-1 threw seventy million dollars into this campaign /.
There were ads in Cantonese and Russian /.
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> won a landslide /.
<COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jeff_Greenfield.">I</COREF> 'll cross the river /.
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">John Corzine</COREF> 's worth about three hundred million defeated <COREF ID="207" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Doug Forrester</COREF> <COREF ID="207" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a piker only worth about fifty million dollars</COREF> though it was a combined campaign of about fifty million dollars /.
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Mark Warner who <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_King">John King</COREF> just talked about *T*-1</COREF> has a personal wealth of two hundred million /.
and later tonight when we go to <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> *T*-2 <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">the gentleman named * *PRO*-3 Schwartzeneggar who *T*-4 has about a hundred million dollars</COREF> threw millions into <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> big successful effort at governor /.
But c- can <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">the democrats</COREF> really crow about about what *T*-1 's going on in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> and what *T*-2 's going in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">New Jersey</COREF> /?
Well <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will *?* /.
um and th- <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> won uh and in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> particularly /.
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> was one of the first southern states 0 *T*-1 to to go republican /.
<COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jeff_Greenfield.">I</COREF> think 0 Nixon carried <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in nineteen sixty /.
It is significant when a democrat <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">succeeds</COREF> a democrat not just because <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gives <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Mark Warner</COREF> talking points but <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a crimson red state *T*-1 /.
Do we want *PRO*-1 to make too much of <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /?
No we do n't *?* /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_King">John King</COREF> uh <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">Arnold Schwartzeneggar</COREF> 's not on the ballot /.
but i- eh some of <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> critics say <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> really with some of these ballot initiatives /.
Uh when do <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">the polls</COREF> close there *T*-1 /?
<COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">The polls</COREF> close eleven o'clock eastern out in <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> /.
and *PRO* to follow up on the point 0 <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jeff_Greenfield.">Jeff</COREF> just made *T*-1 about *PRO* perhaps not overstating the impact for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_King">I</COREF> think 0 one of the things 0 we will watch *T*-2 closely <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> is that some of the polls are showing that the American people <COREF ID="CNN_AARONBROWN_ENG_20051108_215800.part-3-E2" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> a bit testy shall we say 0 *?* um not patient anymore with all of the politicians /.
And <COREF ID="CNN_AARONBROWN_ENG_20051108_215800.part-3-E2" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> of course would <COREF ID="327" TYPE="IDENT">affect</COREF> <COREF ID="313" TYPE="IDENT">the republicans</COREF> more because <COREF ID="313" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are in power in Washington *PRO*-1 controlling the presidency and the Congress /.
Whether they take <COREF ID="CNN_AARONBROWN_ENG_20051108_215800.part-3-E2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out on <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">Governor Schwartzeneggar</COREF> in <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> could be another test of <COREF ID="327" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> as well /.
<COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jeff_Greenfield.">Jeff</COREF> /.
One quick point /.
<COREF ID="331" TYPE="IDENT">the election that *T*-1 mattered for <COREF ID="334" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF></COREF> *ICH*-2 has already happened <COREF ID="331" TYPE="IDENT">that special election in <COREF ID="338" TYPE="IDENT">the Ohio congressional district</COREF> with Cincinatti a republican district</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="331" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's the one that *T*-1 's giving <COREF ID="313" TYPE="IDENT">the republicans</COREF> willies for <COREF ID="334" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF> /.

Texas voters adopting a Constituional amendment to *PRO* finding marriage as between a man and woman /.

<COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is something 0 *PRO* to watch *T*-1 *PRO* heading into <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF> as well because republicans think 0 <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> helps *PRO* increase turnout among conservatives /.
