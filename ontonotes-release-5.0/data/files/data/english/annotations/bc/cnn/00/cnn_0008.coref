Well an honest accounting /.
yeah maybe /.
but not a full accounting /.
You know and if the whole bottom line of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">this mess</COREF> is that <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the public</COREF> <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">has</COREF> the right *PRO* to know and that <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is all about *T*-1 <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the public</COREF> still does n't know a lot of things /.

Why was <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">that waiver that <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Miller</COREF> was apparently granted *-1 *T*-2 by m- uh <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">Scooter Libby</COREF> a year ago</COREF> *T*-3 /-
Why did it wait until <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> sat in jail for all that time before <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> actually took up on <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 /?
Why you know she was -- <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's referred to *-1 in the a- in <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Times '</COREF> own account</COREF> as <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Miss Run Amuck</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was pulled *-1 off of certain stories on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction /.
What are <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> motives and bottom lines to the secrecy of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">this whole thing</COREF> *T*-1 /?
There 's a lot 0 we still do n't know *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Miss Run Amuck</COREF> was a name 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> gave *T*-1 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> quite proudly apparently /.
<COREF ID="m_33" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Arianna_Huffington">Arianna Huffington</COREF> <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="111" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Times</COREF> piece</COREF> <COREF ID="111" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a lengthy piece</COREF></COREF> acknowledges that <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Miller</COREF> was a controversial figure in the newsroom whose own WMD reporting *T*-1 was wrong and that while <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> claims *PRO*-2 to have <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">pushed</COREF> for <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">this uh story on Valerie Plame</COREF> two years ago Jill Abrahamson now <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the paper 's</COREF> managing editor says No way /.
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> did n't happen /.
In other words there 's a dispute in the accounts /.
Pretty candid stuff for <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">a newspaper</COREF> to publish about <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> would n't <COREF ID="m_33" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Arianna_Huffington">you</COREF> say *T*-1 /?
Well as <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Frank_Sesno">Frank</COREF> said *?* there are many unanswered questions /.
And there are many very devastating eh comments and conclusions about <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Miller</COREF> as a journalist /.
<COREF ID="m_33" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Arianna_Huffington">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Times</COREF> had any choice though <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> . Because *PRO* remember as a press reporter back on July twenty - seventh the turmoil in the newsroom *ICH*-1 has been going on for months about <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Miller</COREF> and the way 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the paper</COREF> has decided *PRO*-2 to cover <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the story</COREF> *T*-3 and the way 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> decided *PRO*-4 to present <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> as a martyr for the first amendment *T*-5 /.
And the main unanswered question here is why did <COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Arthur Sulzberger</COREF> <COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the newspaper 's</COREF> publisher</COREF> allow <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Miller</COREF> to hijack the reporting of <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">that story</COREF> and the editorial policy on <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">that story</COREF> *T*-1 /.
And the similarities for <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000-part-2-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Jayson Blair</COREF> case</COREF> /.
*PRO* Remember after <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000-part-2-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Jayson Blair</COREF> scandal</COREF> broke we had a seven thousand word story that *T*-1 did not give a full account of what *T*-2 happened . Especially about why is a major institution like <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Times</COREF> ignoring so many red flags *T*-3 /.
Alright /.
In <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the story</COREF> one of things that we learn *T*-1 is that <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Keller</COREF> took off <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Miller</COREF> off <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> WMD beat as one of <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first personnel decisions when <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took eh the reins as editor *T*-2 /.
Alright /.
Well I uh <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">I</COREF> w- agree 0 there are some unanswered questions /.
but <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">I</COREF> 'm willing *PRO*-1 to give <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Times</COREF> a little more credit than <COREF ID="m_33" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Arianna_Huffington">you</COREF> for *PRO* at least to attempting *PRO*-2 to answer uh many of the questions /.
And <COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">Lucy Dalglish</COREF> here 's *T*-2 the th- the thing that *T*-1 jumped out at <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">me</COREF> in the story /.
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Miller</COREF> acknowledges that at Lou- at <COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">Louis Libby 's</COREF> request <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is the Dick Cheney aide</COREF> <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> <COREF ID="277" TYPE="IDENT">agreed</COREF> *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="266" TYPE="IDENT">refer</COREF> to <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and in stories not as a senior administration official but as a former <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">Hill</COREF> aide because <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had once worked on <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">Capitol Hill</COREF> /.
Do <COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">you</COREF> have a problem with that sort of thing /?
I- I I <COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">I</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="266" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was a little bit misleading /.
And <COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">I</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="266" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was odd /.
<COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> justification was that well <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had been a former <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">Hill</COREF> staffer /.
Um but <COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was a strange request /.
and <COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="277" TYPE="IDENT">the agreement</COREF> <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> strange /.
I 'll -- I 'll -- I 'll -- <COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">I</COREF> 'll agree with <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">you</COREF> on <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.

But that sources these days um with the state of <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> law the fact that <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do not have a federal shield law <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have prosecutors and civil litigants going in there and interfering with the day to day operation of <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> newsrooms /.
and <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> just can tolerate this /.
And <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're trying *PRO* to /-
<COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Frank_Sesno">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">Lucy</COREF> 's on to something here if <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Frank_Sesno">I</COREF> can just say <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Frank_Sesno">I</COREF> think 0 this is very important because this is an ugly case /.
And even people close to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Judith Miller</COREF> say 0 this is not the one 0 you 'd really like *PRO*-1 to go to the mat on *T*-2 /.
You 'd love *PRO*-1 to have a clear whistle blower case /.
You 'd love *PRO*-1 to have a Pentagon papers case /.
You 'd love *PRO*-1 to have something where the -- where the well - being and the -- and the sanctity of the Republic you know hangs in the balance *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> did n't even report on this /.
But it does point out <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">a very serious issue</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is the whole notion of the use of *RNR*-1 and abuse of *RNR*-1 confidential sources the protections that reporters do *RNR*-2 or do n't *RNR*-2 have *T*-3 and the propensity *ICH*-4 of this government uh <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the United States government</COREF> *PRO* to have more secrecy not less /.
We 've got *-1 to figure this out /.
Well *PRO* just to clarify uh <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did ultimately uh testify about <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> confidential source</COREF> /.
The whole issue was how voluntary was <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the waiver of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> promise to <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Scooter *Libby Libby</COREF></COREF> offered *-1 *T*-2 and why was <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> able *PRO*-3 to accept after *PRO*-4 being in jail as opposed to before *PRO*-4 being in jail *T*-5 /.
Well exactly /.
and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">you</COREF> know what <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> /. /.
It 's really -- it 's really time for <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">Lucy</COREF> and other <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Miller</COREF> defenders to update <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">her</COREF> talking points because what <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">Lucy</COREF> just said *T*-1 just simply does not wash /.
The truth is that as <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> said *?* <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did testify /.
The truth is that it *EXP*-1 's very clear from the stories <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could 've asked uh <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Scooter Libby</COREF> *PRO*-2 to call <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> so that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could hear the timber of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> voice earlier /.
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">All of that</COREF> could have happened /.
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> did not happen because clearly <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Miller</COREF> is protecting another source that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> still has not revealed *T*-1 to <COREF ID="268" TYPE="IDENT">the American public</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">I</COREF> think 0 it *ICH*-2 's very obvious from what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Judy</COREF> wrote *T*-1 <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is protecting somebody else /.
And one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> negotiating what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was going *-1 to say *T*-2 about <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Scooter Libby</COREF> but you got *-3 to -- but you got *-4 to keep in mind <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lucy_Dalglish">I</COREF> 'm a lawyer 0 there were <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">lawyers involved * in this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> had *-1 to negotiate with <COREF ID="307" TYPE="IDENT">Patrick Fitzgerald</COREF> what <COREF ID="307" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would not talk about *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also had *-1 to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um y- uh uh obstruction charges connected * with contacting /.
Once you invoke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have *-1 to be very very careful /.
You do n't mess with the Feds /.
It *ICH*-1 's very clear in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> story that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> decided finally *PRO*-2 to testify because <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> got tired of jail because <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was threatened *-3 with criminal contempt charges because <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wanted *PRO*-4 to go out and now <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's saying admitting finally write a book /.

Well it *EXP*-1 's very clear that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would not be welcome in the newsroom /.

Well nobody <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">knows</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's the point /.
<COREF ID="m_69" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Arianna_Huffington">Arianna Huffington</COREF> <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">I</COREF> used *-1 to cover the justice department /.
Not everybody who *T*-1 's under investigation winds up *-2 getting indicted *-3 /.

Well not just <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Rove</COREF> though /.
what we have speculated *T*-1 is that it might be <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="139" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a much more tangled web that <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Fitzgerald</COREF> is after *T*-2</COREF> <COREF ID="139" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the whole Iraq White House group</COREF> <COREF ID="139" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the group that uh *T*-3 in <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Cheney 's</COREF> office with Libby and <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Rove</COREF> and Mary Matalin and Condoleezza Rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war *ICH*-4 to the American public based * on lies</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_69" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Arianna_Huffington">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is really the web /.

<COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Pat Fitzgerald /.</COREF>
It *EXP*-1 's very easy *PRO* to sit here and say oh we should never speculate in journalism /.
It 's irresponsible journalism /.
It 's really how you speculate *T*-1 not that you speculate /.
The fact of the matter is that <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Karl Rove</COREF> has been to <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the grand jury</COREF> four times /.
The fact of the matter is that there are <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">lots of people in Washington</COREF> and *PRO* believe <COREF ID="m_17" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Frank_Sesno">me</COREF> <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> *ICH*-1 're not all journalists who *T*-2 are speculating what if <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the guy</COREF> gets indicted *-3 /.

You have satellite delay /.

Welcome /.
*PRO* Let 's deal with the substance first /.
<COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Louis_Freeh">Louis Freeh</COREF> says that when <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> met with <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Crown Prince Abdullah</COREF> in nineteen ninety - eight *T*-1 , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't press for <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-6-E1" TYPE="IDENT">FBI</COREF> access to suspects in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-6-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Khobar Towers</COREF> bombing</COREF> and <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> hit up <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the prince</COREF> for a contribution to <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> presidential library</COREF> /.
Well not only is <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> false and <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> has said so but everybody at the meeting who *T*-1 attended <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting</COREF> not including <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Louis_Freeh">Louis Freeh</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's false /.
And <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">my</COREF> problem with <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF></COREF> is that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> never called anybody at <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting</COREF> /.
Until <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Friday afternoon</COREF> <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did n't even know 0 the charge was being made *-1 /.
And even then <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were unwilling *PRO*-1 to put somebody on the air *PRO* to contradict <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Louis_Freeh">Mister Freeh</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Clinton</COREF> was <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">offered</COREF> *-1 a chance *PRO* to come on and give <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rebuttal /.
What 's *T*-1 wrong with <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
Well first of all it *EXP*-1 's absolutely amazing that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> thinks 0 it *EXP*-2 's okay *PRO* to air a false and malicious statement /.
This is <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">a terrible charge that an <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-6-E1" TYPE="IDENT">FBI</COREF> investigation was thwarted *-1 because <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> wanted *PRO*-2 to receive money for <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> library</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">The charge</COREF> was false /.
and the only way that <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> can be countered *-1 *T*-2 is a former president of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> /?
What about anybody at <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting</COREF> who *T*-1 was willing *PRO*-2 to be on /?
What about <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> doing reporting <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> before <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> air <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">a false and demonstrably false charge</COREF> /?
That 's <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">my</COREF> problem</COREF> /.
What about <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sandy Berger</COREF> <COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the former national security advisor under <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF></COREF></COREF> /?
<COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was at <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was in the room /.
Did <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> offer <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> for an on - camera interview /?
Well on <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Friday afternoon</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">You</COREF> were n't there /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">I</COREF> was not there /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">You</COREF> 're good on television /.
but <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">you</COREF> were n't there /.
I uh <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">I</COREF> talked to <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Sandy Berger</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> issued a statement from <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Berger</COREF> /.
but this was <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Friday afternoon</COREF> when <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> first learned about it with Sunday broadcast *T*-1 /.
Why did n't <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> invite <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Berger</COREF> or other people at <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting</COREF> before <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Friday afternoon</COREF> *T*-1 /?
Why did it take <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *PRO* to get <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> to do basic reporting *PRO* to verify facts *T*-1 /?
It *EXP*-1 's not enough *PRO* to <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Louis_Freeh">Louis Freeh</COREF> say 0 something is so based on an anonymous source /.
<COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's poor journalism /.

<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> gave no +substantive response to any of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the allegations</COREF> until <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">Lanny Davis</COREF> launched <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">his</COREF> PR campaign on the Thursday before the broadcast and offered <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">himself</COREF> as the person from <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the camp</COREF> who *T*-1 would merely disparage and attack <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Freeh</COREF> rather than deal with <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> allegations</COREF> /.
Denials from <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> and Sandy Berger that *T*-1 did deal with <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Freeh 's</COREF> allegations</COREF> were included *-2 in the <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> report /.
Well first of all it *EXP*-1 's false *PRO* to say that <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">I</COREF> was asking *PRO*-2 to disparage <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Freeh</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">I</COREF> was asking *PRO*-1 to tal- k- talk about facts that <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Freeh</COREF> was saying *T*-2 that *T*-3 were not true /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">You</COREF> do n't mind *PRO*-1 disparaging <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Freeh</COREF> /.
M- m- <COREF ID="m_29" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">my</COREF> observation /.
N- no in fact <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">I</COREF> disparage <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">any man who *T*-1 as <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">FBI</COREF> director has a personal pique rather than *PRO* doing <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> job</COREF> /.
That 's disparaging /.
Secondly it *EXP*-1 is absolutely a misrepresentation that <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> told <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> before just the week before /.
When <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mister Carson</COREF> <COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the representative</COREF></COREF> spoke to <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Wallace</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Wallace</COREF> agreed that <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had never verified what <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Mister F- Fee- uh Freeh</COREF> had said *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> never talked to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Freeh</COREF> /.
and in fact it was n't until that Friday that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> learned the substance of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Freeh 's</COREF> charges</COREF> *T*-1 /.
So <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">I</COREF> think 0 *?* has just said something that *T*-1 is false /.
When did <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> team</COREF> find out that <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> was going *-1 to report that <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Louis Freeh</COREF> with <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> new book</COREF> was going *-2 to have <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">a specific +allegation specific allegation about <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton 's</COREF> handling of the <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">Khobar Towers</COREF> investigation and the business about the presidential library soli-</COREF> solicitation *T*-3 /.
When <COREF ID="m_29" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">somebody named * *PRO*-1 Howard Kurtz</COREF> wrote <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">a story in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the Washington Post</COREF> on Friday morning</COREF> *T*-2 is *T*-3 the first time that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> forces</COREF> learned about <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">that false and demonstrably false charge</COREF> that good reporting by *PRO* calling people who *T*-4 were at <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting</COREF> could have done would have verified that <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Freeh</COREF> made a false charge *T*-5 /.
And even since that interview <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Freeh</COREF> has backed off and has not told people who <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> source</COREF> is *T*-1 /.
and <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has n't even insisted that <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was true /.
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> just said 0 <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">somebody</COREF> told <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was true /.
*PRO* Hold on /.
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes spokesman Kevin Tedesco</COREF> said in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the statement 0 <COREF ID="m_29" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">I</COREF> just referred to *T*-1</COREF> that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> office</COREF> was <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">contacted</COREF> *-2 in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">August</COREF> with <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">a detailed list of charges</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's false /.

<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were never told *-1 /. /.
or at least <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">I</COREF> 'm now basing this on what <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Carson</COREF> has told <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Lanny_Davis">me</COREF> *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Jay Carson</COREF> is the spokesman for <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">former president Bill Clinton</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> at <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">that re- uh meeting</COREF> did press the uh Crown Prince *PRO*-1 to cooperate with <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> /.
so what <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Freeh</COREF> said *T*-1 was false /.
That was not understood *-1 by <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> people</COREF> until it was read *-2 in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the Washington Post</COREF> in <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the story that <COREF ID="m_29" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">you</COREF> wrote *T*-3 because <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> put a press release out</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> did n't have <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">Ken Starr</COREF> on *PRO*-1 to rebut /.
Now <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the former director of <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the Federal Bureau of Investigation</COREF> uh who *T*-1 ca n't stand <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> clearly</COREF> writes <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">a book</COREF> gets one segment for <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> book</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> cry foul /.
Nobody was complaining about when <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Clinton</COREF> was getting all this airtime on CBS *T*-1 /.

Look this is a program about good journalism /.
*PRO* Let 's ask a <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-7-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Sixty Minutes</COREF> uh journalist *PRO*-1 to say do you have an obligation *PRO* to verify <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">a charge made * by <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the former <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">FBI</COREF> director</COREF></COREF> as whether <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's true or not /.
Is it *EXP*-1 good enough *PRO* to air <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> just because <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
or should you do reporting /?
Good reporters would hear <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">that charge</COREF> and say <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is an extremely serious charge 0 *T*-1 to be levelled *-2 against <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">former president Clinton</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> new time for those of you just turning in is ten AM eastern seven on the west coast /.
And <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll be bringing you a full hour of media interviews and analysis each week /.
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> story which the media has placed *T*-1 on the back burner in recent months</COREF> is simmering again as voters in <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">that war torn country</COREF> went to the polls yesterday *PRO*-2 to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted *-3 /.
But are journalists getting the real story there /?
*PRO* To help <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> scrutinize the coverage <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">I</COREF> sat down with <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a foreign affairs columnist of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Times</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">three time Pulitzer winner Tom Friedman</COREF> and <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the author most recently of The World is Flat</COREF></COREF> /.

Good *PRO* to be here <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> /.
*PRO* thank <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">you</COREF> /.
The other day <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> wrote that if <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> were the editor of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Times</COREF> <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> would 've put on the front page led <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the paper</COREF> with <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the news *ICH*-1 of recent days that <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">a Sunni suicide bomber</COREF> on <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Ramadan</COREF> had attacked <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">a Shiite mosque</COREF></COREF> /.
Now in reality the world that <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> do n't rule *T*-1 <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">New York Times</COREF> Washington Post made <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> part of a larger story on <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
Uh nobody put <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> on the front page /.
Bad news judgement /?
Uh <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> think so <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 'm not here *PRO*-1 to cric- make a news point though /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 'm really making a larger point which *T*-1 is about <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terrorism</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 'm a firm believer /.
How <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> ever going *-1 to <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">win</COREF> <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">this war</COREF> *T*-2 /?
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're never going *-1 to <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">win</COREF> <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> by way of American intelligence *PRO*-2 finding this terrorist or that terrorist /.
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> get lucky every once in a while /.
but there 's only {one?} way 0 <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">win</COREF> <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">this war</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> is <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> takes a village /.
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> only happens when <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the Sunni Muslim world</COREF> basically turns people in *T*-1 and when <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the Sunni Muslim world</COREF> restrains <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own *T*-2 /.
And what *T*-1 was so shocking to <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">me</COREF> about <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">this story</COREF> <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">a Sunni Jihadi suicide bomber</COREF> <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">blows</COREF> up <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">a mosque</COREF> number one on <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">the first day of <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Ramadan</COREF></COREF> /.
What <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> tells you *T*-1 is that there 's no controlling moral authority <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> in <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the Sunni Muslim world</COREF> /.
Well what is the bigger story *T*-1 /?
And <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is a huge story /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should have been a big story /.
Why was n't /-
Is it because of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> fatigue /?
Um /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> think 0 it is *?* yeah /.
*PRO* Think 0 it 's /-
Are all the editors and producers and new executives feeling another day another bombing ten killed *-1 twenty killed *-2 fifteen killed *-3 /.
and it does n't ha- rise anymore to the top of the newscast or the front page /?
Right /.
Yeah and <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> think 0 that 's right /.
There is <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> fatigue /.
And there 's so much fatigue that we do n't sit back and say *PRO* wait a minute /.
what *T*-1 happened <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">A Sunni Muslim fundamentalist</COREF> went into <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">a mosque</COREF> on <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="195" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the first day of <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Ramadan</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="195" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> holiest day</COREF></COREF> /.
and no one says boo /.
This is -- this is <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">civilization that when we we accidentally or deliberately <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> do n't know abused the Koran *T*-1 people rioted in Pakistan *T*-2</COREF> /.
Yet <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own houses of worship and holidays are being <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-10-E1" TYPE="IDENT">defiled</COREF> *-1 /.
And <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-3 is a measure of how much we 've kind of lost *T*-1 been numbed *-2 *T*-1 by all of this that we do n't sit back and say wow *PRO* wait a minute /.
<COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-10-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> really <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">crosses</COREF> the line /.
and we have *-1 to call <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> on <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> even if <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't *?* /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">You</COREF> 're recently back from <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> write about *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">driving</COREF> in from Kuwait /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">You</COREF> were guarded *-1 by the US navy /.
and yet <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was kind of a harrowing experience /.
Why so /?
Um <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">you</COREF> know <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="243" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the south of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> which *T*-1 is where <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> was *T*-2</COREF> <COREF ID="243" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the area around</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is the safe part /.
Right exactly /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> was in <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">the safe district</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> was guarded *-1 uh by <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">the British Royal Marines</COREF> actually because unfortunately <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs /.
And it 's part of <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT">the general continuing insecurity of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> that um *T*-1 <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 'm afraid 0 *?* has plagued <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">this story</COREF> from the very beginning</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's been <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 've always felt 0 *?* the Achille 's heel /.
You know my <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">my</COREF> criticism of the Bush administration as <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">you</COREF> know *?* How- we 've talked about this before is not that <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">this war</COREF> is not important /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> believe 0 it is important much more important than <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> think 0 the left has ever fully recognized /.
But it 's so much harder than the right has ever been willing *PRO*-1 to acknowledge /.
And on that trip <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> put on body armor /.
Their their rifles were out /.
Yeah /.
Um how does <COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> affect <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">your</COREF> perception as a journalist *T*-1 /?
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">You</COREF> 're there /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> 're being <COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT">protected</COREF> *-1 /.
and <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> 're must have been a little bit nervous of of what the safety situation is *T*-1 in there /.
Well <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 'll tell <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">you</COREF> what *T*-1 's really frustrating from a journalist 's point of view as one who *T*-2 have lived in Beirut for nearly five years covered that war /.
When <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> worked in <COREF ID="322" TYPE="IDENT">Lebanon</COREF> *T*-1 you could go anywhere on that story /.
You could cross lines /.
Journalists worked for the most part until the very end with Terry Anderson the kidnappings targets /.
Therefore by the end of the <COREF ID="322" TYPE="IDENT">Lebanon</COREF> story <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> thought 0 the best journalists there knew more than <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT">the Lebanese</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> always thought 0 the best compliment 0 you could get *T*-1 as a journalist is when you told <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT">the Lebanese</COREF> something 0 <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't know *T*-3 *T*-2 because you were moving around so much /.
What *T*-1 's so frustrating about <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> story</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> no one has a bird 's eye view /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> care passionately about <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">this story</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 'm so interested in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
but because of the securtiy situation you ca n't move around with the freedom 0 you want *?* *T*-1 /.
And the brave reporters who *T*-1 are there every day do n't have that freedom of movement either /.
And therefore <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's limited /.
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="011">
and in fact as <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> know *?* <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /.
There 's a lot of good things going on in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
There 's a lot of progress being made * 0 we 're not seeing *T*-1 reported *-2 by the press /.
Do <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> think 0 that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /?
No because <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> do n't have a bird 's eye view /.
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> wish 0 <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> could say /.
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> wish 0 <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> could be so sure /.
but General Casey does n't <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> a bird 's eye view /.
And <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's why we get surprises in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> *T*-1 /.
Uh <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out *T*-1 *T*-2 /.
and maybe you know we 're going *-1 to see more surpises in the coming future there /.
But because no one can move around with the freedom that you need *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to talk to everyone you do n't have that bird 's eye view /.
And as a reporter as a columnist who *T*-1 really cares about <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">this story</COREF> <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> find that *PRO*-2 really frustra- /-
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> can not report <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> the way 0 <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 'd love *PRO*-1 to *T*-2 /.
So <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> 've been there five times /.
but it 's episodic /.
It 's here /.
It 's there /.
It 's never really putting your arms around the story /.
Tak- *PRO* pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have *-1 to say that <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraq story</COREF> has been overshadowed *-2 by <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Katrina</COREF> by <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Rita</COREF> by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT">this Pakistan earthquake</COREF> /.
Um inevitable with a war that *T*-1 drags on and on /.
And I 'm -- and these are all also important stories obviously /.
but uh do <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> feel 0 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's getting the attention that <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should *T*-1 /?
Yeah /.
No because to <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">me</COREF> this is the whole ballgame of <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Katrina</COREF> and <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Rita</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll come and go /.
but at the end of the day <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> made a very big claim um that <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could go to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> um and <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">produce</COREF> a decent forward looking government there /.
If <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> happens then <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> is going *-1 to have a a very huge quiver you know in <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> uh legacy there /.
Um if it -- if <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't happen <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> think uh 0 <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> will be seen *-1 as a complete and utter failure /.
so everything rides on <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> not just for <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> though but for <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> /.
These are huge stakes involved * /.
And so I <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's gotten the attention 0 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's deserved *T*-1 /.
And *PRO* going back again to one of <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">your</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> collumns uh <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> observed the Iraqi military *ICH*-1 there which *T*-2 after all is supposed *-3 to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /.
The slightly ragged quality left <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> *-1 feeling <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> write 0 *?* that if you pulled the US and British advisors out tomorrow <COREF ID="275" TYPE="IDENT">the whole Iraqi navy</COREF> would collapse /.
That 's a pretty pessimistic assessment and clearly at odds with what <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> and the Defense Department say *T*-1 every day /.
/.
Not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying *T*-1 which *T*-3 is that the number of really trained Iraqi units you know are far fewer than than sometimes *PRO* suggested *-2 by <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> /.
So <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> 're saying 0 there 's a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing *PRO*-1 to tell <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> *T*-2 not necessarily on the record /.
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">You</COREF> quoted one US senior official and what <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the President of the United States</COREF> and the Vice President and the dis- Secretary of Defense</COREF> are <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">saying</COREF> *T*-1 to reporters every day /.
Are we calling <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> on <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
Right d- <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> do n't think enough because there 's -- there 's been a lot of happy talk around this <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">Howie</COREF> basically /.
And a lot of numbers are thrown *-1 out /.
Eighty thousand this week we 've got *T*-1 trained *-2 a hundred and twenty thousand next week /.
Here 's what you learn *T*-1 when you go to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> *T*-2 /.
Where you have <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">an Iraqi commander who *T*-1 's a real leader of of soldiers</COREF> *T*-2 okay you have a unit /.
And where you do n't have <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">that commander</COREF> *T*-1 you do n't have a unit /.
So the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.
So <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> went down to the -- *PRO*-1 to see <COREF ID="275" TYPE="IDENT">the navy there</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="275" TYPE="IDENT">The navy of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF></COREF> has <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">a terrific commander</COREF> /.
so <COREF ID="281" TYPE="IDENT">the people around <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="281" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll follow <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> into battle /.
But you take <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">that one guy</COREF> out there 's no Iraqi navy /.
and it 's true of units all over the country /.
That 's really the key /.
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">You</COREF> say that <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> are angry uh that <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> has fought <COREF ID="300" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> as though <COREF ID="300" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would be easy /.
Are <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> particularly angry as somebody who *T*-1 supported <COREF ID="300" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> and took heat from some of <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">your</COREF> liberal friends for *PRO*-2 doing so /?
Yes /.
Absolutely because <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> believe 0 this is important /.
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> believe that something very big is at stake /.
We 're dealing with <COREF ID="320" TYPE="IDENT">a Muslim Arab civilization</COREF> *ICH*-2 right now that *T*-1 's that *T*-3 's in decline , that *T*-4 's heading in the wrong direction in ways that *T*-5 are dangerous for <COREF ID="320" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> believe 0 *?* dangerous for the stability of <COREF ID="333" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> /.
There 's something really important here at stake /.
and what *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">me</COREF> so angry at <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> is not that <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't frame the stakes /.
It is important /.

<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> says that <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">you</COREF> 're the composer of the nation 's talking points which *T*-1 was news to <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Howard_Kurtz">me</COREF> /.
Uh one of the things 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> said *T*-1 was that uh in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">your</COREF> book</COREF> and in <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">your</COREF> writing that CEOs play a very central role /.

Yeah /.
Mhm /.
Mhm /.
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> a reasonable observation /?
Yeah <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a reasonable observation /.
And <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">my</COREF> reaction to <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is look if <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to understand <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the underlying technology that *T*-2 is flattening <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF></COREF> who do <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> go to *T*-3 /?

Do <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> go to um uh the factory floor /?
Or do <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> go to <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the innovators and entrepeneurs who *T*-1 actually put <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">all this</COREF> together</COREF> /?
So <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> make no apology for <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-12-E3" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> at all /.
Um fact <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> would make a criticism of <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-12-E3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
There are n't enough people during the last few years who *T*-1 actually went out and talked to <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the innovators who *T*-2 are doing all of these things who *T*-3 are actually reshaping <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF></COREF> /.
Just the opposite /.
We kind of had <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">an <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-12-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Enron</COREF> effect</COREF> /.

And therefore I would argue -- <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> would argue -- /.
*PRO* Wait a second /.
*PRO* wait a second /.
Journalists uh subscribe to stereotypes because there are a few crooks at major corporations because you know they 're all bad guys /?
Yeah yeah /.
Yeah I w- -- I would say -- <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> would say /.
That 's a -- uh that 's a harsh uh assessment /.
<COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> would say that there was a lot of *PRO* ignoring -- there 's <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">several things 0 *T*-1 happened basically in the last three years</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> would call <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 a poli- -- a perfect storm /.
One was <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">nine eleven</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> distracted us okay /.
The other was <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-12-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Enron</COREF> effect</COREF> /.
You know no one wanted *PRO*-1 to be sort of seen *-2 with CEOs /.
And number three was the dot com bust which *T*-1 made everyone think well all this globalization technology stuff is really over /.
And as a result <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> would argue 0 <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> really masked what *T*-1 is actually <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">a fundemental inflection point</COREF> <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">the flattening of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF></COREF> that we 're <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">going</COREF> from a vertical value creation model of command and control to a much more horizontal one of connect and collaborate /.
The argument of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this book</COREF> is that <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">that shift</COREF> is actually going *-1 to be as big -- have as big an effect *ICH*-2 over time as Gutenberg and the printing press /.
And <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tom_Friedman">I</COREF> would argue a little bit that <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> got missed *-1 because of <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">all these other distractions</COREF> /.

And television was all over <COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-14-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the story</COREF> /.
Here in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> tonight <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">officials</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are increasing security on <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> massive subway system</COREF> because of what <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> call *T*-1 *PRO*-2 a significant and credible threat /.
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">The threat *PRO* to attack the subways in coming days</COREF> comes from overseas /.
and the police here will be searching bags briefcases even baby strollers *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to stop <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="CNN_RELIASRC_ENG_20051016_100000.part-14-E3" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was *PRO* let 's face it irresistable /.

<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">The threat</COREF> concerns <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> subway system behind <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anderson_Cooper">me</COREF> around <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anderson_Cooper">me</COREF> literally beneath our feet here in Times Square</COREF> /.
The Fox News alert <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> subways</COREF> are on a heightened state of alert this evening after what officials are describing *T*-1 as a specific threat /.
And <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> tabloids were n't far behind /.
The problem as with so many previous terror alerts is that allegations from informants are inherently shaky /.
And some correspondents offered caveats of course /.
MSNBC anchor Keith Olbermann could n't help but notice 0 on <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">that day</COREF> <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">October six</COREF> it *EXP*-1 was news that Karl Rove had been called *-2 back *PRO*-3 to testify in the CIA leak case and <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the white house</COREF> is being assailed *-4 by conservatives over the Harriet Miers nomination /.
E- events that *T*-1 have been politically disadvantageous to <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the current administration</COREF> have been uh oc- occuring simultaneously *RNR*-3 or followed quickly upon *-2 *RNR*-3 wi- with uh with with something related * to terrorism on a -- on a big scale /.
By the next morning the New York Times and the Washington Post were reporting that federal authorities were playing down <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the threat</COREF> as noncredible /.
But the TV coverage kept *-1 rolling down the track like the number four express /.
Finally last Tuesday some newspapers and then the cable networks reported that <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the whole thing</COREF> <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> a hoax /.
The CBS evening news gave <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">three sentences</COREF> /.
Well Jim Stewart of our Washington bureau quotes governe- government sources tonight as *PRO*-1 saying 0 the Iraqi man who *T*-2 gave <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">that tip</COREF> to US intelligence agents in Iraq now says 0 <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">the information</COREF> was simply not true /.
But <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's a lot more than NBC Nightly News and ABC 's World News Tonight which *T*-1 did n't mention <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the great subway hoax</COREF> at all /.
In an age of terror such threats obviously need *-1 to be reported *-2 /.
