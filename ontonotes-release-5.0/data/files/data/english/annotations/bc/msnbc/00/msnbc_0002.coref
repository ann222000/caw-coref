Three charges here /.

<COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Darryl_Littlejohn">I</COREF> 'm a likely suspect because <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Darryl_Littlejohn">I</COREF> have a criminal background and <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Darryl_Littlejohn">I</COREF> was n't supposed *-1 to be there *PRO*-2 working /.

Joining us now <COREF ID="m_26" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Gail_Abramson">former prosecutor Gail Abramson</COREF> and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">criminal defense attorney uh Janna Spillbore</COREF> /.
All right so <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">Janna</COREF> look <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">this defense attorney</COREF> is is out there uh you know *PRO*-1 talking a big game Basically saying <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've got a solid defense here /.
uh <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took the subway home /.
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had nothing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> et cetera /.
Yeah and what 's *T*-1 wrong with that /?
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's going *-1 to present <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the uh some other dude defense did it</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> could work in this case <COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> because we do n't have a lot of solid evidence yet linking <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> to to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Imette St. Guillen 's</COREF> rape</COREF> or <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> murder</COREF></COREF> /.
Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">you</COREF> mean 0 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">you</COREF> 're ignoring <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">all the evidence that Ray Kelly 's explaining *T*-1</COREF> /?
No you know what /.
because <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">that evidence</COREF> is weak at best /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">I</COREF> mean you could have an alternate explanation for <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">all of that</COREF> /.
The fibers transference <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's easy /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">I</COREF> mean it it <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *?* /.
Oh yeah /.
No but *PRO* listen /.
If the -- if the theory is that <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">raped</COREF> and <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">killed</COREF> *-1 why is n't <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn 's</COREF> DNA all over <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> body</COREF> *T*-2 /?
We have no semen /.
We have no evidence of rape /.
<COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> 'm sorry /.
Have have you -- have <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">you</COREF> not been involved *-1 in any cases where there were rapes where there was no semen *T*-3 *T*-2 /?
eh It 's highly unlikely <COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> /.
Oh really /?
Yeah /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">I</COREF> mean you know <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">I</COREF> 'm not actually going *-1 to claim that the rapist was polite and used a condom /.
and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">I</COREF> do n't think 0 that was the case /.
Hold on /.
I <COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> /.
Is there any evidence of that /?
No /.
So so we -- uh at at worst we might have a couple of people involved * in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">this crime</COREF> /.
But we have no evidence that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">raped</COREF> <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /.
The theory is rape and murder /.
All right <COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> know /. /.
But see but <COREF ID="m_26" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Gail_Abramson">Gail</COREF> <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is what <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">defense attorneys</COREF> do *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">change</COREF> the subject /.
They <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> start saying aha *PRO* prove <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the rape</COREF> prove <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the rape</COREF> /.
Exactly /.
And <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're /-
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Even the prosecutors</COREF> are suggesting well you know what /.
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have alternate theories here where it sounds like <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not even a hundred percent certain 0 <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can prove <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the rape</COREF> *T*-1 /.
And here 's *T*-1 the thing <COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Janna_Spillbore">Janna</COREF> with all due respect this is /-
We 're talking about <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">a career criminal who *T*-1 knows about DNA who *T*-2 knows about criminal evidence who *T*-3 probably has been tried *-4</COREF> /-
But not a career rapist /.
Well rape can be an crime of opportunity /.
And there will -- there has been <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">many many many career criminals who *T*-1 do not have rape on <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rap sheet until <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have an opportunity *PRO* to rape someone</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> could have used a condom /.
In addition <COREF ID="172" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Charles Heinz</COREF> <COREF ID="172" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the district attorney</COREF> came out today *PRO*-1 saying that <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're only twenty per cent through *PRO*-2 analyzing the physical evidence /.
And <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're also concerned /-
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have not said /-
*PRO* Wait <COREF ID="m_26" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Gail_Abramson">Gail</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were also concerned that that other cases which <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> might be -- might be linked *-2 to *T*-1 were cases where the rapist uh forced <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the women</COREF> *PRO*-3 to clean <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> off *T*-4 /.
Absolutely /.
And the /-
One in -- one in particular /.
<COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">a woman</COREF> called when <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> saw <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> picture on the television *T*-1 /.
um Her <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> test /-
<COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> story is exactly that /.
And <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> whether <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's a rapist or a drug dealer or whatever <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is a career criminal /.
And <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's also a smart -- a smart guy /.
<COREF ID="m_26" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Gail_Abramson">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> managed *PRO*-1 to you know while <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was on parole work as a security guard which <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was n't supposed *-2 to do *T*-3 /.
*PRO* Told people 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was a federal marshal /.

And what *T*-1 's more important <COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> is that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's charged *-2 with first degree murder /.
And we do n't have *-1 to prove rape *PRO*-2 to prove first degree murder /.
um First degree murder will have -- will have a sexual assault /.
but you do n't need *-1 to pr- -- you do n't need *-2 to prove that there was semen /.
You know you do n't need *-1 to prove that there was any kind of mark left * on <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> body</COREF> /.
Not according to <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">this indictment</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_26" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Gail_Abramson">I</COREF> mean /-

and <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've charged <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> three different ways /.
Under count one <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do have *-1 to prove that there was <COREF ID="292" TYPE="IDENT">a sex crime</COREF> and under three as well /.
What <COREF ID="m_26" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Gail_Abramson">I</COREF> mean *T*-1 is they do n't have *-2 to -- they do n't have *-3 to -- <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't have *-4 to bring forth any forensic evidence of <COREF ID="292" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.

<TEXT PARTNO="005">
But but the problem <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Gail_Abramson">Gail Abramson</COREF> is it is a crime if the -- if <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the bar manager</COREF> lied to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the authorities</COREF> about what *T*-1 happened led <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> on a wild goose chase /.

Exactly /.
and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going *-1 to argue one of two things /.
Number one <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going *-1 to argue that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had no idea that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="35" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Darryl Littlejohn</COREF> <COREF ID="35" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">aka B as <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is known *-2 at the bar</COREF></COREF> was on parole and was not allowed *-3 to be working there /.
You know number two /-
So <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going *-1 to argue ignorance /.
And <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's also going *-1 to argue that um you know <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> felt *-2 threatened *-3 or something like that . And that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> uh was threatened *-4 by someone /.
*PRO* Remember 0 there was another bouncer by the name -- that they called *T*-1 *PRO*-2 Kwan that *T*-3 never showed up again either /.
Right /.
So <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might plead <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was a victim in this case and /-

<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's going *-1 to be a tough argument in part because the original story that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the bar manager</COREF> told cops *T*-2 was that he -- was that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'd seen <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Imette</COREF> leave alone /.

One other thing <COREF ID="m_19" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> worth <COREF ID="m_10" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Golden">I</COREF> think 0 *?* *PRO* pointing out real quickly here is that <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did hear for the first time today a potential alibi for <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn</COREF> /.
That Ray Kelly indicated that <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't believe 0 <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went *PRO*-1 to visit <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">that day</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> van</COREF> to work <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">that day</COREF> and <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> van</COREF> back <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> now know 0 *?* /.

<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">She</COREF> joins <COREF ID="m_40" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">me now</COREF> on the phone for <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">her</COREF> first tv interview since these charges were dropped *-1 /.
Thanks *ICH*-1 a lot for *PRO* coming on <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> /.
We appreciate it /.
<COREF ID="m_40" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">You</COREF> 're welcome /.
All right so <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> eh seemed to uh *-1 to really be I do n't know if it 's saying *PRO* going after your son But basically saying that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">your</COREF> son</COREF> should be forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">testify</COREF> /.
Exactly /.
And on one hand he <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> basically says that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is uh you know appalled *-1 that a teacher would do this to a child /.
And on the other hand <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's saying that because you know <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's not under twelve years old /.
nobody likes *PRO*-1 to testify /.
*PRO* even referred to police officers do n't like *PRO* to testify /.
so um basically he should -- -- um You know <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needed *-1 to do <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
So um I <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">I</COREF> have *-1 to tell <COREF ID="m_40" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">you</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">I</COREF> 've just been mostly shocked *-2 that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> really did not appear *-3 to consider <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">my</COREF> son</COREF> at all um at all through this /.
And largely you know that was made *-1 known *-2 through <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> comments and <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> order that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> issued *T*-3 /.
You know look I <COREF ID="m_40" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> made a lot of comments *ICH*-1 yesterday on <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">this program</COREF> saying that <COREF ID="m_40" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> thought that a lot of people were demanding that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> be prosecuted *-2 Were suggesting that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">your</COREF> son</COREF> be forced *-3 to *PRO*-4 to testify in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="m_40" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> was saying that the same people who *T*-1 are usually out there *PRO*-2 yelling and screaming for <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the victims</COREF> we 've got *-3 to protect <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the victims</COREF> are suddenly saying oh you know well the victim does n't -- We do n't really have *-4 to worry about <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the victim</COREF> in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> /.
Exactly /.
And and there was no one that *T*-1 wanted <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> to serve prison time more than <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">myself</COREF> /.
And uh <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> /-
You know that was <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> original plea agreement that <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> offered *T*-1 to them um /.
But at the end of the day and as it got closer to <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the trial</COREF> we were you know less than a week before <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">trial</COREF> , that uh <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the court tv</COREF> refusing *PRO*-1 to um /-
Which originally <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had said 0 <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would do a delay and <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would shadow <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">my</COREF> face and the family members as well as <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">my</COREF> son</COREF> /.
Well without a delay then there 's -- <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">My</COREF> son 's</COREF> name would have ended up *-1 being said *-2 /.
um You know with thirty forty witnesses you ca n't help it /.
And um you know *PRO* just having all of this aired *-1 live and and being debated and re-debated *-1 every statement every comment /.
And as you -- as <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">I</COREF> know *?* you know you can say <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">one sentence</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's many times taken *-1 out of context /.
So um it at the end of the day <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">I</COREF> could n't move forward with that uh to *PRO* forcing <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> to prison and basically having <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">my</COREF> son</COREF> re-victimized *-1 /.

I <COREF ID="m_29" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> did not find <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to be particularly sympathetic either /.

<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Debra_Lafave">My</COREF> greatest regret would probably be um the fact that <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Debra_Lafave">I</COREF> put <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">this young man</COREF> through <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
um <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Debra_Lafave">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the media</COREF> has totally um taken it out of proportion /.

It 's -- it 's really never <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Debra_Lafave">her</COREF> fault from what <COREF ID="m_8" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sally">I</COREF> 've seen *T*-1 up to this point /.

Yeah she seems -- uh <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Debra_Lafave">She</COREF> seems *-1 to be blaming <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">this all</COREF> on <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Debra_Lafave">her</COREF> uh mental conditions /.

<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> could have four or five years ago done whatever <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 /.
Suddenly this wonderful story of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">hers</COREF> comes out which <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="James_Eckert">I</COREF> assume 0 *T*-1 will be made *-2 into a book someday /.

Well i- if <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="James_Eckert">I</COREF> said with <COREF ID="m_48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">you</COREF> <COREF ID="m_48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> sex with <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> that 's true /.

and <COREF ID="m_48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">you</COREF> know that /.
Well but but <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="James_Eckert">you</COREF> are sort of attacking <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> by *PRO*-1 saying 0 if <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wanted *PRO*-2 to go <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could have gone and this and that and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> looked /-

<COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="James_Eckert">I</COREF> said certainly if any part of this were true from <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the time 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was eighteen years old *T*-1</COREF> until the time 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was twenty four *T*-2 /.
Now <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> looks very mature for <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> age as <COREF ID="m_48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">you</COREF> just saw and heard *?* /.
There 's no question *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="James_Eckert">my</COREF> mind <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could have done anything 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wanted *T*-2 /.

<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was fourteen /.

No <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's basically saying 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was brainwashed *-1 /.

How did <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> come to then *T*-1 /?
But how did <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> come to uh as just just recently *T*-1 /?
Well <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> explains it as over the past ten months <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had some more freedom *PRO* to go out /.
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> started *-1 going out /.
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> volunteered at a church /.
uh <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was wearing <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">a purple ribbon</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Karen_Wells">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> what <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was about *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was for Lent /.
So <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was out and about in the public /.
and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> started *-1 making friends <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">especially a man at um <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">a deli</COREF></COREF> /.
And people kept *-1 questioning <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /.
How come <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do n't have a driver 's license *T*-1 /?
How come <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> did n't graduate from high school *T*-1 /?

<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> do n't have a job /.
And <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could n't really come up with the right answers /.
And then she said -- <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 finally <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> broke down and told <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">this man at <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the deli</COREF></COREF> everything because she <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> just did n't have any answers for these questions anymore /.
And <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> felt that <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had people 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could trust *T*-1 and that <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could turn to *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> biggest fear was that if <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 to escape or if <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> told <COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> <COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would n't believe <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 'd be out on the street /.

But in the Afghan capital of Kabul it 's Islamic values that *T*-1 count /.
And under some interpretations of Islamic law apparently you can be sentenced *-1 to death for *PRO*-2 switching religions /.
Now <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is hinting that <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Rahman</COREF> might be mentally ill and unfit *PRO*-1 to stand trial /.

uh If <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">you</COREF> can *?* *PRO* explain <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> to us /.
Well <COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> there 's really two things at play /.
In <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> there is a power struggle *ICH*-1 going on between those who *T*-2 want *PRO*-3 to bring <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> back into the community of nations and make <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> modern and democratic country and the Islamic conservatives who *T*-4 have really run <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> uh for the last decade /.
Even before <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Taliban</COREF> there was also <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">an Islamic government</COREF> /.
and many of <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">those same people</COREF> are back in power /.
And <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> really represents something that *T*-1 's happening in the broader Islamic world which *T*-2 is a tension between democratic values on one hand and Islamic values on the other hand /.
<COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean because the <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Afghan constitution</COREF> ar- article two point two says 0 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">followers of other religions</COREF> are free *PRO*-1 to exercise <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> faith and perform <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> religious rights within the limits of the provisions of law /.
*PRO* Seems pretty straightforward /.
That 's right /.
uh And <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">article seven of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF></COREF> also cites <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the universal declaration of human rights which *T*-1 specifically says that <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> should have freedom *PRO* to choose <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own religion</COREF> /.
Let *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">me</COREF> read <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">The state</COREF> shall <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">abide</COREF> by the UN charter international treaties international conventions that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> has signed *T*-1 and <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the universal declaration of human rights</COREF> /.
Th- <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's exactly right /.
But there are contradictions within <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">this constitution</COREF> /.
Article three of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> says that no law shall eh contradict the beliefs or provisions of Islam /.
And article one thirty of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> says that if there is not something specific in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Afghan law</COREF> that *T*-1 speaks to a certain situation then <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">judges</COREF> should use <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> interpretation of Islamic law /.
In this case there is nothing in the Afghan criminal code which *T*-1 actually talks about the crime of apostasy or *PRO* changing one 's religion /.
Well *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">you</COREF> about /-
<COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean since <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">you</COREF> were involved *-1 in *PRO* helping <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">create</COREF> <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> constitution</COREF> and <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> law</COREF> wh- when <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">you</COREF> were helping <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> do <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *T*-2 did <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">you</COREF> foresee something like <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> maybe happening /?
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> absolutely did *?* /.
uh And and there were several of <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> who *T*-1 really advised strongly both uh to <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghan government</COREF> and the people drafting <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> as well as <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> own government that there were some very potentially dangerous contradictions within <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> /.
um <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was ultimately a document that *PRO*-1 was agreed upon *-2 That *T*-3 was drafted *-4 by <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghans</COREF> and agreed upon *-4 by <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghans</COREF> /.
And in the final negotiations <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> actually made <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the document</COREF> even more Islamic and made the judiciary even more powerful um than what the original draft has done *T*-1 /.
So <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did foresee some of these problems /.
H- here 's *T*-3 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Bush">the president</COREF> <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">talking</COREF> about how <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Bush">he</COREF> hopes *PRO*-1 to deal with <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to listen to <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and then ask <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">you</COREF> if <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">you</COREF> think that <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going *-2 to be able *PRO*-3 to achieve <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> can <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">solve</COREF> <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this problem</COREF> by *PRO*-1 working closely with <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the government that uh <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've got contacts with *T*-2 and will</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll deal with <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> diplomatically and remind people that there is something as universal as *PRO* being able *PRO*-1 to choose religions /.
It *EXP*-1 is hard *PRO* to believe *PRO* right uh as an -- as outsiders uh that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a country that uh *T*-2 has been liberated *-3 by the United States uh that there are still many US troops there fighting <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Taliban</COREF> et cetera and somehow uh we now have *-4 to negotiate the right of citizens there *PRO* to practice Christianity /.
<COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">You</COREF> 're right <COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> /.
it *EXP*-1 's a travesty um that something like <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> could happen anywhere in the world /.
And <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> really contains a very important lesson for <COREF ID="286" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> in that <COREF ID="286" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really need *PRO*-1 to pay close attention not to just broad questions like elections but specifically the law in countries like <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="286" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> could have worked over the last four years <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">I</COREF> believe 0 *?* much harder *PRO* to make *PRO* *EXP*-1 sure that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> had a competent non-ideological and non-political judiciary /.
um And <COREF ID="286" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're really going *-1 to have *-2 to work very closely with <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghans</COREF> in the future *PRO* to help <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> improve <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> judicial system /.
Is it going *-1 to work /?
<COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean is <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Bush">the President</COREF> going *-1 to be able *PRO*-2 to work on <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> diplomatically as <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Bush">he</COREF> says *?* and with the people that <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have contacts with *T*-3 and resolve <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="m_2" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean it sounds like what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen is 0 <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> 's going *-3 to declare <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> mentally ill /.
Well <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is is really looking for a way out of <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have come under a tremendous amount of pressure /.
and obviously when Secretary of State Rice and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Bush">the President</COREF> weigh in *T*-1 uh this is of uh uh extreme importance at the highest levels /.
And so <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Alex_Thier">I</COREF> have little doubt that <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghan government</COREF> will find some way 0 *PRO* to wiggle out of <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> either by *PRO* declaring <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> insane or perhaps quietly letting <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> slip out of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> *PRO*-2 to seek asylum elsewhere *T*-1 /.
All right /.
