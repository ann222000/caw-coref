Dealing with <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">serial crimes</COREF> per se /.
<COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> can see <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">the emerging behavior</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can see that <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a behavior that *T*-1 is is not going *-2 to stop /.
You can have hundreds of individuals as suspects and can narrow the focus of your investigation to <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">a smaller pool of people</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gives you a starting point /.
The good news is 0 even though at any given point in time that there are <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">these people out there perpetrating <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">these crimes</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are getting better at *PRO*-1 catching <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and better at *PRO*-1 catching <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> sooner So that instead of *PRO* waiting until <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've committed twelve crimes or instead of *PRO* having twelve murders take place before <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> catch <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">somebody</COREF> now <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> may catch <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> after the first or second murder /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker_1">I</COREF> will never in <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker_1">my</COREF> lifetime learn why a serial killer <COREF ID="284" TYPE="IDENT">becomes</COREF> a serial killer *T*-1 /.
But maybe the work that <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker_1">I</COREF> 'm doing *T*-1 now will be able *PRO*-2 to take other people down avenues 0 *PRO* to explore *T*-3 with more tools with more ability *PRO* to experiment with more ability *PRO* to study on a hands - on basis /.
But <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker_1">I</COREF> will never learn <COREF ID="284" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
As a psychologist through all the interviews that <COREF ID="m_8" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker_2">I</COREF> 've conducted *T*-1 all the cases that <COREF ID="m_8" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker_2">I</COREF> 've reviewed *T*-2 what <COREF ID="m_8" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker_2">I</COREF> 've learned *T*-3 is that <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> while bright um and while at some level charming are emotionally and spiritually bankrupt /.
and <COREF ID="m_8" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker_2">I</COREF> 've learned that there is such a thing as evil /.
While <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">criminal profiling</COREF> has been the topic of best selling books and award winning films <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is merely one tool used * *PRO* to solve crimes /.
The fact is that often <COREF ID="317" TYPE="IDENT">offenders</COREF> are caught *-1 while *PRO*-2 committing minor crimes like traffic violations or simply because <COREF ID="317" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> raise suspicion of local police /.
That 's our crime files investigation /.

<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese Government</COREF> is sending tonight to a senior delegation /.

<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">The Chinese</COREF> have influence certainly more than <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> and the other members of the international community dealing with <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT">this problem</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> now has an opportunity *PRO* to put <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> best foot forward , *PRO* to send <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> a direct message that <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">these missile tests</COREF> can not be tolerated *-1 and if <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> now have *-2 to come back to <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement</COREF> and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've got *-3 to denuclearize give up <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> nuclear ambitions and abide by <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the agreement that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> made *T*-4 with the rest of us nearly a year ago</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">the South Koreans</COREF> and <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese</COREF></COREF> have both said 0 <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not believe 0 there should be sanctions against <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> /.
Will <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> absolutely insist that there be sanctions in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> resolution</COREF> /?
If you look at <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">this <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> resolution that *T*-1 's under debate in <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does *?* /.
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a chapter seven resolution so <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has the effect of compuls- compulsory behavior by <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">all the member states</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> says that what <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> did *T*-1 was a threat to international peace and security /.
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> does ask <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">all member states</COREF> *PRO*-1 not to <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">engage</COREF> in nuclear trade with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> strikes <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> as an obvious point /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">I</COREF> think what <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *-1 to do *T*-2 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll see a lot of diplomacy over the next couple of days /.
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll have *-1 to see how the <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese</COREF> and <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Russians</COREF> react to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> *T*-2 /.
but <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> view is that the six parties <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">the five parties</COREF> ought *-1 to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be *PRO* to use the combined leverage of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> and <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Russia 's</COREF> of <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">South Korea</COREF> <COREF ID="277" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">force</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> back to <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the negotiating table</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's the certainly the best policy for <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> /.
Force <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> back to <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the negotiating table</COREF> /.
there are many *ICH*-1 as <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">you</COREF> know *?* <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">Mister Ambassador</COREF> who *T*-2 believe 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> did <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">this launch</COREF> on <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the fourth of July</COREF> *PRO*-3 to get <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> attention Because <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> saw the way 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were treating <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> differently than <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were treating <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> *T*-4 /.
Here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">one Nicholas Burns</COREF> on National Public Radio /.
With <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> has made <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">an offer</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are willing *PRO*-1 to sit down and negotiate with <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">the Iranians</COREF> *PRO* assuming *RNR*-2 and contingent upon *RNR*-2 <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> suspension of <COREF ID="333" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> nuclear activities at <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> plant in the in <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF></COREF> /.
Why *PRO* not sit down in the same way with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Koreans</COREF> Say to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO* stop *-1 developing <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> program</COREF> *T*-2 /.
and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll sit down with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> one on one /.
Well <COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're trying *PRO*-1 to sit down with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> in the context of <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the six party talks</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've been saying for months now that the right step forward is for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> to return to <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">these talks</COREF> /.
but <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really do n't see the logic in *PRO* turning this into a test of wills between <COREF ID="261" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">two countries</COREF> <COREF ID="261" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF></COREF> /.
The fact is that <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> has <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">the same interest as <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> should have <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">the same interest</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is *PRO* to stop <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> nuclear program</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="276" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Our allies</COREF> <COREF ID="276" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="277" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> and <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">South Korea</COREF></COREF> have the same interests /.
and <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> do as well /.
And so <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're far better off *PRO*-1 working within the framework of <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the six party talks</COREF> because you get in <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">that process</COREF> the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> of <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">all these different countries</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">I</COREF> simply do n't see why it *EXP*-1 's in the interest of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> *PRO* to get <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">those countries</COREF> out of the way and only deal with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> directly *T*-2 /.
So the problem here is not the lack of discussion between <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're perfectly willing *PRO*-1 to sit down with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">that six party environment</COREF> /.
and in that sense it 's analogous to what <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're trying *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 with <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Secretary Rice</COREF> announced about a month ago that should <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">the Iranians</COREF> meet the condition of suspension of <COREF ID="333" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own nuclear activities</COREF> <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd be willing *PRO*-1 to sit down in <COREF ID="336" TYPE="IDENT">another multilateral forum</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="336" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's with the Europeans and <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Russians</COREF> and <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese</COREF> /.
So really you know <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> problem</COREF> is not a problem just for <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> /.
What <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *T*-1 the other day on <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">July fourth</COREF> was *PRO* to disrupt the peace and harmony of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> relations with <COREF ID="354" TYPE="IDENT">the Asian countries</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="354" TYPE="IDENT">the Asian countries</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to be involved *-2 in <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">these negotiations</COREF> /.
Is it *EXP*-1 the policy of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd like *PRO*-2 to see regime change in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> /?
Well <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is one of the most despotic regimes in the world /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a major human rights violator /.
There 's massive famine /.
And certainly <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> hope for the day *ICH*-1 will come when those people will live in peace and be governed *-2 by a different type of government *T*-3 /.
Uh what <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've got *-1 to do *T*-2 now of course is *PRO* focus on <COREF ID="393" TYPE="IDENT">the most immediate problem</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="393" TYPE="IDENT">that problem</COREF> is nuclear weapons /.
<COREF ID="393" TYPE="IDENT">The problem</COREF> is <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the ballistic launches of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the other day</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">I</COREF> think the thing 0 *PRO* to remember *T*-1 about <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">those launches</COREF> by the way <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were provocative , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were reckless , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were also unsuccessful /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> fired <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060709_215800.part-2-E10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">four scud missiles</COREF> <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060709_215800.part-2-E10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">intermediate range missiles</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="418" TYPE="IDENT">fire</COREF> <COREF ID="419" TYPE="IDENT">the longer range missile the</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="418" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was spectacularly unsuccessful /.
<COREF ID="419" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> crashed in the sea of Japan /.
So <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> obviously have an opportunity now for diplomacy . And an opportunity *PRO* to <COREF ID="438" TYPE="IDENT">use</COREF> the combined strength of <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">all these countries</COREF> *PRO*-1 to provide some leverage put some leverage against <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> /.

Oh <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was coincidental /.
You know it 's a -- <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a very unreliable and unpredictable regime /.
The last thing 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 is react to every wild statement that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> make *T*-3 /.

Uh but what <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've got *-1 to realize *T*-2 is there is no magic bullet here /.
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ca n't just think that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">sit</COREF> down with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> alone /.
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> does n't work for <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> /.

For thirteen years <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the North Korean dictatorship</COREF> has lied and hunkered down and continued *-1 to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles /.

Well uh with all due respect to <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">Speaker Gingrich</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are on <COREF ID="251" TYPE="IDENT">a course which *T*-1 has a reasonable chance of success</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have countries with us united with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> who *T*-1 can apply the same type of pressure /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">I</COREF> will say this what <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> have done *T*-1 over the past week is going *-2 to give a lot of strength in <COREF ID="288" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> efforts *PRO* to develop a missile defense system</COREF> /.

By more than one criteria indeed strategic successes on the <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> watch outshine those from its during the Clinton years /.

<COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have not given up on on on this quest *PRO* to come to the end of <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">these negotiations</COREF> and put <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> back into a place where <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can no longer be a threat to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> neighbors or to <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> *T*-1 /.
But again it 's the tone and the rhetoric /.
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">me</COREF> go back and review some of the things 0 <COREF ID="m_36" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_Bush">the President</COREF> has said *T*-1 about <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">Kim Jong - Il of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_36" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_Bush">I</COREF> loathe <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">Kim Jong - Il</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_36" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_Bush">I</COREF> got a visceral reaction to <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> /.
And then in two thousand four there 's <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">a tyrant in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> that *T*-1 wants *PRO*-2 to develop a nuclear weapon</COREF> /.
And then this in <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">two thousand two</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_36" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_Bush">the President</COREF> called <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 a pygmy And compared <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to a spoiled child at a dinner table /.
Does <COREF ID="m_36" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_Bush">the President</COREF> still believe that <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">Kim Jong - Il</COREF> is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /.
<COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">Kim Jong - Il</COREF> is a -- is a despot /.
And <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is someone who *T*-1 is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="262" TYPE="IDENT">these missile tests the other day</COREF> were certainly reckless /.
<COREF ID="262" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were provocative /.
And so uh <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have n't changed <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> opinion of the nature of <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060709_215800.part-5-E6" TYPE="IDENT">the regime in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF></COREF> /.
No one in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> government has *?* /.
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are very clear - eyed about who <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060709_215800.part-5-E6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *T*-1 , what <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060709_215800.part-5-E6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> represent *T*-2 , how much <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060709_215800.part-5-E6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've denied <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060709_215800.part-5-E6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own people the basic human rights that people should have *T*-3 around <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> *T*-4 /.
And <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're focused on this nuclear question as well /.
So <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">I</COREF> think 0 there 's been a lot of continuity over <COREF ID="295" TYPE="IDENT">American policy</COREF> both in the substance of <COREF ID="295" TYPE="IDENT">the policy</COREF> and in the way 0 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've talked about <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> over the last several years *T*-1 /.

And <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">both of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">those countries</COREF></COREF> have clearly miscalculated <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own situation /.
Now <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> felt <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">I</COREF> guess 0 *?* that by *PRO* testing these ballistic missiles <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would somehow put <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> in a position of greater weight in the negotiations /.
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 've miscalculated because you 've seen very tough statements from <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese</COREF> and <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> and the South Koreans and the Japanese against what <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've done *T*-1 /.

<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">The Iranians</COREF> have miscalculated /.
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> fou- thought that <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could divide <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> from both <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> European allies</COREF> and from <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> /.

Frankly <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Nicholas_Burns">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">both of these countries</COREF> are rather cornered and isolated /.
There are very few countries defending <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.

and it *EXP*-1 's important that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> be an ingredient of course in diplomacy /.
But the real levers on Kim Jong - Il are <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese</COREF> and <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the South Koreans</COREF></COREF> /.

<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> started *-1 cheating in the late nineties by *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">getting</COREF> <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">some gas centrifuge equipment</COREF> from Pakistan /.
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do n't know a lot about <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> where <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-1 whether <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the equipment</COREF> has been put *-2 together /.
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> think 0 over a period of time <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll do what the Pakistanis did *T*-1 , what the Iranians appear *-2 to be wanting *PRO*-3 to do *T*-4 and put together this gas centrifuge /.

Or <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've gotten there yet /.

<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> absolutely <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">cheated</COREF> /.
There 's no question about <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
But really really you ought *-1 to be clear *ICH*-3 here what *T*-2 's happened /.
There was <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">a nuclear weapons program that *T*-1 was stopped *-2</COREF> /.
Plutonium production was stopped *-1 /.
Right /.
And afterwards tragically <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">I</COREF> believe *T*-3 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">that agreement which *T*-1 locked <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> up</COREF> was allowed *-2 to collapse /.
And <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> find <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> now with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> accumulating plutonium a bomb 's worth a year /.
And *PRO* freed up <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">that plutonium that *T*-1 was um controlled *-2 for that period of time</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd have *-1 to estimate about five more /.
And with each passing day <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">I</COREF> would argue to you 0 *PRO* more important than <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">that missile that Ash would take *T*-1 out on the gantry if <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> turns up again</COREF> with each passing day <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-2 to find <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> more and more closer *ICH*-3 than <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were *?* before to the day where <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">that material</COREF> could be transferred or sold *-4 to Al - Queda *T*-5 *PRO* Presenting a threat far greater than the threat that *T*-6 is posed *-7 to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> by nuclear weapons aboard ballistic missiles /.

<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> know the return address /.
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do *?* /.
But with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against United Airlines or American Airlines Or a bus or a truck /.
And deterrents does n't work terribly well when <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">an enemy</COREF> values your death more than <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life *T*-1 /.
So no defense no deterrents /.
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *-1 to lock up <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the nuclear program</COREF> /.
You would not care about the ballistic missile program if <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did not have <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the nuclear weapons program</COREF> /.

if <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going *-1 to cheat what good are <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> *T*-2 /?
Madeline Albright essentially had it correct in <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">my</COREF> view /.
You make a deal /.
Nobody did <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">that deal</COREF> in ninety four *PRO*-1 thinking 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were trusting <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">North Koreans</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> caught <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 cheating /.
You might make another deal /.

If the answer to <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the former</COREF> is yes you do <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the deal</COREF> /.
You do n't +ask <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">I</COREF> think the simple question have <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> fooled <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> before /.

Well I I <COREF ID="m_55" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ashton_Carter">I</COREF> 'm concerned that <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're thinking that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're giving a new meaning to the word intolerable Because <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> keep doing <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">things that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> say 0 *T*-1 are intolerable</COREF> and then <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">tolerate</COREF> <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's why <COREF ID="m_55" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ashton_Carter">I</COREF> think 0 at some point you have *-1 to draw the line with <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="m_55" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ashton_Carter">I</COREF> do think and I here <COREF ID="m_55" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ashton_Carter">I</COREF> agree with both of the other gentlemen 0 <COREF ID="m_62" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">you</COREF> have *T*-1 on the show who *T*-2 have shown 0 it *EXP*-3 's possible *PRO* to reach an agreement with <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> and to get agreements that *T*-4 serve <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> interests <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">The much maligned agreed framework</COREF> 0 as <COREF ID="m_45" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">Bob Galluci</COREF> pointed out *?* without <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">that agreed framework</COREF> <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons /.
So <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were better off with <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the agreement</COREF> than without <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
It *EXP*-1 is possible *PRO* to reach agreement with <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> But not when <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> see the kind of footage that <COREF ID="m_62" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">you</COREF> uh showed *T*-2 Which *T*-3 is uh uh uh <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Americans</COREF> drawing <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">a line</COREF> in the sand and then stepping back from <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">that line</COREF> And drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back *T*-4 /.
<COREF ID="m_55" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ashton_Carter">I</COREF> think 0 our our <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> diplomacy</COREF> has *-1 to have carrots in <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> but <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has *-2 to stand somewhere /.

<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Governor_Richardson">Governor Richardson</COREF> *PRO* draw a line in the stand and step back /.
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> watch <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> observe <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know what <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own has been *T*-1 /.
How do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Governor_Richardson">you</COREF> have any strength in *PRO* negotiating with people like <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *T*-1 /?
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">The North Koreans</COREF> in <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Governor_Richardson">my</COREF> dealings with <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> care more *ICH*-1 about form than <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do substance /.
In <COREF ID="m_62" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">your</COREF> earlier segment <COREF ID="m_62" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">you</COREF> showed <COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_Bush">president Bush</COREF> calling <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 a tyrant /.
But then later <COREF ID="m_54" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_Bush">he</COREF> <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">called</COREF> <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Kim Jong - Il</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Governor_Richardson">I</COREF> was in <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> when <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> happened *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">The North Koreans</COREF> were delighted *-1 because <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> felt 0 <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'd been treated *-2 with respect /.
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> care deeply about protocol /.
And this is another reason why <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Governor_Richardson">I</COREF> think 0 for a relatively cheap price a face to face negotiation at the level of <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">Chris Hill who *T*-1 again is very competent</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Governor_Richardson">I</COREF> believe 0 *?* would set the stage for a final agreement at the six party talks Which *T*-2 is essential Which *T*-3 is basically a good agreement *T*-4 /.
In exchange for <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> dismantling <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> nuclear weapons <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> missiles <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get an armistice agreement where <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are not attacked *-1 *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get food fuel energy assistance /.
<COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">Security assurances 0 <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will not topple <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their regime</COREF> /.</COREF>
<COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's right /.
yeah <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's right /.
That 's in -- <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's in that September agreement that <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">Chris Hill</COREF> negotiated *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Governor_Richardson">My</COREF> point is if it 's just going *-1 to be <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT">a face to face meeting that *T*-2 serves as a precursor that *T*-3 also deals with <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">this frozen assets issue</COREF> which *T*-4 has directly hit <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the North Korean regime</COREF> cause <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> controls the foreign expenditures of <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">Kim Jong - Il</COREF></COREF> and you deal with <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">this light water reactor</COREF> especially now after <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've promised <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> and economic incentives to <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Governor_Richardson">I</COREF> think 0 the timing is right for <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT">this new stage of direct negotiation</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_45" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">Ambassador Galluci</COREF> based on <COREF ID="m_45" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">your</COREF> experience do <COREF ID="m_45" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">you</COREF> believe 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> would give up <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> nuclear program give up <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> nuclear bombs which <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">believe</COREF> in <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mind 0 *T*-1 is an insurance policy against an American invasion for economic assistance light water reactors /?
At the end of the day <COREF ID="m_45" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">I</COREF> do n't know /.
Um but <COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> leaves <COREF ID="m_45" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">me</COREF> *PRO*-1 to conclude since <COREF ID="m_45" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Robert_Gallucci">I</COREF> really do n't know that it *EXP*-2 's a good idea *PRO* to find out /.
It *EXP*-1 's a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four *PRO* to do <COREF ID="310" TYPE="IDENT">a deal with <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Noth North</COREF> that *T*-2 required <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-3 to give up <COREF ID="308" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> did <COREF ID="310" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
and for a period of years <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were in a position 0 *PRO* to monitor <COREF ID="310" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> closely *T*-1 /.
and <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did give <COREF ID="308" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up /.
Indeed you can make an argument that while the centrifuge program with the Pakistanis is clearly cheating *PRO* was n't yet a genuine nuclear weapons program had n't produced anything and probably still has n't produced anything /.
So you have the possibility if <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the North Koreans</COREF> are thinking the way 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may be thinking *T*-1 that <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need one or the other , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need either nuclear weapons *PRO*-4 to deter <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> from regime change or <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need a relationship with <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> that *T*-2 makes it *EXP*-3 unnecessary for <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to have <COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT">nuclear weapons</COREF> /.
The only way 0 *PRO* to find out whether <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll ultimately give up <COREF ID="361" TYPE="IDENT">those weapons</COREF> *T*-1 is *PRO* to do a deal /.
