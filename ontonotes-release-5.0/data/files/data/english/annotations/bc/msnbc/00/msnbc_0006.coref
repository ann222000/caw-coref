Tim Russert will be back next week at <COREF ID="248" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a special earlier time</COREF> <COREF ID="248" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">eight am Eastern</COREF> right before the Wimbledon finals /.
The evidence is the evidence /.
The tapes are the tapes /.
I think 0 <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">Pam</COREF> would just be convicted *-1 again /.
For <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">William Smart</COREF> to this day <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">the murder of <COREF ID="268" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son</COREF></COREF> still does n't make sense /.
In <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> office hangs *T*-1 <COREF ID="268" TYPE="IDENT">Greg 's</COREF> wedding picture minus <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">Pam</COREF> /.
This was all -- could have been prevented *-1 by a +cirple certain little divorce decree /.
If <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">she</COREF> wanted a divorce and <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">she</COREF> wanted out of the marriage all 0 <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">she</COREF> had *-1 to do *T*-2 was go to an attorney and get a divorce /.
It was n't a matter of *PRO* murdering your spouse /.
<COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">This woman</COREF> is very wrong /.
And I hope to God 0 <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">she</COREF> stays in there And lives a long long time /.
<COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> have peace in <COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">my</COREF> heart</COREF> *PRO*-1 knowing that I 'm not -- <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> was n't involved *-2 in <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> except that for you know the relationship *ICH*-4 that <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> had *T*-3 with <COREF ID="311" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Flin</COREF> which <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> 've already <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> believe 0 *?* you know put ju- <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">myself</COREF> through enough behind /.
But I <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> just do n't feel that I w- I when <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> look in the mirror in the morning *T*-1 that <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> hate who <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> see *T*-2 /.
Because now <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> 'm this evil person who you know *T*-1 did all this /.
And it 's -- no <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> do n't *?* /.
<COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> have peace in <COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">my</COREF> heart</COREF> /.
But you know 0 <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> felt a lot of anguish in <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">my</COREF> life</COREF> *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="344" TYPE="IDENT">being</COREF> incarcerated *-2 /.
<COREF ID="344" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has n't been easy /.
For now it appears that <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">Pamela Smart</COREF> will <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT">spend</COREF> the rest of <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">her</COREF> life</COREF> behind bars /.
Just recently <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">she</COREF> reflected on <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> with MSNBC 's Rita Cosbey /.
Sometimes <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> think a- about <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> think like what if <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> really never got out of here /?
Am I going to -- <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> mean uh how am <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> going *-1 to do <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> *T*-2 /?

And other days <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="m_5" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Pam_Smart">I</COREF> ca n't *?* /.
As for the four young men <COREF ID="311" TYPE="IDENT">Billy Flin</COREF> and Patric Randell will not be eligible for parole until two thousand eighteen /.

But first <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">Senator McConnell</COREF> and <COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">Senator Schumer</COREF></COREF> welcome <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">both</COREF> /.
In <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">a major rebuke this week to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the White house</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> ruled that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> has *-1 to abide by <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva convention</COREF> and the uniform code of military justice when *PRO*-1 handling detainees *T*-2 uh And ruled that the military tribunals can not be the /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">Senator McConnell</COREF> in addition to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> the New York Times editors wrote in reaction to <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court 's</COREF> decision striking down the military tribunal set * up to private <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">detainees being held * in <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo bay</COREF></COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is far more than a narrow ruling on the issue of military courts . <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is an important and welcome reaffirmation That even in times of war <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> is what <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> the statuette books and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva convention</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-1 . Not what <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> wants <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to be *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">Senator</COREF> in a broader sense is n't <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> a a real rebuke out of repudiation of the broad authority That <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> 's been claiming *T*-1 since <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">nine eleven</COREF> /?
Well first and most importantly <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the decision</COREF> did not require <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> *PRO*-1 to release <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the prisoners at <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF></COREF> /.
Nor did <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> require <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> *PRO*-1 to close <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> /.
Correct /.
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> said that uh in order *PRO* to try <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">these individuals</COREF> by an appropriate thing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 would be for <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> to get <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> uh to create military commission /.
Or there were two other options Both of which <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 *?* *T*-1 were clearly unacceptable /.
So what <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> will be doing *T*-1 is creating <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">military commission</COREF> /.
And second a very disturbing aspect of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the decision</COREF> was that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">held</COREF> uh common article three of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva convention</COREF> applicable to um American service men /.
And <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> means that American service men potentially can be accused *-1 of war crimes /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> is going *-1 to want *PRO*-2 to deal with <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> as well when <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">enacts</COREF> <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">these military commissions</COREF> *T*-3 /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *-1 to do <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> soon /.
uh and so <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll be dealing with <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> in the coming weeks /.
You <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">you</COREF> have time /?
you won- -- <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">you</COREF> 're going off now /?
Are <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">you</COREF> off now /?
There 's nothing more important than <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think uh 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will have *-1 to act on <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> very soon either in July or in September Certainly uh in the next couple of months /.
<COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">Senator Schumer</COREF> will <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> be a bipartisan effort /?
And can you agree on the fix /?
<COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will *?* /.
uh Look *PRO* let 's face it <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">Andrea</COREF> /.
The world is a different place /.
And in <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">this war on terrorism</COREF> you do n't have set battlefields /.
You do n't have the enemy wearing uniforms /.
So *PRO* to <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">change</COREF> things <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is a good idea /.
The problem is <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">this White House</COREF> has felt 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could just change things unilateral Against <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF> against the systems of checks and balances /.
Had <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> come to <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> a few years on this a few years ago on <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> <COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">my</COREF> guess is <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would have gotten most of what <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wanted *T*-1 /.
But what *T*-1 's happened here , because there is such a view that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's</COREF> power is infinite and unchecked by anybody first time ever 0 a President has had those kinds of views *T*-2 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> keep running into brick walls In this case a Supreme Court that *T*-3 has generally been sympathetic to executive power /.
And so we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to not only look at <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> /.
We 're going *-1 to have *-2 to go back to the other issues as well Because <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this ruling</COREF> undercuts some of the other things 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> has done *T*-3 /.
But on *PRO* giving <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> what <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs *T*-1 and giving <COREF ID="567" TYPE="IDENT">our country</COREF> what <COREF ID="567" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to fight <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> there 's going *-4 to be g- agreement /.
Well *PRO* let 's break it down here Because <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this ruling</COREF> does indicate to some human rights groups that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> applies to the prisoners in secret CIA prisons to the prisoners in Afghanistan Beyond <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> /.
Are we going *-1 to see a flood of habeas corpus petitions now <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">Senator McConnell</COREF> /?
Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 clearly <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've got *-1 to act /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> 'm pleased *PRO*-1 to hear that <COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">Chuck</COREF> thinks that <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> may be able *PRO*-2 to do <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> on a bipartisan basis /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-1 is important *PRO* to note that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">this president</COREF> has n't done anything with regard to enemy combatants that *T*-2 have been done *-3 -- that *T*-4 had n't been done *-5 by previous presidents /.
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">The Court</COREF> now has stepped into a -- eh eh into the field And said 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> must <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">create</COREF> <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">these commissions</COREF> /.
Well <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're happy *PRO*-1 to do <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> 'm hopeful 0 <COREF ID="294" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 'll be done *-1 on a bipartisan basis /.
But <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-1 to pass something that *T*-2 's going *-3 to have <COREF ID="306" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="567" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> military servicemen</COREF> uh subject uh to some kind of international rules /.
Of course not /.
But <COREF ID="567" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are signatories to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva Conventions</COREF> /.
Why should n't <COREF ID="306" TYPE="IDENT">our servicemen</COREF> be *T*-1 /-
But the -- but the -- but the enemy is not a signatory to the -- to the -- to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva Conventions</COREF> /.
So why should <COREF ID="318" TYPE="IDENT">these uh terrorists</COREF> uh be subjected *-1 uh to something 0 <COREF ID="318" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not signatories to *T*-2 *T*-3 /?
The good news <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">Andrea</COREF> is that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Court</COREF> particularly Breyer 's decision said 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> could change <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> <COREF ID="347" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> *-1 to <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">change</COREF> <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> do n't think 0 there 's disagreement on <COREF ID="347" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will *?* /.
Security and liberty have <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">a tenuous and careful balance in <COREF ID="567" TYPE="IDENT">this republic</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> changes from time to time And should *?* /.
But the problem here again /-
<COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">you</COREF> 're right /.
There 're going *-1 to be hundreds of court petitions /.
<COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is going *-1 to create huge discombobulation /.
We 're going *-1 to be far worse off than if <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> had come to <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> originally and gotten <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> done *-2 /.
But this view -- and <COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> do n't agree with <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">Mitch</COREF> here This view that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> has the sole right based * on a -- the use of military force doctrine when none of this was even discussed or mentioned *-1 *T*-2 <COREF ID="390" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> the wrong view /.
and <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> said <COREF ID="390" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">Andrea</COREF> could <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> just /-
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">Senator McConnell</COREF> should <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> now just be closed *-1 /?
No <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> d- <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> /-
Because <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's just been such a black eye diplomatically /.
What are we -- what are we going *-1 to do *T*-2 with <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> mean we want them to free <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> so <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can come *PRO*-1 kill us again /?
Look I <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> is very very likely *PRO*-1 to give <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> exactly what <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to continue *-4 to fight <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> /.
And it *EXP*-1 's important for all of us to remember that we have n't been <COREF ID="431" TYPE="IDENT">attacked</COREF> *-2 again here at home again since <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">nine eleven</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="431" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's not an accident /.
<COREF ID="431" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's not an accident /.
The policies that we 've pursued *T*-1 are protecting us here at home /.
But is <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Court</COREF> ruling</COREF> a strong signal *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should now agree with <COREF ID="448" TYPE="IDENT">Senator McCain</COREF> Senator Lindsey Graham and and others in your party who *T*-2 believe that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should go in -- go along with <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva Convention</COREF> in terms of rules of the road for <COREF ID="306" TYPE="IDENT">our soldiers</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> is going *-1 to be very reluctant *PRO*-2 to subject American military people to potential war crimes uh violations /.
So <COREF ID="448" TYPE="IDENT">John McCain</COREF> is wrong on this /?
Well we 'll see /.
We 're going to have -- w- <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're looking for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> advice about what <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to fight <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">My</COREF> guess is that <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> is very likely *PRO*-1 to give <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> what <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs *T*-2 the tools 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs *T*-3 *PRO*-4 to protect us here at home /.
<COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> do n't think 0 it 's quite that simple /.
<COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> think that there will be a careful looking again at what certain due process elements *ICH*-2 are *T*-1 that <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF> and <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> has required *T*-3 in the past /.
But *PRO* giving <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> the tool 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs *T*-1 yes /.
But there 's one other thing that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be done *-3 <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">Andrea</COREF> given the sweeping nature of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this decision</COREF> not so much on the specifics of what *T*-4 can be done *-5 But on how it ought *-6 to be done *-7 *T*-8 /.
I think -- I 've -- <COREF ID="m_53" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> 've sent a letter *ICH*-1 today to Attorney General Gonzales asking that they do a review *ICH*-2 now in light of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this decision</COREF> of all their other abrogations of power So we avoid this mess again two years later on these other issues Whether it 's wire taps or anything else Where <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> just said unilaterally <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can do whatever <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want *T*-3 *T*-4 /.
That is not how <COREF ID="567" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> works *T*-1 /.

<TEXT PARTNO="003">
Well *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">me</COREF> turn to another controversy which *T*-1 is the battle over <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">national security leaks</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">The House</COREF> voted this week on <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">a resolution condemning the publication by <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> and several other newspapers <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">particularly though The New York Times</COREF></COREF> /.
Now <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the resolution</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">The House of Representatives</COREF> expects the cooperation of all news media organizations in *PRO* protecting the lives of Americans And the capability *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> *PRO* to identify disrupt and capture terrorists by *PRO* not disclosing classified intelligence programs such as <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Representative Peter King</COREF> <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Republican of New York</COREF> said If there is another terror attack the blood will be on <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hands *PRO*-1 Meaning on <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the editors and reporters of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF></COREF> and elsewhere /.
<COREF ID="m_86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_W_Bush">The President</COREF> <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">expressed</COREF> anger over <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
*PRO* Let 's give a listen to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">The disclosure of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">this program</COREF></COREF> is disgraceful /.
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're at war with a bunch of people who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to hurt <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the United States of America</COREF> /.
And for people to <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">leak</COREF> <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">that program</COREF> and for a newspaper to publish <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does great harm to <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the United States of America</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">Senator Schumer</COREF> on January first <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">you</COREF> said that an- about an earlier leak regarding the NSA surveillance that quote Whenever classified information is <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">leaked</COREF> *-1 *T*-3 there ought *-2 to be an investigation because <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could endanger <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> security /.
Right /.
So <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">I</COREF> would presume 0 <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">you</COREF> now would agree with <COREF ID="m_86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_W_Bush">the President</COREF> that <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">this leak</COREF> should also be investigated *-1 /.
Well <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> certainly should be investigated *-1 /.
But <COREF ID="m_86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_W_Bush">the President</COREF> and others have gone way overboard /.
How so /?
um How so /?
Look we believe in a free press in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="360" TYPE="IDENT">The press</COREF> <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> often antagonistic or uh l- probing of people in power /.
We all do n't like <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's part of <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> /.
And as a founding father said *?* when they first wrote the Constitution *T*-1 true to this day <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's a good thing for <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> /.
ther- ec- There are exceptions /.
One is if <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> harms national security /.
Now all of these statements by <COREF ID="m_86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_W_Bush">the President</COREF> and others are jumping the gun /.
We do n't know if <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's harmed national security /.
In fact <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> 've been on <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the Banking Committee</COREF> for six years /.
It is broad public knowledge stated * by administration officials /-
Have <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">you</COREF> been briefed *-1 on <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> have not been briefed *-1 privately on <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">this program</COREF> /.
but we 've had people come before <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the Banking Committee</COREF> uh publicly from <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> and other departments /.
And this is -- <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> has made statements *RNR*-1 , others have made statements *RNR*-1 , that <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> monitor and track terrorist financing /.
It 's been successful /.
Well /.
So that you uh look at the reports , the terrorists do n't use the banks as much /.
So *PRO* to jump out front and just blast a newspaper that <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may not like *T*-1 that to <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">me</COREF> is totally wrong /.
It 's -- it 's the guilty verdict first /.
And the the trial /.
Mitch uh <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Pat Roberts</COREF> has called for <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">an investigation</COREF> /.
Fine *PRO* let <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> be a fair /-
<COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee /.</COREF>
Yeah /.
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> be a fair and down the middle investigation /.
<COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">My</COREF> guess <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> will find that national security was not compromised *-1 a jot /.
Well *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">me</COREF> pick up on /-
because <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> Secretary Snow took a group of reporters on a trip to <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> and other parts of the world *PRO*-1 to show off how <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were tracking <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">terror financing</COREF> *T*-2 /.
So <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">Senator McConnell</COREF> do <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to have it both ways /?
Do <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to brag about <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> success record in *PRO* tracking <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">this financing</COREF> and at the same time yell and scream about <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">the reporters</COREF> when <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> print the source *T*-2 /?
Well look <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">the leaks</COREF> are abominable /.
And printing of <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">the leaks</COREF> is certainly trouble /.
You can talk in general about what <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're doing *T*-1 without *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">revealing</COREF> the specifics /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 we all regret that the -- uh that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the times</COREF> and other publications chose *PRO*-1 to do <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And uh <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="m_86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_W_Bush">the President</COREF> essentially had it correctly /.
Well *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">me</COREF> show you a joint statement that *T*-1 was on the oped pages of <COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">both <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> and The Los Angeles Times</COREF> yesterday /.
The editors of <COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">those newspapers</COREF> wrote the banking articles did not dwell on the operational or technical aspects of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> but on <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sweep The questions about <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> legal basis and the issues of oversight /.
We understand that honorable people may disagree with <COREF ID="293" TYPE="IDENT">any of these choices *PRO* to publish or not to publish</COREF> /.
But *PRO* making <COREF ID="293" TYPE="IDENT">those decisions</COREF> is <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">the responsibility that *T*-1 falls to <COREF ID="313" TYPE="IDENT">editors</COREF></COREF> A corollary to the great gift of our independence /.
<COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is not a responsibility 0 <COREF ID="313" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> take *T*-1 lightly /.
And <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not one 0 <COREF ID="313" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can surrender *T*-1 to <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> /.
After <COREF ID="321" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> in fact <COREF ID="323" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> <COREF ID="327" TYPE="IDENT">attacked</COREF> <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> on <COREF ID="325" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="323" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> editorial pages</COREF> Friday /.
So <COREF ID="327" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was clearly a response to <COREF ID="321" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
uh Even though <COREF ID="323" TYPE="IDENT">the Journal</COREF> had <COREF ID="323" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> published uh the same story about terror financing in <COREF ID="323" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> news columns which *T*-1 is separate from <COREF ID="325" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="323" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> editorial pages</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">Senator McConnell</COREF> has <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> and <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> conservative supporters now embarked *-1 on <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">a calculated campaign *PRO* to demonize <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> and other newspapers but <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">particularly The New York Times</COREF></COREF> as a political calculus because <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 'll help in the midterm elections /?
Look eh eh newspapers are very very important in our -- in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">our country</COREF> /.
The media is important /.
And <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have a free press /.
But <COREF ID="360" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> is not responsible for <COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT">our national security</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's the responsibility of <COREF ID="m_86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_W_Bush">the President</COREF> and the Department of Defense and the other agencies that *T*-1 look after us /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-1 's important for <COREF ID="378" TYPE="IDENT">the leaders of the principle outlets in <COREF ID="360" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF></COREF> to be responsible /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> do n't think uh 0 <COREF ID="386" TYPE="IDENT">this publishing of this kind of information</COREF> is helpful /.
And nor do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Mitch_McConnell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="386" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is necessary uh in um *PRO* doing <COREF ID="378" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> job /.
<COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">Andrea</COREF> *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">me</COREF> say a couple of things /.
First <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">you</COREF> asked about a double standard /.
There clearly is <COREF ID="404" TYPE="IDENT">a double standard</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="404" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's with <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> leak things 0 <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to leak *T*-2 /.
And when the Plame leak came out *T*-1 there was no outrage /.
there was no high dudgeon /.
In fact regardless of the criminal standard which uh special prosecutor Fitzgerald is handling *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 's clear that there were leaks /.
There 's been no punishment no outcry etcetera /.
<COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> mean you ca n't have it both ways And use leaks when you want *PRO*-1 to *T*-2 And do n't use leaks when you do n't *T*-3 /.
But there 's a second point here /.
When it comes to difficult situations and clearly <COREF ID="468" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> now is one *T*-1 And uh <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">this administration</COREF> has a penchant for diversion and scapegoating /.
And here 's *T*-1 the good news the good news for <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> and <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> think the good news in many ways /.
<COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're going *-1 to have *-2 to solve the problem in <COREF ID="468" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're going *-1 to have *-2 to solve the problem in the war on terrorism where <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> is deteriorating right now *T*-3 /.
And <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="480" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> are tired and see through these diversions /.
<COREF ID="480" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> want real solutions /.
<COREF ID="480" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> want real progress /.
*PRO* Let 's talk about real solutions <COREF ID="m_41" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">Senator</COREF> Because Democrats are sharply divided *-1 over <COREF ID="468" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.

*PRO* Let <COREF ID="m_18" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">me</COREF> say this /.
<COREF ID="m_18" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> think 0 what <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> want *T*-1 is for <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060702_215800.part-4-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> to hold <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's</COREF> feet</COREF> to the fire /.
Now <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060702_215800.part-4-E2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did present <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">an alternative</COREF> <COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The one that a vast majority of Democrats *ICH*-2 voted for *T*-1 including some who *T*-3 voted for the other one which *T*-4 said 0 <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was drafted *-5 by Senator Levin and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island</COREF></COREF> /.

But *PRO* make no mistake about it <COREF ID="m_8" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">Andrea</COREF> /.
A minority party in <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060702_215800.part-4-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> has <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">a job</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="m_18" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> think 0 what <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> are most upset about *T*-1 is 0 the Republican Congress is not holding <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's</COREF> feet</COREF> to the fire at all /.
With all due respect But with all due respect when we talk about the politics of this *T*-1 <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Senator Chris Dodd who *T*-2 has said 0 <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's considering *T*-3 running for president</COREF> said that in fact the Kenned- -- *PRO* excuse me <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the Kerry - Feingold amendment</COREF> <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">hurts</COREF> rather than helps <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the Democratic Party</COREF> /.
Oh <COREF ID="m_18" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chuck_Schummer">I</COREF> do n't buy <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">Tom Kean</COREF> said in an interview *RNR*-1 , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *RNR*-1 , <COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT">a very successful program which *T*-2 has been very successfu- successful successful in the war against terror</COREF> has been lost compromised *-3 because of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="379" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will stop cooperation /.

<COREF ID="m_66" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">I</COREF> do n't think so /.

<COREF ID="m_11" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dana_Priest">Dana</COREF> *PRO* let me point out that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Washington Post</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="m_11" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dana_Priest">your</COREF> newspaper</COREF> was behind the others but also did publish this story /.

But <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not a crime /.
Why is n't <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> not a crime *T*-1 /?
Because the framers of the Constitution wanted *PRO*-1 to protect <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> so that <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">perform</COREF> a basic role in government oversight /.

There can be no excuse for anyone entrusted * with <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">vital intelligence</COREF> to leak <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> . And no excuse for any newspaper to print <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">The leaks to The New York Times</COREF> and the publishing of <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">those leaks</COREF> is very damaging /.
What *T*-1 is doubly disturbing for <COREF ID="m_8" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dick_Cheney">me</COREF> is that not only have <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">gone</COREF> forward with these stories but <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been rewarded *-2 for <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> for example in the case of the terrorist surveillance program by *PRO* being <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">awarded</COREF> *-3 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Pulitzer Prize</COREF> for outstanding journalist /.

But in this case uh <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">I</COREF> am certain *RNR*-1 , <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">I</COREF> 'm really certain *RNR*-1 , that the editorial position of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> about the war which <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">I</COREF> completely disagree with *T*-2 did not affect its coverage of the -- of the news /.
*PRO* Let me wa- -- *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">me</COREF> show you <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street Journal</COREF> editorial</COREF> <COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">very unusual editorial</COREF> that *T*-1 was uh in the paper on Friday</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> said that the problem with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> is that millions of Americans no longer believe that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> editors would make those calculations in anything close to good faith /.
We certainly do n't *?* /.
On issue after issue it *EXP*-1 has become clear that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The Times</COREF> believes 0 the US is not really at <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">war</COREF> /.
And in any case the Bush administration lacks le- the legitimacy *PRO* to wage <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">John</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">I</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to really put <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">you</COREF> on the spot here /.
But <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchel">I</COREF> am *?* /.
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Your paper 's</COREF> news columns also ran this story /.
And here you have <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">this editorial</COREF> /.
uh It it really is uh a really sharp conflict /.
Couple of points on that /.
First of all <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">that editorial</COREF> was n't kidding when <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said 0 there <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> a separation between the news and the editorial pages at <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's for sure /.
Same with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.
se- Secondly there is a very large gap between the ideological outlook and philosophy of The <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">New York Times</COREF> editorial page and The <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street Journal</COREF> editorial page /.
There is not a large ideological gap between the news staffs of those two places /.
And why would there be *?* *T*-1 /?
Some of the top people of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> were hired *-1 from <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> /.
What <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">I</COREF> found *T*-1 shocking about <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the editorial</COREF> was the assertion that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> did not <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">act</COREF> in good faith in *PRO*-2 making that judgment /.
<COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">I</COREF> do n't know anybody on the news staff of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> that *T*-1 believes <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">I</COREF> certainly do n't *?* /.

<TEXT PARTNO="014">
*PRO* Let 's turn to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> /.
What *T*-1 is the political fallout <COREF ID="m_38" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">John</COREF> from <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> decision</COREF> /?
is <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> something that *T*-1 can actually work in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> favor because <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> pits <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Court</COREF> according to the talk show hosts the last couple of days on the side of al - Qaeda /?
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's embarrassing uh internationally /.
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> isolates the United States /.
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a setback for <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> +philosophly philosophy /.
Politically <COREF ID="m_38" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could come out ahead on this In part because as we just heard <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer</COREF> say *?* <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the US uh Congress</COREF> is going *-1 to take up very soon <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">legislation giving <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> this authority</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's a good subject 0 for Republicans to be on *T*-1 /.
Dana what is it costing us *T*-1 diplomatically /?
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo /.</COREF>
Huge /.
Which is -- which *T*-1 is the point not just on +Guantanamo <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> But all of these programs /.
You know <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are covering <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a classified war /.
How wha- why are <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> covering <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 /?
Because <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to figure out whether <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is going *-2 to achieve <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> strategic goals which *T*-3 is *PRO* to defeat terrorism and to compete in the realm of ideology /.
It 's not just the tactical question /.
And on <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> has cost us a lot internationally as a defender a primary defender of human rights /.
And you have *-1 to take those things into consideration when you 're trying *PRO*-2 to win a war *T*-3 /.
<COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">Bill Safire</COREF> should <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> take this as a cue *PRO* to just shut <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> or accept the John McCain approach now towards /?
No <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">I</COREF> think uh 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> should follow what the -- the guideline that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> has suggested *T*-1 which *T*-2 is *PRO* go to <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> and and get some kind of solid guidelines on what *T*-3 should happen /.
Wonderful thing here /.
Really a wonderful thing in the last week /.
Here 's *T*-3 a Supreme Court which *T*-1 put <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">George W Bush</COREF> in the presidency uh only six years ago Now pulling <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> up short and saying hey <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> got *-2 to get some oversight /.
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> got *-1 to get some congressional backing uh before <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> can do this kind of thing /.
And as you just saw *?* in the beginning of this program <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">these two senators who *T*-1 disagree about so much</COREF> uh pretty much signaled you bet /.
we 'll -- first we 'll hear from <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll backtrack /.
And <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll say this is what kind of a military commission we need *T*-1 /.
And they 'll keep <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> /.
They 'll keep uh the most dangerous terrorists there /.
And we 'll have these military commissions /.
And uh they 'll set a good pattern for the next president And hopefully not the next war /.
Andrea the other thing 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> does *T*-1 politically is underscore the arguments of conservatives of why it *EXP*-2 's important *PRO* to change <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Court</COREF> *T*-3 /.
You had Scalia Thomas Alito siding with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> was saying we need some more conservatives /.
The last word to <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Bennett">you</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Bennett">Bill Bennett</COREF> /.
We only have about fifteen thirty seconds /.
Yeah <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Bennett">I</COREF> agree with <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">Bill Safire</COREF> /.
It 's in uh in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Congress 's</COREF> court now /.
And <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need *-1 to act on it /.
But <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Bennett">I</COREF> do n't agree with <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">Bill Safire</COREF> that <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> has a right *PRO* not to give testimony in a criminal trial /.
<COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are not above the law /.
And when you show your Pentagon Papers case *T*-1 please *PRO* read Black- <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Justice Blackmail 's</COREF> decision /.
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said no prior restraint /.
But if people get hurt *-1 , if people get killed *-2 as a result of this <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> is responsible /.
So the issue is whether people are hurt *-1 by something that *T*-2 had arguably been previously disclosed *-3 /.
That 's correct /.
<COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">I</COREF> disagree completely /.
You 're not above the law /.
<COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Safire">I</COREF> will respect <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Bill_Bennett">his</COREF> right *PRO* to disagree /.
Okay /.
Well we are going *-1 to have *-2 to leave it there /.
Happy Independence Day on these themes of July fourth and our founders /.
*PRO* Thank you all /.

And <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are back /.
On Sunday morning June thirteenth nineteen seventy one <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the front page of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF></COREF> featured a photo of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">a smiling President Nixon</COREF> escorting <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> daughter</COREF> <COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tricia</COREF></COREF> on <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> wedding day /.
But the middle of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the front page</COREF> contained a story that *T*-1 through a strange chain of events would lead to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">a landmark <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060702_215800.part-15-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> case on press freedoms</COREF> And eventually to the Watergate scandal and <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Nixon 's</COREF> own resignation /.
The headline read Vietnam Archive Pentagon Study Traces three Decades of Growing US Involvement /.
The person who *T*-1 leaked <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the classified Pentagon Papers</COREF> to <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> was <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Daniel_Ellsberg">defense analyst Daniel Ellsberg</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Daniel_Ellsberg">He</COREF> appeared on <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Meet The Press</COREF> several years later /.

<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Daniel_Ellsberg">Mr. Ellsberg</COREF> wise men made the point *ICH*-1 centuries ago that liberty without order is anarchy /.
