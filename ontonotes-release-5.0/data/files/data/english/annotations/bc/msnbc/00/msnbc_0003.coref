<COREF ID="m_29" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Christopher_Dodd">I</COREF> just do n't think 0 <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can do a very good job there /.
<COREF ID="m_29" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Christopher_Dodd">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going *-1 to hurt <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> more importantly going *-1 to hurt the country /.
<COREF ID="m_29" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Christopher_Dodd">I</COREF> think 0 the nomination is a -- is a bad one /.

<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">NBC 's David Gregory</COREF> is at the White House /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">David</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">you</COREF> know <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> does n't <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> run the risk of *PRO*-1 looking like <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">the little rich kid who *T*-2 is not winning the game so <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says it 's <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> ball</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm going home with <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /?
Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">I</COREF> have a theory about <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">Chris</COREF> which *T*-1 is that every time 0 somebody accuses <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> about *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">being</COREF> abrasive or abusive to subordinates or you know difficult 0 *PRO* to work with *T*-3 as somebody who *T*-4 is just going *-5 to break all the china in the place *T*-7 <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> says oh yeah <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is why <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> like <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">the guy</COREF> *T*-6 /.
<COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is exactly what <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *T*-8 at <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> /.
And I 'm -- <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">I</COREF> 'm only half kidding /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">I</COREF> really think that <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is a big part of <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> that <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> uh yes <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may be ruffling feathers here but he does n't mind if he -- *PRO* to <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">deal</COREF> with <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to do <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in a pretty hardline way /.
But it uh but does n't -- well *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">you</COREF> this about the nature of <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the appointment</COREF> because <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can only be appointed *-1 through uh the beginning of the next session of Congress which *T*-2 is in early oh seven it 's really only a year and a few months /.
how can <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> really be a permanent representative and have the stature of one *T*-1 /?
Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's a big question /.
Uh I me- <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is a question that *T*-1 was posed *-2 to the <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> secretary - general <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">I</COREF> mean the bottom line is that <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> has got some time 0 *PRO* to work with <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has a year up there /.
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> knows 0 <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has got you know <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> authority /.
<COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">Everybody up there in New York</COREF> understands that *ICH*-1 as well that <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can push the the US agenda /.
And then we 'll see what *T*-1 happens /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">I</COREF> mean if <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can prove to some Democrats that uh <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can work well with others up there perhaps <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="306" TYPE="IDENT">changes</COREF> some minds /.
Maybe that 's -- uh <COREF ID="306" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not going *-1 to happen /.
but the bottom line this is that <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is not an administration that *T*-2 thinks very highly of <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> /.
and the only real engagement 0 <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want *PRO*-3 to have *T*-4 at <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> is *PRO* to try *PRO*-5 to <COREF ID="329" TYPE="IDENT">clean</COREF> <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the place</COREF> up /.
And so <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT">going</COREF> *-1 to stand by <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">the guy 0 <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think who *T*-2 can really do <COREF ID="329" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF></COREF> /.
and this is very much a statement that <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> was not going *-3 to be deterred *-4 from *PRO*-5 making *T*-6 in terms of <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> views of <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> and how <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ought *-7 to operate *T*-8 /.
How ra- how big a role *ICH*-2 has <COREF ID="346" TYPE="IDENT">the vice president</COREF> had *T*-1 in <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">this appointment</COREF> and <COREF ID="351" TYPE="IDENT">this continuation</COREF> *PRO* to fight for <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to the point of *PRO* naming <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-3 a recess appointment /?
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">I</COREF> think huge /.
And and in fact it 's <COREF ID="346" TYPE="IDENT">the vice president</COREF> who *T*-1 's very close to <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> , who *T*-2 has been a real stalwart for <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> throughout this process /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-1 's perfectly clear that uh that <COREF ID="346" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made the argument *ICH*-2 to <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> that <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do n't wobble on <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> , that <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is an important player in <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> agenda with <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> /.
Okay *PRO* thank <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">you</COREF> very much <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Gregory">David Gregory</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The president</COREF> referred to <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">a handful of Democrats</COREF> /.

who *T*-2 held up <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050801_190000.part-1-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this nomination</COREF> /?
Well the bottom line is that there were fifty - six votes for cloture /.
so the majority of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the United States Senate</COREF> supported *PRO* ending the debate /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton</COREF> would have gotten more than fifty - six votes *PRO*-1 to be confirmed *-2 /.
so a majority of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> supported <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> /.
and in most democracies <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">majorities</COREF> actually get <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way /.
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> procedure allows a minority to block <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050801_190000.part-1-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this nomin- nomination</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *?* /.
<COREF ID="m_48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">Chris</COREF> two other things /.
the bottom line is <COREF ID="m_48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">you</COREF> 're forgetting 0 there 's <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">a conference on <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> reform</COREF> <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">major conference</COREF> September fourteenth through the sixteenth /.

<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is an important period of time /.
We 've been six months without a permanent representative /.

and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">I</COREF> believe 0 *?* did the right thing /.
*PRO* Let 's listen to <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Trent_Lott"><COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050801_190000.part-1-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Senator and former former Majority leader</COREF> <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050801_190000.part-1-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Trent Lott of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Mississippi</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050801_190000.part-1-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the United States senator from <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">that state</COREF></COREF></COREF> /.
Here 's what *ICH*-2 <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Trent_Lott">he</COREF> <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">said</COREF> *T*-1 that <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Trent_Lott">he</COREF> opposed <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the recess appointment of uh <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Trent_Lott">I</COREF> have advised against <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Trent_Lott">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was not confirmed *-1 /.
And if <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went in there <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be limited *-1 to like seventeen months /.

Uh but uh I <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Trent_Lott">I</COREF> would recommend against a recess appointment /.
What do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">you</COREF> make *T*-1 of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">Senator Coleman</COREF> /?

Bottom line is that <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is an important moment /.
<COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">This UN</COREF> is is reeling from the aftermath of the investigation that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've done *T*-1 on oil for food /.
And <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been reeling from from the child prostitution in Africa from the sexual harassment of top <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> personnel /.
<COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> finally understand 0 <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have got *-1 to make change /.
Uh hopefully *PRO* get a John Bolton who *T*-2 can force the Chinese and Zimbabwe and Sudan *PRO*-3 to understand that we have got *-4 to get *PRO*-5 rid *-6 of the odious Human Rights Commission /.
And so the time is now /.
Eh <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush</COREF> is only going *-1 to be in office a couple more years /.
that that that 's how permanent permanent will be *T*-2 /.
Uh <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> will be there during probably the most important time for <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> in many many years /.
Do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">you</COREF> think 0 there 's a value in <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> in *PRO* <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">having</COREF> someone 0 *T*-1 to go up there and just waste the place <COREF ID="m_48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">I</COREF> mean in other words just give tough speeches try *PRO*-2 to humiliate <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> uh try *PRO*-2 to get <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out and get <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> straightened * out by *PRO* just making fun of <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> by *PRO* basically trashing some of those Third World members that *T*-3 have contributed to this uh horror in some of these cases 0 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">you</COREF> mentioned *T*-4 /?
I do n't think anyone -- uh <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">I</COREF> do n't think there 's -- 0 there 's any basis for *PRO* saying 0 <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> is going *-1 to do *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> by the way was a very effective assistant of state /.
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> helped <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> get *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">rid</COREF> *-1 of <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> odious Zionism is racism resolution in nineteen ninety - one when people said 0 <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> could n't be done *-4 *T*-3 /.
So *PRO* do n't underestimate the skill of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> /.
Is there a time 0 *PRO* to be tough *T*-1 /?
Yeah /.
And <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can be tough /.
Is there a time 0 *PRO* to be persuasive *T*-1 /?
Yeah /.
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> can <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> persuasive /.
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's got a record of *PRO*-1 doing <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> officials themselves have said <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
Malloch Brown has said <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
Kofi Annan has said <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
So <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be a mistake *PRO* to simply <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> as a tough guy who *T*-2 is going *-3 to push folks around /.
But <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knows how *PRO* to get things done *-2 *T*-3 /.
<COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">The moment for reform</COREF> is now /.
and if <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> miss <COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">that moment</COREF> shame on <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.

now now <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're at war /.
What did <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">you</COREF> just say *T*-1 /?
Uh <COREF ID="m_37" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">I</COREF> do n't think so /.
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's not going *-1 to happen /.
And the bottom line is that a lot of folks would say 0 <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> has not been as effective as <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should be *?* /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Norm_Coleman">My</COREF> investigation has *shown shown mismanagement at least perhaps corruption at worst /.
Right /.
An- and so there are a lot of folks saying 0 you got *-1 to make change in <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was all about *T*-1 /.
And <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> recognized <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> now /.
<COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's why <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're holding this meeting on <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">reform</COREF> *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's why <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> is going *-1 to be speaking there *T*-2 /.

More *ICH*-1 now on <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the recess appointment of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> to <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF></COREF> /.
NBC <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell"><COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050801_190000.part-6-E8" TYPE="IDENT">NBC News</COREF> chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell</COREF> joins us now /.
<COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">Andrea</COREF> there are two paradigms for <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> ambassador /.
There 's <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Adlai Stevenson</COREF> <COREF ID="33" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the old liberal who *T*-1 really came through during the Cuban Missile Crisis because everybody in the world believed 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was n't a hawk</COREF></COREF> /.
And then there was <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Daniel Patrick Moynihan who *T*-2 went over there and took took on the Third World on issues like uh the issues of anti-Israel sort of rhetoric over there and <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> won those battles</COREF> /.
What *ICH*-2 are we looking at *T*-1 here a smart diplomat or a tough talker /?
<COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">I</COREF> think a tough talker /.
But what <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs *-1 to learn *T*-2 and what <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been warned *-4 about *T*-3 uh from diplomats up there is that you need votes /.
And <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ca n't go in with a mandate *ICH*-2 that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> has given <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-1 *PRO* to shake the place up with some of those pungent sound bites and get along with enough people especially because <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own credibility was really on the line on <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">some of the tough issues that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going *-3 to confront *T*-4 <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> Iraq <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF></COREF> /.
So since <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been accused *-1 of *PRO*-2 twisting the intelligence on <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">exactly those issues</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> needs <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">some allies</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going *-3 to have *-4 to develop <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">those allies</COREF> now /.
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> will have the Brits and some of the other traditional American allies /.
but <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't have a lot of goodwill up there /.
That said *-1 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> has experience /.
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was very successful in a previous incarnation in New York when <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was able *PRO*-1 to defeat the Zionism is racism uh resolution there back then *T*-2 /.
And <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's a smart guy /.
So <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">I</COREF> would n't bet against <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
What about the <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the European *RNR*-1 and the world *RNR*-1 press</COREF> /.
are <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> going *-2 to destroy <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> before <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets started for *PRO*-3 being a recess appointment /?
Sure but <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Kofi Annan</COREF> look does n't have a whole lot of strength <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> especially with critics here in <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> /.
So while <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would like *PRO*-1 to warn <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> as <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did today that there are a hundred ninety other representatives <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> has a certain special clout /.
and <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Annan</COREF> is going *-2 to have *-3 to listen to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">I</COREF> guess that if <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton</COREF> had not said some of the things that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had said *T*-1 in the past that you know the UN secretariat has <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">thirty - eight floors</COREF> and you could lose ten of <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> without *PRO* losing anything those kinds of quotes are going *-2 to kind of haunt <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
Do <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">you</COREF> think 0 there 's any danger in the world of *PRO* causing a real war in <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> *ICH*-1 again another Korean war by *PRO* calling <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">the North Korean dictator</COREF> *PRO*-2 what <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is *T*-3 /?
I mean <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> calls <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 a tyrannical dictator /.
and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says he 's -- it 's a <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">nightmare</COREF> all over there /.
all true /.
But here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">a guy on Jack Daniels most of the time in a world of delusion</COREF> /.
Is there any chance 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might just rattle <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">that cage</COREF> too hard /?
Well actually <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">Condi Rice <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF></COREF> in <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> own confirmation hearing had <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">rattled</COREF> <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">that cage</COREF> /.
And they 've walked way back from <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
What <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">Rice</COREF> is proving *T*-1 as secretary is that <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's much more pragmatic *ICH*-3 *ICH*-2 as secretary of state than <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was a national security adviser on <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> and on <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> /.
So <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's taken this this posture <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's reflecting <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> view as *PRO* adjusted *-1 for second term and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton</COREF> is going *-2 to have *-3 to follow that line /.
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> ca n't really go off on <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own /.
And if <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does *?* <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 'll reel <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> right back in /.
How many months before <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">Condi Rice</COREF> has *-1 to apologize or defend uh <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> language /?
Maybe two /.
Okay *PRO* thank <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">you</COREF> very much <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Andrea_Mitchell">Andrea Mitchell</COREF> /.

Um and when you 're wearing like <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> was *?* twenty - five pounds of body armor um and sweating through your clothes and trying *PRO*-1 to stay hydrated um in the middle of a sandstorm um where we were trapped *-2 on a couple of different occasions *T*-3 *T*-4 it was pretty grueling tough work and an assignment that *T*-5 made <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">me</COREF> have a tremendous appreciation of what <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">our troops</COREF> are going through *T*-6 on a day to day basis in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
What did you -- what did <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">you</COREF> get *T*-1 from <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqis</COREF> /?
Do <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> like <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.
Do <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> dislike <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.
Are <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> neutral /?
Are <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> waiting *PRO*-1 to see who *T*-2 wins or what /?
<COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> think that many of of <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqis</COREF> <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">at least the ones with whom <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> spoke *T*-1</COREF> felt very strongly that <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> appreciated the American presence there /.
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are obviously extremely <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">concerned</COREF> about the level of violence that *T*-1 is is coming from <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">the insurgency</COREF> /.
but there 's <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">a reason for <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> /.
and you have n't heard <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> discussed *-2 in the mainstream media because nobody has brought <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">The reason why <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are concerned *T*-1</COREF> is because <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know that the upcoming August and December referential -- uh <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the constitutional referendum</COREF> is terribly important /.
<COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">the insurgency</COREF> made a strategic and tactical error by *PRO* not disrupting the last election back in January /.
<COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> know that <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's coming time around /.
But if those elections go successfully as <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the American military</COREF> *ICH*-1 is hoping and planning for *?* as well as the Iraqi army then they 're -- <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are going *-2 to start *-3 discussing the possibility of *PRO* drawing down down <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> troops</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's something that <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> learned *T*-1 and reported on *T*-1 while <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> was in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
And it was n't until ten days later 0 <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> finally started *-1 seeing something in the front pages of the daily newspapers *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">Paul</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">you</COREF> helped *PRO* fight <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">that war</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">your</COREF> reaction to what <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">Melanie</COREF> just said *T*-1 /?
Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-1 's great that some reporters are headed over there and trying *PRO*-2 to get a taste and a feel for what soldiers like <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">me</COREF> lived *T*-3 every day /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">I</COREF> was there for a year in Central Baghdad /.

And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">reporters</COREF> need *-1 to really continue *-2 to go outside <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> area of comfortability</COREF> outside <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">the Green Zone</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">I</COREF> think 0 the reality is that <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">Ms. Morgan</COREF> like <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">most reporters</COREF> are really spoon - fed *-1 uh <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> experience there /.
They 're prada- -- <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're provided *-1 with with DOD contractors or uh military security personnel /.
and what <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get *T*-2 is a very narrow understanding of what the day to day life is *T*-3 /.
Not enough reporters are really going outside of <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">that comfortability factor</COREF> and going beyond <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to experience what we as soliders experience *T*-3 /.
What makes -- wha- what what *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">you</COREF> assume that <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> <COREF ID="297" TYPE="IDENT">stayed</COREF> inside <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT">the green zone</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="297" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's another thing that <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Rieckhoff">you</COREF> 've written *T*-1 about <COREF ID="m_42" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">me</COREF> that *T*-2 is a lie /.

The day that <COREF ID="m_63" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> was there *T*-5 there were -- uh there were <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050801_190000-part-13-E1" TYPE="IDENT">thirty - three young school children who *T*-1 were killed *-2 about six blocks away from where <COREF ID="m_63" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Melanie_Morgan">I</COREF> was located *-4 *T*-3</COREF> because an American soldier had the audacity *PRO* to hand <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050801_190000-part-13-E1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> candy because <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were at the same time passing out soccer balls um at orphanages /.
