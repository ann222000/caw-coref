    Senator McConnell in addition to this the New York Times editors wrote in reaction to the Supreme Court's decision
    striking down the military tribunal set up to private detainees being held in Guantanamo bay it is far more than a
    narrow ruling on the issue of military courts. It is an important and welcome reaffirmation That even in times of war
    the law is what the constitution the statuette books and the Geneva convention say it is. Not what the President wants
    it to be.

    Senator McConnell in addition to this the New York Times editors wrote in reaction to the Supreme Court 's decision
    striking down the military tribunal set * up to private detainees being held * in Guantanamo bay it is far more than a
    narrow ruling on the issue of military courts . It is an important and welcome reaffirmation That even in times of war
    the law is what the constitution the statuette books and the Geneva convention say 0 it is *T*-1 . Not what the
    President wants it to be *T*-2 /.
