*PRO* Let <COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">you</COREF> first specifically about about <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">the tape</COREF> /.

Well <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">the tape</COREF> is troubling /.

Um and <COREF ID="m_27" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> should say 0 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">you</COREF> 're on a cell phone so <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're having <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">a little trouble</COREF> /.
If uh if <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> continue *-1 to have <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll have <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">you</COREF> call back /.
But uh *PRO* let me a- -- <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">Captain</COREF> i- i- is it *EXP*-1 fair *PRO* to a- -- to to ask the question are some on <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the police department</COREF> kind of losing it /?
<COREF ID="m_27" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean even when <COREF ID="m_27" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> was down there *T*-1 <COREF ID="m_27" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> saw the kinds of hours uh that people were working *T*-2 etcetera /.
and <COREF ID="m_27" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> know that there was a -- the goal was *PRO* to give <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">a lot of people</COREF> some time off uh right after this happened in order *PRO* to allow <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to to get <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wits back to be able *PRO*-1 to relax a little bit /.
But you know you look at this guy you know punching the the one guy grabbing <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="MSNBC_ABRAMSRPT18_ENG_20051011_040000-part-1-E2" TYPE="IDENT">AP</COREF> producer</COREF> you know /.
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">these three</COREF> at least l- give you the sense that some on <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the force</COREF> are kind of losing it /.
Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">I</COREF> certainly do n't want *PRO*-1 to to to uh any kind of excuse <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the officers involved *</COREF> /.
but you know police officers have been working for the last six weeks uh under some very challenging times /.
Uh but *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">me</COREF> just say 0 <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">more than two thousand employees on <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the police department</COREF></COREF> and certainly th- the incident that *T*-1 occured on <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Saturday night</COREF> uh does not reflect the the the vast majority of <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the hard men and wom- -- hard working men and women of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">this department</COREF></COREF> /.
But um just so we 're clear <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">you</COREF> are not defending the actions of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">those police officers</COREF> , *PRO* correct /?
No I 'm -- <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">I</COREF> 'm not *?* /.
otherwise <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">I</COREF> would n't have suspended <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and to have <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> charged *-1 with battery /.
So no /.
but clearly <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the police department</COREF> /-
When this was brought *-1 to <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> attention *T*-2 um uh the quick and decisive action was taken *-3 /.
And <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">I</COREF> think 0 that *ICH*-2 's very important for the public that *T*-1 's listening to this or looking at this newscast that uh question answered that once these types of issues are are brought *-3 to the attention of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> what is <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> going *-4 to do *T*-5 /?
And certainly um we w- -- <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have a zero tolerance for this type of behavior /.
and when something like of this magnitude occurs *T*-1 <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-2 to take <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriate action</COREF> /.
and it <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's going *-1 to be swift and decisive and effective /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">Captain</COREF> final question /.
the the attorney for <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">that man</COREF> is <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">saying</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was n't even drinking uh <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">that night</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">You</COREF> know anything about <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
No that 's the first 0 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">I</COREF> 've heard *T*-1 of <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And again um there will be -- there <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> will have <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> day in court /.
You know <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the officers</COREF> are going *-1 to have <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> day in court /.
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Davis</COREF> is going *-1 to have <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> day in court /.
and *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">me</COREF> just go on *PRO*-1 to say that how serious *ICH*-3 <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">this department</COREF> is *T*-2 about discipline /.
The <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the uh <COREF ID="MSNBC_ABRAMSRPT18_ENG_20051011_040000-part-1-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Associated Press</COREF> producer</COREF> did not want *PRO*-1 to press charges /.
Uh we decided -- <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the police department</COREF> decided that that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-1 to pursue charges on on the behalf of /.
so uh that 's how serious *ICH*-2 <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are *T*-1 about *PRO* making *PRO* *EXP*-3 sure that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> officers do the right thing /.
And *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">me</COREF> also add that that you know there 's -- there 's not a police department in America that *T*-1 's not having -- that *T*-2 's not having personnel problems /.
The question is again once you find 0 you have <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">problem personnel</COREF> what do you do *T*-1 with <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /?
Do you -- do you uh /.
or do you deal with issues /?
And <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> dealt with those issues /.
Well look it i- -- it *EXP*-4 is good *PRO* to see that this -- uh that <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're not hearing what <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> sometimes hear *T*-1 in this case is these kinds of cases which *T*-2 is well you know you got *-3 to understand the circumstances and the tape is n't showing everything /.
Basically <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">you</COREF> 're saying look <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> took action /.
it was unacceptable /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Marlon_Defillo">Captain Defillo</COREF> thanks *ICH*-1 a lot for *PRO* coming on the prorgram /.
<COREF ID="m_27" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">You</COREF> 're welcome /.

an- and it it <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> certainly demands some explanation /.
Um *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">me</COREF> read uh this <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">this quote</COREF> as I <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> go to <COREF ID="m_56" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Victoria_Habathee">Victoria Habathee</COREF> /.

Yes <COREF ID="m_30" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> quite frankly <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *?* /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Joe_Tackapena">I</COREF> mean it s- -- it 'd be an unusual in a plea um sort of defense when you 're defending <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">cops</COREF> *T*-1 because normally <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mental health is not in question /.
But in this instance it could be a defense /.
and more importantly as a trial lawyer what it would really be called *-1 *PRO*-3 *T*-2 is jury nullification /.
What you 're seeing *T*-1 on <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">this tape</COREF> is a black eye /.
There 's really no excuse for <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
Um it <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was unjustified by any training manual across the country /.
but but what <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Joe_Tackapena">I</COREF> just heard *T*-1 from <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">that doctor from <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">LSU</COREF></COREF> and what the fact of the matter is *T*-2 is that <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">these cops</COREF> were working you know twenty four hour shifts <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">some of <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> sleeping in <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cars being displaced *-3 /.

And he was n't even -- <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was just basically saying <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm trying *PRO*-1 to keep alive go home /.
Uh h- <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had clearly at that point lost it /.
and these are <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">cops who *T*-1 literally slept in <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> car for twenty four hour shifts</COREF> /.
Here here 's -- here 's *T*-2 some of what we 've seen *T*-1 from <COREF ID="MSNBC_ABRAMSRPT18_ENG_20051011_040000-part-2-E2" TYPE="IDENT">New Orleans</COREF> police since hurricane Katrina /.

*PRO* Let <COREF ID="m_19" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Eddie_Jordan_Jr.">me</COREF> just say that uh from the standpoint of a prosecutor I <COREF ID="m_19" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Eddie_Jordan_Jr.">I</COREF> respectfully disagree uh with that position /.

Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Matt_Biehl">I</COREF> was dropping <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taylor</COREF> off /.
Um <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was actually staying in that ap- uh townhouse with <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the friend that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> knew *T*-1 from Madison high school where <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> graduated from *T*-2</COREF> /.

and <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Ben Folly</COREF> was <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> roommate /.
And frankly I d- -- <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Matt_Biehl">I</COREF> did n't get a sense of urgency at that point because <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Matt_Biehl">I</COREF> had no idea of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> age and thought 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was just a student at <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> /.
So it was a -- <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a very brief meeting at that /.
About about ten or fifteen minutes yeah /.
Um all right an- an- now now that <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Matt_Biehl">you</COREF> know so much more have <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Matt_Biehl">you</COREF> heard anything from <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the authorities</COREF> about uh if *RNR*-2 and when *RNR*-2 , <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going *-1 to charge <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in connection with <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> *T*-3 /?

Um i- the you know like from the beginning it seems to <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">me</COREF> that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> had *-1 to be the the chief su- /-
This this this this silliness about <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was kidnapped *-1 on <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the same night that that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> went missing *T*-2</COREF> etcetera /.
Ha- have <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Matt_Biehl">you</COREF> gotten the impression uh that from the beginning that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was the one <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were looking at *-1 /?
Well I I <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Matt_Biehl">I</COREF> do n't know if it 's -- <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's the only one that <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're looking at *T*-1 or if there 's other people that <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're looking at *T*-2 /.
Certainly <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Matt_Biehl">my</COREF> presumption is that he i- -- <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be considered *-1 uh a primary suspect /.
Yeah ne- and here 's -- here 's what the police chief uh said *T*-1 about it uh on Thursday /.
A dog tracked a scent from <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> car to uh <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">a gentleman 's uh named * *PRO*-1 Jesse Schultz</COREF> /.

and <COREF ID="m_67" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Peterson">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the authorities</COREF> are looking into any connection there /.
All right that was n't the piece of sound 0 <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> was looking for *T*-1 /.
and and <COREF ID="m_67" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Peterson">George Peterson</COREF> is the attorney um for <COREF ID="286" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taylor 's</COREF> mother</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_67" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Peterson">He</COREF> 's speaking there /.
What what <COREF ID="m_67" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Peterson">he</COREF> had said *T*-1 was we certainly believe that strongest suspect uh <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> already have *T*-2 in custody /.
<COREF ID="m_67" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="George_Peterson">He</COREF> was talking there about <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">someone else who *T*-1 apparently has been cleared *-2 um as a suspect uh in <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF></COREF> /.

<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> just know that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's fifty seven /.
apparently <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had an Illinois driver 's license but does not necessarily reside there /.
Um a- and we just -- we do n't know anything about <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Linda_Sharp">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were seen *-1 together in <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Richmond</COREF> um <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">either Monday or Tuesday</COREF> /.
Uh she w- -- sh- <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was missing on a Sunday /.
and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Linda_Sharp">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Monday or Tuesday</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was seen *-1 in <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Richmond</COREF> with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.

Yes yes /.
Well well yes <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Linda_Sharp">I</COREF> think 0 it the belief is that <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> met online /.
and um you know we 've -- we 've -- <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have taken all that information off <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> computer /.

but there was no indication that <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were planning *PRO*-1 to meet <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">that Sunday morning</COREF> /.
So in other words you know when <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> woke up went out and walked <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> dog</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did n't take anything *ICH*-2 with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> like keys <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> purse <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> money or clothing or you know or anything like that /.
So you know we 're -- we 're -- <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do realize that there are these um transcripts of some conversations that <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had *T*-1 but apparently nothing that *T*-2 indicated that <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">that morning</COREF> <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were planning *PRO*-3 to meet /.
A- any of <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Monica 's</COREF> friends</COREF> able *PRO*-1 to provide any other information /?
No <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have talked to everyone /.

All right well look this is one of these cases where we do n't ha- just have *-1 to look back *T*-2 where we can actually look forward and hope that someone has seen <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> and can call the authorities *T*-3 /.

Closing argument /.
It 's time 0 *PRO* to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">blow</COREF> through the smoke screens created * by many opposed * to <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Harriet Miers '</COREF> nomination to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's actually quite easy 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 /.

*PRO* Do n't believe those who *T*-1 say 0 there 's no litmus test /.
Of course there is *?* /.
If you do n't want *PRO*-1 to overturn <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Roe v Wade</COREF> , if you do n't want *PRO*-2 to limit the rights of gays and if you do n't want *PRO*-3 to allow more religion in public buildings and schools then <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't want you on <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> period /.
Your qualifications quote end quote meaningless /.
Now apart from the handful of law professors and legal scholars almost all of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-1 at this time are claiming 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's not qualified</COREF> are just looking for an excuse /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> assure you 0 the vast majority of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> would welcome a poorly qualified but guaranteed hardcore conservative /.
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The far right</COREF> is only resorting *PRO*-1 to talk about <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> judicial experience and qualifications because <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want someone with experience that *T*-2 proves 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 'll vote <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way not because <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> truly are concerned about <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> ability *PRO* to value uh evaluate constitutional issues /.
It *EXP*-1 's almost humorous *PRO* to hear some of the same people who *T*-2 regularly mock the so called elite point out that <COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> law school</COREF> <COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">SMU</COREF> is not among the nation 's most respected /.
Now <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">some on the left</COREF> engaged in a similar type of dishonest attack during <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">John Roberts '</COREF> confirmation process /.
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> could n't hide behind the cloak of inadequate qualifications /.
After all <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the Harvard law grad</COREF> had worked for the Justice Department repatedly argued in front of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> and had served as a federal Court of Appeals judge /.
So instead <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the twenty two senators who *T*-1 opposed <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Roberts</COREF></COREF> claimed that <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could n't vote for <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> because <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't know enough about <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> or said 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had n't answered <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> questions /.
The reality <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could n't be assured *-1 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would not vote with the conservative justices on many of the same controversial issues in particular <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Roe v Wade</COREF> /.
Since when are senators entitled *-1 to guarantees about how a <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> justice will rule *T*-2 *T*-3 /?
The Senate 's constitutional role of advise and consent is rapidly disintegrating into one of advocate and confront /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> 'll say it again /.
We can not let <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">the fringes on both sides</COREF> hijack the <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> nomination process /.
But it 's even more insulting and dangerous when <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are n't straight with us about what <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're saying *T*-1 and why <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're saying it *T*-2 *T*-3 /.
