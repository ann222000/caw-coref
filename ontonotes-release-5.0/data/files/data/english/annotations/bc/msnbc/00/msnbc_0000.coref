Hi everyone /.
first up on the docket tonight we got an interview with <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the witness who *T*-1 led investigators to <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">a landfill</COREF> in the search for <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Natalee Holloway</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's telling <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">NBC news</COREF> what and who <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw *T*-1 just days after <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Natalee 's</COREF> May thirtieth disappearance</COREF> /.
Also <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Natalee 's</COREF> mother met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation today /.
And while <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the landfill</COREF> continues *-1 to be searched *-2 and <COREF ID="126" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">lead suspect</COREF> <COREF ID="126" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Joran Van Der Sloot</COREF> is interrogated *-3 for the fourth straight day by a team of behavioral specialists <COREF ID="m_4" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michelle_Kosinski"><COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">NBC 's</COREF> Michelle Kosinski</COREF> remains in Aruba /.
So <COREF ID="m_4" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michelle_Kosinski">Michelle</COREF> <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the authorities</COREF> really believe that this uh <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">this witness</COREF> with regard to <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the landfill</COREF> 's credible , do n't <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> *?* /?
Well the authorities including <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> found out had checked <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">this witness</COREF> out early on just days after <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Natalee</COREF> <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">disappeared</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> just found out about <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">this witness</COREF> a couple weeks ago /.
That 's when <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> existence became widely known through private investigators and other sources *T*-1 /.
And it *EXP*-3 has been reported *-1 that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was afraid *PRO*-2 to come forward /.
Well it turns out 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was just afraid for <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> identity to be known *-1 /.
but <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> learned that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> came forward very quickly after <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw what *T*-1 happened in <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the landfill</COREF> that day just days after it happened /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> talked to police /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> talked to <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">The FBI</COREF> actually went out to <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">that landfill</COREF> with dogs looked around <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">that area</COREF> even before <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> became piled *-1 up with garbage /.
and <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't find anything /.
It 's <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">EquuSearch</COREF> volunteers</COREF> who *T*-1 really said hey <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> believe <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> story</COREF> does n't change /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> seems *-1 to pan out /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> seems *-1 to be a lucid guy /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> seems *-1 to also be insistent that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw something /.
So <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">some men</COREF> *ICH*-1 drive up in <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">a white pickup truck</COREF> <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">men that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> later recognized *T*-2 to be the three suspects in this case</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> took what *T*-1 looked like a body out of the back of <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">the pickup truck</COREF> /.
It was wrapped *-1 up in <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">a bag</COREF> /.
But when the wind blew *T*-1 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw the upper part of <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">a woman 's</COREF> body</COREF> <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">blonde hair</COREF> /.
and then <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> buried <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">this body</COREF> there in <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the landfill</COREF> /.
Well over a period of weeks <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">some ten feet of garbage</COREF> has piled up /.
<COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">EquuSearch</COREF> will tell you too that when <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> bring out dogs *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 's very difficult for <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">a dog</COREF> to catch a scent in <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">that landfill</COREF> when <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're coming across things like medical waste *T*-3 /.
but <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're determined *PRO*-1 to keep *-2 going /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> saw uh the <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">the woman 's</COREF> body</COREF> and inside <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">a bag</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> hair</COREF> was blowing out with the wind /.
And uh <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't say this now /.
but <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> told that he s- -- the the back kind of came off and <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw the woman -- half of <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">the woman 's</COREF> body</COREF> /.
One of the most compelling reasons <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">searchers</COREF> say 0 *?* 0 <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believe <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> very much *T*-1 is that h- <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> some clues as to <COREF ID="291" TYPE="IDENT">things 0 <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would find *T*-2 *PRO*-3 buried *-4 deep within <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">that garbage around <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">that same area where <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> claims 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw a body *T*-5</COREF></COREF> things like a plastic pool</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said that there was a dirt road buried * under <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">all that garbage</COREF> /.
Well <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> found <COREF ID="291" TYPE="IDENT">those things</COREF> and a couple of other items that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 would be there /.
The problem is 0 <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just have n't found any sign at all of <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Natalee Holloway</COREF> /.
but <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to clear <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">that place</COREF> out and just feel satisfied that <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> looked as best 0 <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could *?* because it 's disturbing /.
<COREF ID="m_4" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michelle_Kosinski">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> story</COREF> has panned out in some ways /.
so they just do n't wa- -- <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to give this up /.
Well tha- tha- was- tha- that 's the question 0 I have *T*-1 for <COREF ID="m_4" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michelle_Kosinski">you</COREF> <COREF ID="m_4" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michelle_Kosinski">Michelle</COREF> /.
So are <COREF ID="m_4" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michelle_Kosinski">you</COREF> saying that <COREF ID="349" TYPE="IDENT">the authorities</COREF> in uh looked into <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">this guy 's</COREF> story</COREF> early on and <COREF ID="349" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> kind of pooh - poohed <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and then <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">EquuSearch</COREF> came in a couple weeks later and said *PRO* wait a sec , *PRO* wait a sec , *PRO* let <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> give <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> a shot here and <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> followed up on <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /?
Yeah pretty much /.
Uh the <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the witness</COREF> told <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> directly that in the beginning <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> felt like nobody was believing <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> story</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="367" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> talked to a high level source in <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">law enforcement</COREF> /.
and it turns out 0 <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did check <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out /.
Hm /.
<COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> sent <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> out there with a dog /.
But <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">EquuSearch</COREF> says hey maybe <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can do something more thoroughly here /.
<COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> can bring out teams of dogs /.
But here 's *T*-1 the thing /.
<COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> still have n't found one sign of <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /.
but uh <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are determined *PRO*-1 to keep keep it up through the weekend at least /.
Alright <COREF ID="m_4" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michelle_Kosinski">Michelle Kosinski</COREF> as always thanks a lot /.

<TEXT PARTNO="001">
And as Michelle reported *?* <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Beth_Holloway_Twitty"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Natalee 's mother</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Beth Holloway Twitty</COREF></COREF> met with <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the lead prosecutor in the investigation *ICH*-1</COREF> this afternoon <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Karin Janssen</COREF> where <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Beth_Holloway_Twitty">she</COREF> told <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Janssen</COREF> about <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">a girl 0 *T*-2 came forward said 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">an encounter with <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Joran Van Der Sloot</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the chief suspect</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> *T*-3 /.
And on our program last night <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Beth_Holloway_Twitty">Beth</COREF> told me the story /.
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">A beautiful eighteen year old blonde - headed girl from New Jersey</COREF> and um you know was able *PRO*-1 to recount <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">an encounter that *ICH*-3 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had *T*-2 with <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Joran Van Der Sloot</COREF> <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Deepak Kalpoe</COREF> and <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Satish Kalpoe</COREF></COREF> during the month of April oh five</COREF> /.
And what did <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> say 0 *T*-1 happened /?
We- you know it 's a pretty long scenario /.
We have a lot of details /.
Um you know the the main thing to to sum it up as you know <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Joran</COREF> how <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> entered <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">this establishment</COREF> *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Beth_Holloway_Twitty">I</COREF> believe that you know if you enter on the right side you have *-1 to have a valid ID /.
You enter <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Carlos N' Charlie 's</COREF> on the left side you must have some type of <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Beth_Holloway_Twitty">I</COREF> do n't know if it 's a VIP pass or what *PRO*-1 to enter /.
but <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Joran</COREF> enters <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the establishment</COREF> on the left side approaches +approaches <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">these group of tourist</COREF> /.
Um you know it 's -- it *EXP*-1 's interesting how <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is able *PRO*-2 to um try *PRO*-3 to work <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> way in and connect establish <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> in that casin- -- in d- uh <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Carlos N' Charlie 's</COREF> *T*-4 /.
*PRO* Was walking <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *ICH*-1 around and her -- and these other tourists and was able *PRO*-2 to point out <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Satish</COREF> and <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Deepak Kalpoe</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're sitting ironically in <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the same corner the same stools that <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were seated *-1 at *T*-2 in the picture that *T*-3 's been all over international media</COREF> /.
So that must be their -- <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> must be <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> spot where <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wait *T*-1 while <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Joran</COREF> is working /.
And um you know s- it *EXP*-1 was so interesting how <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">everyone in <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the casino</COREF></COREF> knew <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Joran</COREF> *T*-2 /.
He had -- you know <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knew <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> was greeting all the guys with this grip handshake /.
All the girls approach <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> with a kiss on the cheek /.
It *EXP*-1 was interesting how um you know <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was able *PRO*-2 to order these <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">these group of girls</COREF> by *PRO*-3 just merely leaning over the bar and ordering three shots of one fifty - one one for <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> and three for <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the tourists</COREF> with with no money *T*-4 /.
So <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's got an open uh tab at <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Carlos N' Charlie 's</COREF> /.
able *PRO* to run a tab /.
And you know then you notice that in a evening 's proceeding <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's even <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">approaching</COREF> <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">these girls</COREF> *PRO* getting close to closing time /.
Did /.
So <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's another unique pattern that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has *T*-1 /.
Did did did did <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> say uh anything about uh violence /?
No <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did n't say anything about violence /.
but what <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Beth_Holloway_Twitty">I</COREF> was looking for *T*-1 was a -- was a history is a predatory type behavior which <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Beth_Holloway_Twitty">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Joran</COREF> and <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Deepak</COREF> and <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Satish</COREF></COREF> have *T*-2 and how tightly connected <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the three</COREF> are *T*-3 /.

Uh <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have n't followed up with <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
Um <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Beth</COREF> and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="T.J._Ward">I</COREF> have talked about <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.

Is is <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> relevant /?
<COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean a lo- lot of <COREF ID="m_16" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">my</COREF> viewers wrote in *PRO*-1 saying alright so what /.
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> a pickup artist /.
How does that -- how does <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> really impact the case *T*-1 /?
Well <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> just shows 0 <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a pattern d- of um what <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> activity is *T*-1 when <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> hangs out at <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Carlos N' Charlie 's</COREF> *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="T.J._Ward">I</COREF> mean h- he and and *PRO* trying *PRO* to pick <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> up and <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">take</COREF> <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> from <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the bar</COREF> and whatever <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's doing *T*-1 with <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> after <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
But if there 's no violence associated * with <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is that -- does <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> help <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> in the investigation /?
Well again <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't think 0 there was a violent issue with with <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> with <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Natalee</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> think 0 probably +something has happened to <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Natalee</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> panicked and and then went forth and did what <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were supposed *-1 to do *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="T.J._Ward">I</COREF> mean there there 's issues of that *T*-1 's come up /.
Um we kn- -- we know that there 's in -- um well w- we <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">feel</COREF> 0 something happened when Na- -- when <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Natalee</COREF> was with <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-1 /.
What do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="T.J._Ward">you</COREF> mean *T*-1 by <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
Either <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> either passed out regurgitated /.
um something had happened /.
And on top of <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> now there 's a statement *ICH*-4 that *T*-1 's come up from <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Joran Van Der Sloot</COREF> that 's <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's given *T*-2 to the police uh one of twenty - two statements 0 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's given *T*-3 by the way that um Deepak had uh killed her on raped <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> and killed <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> on the beach /.
So at this point w- what the police have *T*-1 w- you know again <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're unaware *T*-2 because <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're not getting any information from law enforcement /.
so we <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *-1 to go on the course of information that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're gathering *T*-2 on behalf of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the family</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Harvey_Levin">I</COREF> mean this is jury tampering from within the jury if <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">these allegations</COREF> are true /.
And if there is ever *PRO*-1 to be a fair celebrity trial again especially in California somebody needs *-2 to say look we are drawing the line /.
You 're not going *-1 to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.
If it pans out 0 <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's true <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Harvey_Levin">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Tom Sneddon <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Michael Jackson</COREF> /.

Nothing /.
eh game over /.
You ca n't take an appeal from an aquittal /.
The problem that <COREF ID="m_21" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Susan_Filan">I</COREF> have *T*-1 with this is as members of the media we had an awfully difficult time with access to this trial /.
If this is going *-1 to set a precedent *PRO* to shut media out because these highly publicized celebrity trials yield these faulty verdicts <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's doing far far more harm than <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could ever understand *?* /.

<COREF ID="m_37" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean the bottom line is 0 <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the prosecutors</COREF> ca n't do anything about this , *PRO* right /?

If <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">this young man</COREF> will talk this could break open what *T*-1 happened to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">George</COREF> /.
The key question is is <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> a tragic accident or is <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> foul play /?
Right now law enforcement seems *-1 to think 0 <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's foul play /.
US attorney Kevin O'Connor said 0 we have reason 0 *PRO* to believe 0 there could have been foul play here *T*-1 /.
Um alright uh <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">Mister Zalisko</COREF> do <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">you</COREF> know anything from <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">your</COREF> personal experience of *PRO* having been on <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the cruise</COREF> as to what *T*-1 happened /?
Uh good evening <COREF ID="m_18" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">sir</COREF> /.
Uh first <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">I</COREF> 'd just like *PRO*-1 to clarify 0 <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">I</COREF> 'm a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">Orlando</COREF> /.
Uh now as far as <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the cruise</COREF> uh <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">I</COREF> was on <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the cruise</COREF> <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">that uh uh day</COREF> /.
and the way 0 <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">I</COREF> became aware of what *T*-1 occured *T*-2 was that uh <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the morning of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the fifth</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">a relative of <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">mine</COREF></COREF> had mentioned that there was <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">blood stain on <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the canopy beneath <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> uh balcony</COREF></COREF> /.
At at that point <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> kind of dismissed <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> did n't know what *T*-1 was uh going on /.
Uh <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> then went on <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> daily excursion /.
However later on into <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the cruise</COREF> <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">that day</COREF> uh <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the ship 's</COREF> captain went onto the PA system and made an announcement that uh there were -- authorities were on the ship and <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.
When <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">my</COREF> cousin</COREF> the uh size of <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">the blood splatter</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had indicated 0 <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was relatively the size of a small uh dog or a of a beagle type /.
However *PRO* viewing those photographs on TV <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">that blood splatter</COREF> is much larger than uh a small dog /.
Mhm /.
In fact <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's maybe three to four feet in length /.
And then we 've been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into *RNR*-2 and out of *RNR*-2 the state rooms uh which *T*-1 would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured *-3 in the early stages of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the investigation</COREF> /.
Well /.

<TEXT PARTNO="012">
Alright *PRO* let me sh- -- *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">me</COREF> play this piece of sound from <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cletus_Hyman">one of the passengers who *T*-1 was uh staying right nearby uh <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">this particular uh room</COREF></COREF> /.
We were awakened *-1 uh about four in the morning uh by <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">loud yelling coming from <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the cabin</COREF></COREF> /.
Um <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.
And <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cletus_Hyman">he</COREF> says uh later um <COREF ID="m_49" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">chief</COREF> that he saw -- that <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cletus_Hyman">he</COREF> heard <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">a horrific thud</COREF> /.
Well yeah <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would indicate that something did go on there /.
and and we know uh that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the three individuals</COREF> were in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">a room</COREF> uh with <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Smith</COREF> /.
And the question that *T*-1 has *-2 to be uh presented *-3 to everybody is why is it *EXP*-4 taking so long for authorities to interview <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the individual that *T*-5 was in a cabin next door</COREF> *T*-6 /?
Mhm /.
Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want *PRO*-1 to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the crime</COREF> /.
Yeah /.
Yeah /.
And you would not just interview <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">that individual next door</COREF> /.
You would have *-1 to take a step *PRO*-2 to interview people above below and to both sides /.
Su- <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Susan_Filan">Susan</COREF> what 's the answer to that *T*-1 /?
But <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> /.
there are jurisdictional problems here /.
You know it 's not a clear cut case as to who *T*-1 gets *-2 to prosecute this case /.
Turkey ca n't do anything without a body /.
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">United States</COREF> can *?* /.
Fair play of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> for *PRO* stepping in /.
fair play to law enforcement for *PRO* getting involved /.
Jurisdiction is n't clear /.
but they 're working very hard *PRO*-1 to solve <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the crime</COREF> /.
I <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Susan_Filan">I</COREF> do n't think 0 the criticism *ICH*-1 is well placed against law enforcement in this case /.
Also <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the crime scene</COREF> was oh if you want *PRO*-1 to call <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-2 that was cleaned *-3 up by <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the cruise ship who *T*-4 got <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> investigators and <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lawyers in from what <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Susan_Filan">I</COREF> understand *T*-5 right away *PRO* to make this go away</COREF> /.
so <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Susan_Filan">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">law enforcement</COREF> was put *-1 in a bad position *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-3 to play catchup /.
and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Susan_Filan">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're doing +an amazing job /.
<COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Larry_Kobilinsky">Larry</COREF> so any uh any chance now *ICH*-2 based on the fact that things have been cleaned *-1 up et cetera *PRO* to to get any usable evidence /?
Well it 's very difficult <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">Dan</COREF> /.
Uh obviously as we keep saying *?* we do not have a body /.
therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.
But we do have some physical evidence /.
Unfortunately examination of <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the photograph</COREF> uh tells <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Larry_Kobilinsky">me</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was not done *-1 the proper way /.
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was n't a forensic photograph /.
So <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Larry_Kobilinsky">I</COREF> really do not know how large *ICH*-2 <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the stain</COREF> was *T*-1 in <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> dimensions /.
but it *EXP*-1 is pretty clear that there 's an awful gr- there 's a lot of blood *ICH*-2 there great deal of blood /.
It makes you think that something criminal occured /.
But again *PRO* getting back to how you solve <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the crime</COREF> *T*-1 you got *-2 to go to <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the crime scene</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Larry_Kobilinsky">I</COREF> think 0 there are multiple scenes here /.
<COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Every place 0 there 's blood *T*-1</COREF> <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a crime scene /.
But the most important place is <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the cabin</COREF> because <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's presumably where the trauma -- where <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">the injury</COREF> took place *T*-1 /.
Now there was some rumor about some arguments going <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">casino</COREF> the night before /.
Uh and it could very well be that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was arguing with <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">these individuals</COREF> /.
so uh that could be the c- -- the tie the connection /.
and <COREF ID="m_13" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Larry_Kobilinsky">I</COREF> think 0 good policework would connect <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the individuals in question</COREF> with <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">the casino</COREF> with <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Smith</COREF> /.
and that might help us understand what *T*-1 happened /.
Excuse this is um <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">a little bit more sound</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is again from <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cletus_Hyman">Cletus Hyman uh who *T*-1 was literally um in a -- in a joining or nearby cabin</COREF> um as to what <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cletus_Hyman">he</COREF> heard *T*-2 around <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cletus_Hyman">he</COREF> said 0 *?* four in the morning the day before uh <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Smith</COREF> went missing /.
At times it sounded like furniture was being actually picked *-1 up and dropped *-1 /.
and then <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">that horrific uh thud</COREF> /.
Yeah <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean that sure sounds to <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">me</COREF> <COREF ID="m_49" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Walter_Zalisko">chief</COREF> like we 're not talking about someone who /-
<COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="m_35" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dan_Abrams">I</COREF> guess 0 it 's possible if you 're talking about ye- loud yelling coming /-
Well look if there 's loud -- if <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cletus_Hyman">this guy</COREF> 's right right that loud yelling is coming from <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the cabin</COREF> right and the wife is not a real suspect here *PRO* means that there was probably someone else in there /.
Well there absolutely was someone else in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">that room</COREF> /.
And what *T*-1 's interesting is 0 there was <COREF ID="282" TYPE="IDENT">a witness who uh *T*-2 had informed ship 's authorities that <COREF ID="282" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had heard a scream uh early that morning</COREF> /.
And what *T*-1 's really interesting is 0 that witness has n't been interviewed uh f- -- uh we do n't know if <COREF ID="282" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's been interviewed *-2 at this point /.
But it was five days later that the ship 's attorneys *ICH*-2 had begun *-1 to question <COREF ID="282" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> not law enforcement but ship 's attorneys *T*-3 /.
We will uh continue *-1 to follow this /.

Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Erin_Runnion">I</COREF> think that there 's a gross misconception about s- sex offender crimes /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Erin_Runnion">I</COREF> think 0 most do not realize how pervasive the problem is *T*-1 /.
The sex offenders that we have caught *T*-1 are a very small percentage of those that *T*-2 are out there /.
