But first as we begin the fourth year of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the war in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF></COREF> we are joined *-1 by <COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">the Secretary of State</COREF> /.
*PRO* Welcome back <COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">Madame Secretary</COREF> /.
Good morning /.
nice *PRO* to be with <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">you</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> /.
Very disturbing headlines in the papers yesterday <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">helping</COREF> <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
and this is how <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was captured *-1 in the paper *T*-2 /.
Russian officials collected <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-1-E1" TYPE="IDENT">intelligence on US troop movements and attack plans</COREF> from inside the American military command leading the two thousand and three invasion of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> and passed <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-1-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that information</COREF> on to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein</COREF> according to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">a US military study</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">The intelligence report which <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the study</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 were provided *-2 to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hussein</COREF> through the Russian ambassador in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> during the height of the US assault</COREF> warned accurately that <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">American formations</COREF> intended *PRO*-3 to bypass Iraqi cities on <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> thrust towards <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">The reports</COREF> provided some specific numbers on US troop units ' locations according to <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Iraqi documents dated * March and April oh three and later captured * by the United States</COREF> /.
Have <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> told <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> what *T*-1 is going on /?
Well <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're trying first *PRO*-1 to m- make *PRO* *EXP*-2 sure 0 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> understand fully what <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the documents</COREF> say *T*-3 /.
Uh <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are documents that *T*-1 were found *-2 uh in Iraqi stores /.
and obviously <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> would take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> may have been done *-1 uh maybe to the detriment of American forces /.
And so uh <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will certainly raise <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to uh take a real hard look at <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the documents</COREF> and then raise <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are <COREF ID="104" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">US documents</COREF> <COREF ID="104" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a US report</COREF> /.
Y- yes /.
<COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">You</COREF> believe <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the report</COREF> /.
Oh I <COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> certainly think 0 there is uh a lot to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">this report</COREF> /.
but <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really have n't a cha- had a chance *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">look</COREF> at <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the documents</COREF> in uh detail /.
*PRO* Intend *PRO*-1 to do <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> and then to raise <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> would hope 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> will take <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> seriously /.
Will there be an investigation as to who *T*-1 leaked the information to <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> /?
Well I we 'll just have *-1 to see /.
I d- <COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to get ahead of us /.
but obviously <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> take very seriously uh <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">any suggestion that uh <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> may have been done *-1 at the beginning of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would be a quite serious charge /.
Was it -- could <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> have been deliberate misinformation /?
<COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't know /.
<COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really have *-1 to take a look at <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the documents</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're finding <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">thousands and thousands and thousands of documents</COREF> /.
And uh <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-1 to find some uh i- i- -- some important and uh surprising things in <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">these documents</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *-1 to step back take a hard look at <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the documents</COREF> /.
but I definitely -- <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will raise <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> /.

<TEXT PARTNO="002">
When <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> first went into Iraq *T*-1 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had some unexpected encounters with Fedayeen /.
and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> lost uh dozens of American men that Russians may have been responsible for American deaths /.
Well <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to try hypothetically *PRO*-2 to to know what impact <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> might have had *T*-3 /.
<COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> think 0 the first thing 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* take a good hard look at <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the documents</COREF> /.
and then <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> definitely want *PRO*-3 to raise <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> /.
And again <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> would hope that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> would uh would take <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> seriously and and give <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> a serious answer on what <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> find *T*-1 /.
Back in June of two thousand one <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> looked <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Vladimir Putin</COREF> in the eye /.
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> got a sense of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> soul found <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to be very straightforward and very trustworthy /.
Does <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> still believe that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">President Putin</COREF> is straightforward and trustworthy /?
<COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> really do think that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> have generally done what <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would do *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were going *-1 to <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">oppose</COREF> <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraq War</COREF> and <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *?* /.
and <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> told <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-2-E1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> from the very beginning /.
Uh so <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't have an argument there /.
and <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to jump to the conclusion that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was something that *T*-2 was ordered *-3 out of the Kremlin /.
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have *-1 to look at <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the documents</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have *-1 to go to <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> /.
but <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> would hope that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> would take seriously uh any suggestion uh that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may have passed uh data to the Iraqis uh at the advent of <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> /.
But the Russian ambassador is the source /.
How could <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> not have known *T*-1 /.
and how could it *EXP*-1 be straightforward and honest for <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> to help Saddam Hussein *T*-2 /?
Tim <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *-1 to get to the bottom of the facts of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> will most certainly raise <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian government</COREF> /.
I <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> 've said several times 0 <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a serious matter /.
but uh <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to jump out ahead and start *-2 making accusations about what uh <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> may *RNR*-3 or may not *RNR*-3 have known *T*-4 /.
This is something in a relationship that <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-2-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *T*-1 with <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> that *T*-2 really is candid and where <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do talk about difficult things all the time *T*-3 , where <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll be able *PRO*-4 to talk about <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and talk about <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> uh honestly *T*-5 /.
Why wo n't <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> help <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-2-E1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> get sanctions in the United Nations against <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> and try *PRO*-1 to stop <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> from *PRO*-2 developing nuclear weapons *T*-3 /?
Well <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-2-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're not yet at the stage where <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-2-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're seeking sanctions *T*-1 /.
Uh what <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-2-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're doing *T*-1 now is uh <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-2-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're seeking a presidential statement that *T*-2 would make clear to <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the international community 's</COREF> determination that <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> live up to the obligations that everyone thinks 0 <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> has *T*-3 /.
<COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're working through it /.
Uh <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have a s- -- the same strategy here /.
<COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have the same uh view of the problem /.
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">The Russians</COREF> do not want a nuclear rec- weapon in <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> either /.
It *EXP*-5 's been very clear in everything that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have tried *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 in the way that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> set up the civil nuclear cooporation with Bushehr *T*-3 in what <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> offered <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the Iranians</COREF> *T*-4 that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> also do not believe that there should be enrichment and reprocessing capability on Iranian soil /.
And uh enrichment and reprocessing capability is the core here /.
If you 're able *PRO*-1 to enrich and reprocess then the ability *PRO* to build a bomb is is there /.
And so <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-2-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> and <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> uh the Chinese and certainly the Europeans have the same view of what *T*-1 is -- what *T*-2 is to be prevented *-3 /.
Uh yes <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've had some tactical differences on how *PRO* to get there *T*-1 /.
but uh <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> talked with <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">my</COREF> Russian counterpart uh on Friday /.
<COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> agreed that <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> people would go back and work very hard this weekend and we 'll see where we are *T*-1 on Monday /.
Um <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're considering whether it *EXP*-1 might be a good idea *PRO* to get um after <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have a presidential statement uh get ministers together again uh with the <COREF ID="250" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the P five</COREF> <COREF ID="250" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the permanent five of the Security Council</COREF> plus Germany uh *PRO* to talk about *PRO* charting a course forward because everybody takes very seriously <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Iran 's</COREF> intransigence and <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Iran 's</COREF> unwillingness uh *PRO* to do what <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the international community</COREF> is bid- -- is uh determined that <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will do *T*-2 /.

<TEXT PARTNO="003">
It *EXP*-1 is the policy of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">our government</COREF> that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> will not be allowed *-2 to develop a nuclear weapon /.
I- i- <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> can not be <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">allowed</COREF> *-1 to develop a nuclear weapon /.
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is the view of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the international community</COREF> not <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">just the United States</COREF> /.
This article is in the New York Times /.
The reality is that most of us think 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Iranians</COREF> are probably going *-1 to get a weapon or the technology 0 *PRO* to make one *T*-2 sooner or later <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">an administration official</COREF> acknowledged 0 *T*-3 a few weeks ago *PRO*-4 refusing *PRO*-5 to talk on the record because such an admission amounts to a concession that *PRO* dragging <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> in front of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">United Nations</COREF> Security Council</COREF> may prove an exercise in futility /.
The optomists around here about the White House just hope 0 we can delay the day by ten or twenty years and that by that time we 'll have a different relationship with a different Iranian government /.
That seems like a much different policy /.
Well I since <COREF ID="m_10" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't know who <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">this anonymous person</COREF> is *T*-1 <COREF ID="m_10" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> ca n't tell <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">you</COREF> what uh w- what relationship *ICH*-3 <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may have *T*-2 to the policy /.
<COREF ID="m_10" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> 'll tell <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">you</COREF> who *T*-1 does n't think <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="m_10" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't believe that <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> believes <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> because <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're doing everything that <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to uh send a strong signal *ICH*-3 to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Iranians</COREF> that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have no choice /.
If <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wish *PRO*-1 to be a part of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the international community</COREF> <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have no choice but *PRO*-2 to give up ambitions that *T*-3 could lead to the technologies that *T*-4 would lead to a nuclear weapon /.
Uh if <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the international community</COREF> stays really solid here <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> can not stand the kind of isolation from <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the international community</COREF> that for instance North Korea endures *T*-1 almost by choice /.
We really do have a chance *PRO* to solve this diplomatically /.
but <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> <COREF ID="m_10" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> would be the first 0 *T*-1 to say 0 we ca n't <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">afford</COREF> *PRO*-2 to waste time /.
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's why <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need our <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> people in in New York to really work toward this first phase *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> need *-1 to see if <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> has a an effect on <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Iranians</COREF> /.

Which *T*-1 is /?
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">The next phase</COREF> is uh *PRO* to look to uh further uh options in <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the Security Council</COREF> /.
For instance perhaps <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the chapter seven resolution</COREF> /.
Which *T*-1 is /?
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Chapter seven resolution</COREF> essentially gives uh <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> or <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the Security Council</COREF> the ability *PRO* to compel a state *PRO*-1 to act /.
Uh <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> i- can um say that there would be consequences if actions are not taken *-1 /.
Including military /?
Well uh no one ever takes anything off the table /.
but <COREF ID="m_10" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> believe 0 <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're a long way from uh from that /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have the possibilities of financial measures that *T*-1 could be taken *-2 uh bans against travel /.
There are -- there <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> a lot of uh options once you 're in <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the Security Council</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's why it *EXP*-1 was very important *PRO* to get this uh dossier Iranian dossier to <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the Security Council</COREF> *T*-2 and why <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">the diplomacy that we 've been working *T*-3 over the last uh couple of years *PRO* to get the Europeans and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> on the same page and to now bring the Russians and the Chinese along</COREF> uh has been so important *T*-4 /.
D- do <COREF ID="m_10" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">you</COREF> believe 0 if <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> chose *PRO*-1 to embark on military action with <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would go to <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> for authorization first /?

US troops killed two thousand three hundred and sixteen . Wounded injured seventeen thousand two hundred seventy - one /.

Um <COREF ID="m_14" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do n't think 0 anyone um knew precisely what we would be facing *T*-1 in terms of numbers /.
And * look /.
every one of those deaths is uh mourned *-1 by people in the administration uh because these are families that *T*-2 have lost um husbands and wives and daughters and sons /.
Um but we also know that nothing of value is ever won *-1 without sacrifice /.
We 're in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> because the um United States of America faces a different kind of enemy and a different kind of war /.

Iraq was a -- <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein 's</COREF> Iraq was a threat /.
Now that the /-
B- but but <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> was not related *-1 to *PRO* flying airplanes into buildings /.
No /.
and we have never said that <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> /-
u- uh <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> was not related *-1 to the events of <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">September eleventh</COREF> /.
But if you really believe that the only thing that *T*-1 happened on <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">September eleventh</COREF> was 0 people flew airplanes into buildings <COREF ID="m_14" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> think 0 you have a very narrow view of what we faced *T*-2 on <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">September eleventh</COREF> /.
We faced the um the outcome of an ideology of hatred throughout <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> that *T*-1 had *-2 to be dealt with *-3 /.
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> was a part of that old Middle East /.
The new Iraq will be a part of a new Middle East /.
and we will all be safer /.
But <COREF ID="m_14" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">Madame Secretary</COREF> weapons of mass destruction was the primary rationale given * *PRO* to go into <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
Lisa Myers of NBC news broke <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">a story *ICH*-1</COREF> last week that <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="157" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Iraqi foreign minister</COREF> <COREF ID="157" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mister Sabri</COREF></COREF> w- became a spy for the French and and <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> /.
And this is how <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was reported *-1 *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein 's</COREF> last foreign minister</COREF> <COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Naji Sabri</COREF> <COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">paid spy for +French intelligence</COREF></COREF> later turned <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> over to <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> *PRO* to supply information about <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> chemical biological nuclear weapon program</COREF> more than six months before <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> began in March of oh three according {to} former intelligence officials /.
The sources said 0 <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> provided information 0 <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">{the?} Iraqi dictator</COREF> had ambitions for <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">a nuclear program</COREF> but <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was not active and that no biological weapons were being produced or stockpiled *-1 although research was under way /.
That 's a far cry from what the American people were told *-1 *T*-2 /.
Of course <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was a single source among multiple sources /.
And the problem was that <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> was unwilling *ICH*-1 after multiple revel- resolutions in the Security Council *PRO*-2 to account for <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> uh weapons programs</COREF> /.
Uh we all remember that the accounting of the UN mission that *T*-1 was suppo- uh weapons inspection mission that *T*-2 was supposed *-3 to uh look into <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> weapons program</COREF> could not account for large stockpiles /.
We all thought that <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> had <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">weapons of mass destruction</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> certainly had a a very healthy appetite for <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had used <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> before both against <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own people and against <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> neighbors</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was a threat /.
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was someone flying uh against our aircraft or or i- shooting at <COREF ID="253" TYPE="IDENT">our aircraft</COREF> as <COREF ID="253" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> flew the no - fly zone /.
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 'd invaded <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> neighbors</COREF> /.
But the point is that now that <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's gone <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> has an opportunity *PRO* to be a different Iraq in a different kind of <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">Middle East</COREF> /.

Weapons of mass destruction there were none /.
We would be greeted *-1 as liberators /.
this is three years later /.
That th- it *EXP*-1 would not take hundreds of thousands of American troops *PRO* to occupy <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's now over three hundred and fifty billion dollars /.
Each judgement has proven *-1 to be wrong /.
The judgement that *T*-1 has not proven *-2 to be wrong uh Tim is that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the region</COREF> is changing in fundemental ways and <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the region</COREF> is better without <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> /.
Yes it *EXP*-1 is true that uh everyone thought 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had weapons of mass destruction /.
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did not *?* /.
It *EXP*-1 is by the way the case that the Iraqis are delighted *PRO*-2 to be rid *-3 of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
And some Iraqis uh <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">most Iraqis</COREF> in fact uh are willing *RNR*-1 and uh want *RNR*-1 *PRO* to keep coalition forces there until <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can uh take care of this <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> /.
But we do have *-1 to keep things in historical perspective /.
These people are doing something that *T*-1 is quite unknown in <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> /.
and one has *-1 to ask what was <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the alternative</COREF> *T*-2 /?
Was <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the alternative</COREF> *PRO* to leave <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> in power uh *PRO*-1 continuing *-2 to threaten <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> neighbors *PRO*-1 continuing with <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> uh windfall profits from the oil for food scandal</COREF> *PRO*-1 continuing *-3 to repress uh <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> people and build mass graves uh *PRO*-1 continuing *-4 to uh use <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">those oil for food profits</COREF> *PRO*-5 to again build the infrastructure for <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> weapons of mass destruction /?
But many will say 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was contained *-1 by the no - fly zone /.
Ah I do n't think that there is anyone -- I <COREF ID="m_11" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> do not think that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in a box /.
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was in a box /.
It i- the oil for food program alone shows that the billions of dollars that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was collecting *T*-1 /-
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was not just going *-1 to build palaces /.
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was someone who *T*-1 had an insatiable appetite uh *PRO*-2 to dominate <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> region</COREF> /.
Now without <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> you can look across <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the region</COREF> and see that uh a lot is changing thanks to the President 's democracy uh promotion and the hard work of people in those countries /.
You have Syrian forces out of <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Lebanon</COREF> /.
You have uh <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> out of uh <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
The people of <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> are taking on authoritarian governments across <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> /.
Kuwait has given women the right *PRO* to vote /.
<COREF ID="m_11" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> 'd be the first 0 *T*-1 to say that <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">these big historical changes</COREF> are turbulent and <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're difficult /.
But the notion that somehow there was a placid Middle East , that if <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> just left it alone , if <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd just not invaded <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> , if <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had just not overthrown dictators , if <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> {had?} just not challenged Syrian power in <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Lebanon</COREF> everything would be just fine uh is simply not true /.

<COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Condoleezza_Rice">I</COREF> would just ask people *PRO*-1 to remember how hard this was *T*-2 for <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Immigration /.</COREF>
*PRO* Look at these scenes and these pictures from Los Angeles /.
Five hundred thousand people according to police estimates turned out *PRO*-1 to protest some of the immigration reforms that *T*-2 are being discussed *-3 debated *-3 perhaps legislated *-3 in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_34" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">David Broder</COREF> how big of a political issue is <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">immigration</COREF> *T*-1 /.
and what are the potential pitfalls for <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">politicians</COREF> *T*-2 as <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> try *PRO*-1 to navigate <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> started as a border issue in uh states that *T*-1 have common boundaries with Mexico particularly /.
Uh <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has now become a national issue /.
*PRO* Talking to <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Republican Governor of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Minnesota</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a big issue in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> state</COREF> /.
Suburban t- Illinois districts now find large Hispanic populations /.
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has become a much tougher issue for politicians of both parties but particularly <COREF ID="m_34" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">I</COREF> think for Republicans /.
The polling 0 we have seen *T*-1 with the Wall Street Journal NBC eighty - eight percent say 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a serious problem /.
sixty - two percent say that illegal <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">illegal immigrants</COREF> should not be allowed *-1 to become citizens /.
and sixty percent say that we should n't even give <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> guest worker status *PRO*-1 to come here temporarily /.
<COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">Elisabeth Bumiller</COREF> <COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">you</COREF> wrote a piece in the New York Times quote <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> is facing a difficult path on <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">immigration</COREF> talking about the joint pressures on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> from the business community we need these people to work because Americans wo n't do the jobs and the conservative community saying i- <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">illegal immigrants</COREF> get <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out /.
What does <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> do *T*-1 /?
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's trying *PRO*-1 to uh thread the needle and walk a very fine line between both of these groups /.
<COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">I</COREF> mean inches he 's a you know a governor of -- <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's a former governor of a border state /.
so he this is very close to <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> political experience /.
Emotionally he is i- -- in the early days of this debate in two thousand four <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was giving very emotional speeches about <COREF ID="161" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">America</COREF> <COREF ID="161" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the land of immigrants</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was proposing this this very what many Republicans said 0 *T*-1 was a very generous guest worker program /.
Um <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has pulled back a lot now ah under under onslaught from from conservatives /.
and now <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's emphasizing the border security part of <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> plan /.
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's trying *PRO*-1 to do both /.
There 's a lot -- as we know *?* there 's <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">a lot of different proposals on the hill</COREF> right now /.
We 'll see some of <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> next week /.
Um <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> is hanging back *PRO*-1 waiting *PRO*-2 to see what what *T*-3 comes out of th- -- out of the smoke /.
and then we 'll -- <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll weigh in /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">Charlie Cook</COREF> it appears that the American people have very firm views about <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">immigration</COREF> and that <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> and other politicians are kind of trying *PRO*-1 to nuance <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> /.
Is that possible /?
Well <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a funny issue /.
If you ask <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">me</COREF> what *T*-1 's the most important problem facing the country <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a small single digit issue /.
but then once 0 you raise <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> boy emotions run high /.
and it *EXP*-1 's hard *PRO* to split the baby /.
And and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> can see where <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> 's trying *PRO*-1 to go *T*-2 the *PRO* let 's build build a wall or build a barrier stop illegal immigration /.
But for <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">the people 0 we have *T*-1</COREF> we got *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">mainstream</COREF> <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">keep</COREF> this workforce going because <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's important for agribusiness and business /.
Is <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> politically acceptable to conservatives /?
Eh <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not acceptable to anybody /.
but <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's the only way <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> think /-
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> mean they 're going *-1 to have *-2 to figure out a way 0 *PRO* to split the baby *T*-3 because one way or the other is is is is just not going *-4 to work /.
<COREF ID="m_39" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">John /?</COREF>
Well *PRO* let 's do n't forget <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> 0 Democrats are also split *-1 on <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> /.
Lot of African - Americans are not very sympathetic with the cause of the guest worker program /.
Uh <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> one of the ways <COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">Elisabeth</COREF> mentioned *PRO* trying to thread the needle one of the things 0 <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were looking at *T*-1 is *PRO* trying *PRO*-2 to push the final resolution of this until after <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the midterm election</COREF> /.
That also could happen on some budget issues as well as a way of *PRO* trying *PRO*-1 to make some sort of common cause between moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans /.
You know in two thousand <COREF ID="315" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> <COREF ID="315" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> <COREF ID="315" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> /.
Two thousand four <COREF ID="319" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> <COREF ID="319" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> <COREF ID="319" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> /.
You look at two thousand eight that electoral college map /.
and you look at states like New Mexico and Arizona and Colorado some real potential swing states /.
And <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> could be very decisive as we play it through /.
Well *PRO* let 's do- do n't forget one other thing <COREF ID="m_9" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was raised *-1 in the Virginia governor 's race last year by <COREF ID="347" TYPE="IDENT">the republican candidate who *T*-2 went after some of these job centers that *T*-3 attract illegal immigrants</COREF> /.
*PRO* Did n't work for <COREF ID="347" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.

There 's a constant sort of perception if you will *?* that *T*-1 is created *-2 because what *T*-3 's newsworthy is the car bomb in Baghdad it 's not all the work that *T*-4 went on that day in fifteen other provinces in terms of *PRO* making progress towards *PRO* rebuilding <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld</COREF> weighed in /.
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The terrorists</COREF> seem *-1 to recognize that <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">losing</COREF> in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe that history will show <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> to be the case /.
Fortunately history is not made *-1 up of daily headlines blogs on the websites or the latest sensational attack /.
And then this Wednesday <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">President Bush</COREF> went to a town meeting in West Virginia of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">his</COREF> supporters /.
and here 's *T*-3 one of the questions that *T*-1 was asked *-2 /.
And <COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker2">I</COREF> ask <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">you</COREF> this from the bottom of <COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker2">my</COREF> heart for a solution to this because it seems that <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">our major media networks</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to portray the good . <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> just want *PRO*-2 to focus /-
Okay *PRO* hold on a second /.
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> just want *PRO*-1 to focus on another car bomb /.
or <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just want *PRO*-1 to focus on some more bloodshed /.
Does <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">that issue</COREF> *ICH*-1 work that th- it 's the mainstream media that *T*-2 's distorting the good news that *T*-3 's coming out of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> helps with the republican base /.
but <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> helps with swing voters at all /.
First of all it 's the nature of news /.
<COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> mean on the evening news at night a car that *T*-1 is n't in a wreck is n't in the news /.
A house that *T*-1 does n't burn a building that *T*-2 does n't burn a killing that *T*-3 does n't take place /.
News is when -- is the aberration is the change from normalcy /.
Secondly this uh eighty journalists so far have been killed *-1 over there /.
Um <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> mean it 's -- it 's -- it 's -- <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> mean *PRO* getting out there and looking around wandering around <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> *PRO*-1 looking for good news sounds to <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">me</COREF> like a good way 0 *PRO* to get killed *-2 *T*-3 /.
And then the third thing is that I <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> do n't know if <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> really want *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to sell <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> because people do n't think that that uh that everything 's fine /.
I mea- <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> think 0 this is just an extenuation of *PRO* holding the banner that *T*-1 says mission accomplished *-2 /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">The people</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's well /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> can see that <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not going well /.
And what *T*-1 happens in fifteen provinces does n't matter /.
What if <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think that <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">this thing</COREF> is just really going to hell in a handbasket um it 's ki- -- <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> mean that 's what -- you know that 's that /.
<COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">David Broder /?</COREF>
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The ombudsman at The Post</COREF> <COREF ID="195" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Deborah Howell</COREF> has a very thoughtful analysis of this question in the paper *ICH*-1 today which <COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">I</COREF> would refer people to *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="m_12" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">I</COREF> think 0 the answer is that when there is <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">this level of violence and turmoil in <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-10-E5" TYPE="IDENT">a country</COREF></COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> has *-2 to be the heart of <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the story that the press is is telling *T*-3</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">The other parts of <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> do get told *-1 /.
but <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not dominate the news /.
and <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ca n't dominate the news given the realities of <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-10-E5" TYPE="IDENT">that country</COREF> /.
Nor should <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> dominate the news /.
It 's a very weak argument /.
When when you <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> as <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">Charlie</COREF> said *?* <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">journalists over there who *T*-1 can not move around <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> *PRO*-2 to report because <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know that that <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're in danger of *PRO*-3 being killed *-4 at any moment</COREF> *T*-5 <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> tells you about <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">the state of security in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's not good /.
The White House /?
Y- the other thing that *T*-1 's interesting what <COREF ID="m_36" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">you</COREF> did n't show *T*-2 was <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">the President 's</COREF> response to <COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker2">her</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">I</COREF> was there that day /.
and <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">he</COREF> was very very careful *PRO* not to jump on <COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker2">her</COREF> bandwagon /.
In fact uh <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">I</COREF> mean obviously <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">he</COREF> did n't have *-1 to *?* /.
<COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker2">She</COREF> did it for <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">him</COREF> /.
but the point is <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">he</COREF> said *PRO* look , *PRO* wait a minute /.
You know um <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">I</COREF> understand <COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker2">your</COREF> frustration /.
but um we have <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">a free press</COREF> in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> /.
We ca n't tell <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> what *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="President_George_W._Bush">He</COREF> pulled back somewhat from <COREF ID="m_47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="speaker2">her</COREF> comment /.
and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">you</COREF> 're right <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">Charlie</COREF> that they are n't -- <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ca n't sell <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and when <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've <COREF ID="307" TYPE="IDENT">tried</COREF> in the past *T*-1 <COREF ID="307" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has backfired on <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> a couple times <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">this week</COREF> /.
And so so it 's -- i- they 're -- they 're -- again <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're being a little more careful here than usual /.

<COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">You</COREF> captured <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in <COREF ID="m_22" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">your</COREF> column this way /.
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">The conflict over the Dubai Ports World</COREF> brought to the surface deep - seated resentments from <COREF ID="MSNBC_MEETPRESS_ENG_20060326_215801.part-11-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Capitol end of Pennsylvania Avenue</COREF> toward the people around <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> and surprisingly toward <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Bush <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> /.
The harmony that *T*-1 had prevailed during most of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Bush 's</COREF> tenure the deference that a Republican controlled Congress has generally shown *T*-2 to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wishes disappeared /.
Even the normal circumspection with which congressional Republicans treat <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> *T*-1 withered in the heat of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">this dispute</COREF> /.
And then <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="126" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia</COREF> <COREF ID="126" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a committee chairman</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">told</COREF> The Post 0 <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is probably the worst administration ever in *PRO* getting <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Congress '</COREF> opinion on anything /.

One of the things being talked about * <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">Elisabeth Bumiller</COREF> is <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the staff shake - up at <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF></COREF> /.
This is how <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">you</COREF> reported <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 /.
Republicans outside <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> say 0 that had pushed <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Bush</COREF> uh *PRO*-1 not to replace <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Karl Rove</COREF> <COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the chief uh political operator</COREF> <COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Deputy uh Chief of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Staff</COREF></COREF></COREF> but rather to bring in someone at the same level or above perhaps as minister without portfolio /.
One Republican said 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Mister Bush</COREF> should view <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as *PRO* replacing a top - notch pitcher struggling in the later innings of a baseball game rather than as a vote of no - confidence in a friend /.
So who 's the reliever *T*-1 /?
Well there 's <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">lots of names that they</COREF> /-
You 've heard <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> as well as <COREF ID="m_7" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Elisabeth_Bumiller">I</COREF> have *?* /.
Ed Gillespie uh you know <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Paxon</COREF> /.
there 's lots of names /.
Um the question is are they going *-1 to do <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
and and right now there 's -- there 's a lot of talk at <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> /.
There 's no indication that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> has signed on to this idea /.
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Karl Rove</COREF> has told people that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks that *PRO* bringing somebody in without a clear line of authority is a mistake /.
It and and uh th- the bottom line is what is this going *-1 to d- *T*-3 -- is <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> going *-2 to help with the war in Iraq /?
It 's going *-1 to help with -- you know tha- that 's -- it 's -- is it goi- -- you know we 're n- -- we 're not talking about *PRO* changing policies here /.
we 're changing about -- you know changing you know some some personnel /.
so i- that 's /-
it *EXP*-1 's unclear if anything 's going *-2 to happen /.
<COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">John /?</COREF>
Well chances *ICH*-1 are pretty good 0 something will happen /.
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The President</COREF> of course did n't rule out the idea of *PRO* bringing someone on /.
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Paxon</COREF> 's a possibility /.
Vin Weber 's also a possibility /.
And <COREF ID="m_20" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="John_Harwood">I</COREF> think 0 over time you could see some changes in <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">White House</COREF> staff</COREF> as well /.
When you look at sort of the the big three or or th- the biggest names in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Andy Card</COREF> <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Karl Rove</COREF> Dan Bartlett *T*-1 you could see some change over time /.

Uh *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">me</COREF> turn to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the midterm elections</COREF> where th- all these things +invariably lead *T*-1 /.
Here 's *T*-1 our latest numbers in the Wall Street Journal poll right track wrong track /.
United States headed in the right direction twenty - six percent /.
One of four /.
Sixty - two percent say wrong track /.
and the so called generic question who do you want *T*-1 to control Congress /.
Republicans thirty - seven percent /.
Fifty percent now a majority say <COREF ID="273" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF> /.
but as always <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">Charlie Cook</COREF> is warning of us *PRO*-1 to go slow /.
And here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">his</COREF> latest column from the National Journal /.
Despite national political trends indicating that <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the GOP</COREF> is in serious trouble a race by race micro-analysis suggests that Democrats can not easily seize control of the <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> or <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> this fall /.
In <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> Democrats need a net gain of six seats /.
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Democrats</COREF> need *-1 to win in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Tennessee where Bill Frist is retiring *T*-2</COREF> have *-1 to run the table by *PRO*-3 defeating all the most vulnerable Republicans while *PRO*-4 holding all of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own seats including in Minnesota where <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> incumbent is retiring *T*-5 and in Washington state where Senator Maria Cantwell faces a very strong challenger *T*-6 /.
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also need *-1 to hang on to somewhat more secure open seats in Maryland and Vermont as well as fourteen other incumbents /.
Although not impossible in a favorable +political political climate this is a very tall order /.
and here are the vulnerable states according to the <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">Cook</COREF> report /.
Uh <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vulnerable senators</COREF> <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Conrad Burns in Montana</COREF> Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Mike DeWine <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> Santorum in Pennsylvania Jim Talent Missouri and <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Tennessee</COREF> seat</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">Charlie</COREF> what do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">you</COREF> see *T*-1 in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> /?
This is -- you know when you look at <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">this election</COREF> from the big picture the national numbers *T*-1 boy *PRO* just looks horrible /.
and it looks like gosh <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Republicans</COREF> will be lucky if <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> hold onto anything /.
And then you do the race by race like this /.
Now the thing is the first three or four for <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Democrats</COREF> probably are n't that hard /.
But when you get to the fifth and sixth seats *T*-1 you get to to to *PRO* winning in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> and you wi- -- and an- an- talking about <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Tennessee</COREF> open seat</COREF> /.
Gosh that 's hard /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> mean it 's going *-1 to take a real real real strong wind up <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> backs /.
And and it 's the kind of thing where there 's structural barriers *T*-1 /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">I</COREF> mean eighty - five percent of all incumbent senators get reelected *-1 /.
And you 've got *-1 to <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">knock</COREF> out five of them /?
Now <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can happen /.
but <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's hard /.
And it 's kind of like *PRO* having uh <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">structural barriers that *T*-1 are out there that *T*-2 are protecting the Republican majorities</COREF> /.
and if <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a category one two or three hurricane <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">those barriers</COREF> are strong enough /.
but if <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a four or five <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not *?* /.
And the question is how tall it will <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> be *T*-1 /.
And <COREF ID="m_25" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Tim_Russert">Tim</COREF> some of the- -- some of those ranges races can change overnight in a hurry /.
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Conrad Burns</COREF> has now got a primary challenge from a significant Republican /.
There 's some talk *ICH*-1 among Republicans that maybe <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Conrad Burns</COREF> would find something else 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 maybe in the Bush administration /.
That could change in a hurry /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">Charlie</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Charlie_Cook">you</COREF> also say this about <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> /.
In <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the House where Democrats need a net gain of fifteen seats *T*-1</COREF> only about three dozen are truly in play <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> /.
So it 's -- it 's i- tough /.

and the tsunami came /.
Republicans won fifty - two seats uh *PRO*-1 electing <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">Newt Gingrich</COREF> Speaker of <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">Newt Gingrich</COREF> has now weighed in <COREF ID="m_52" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">David Broder</COREF> and said that <COREF ID="273" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats '</COREF> slogan in two thousand shits six should be *PRO* had enough /.
And <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks 0 that would work /.
What a l- helper <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">Gingrich</COREF> is *T*-1 /.
Uh <COREF ID="m_52" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="273" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats '</COREF> real slogan may very well be would n't you like *PRO*-1 to have somebody watching the store because the sense that <COREF ID="m_52" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="David_Broder">I</COREF> get *T*-2 from *PRO*-3 talking to <COREF ID="293" TYPE="IDENT">voters</COREF> is that <COREF ID="293" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are not ready *PRO*-4 to entrust the government to <COREF ID="273" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF> but <COREF ID="293" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not really comfortable th- with the way 0 <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the Republicans</COREF> have been running things *T*-5 /.
