Both vehicles which *T*-1 are armored can house up to twenty five marines /.
This time there were fifteen inside the AAV /.
Fourteen died /.
and one civilian translator was also killed *-1 /.
Now this occured in basically the same area where <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">six marines</COREF> were killed *-1 <COREF ID="311" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> in an ambush launched * by insurgents *T*-2 /.
<COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">The six marines</COREF> were snipers located * on a roof looking for insurgents travelling down a smuggling route when <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">they <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF></COREF> were surrounded and killed *-1 by insurgent snipers *T*-2 /.
Now all of this violence has been located *-1 in <COREF ID="333" TYPE="IDENT">an area known * as the Euphrates river valley</COREF> /.
This is the main smuggling route for <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050803_190000.part-0-E1" TYPE="IDENT">insurgents</COREF> from the Syrian border into central Iraq /.
There have been several marine operations in <COREF ID="333" TYPE="IDENT">that area</COREF> since May *PRO* to try *PRO*-1 to shut down those smuggling routes /.
But today and <COREF ID="311" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> 's attacks show that <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050803_190000.part-0-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the insurgents</COREF> are still very resilient /.

But it was an extremely shallow grave /.
And political analysts say 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the closer than *PRO* expected *-1 outcome</COREF> offers several lessons /.
First of all voters now appear *-1 to be more receptive to criticism of <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> approach to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> and skeptical of blanket support like <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jean_Schmidt">Schmidt 's</COREF> /.

and <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *-1 to stay the course /.
One analyst says that if the fourteen marines from <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> killed * <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> had been ambushed *-1 last week the election results might have been reversed *-2 /.
Secondly <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jean_Schmidt">Schmidt 's</COREF> close call may suggest that *PRO* aligning with <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> on immigration and social security is precarious /.
And finally there is an advantage to *PRO* campaigning as a political outsider /.
<COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">I</COREF> 'm running because uh <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">I</COREF> actually want *PRO*-1 to go to <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> and fight for regular Americans /.
While *PRO* campaigning <COREF ID="m_31" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Paul_Hackett">Hackett</COREF> repeatedly criticized the leadership of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican party</COREF> and argued that power brokers including Tom DeLay must be replaced *-1 /.

*PRO* Welcome back to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hardball</COREF> /.
More on <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">that congressional race in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF></COREF> and what <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> means *T*-1 for the rest of the country /.
We 're joined *-1 right now by <COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> Democratic congressman</COREF> <COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sherrod Brown</COREF> and <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio 's</COREF> Republican Secretary of State</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Ken Blackwell</COREF> who *T*-2 's also a candidate for governor who *T*-3 is in fact a candidate for governor</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">Mr. Secretary</COREF> *PRO* thank <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">you</COREF> very much <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">Ken</COREF> for *PRO*-1 coming on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the show</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">You</COREF> 're running for governor /.
Are <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">you</COREF> worried that this uh strongly Republican district uh barely came through for the Republican candidate against an anti-war Democrat /?
I you know <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> think 0 it was a wake - up call particularly for those Republicans that *T*-1 campaign like Ronald Reagan and then govern like Mike Dukakis /.
Uh what the -- what <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the base</COREF> is saying *T*-1 is that <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> expect you to get up every morning and be who you say 0 you are *T*-2 and do what you say 0 you 're going *-3 to do *T*-4 /.
And <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ken_Blackwell">I</COREF> think 0 I that is a wake - up call /.
And if the Republican party uh grasps that then we will go about the business of *PRO* reestablishing the line of distinction between Republicans and Democrats particularly on fiscal matters because <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF> do n't represent change /.
They are s- -- <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not saying 0 <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to cut taxes and grow out our economy and create jobs /.
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're not saying 0 <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want a right - sized government *PRO* to make sure that we check runaway state government spending and put more emphasis on the private sector /.
So <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't represent any change but the change of *PRO* being from the outside to the inside /.
And so Republicans that *T*-1 are going *-2 to be successful next year are Republicans that *T*-3 show a real distinction between the status quo and *PRO* getting our economy moving again by *PRO* cutting taxes and right - sizing government /.

Yeah I <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> look at who <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">conservatives</COREF> really are *T*-1 /.
I thought -- what <COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> always learned *T*-1 was that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wanted smaller government uh not no no national debt and <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wanted *PRO*-2 to stay out of foreign entanglements /.
and we 're seeing exactly the opposite /.
But what *T*-1 happened in southwest Ohio <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Secretary Blackwell</COREF> 's right /.
it 's a -- <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a wake - up call with <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a message</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> do n't know what *ICH*-3 Mike Dukakis has *T*-2 0 *PRO*-1 to do *T*-4 with it /.

*PRO* has accused <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> of *PRO* not being patriotic /.
<COREF ID="m_6" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Sherrod_Brown">I</COREF> think 0 whatever <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hackett</COREF> said *T*-1 was understandable /.
But the issue is that <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Hackett</COREF> <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">ran</COREF> incredibly well when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush</COREF> put <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> name on the line and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Bob Taft</COREF> put <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> name on the line in <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">that district</COREF> *T*-1 /.

There was a soccer ball there /.
Uh <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> sort of get um uh a feel for what uh <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">recreation</COREF> 's like *T*-1 /.

Each of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">the guides</COREF> pointed out to <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> the black uh arrows that you see *T*-1 everywhere 0 *T*-2 are showing where Mecca is *T*-3 /.

The command staff works inside the wire /.
But a separate question beyond the guys who *T*-1 are working down there is what 's *T*-2 going *-3 to be done *-4 with <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> /?
And uh <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">the military</COREF> will admit to you 0 at the moment it looks like <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the five hundred people that *T*-1 are currently there</COREF> are going *-2 to be there indefinitely and <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't have any charges against <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.

*PRO* Welcome back to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hardball</COREF> /.
Back in March <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">some of baseball 's most well known superstars</COREF> were called *-1 to Congress *PRO*-2 to testify on steroid use in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">major league baseball</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">One of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">those in the hot seat</COREF> denying 0 <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> ever used steroids</COREF> was Rafael Palmeiro of the Baltimore Orioles /.
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">My</COREF> name is Rafael Palmeiro /.

<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">I</COREF> will be brief in <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">my</COREF> remarks today /.
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">me</COREF> start by *PRO*-1 telling you this <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">I</COREF> have never used steroids period /.
<COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">I</COREF> do not know how *PRO* to say it any more clearly than that *T*-1 /.
Never /.
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Major league baseball</COREF> does n't agree /.
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The league</COREF> <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">suspended</COREF> <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">Palmeiro</COREF> for ten days this week for *PRO*-1 flunking a drug test /.
The New York Times today reported 0 <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> had <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">a potent steroid</COREF> *ICH*-2 in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">his</COREF> system</COREF> . <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">The same that *T*-1 caused <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson</COREF> to lose <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Olympic gold medal back in eighty - eight</COREF> /.
Yesterday on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hardball</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">former major leaguer Jose Conseco who *T*-1 wrote about *PRO*-2 injecting <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">Palmeiro</COREF> with steroids in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">his</COREF> book</COREF> <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Juiced</COREF></COREF> responded to <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">his</COREF> suspension</COREF> /.
You have *-1 to be careful now because uh the extensions may be too extreme /.
For example if <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">Palmeiro</COREF> is abiding by <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> , if <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">Palmeiro</COREF> is not using steroids right now and a metabolyte has been found *-1 in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">his</COREF> system</COREF> <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> 's found *-2 guilty which *T*-3 makes -- which *T*-4 makes no sense /.
But that 's <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">his</COREF> fault /.
A lot of the players /-
Is n't it -- is n't it that <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">his</COREF> fault <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">Jose</COREF> if he lie -- if <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> never ever used steroids then <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">tests</COREF> *PRO*-1 positive . And then <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> says oh <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's from a previous drug use /.
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">his</COREF> contradiction that <COREF ID="m_24" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Rafael_Palmero">he</COREF> created *T*-1 , is n't <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *?* /?
Well i- <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a contradiction on one subject matter /.
On one time frame and not o- on another /.
There are going *-1 to be <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">many athletes who uh *T*-3 once this drug testing program was instituted *-2 are going *-4 to be found uh *-5 guilty</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> urine sample is going *-1 to come out positive because there will be strong metabolytes /.
But why do n't <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just say I used *T*-1 /-
But that does n't mean 0 <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not abiding by <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> /.
Okay I do n't want *PRO*-1 to interrupt <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">you</COREF> Dan /.
but but why do n't <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> admit 0 <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> broke <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> before so the new drug test will be found *-1 to be positive because of previous use *T*-2 /.
then <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wo n't be nailed *-1 again /?
It 's very simple /.
They do n't have enough information enough knowledge on how long a metabolyte lasts in an athlete 's system *T*-1 /.

<TEXT PARTNO="015">
Well now <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the House uh Government Reform Committee which *T*-1 held <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">those hearings</COREF> back in March</COREF> is requesting from Major League Baseball <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the documents relating to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro 's</COREF> drug test</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> want <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the drug test results</COREF> on paper</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will cooperate with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">Congressman Steven Lynch of Massachusetts</COREF> is a member of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> and is now with us from Boston /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">Congressman Lynch</COREF> are <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> uh uh /-
uh <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to get a hold of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">those documents</COREF> <COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">those drug test results</COREF> *PRO* right from <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF></COREF> /?
Certainly it would -- uh <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would answer the question that <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Canseco</COREF> has raised *T*-1 about how long uh it was in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> system *T*-2 and whether or not <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was from a residual use /.
What difference does it make *T*-1 whether <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> lied before and was using before and is found *-2 out now or <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been using lately /?
Well if if <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was using steroids during <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> testimony</COREF> or prior to <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> testimony</COREF> obviously <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has committed perjury and has tried *PRO*-1 to mislead <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> in a -- in an ongoing investigation /.
So uh it it has uh a lot 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 about what *T*-2 happens next /.
Would <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> like *PRO*-2 to see <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> charged *-1 with perjury if he did -- h- uh if there 's evidence *ICH*-3 now hard evidence *ICH*-4 to a drug test that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in fact using steroids back then before <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the testimony</COREF> /?
Because there 's only two options here as <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> point out *?* /.
and <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> elucidate this /.
If <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's used <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the drugs</COREF> *ICH*-2 and never used <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> before since <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the hearings</COREF> that *ICH*-1 's almost insane *PRO* to think 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did that /.
Yeah /.
So is uh <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> defense or the defense that <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Canseco</COREF> offered *T*-1 on this show <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">last night</COREF> was that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may have used <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> a while ago in other words before <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> testified that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> never had *?* , therefore <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's guilty of perjury /.
Right /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> 'm not sure if <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Canseco</COREF> is just offering <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> opinion uh uh /.
Certainly <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF> never contested the <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the positive result on <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the test</COREF></COREF> /.
Uh so <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have n't actually got <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in /.
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's agreed today to verbally *PRO*-1 to release <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">all the documents</COREF> /.
However I <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> needs *-1 to get a similar release from the union because the confidentiality agreement is part of a collective bargaining agreement /.
so <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *-1 to go to <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">that step</COREF> as well /.
Yeah but *PRO* assuming 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> get by <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">that step</COREF> do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> should be hit *-1 with a perjury charge /?
Well if he -- if <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> meets the requirements yes /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're trying *PRO*-1 to protect <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the process</COREF> /.
When <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> come before <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> and <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are sworn *-1 *PRO*-2 to testify truthfully *T*-3 there has *-4 to be consequences when <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not do so *T*-5 /.
So <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is about the integrity of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the congressional process</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not about *PRO* going after <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Palmeiro</COREF> /.
We had <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Ray Garibaldi</COREF> *ICH*-1 on <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">last night</COREF> who *T*-2 lost <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son</COREF> to uh steroid use /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's an athlete /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was trying *PRO*-1 to make it as a young man /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was using steroids *PRO*-1 to get ahead in that uh baseball career /.
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="016">
Uh there are <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">a lot of young people out there now watching this program right now probably who *T*-1 may be in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> eighteen year old era from eighteen to twenty one</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're thinking about how <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can break into the big leagues *T*-1 /.
Is this a -- is <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this ten day suspension</COREF> enough *PRO* to turn <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> off to drugs /?
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's really a joke if you think about it /.
If a person -- and if if if a non-athlete a non-celebrity is is uh convicted *-1 of simple possession of a -- of a -- of a schedule three substance like like these steroids uh there 's a potential for a year in jail /.
This eh in this case <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF> 's looking at <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">a ten day suspension</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> still makes over two point eight million dollars a year /.
Uh <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's uh t- rumored *-1 to be considered *-2 for the Hall of Fame /.
So it it really -- uh the the penalty in baseball i- is really an incentive uh *PRO* to take the chance /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> mean there 's -- there 's very little consequences uh other than <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> reputation of course for <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Palmeiro</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">You</COREF> 're not at all prejudiced *PRO*-1 being a <COREF ID="MSNBC_HARDBALL_ENG_20050803_190000.part-16-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Sox</COREF> fan , are <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> *?* here /?

Oh of course of course /.
*PRO* Let 's take a look at something that <COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">Jose Canseco</COREF> said *T*-1 here last night /.
<COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> want people to understand /.
<COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> said this many times /.
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">My</COREF> attack</COREF> was never on <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> respect <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes</COREF> greatly /.
What <COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> needed *T*-1 was one of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes who <COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> name *T*-2 in the actual book who *T*-3 are well known uh individuals</COREF> to come forth and say you know what what <COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">Jose</COREF> 's saying *T*-4 is one hundred percent true /.
Um <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">my</COREF> major attack and my -- and <COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">my</COREF> only attack</COREF> was on <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Major League Baseball</COREF> and <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the Player 's Association</COREF></COREF> because <COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ought *-1 to be you know exploited *-2 and found *-2 out for uh <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the corrupt methods 0 <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> use *T*-3</COREF> for *PRO*-4 letting steroids in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the game</COREF> for *PRO*-4 endorsing steroids in the -- in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the game of baseball</COREF> /.
And all of a sudden you know <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">Bud Segal</COREF> <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">says</COREF> <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know anything about <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> never say anything /.
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's ridiculous /.
It 's the biggest ongoing joke on the planet right now /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">Congressman Lynch</COREF> <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> 're concerned about the rights of labor and collective bargaining agreements /.
And certainly many of us are *?* here as well in this country generally /.
And uh so <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">I</COREF> respect <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> /.
so *PRO* let <COREF ID="m_23" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Chris_Matthews">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> this though /.
Do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> think 0 the unions have done the job here /?
Is it *EXP*-1 fair *PRO* to say that <COREF ID="m_46" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jose_Canseco">Canseco</COREF> 's got it right by *PRO*-2 saying 0 <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the Player 's Association</COREF> has not been aggressive in *PRO* getting rid *-3 of steroids /?
Well <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a union problem /.
Why not a union *T*-1 /-
/.
Why is n't <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> a union problem *T*-1 /?
Well well /-
If <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're protecting <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">the players '</COREF> rights and saying 0 <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should n't be tested *-1 /.
You watch <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">those lawyers in <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">your</COREF> committee</COREF> /.
They 're up there -- <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were all over the place *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to defend eh <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">the players</COREF> /.
Hey <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> 'm a former union president <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">myself</COREF> and and also an attorney that *T*-1 represented a lot of unions /.
<COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">I</COREF> always thought 0 a very strong anti-drug policy was a good thing for <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">my</COREF> union members /.
This is one case where they have <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">turned</COREF> a blind eye to what *T*-1 's going on in professional sports *T*-2 /.
But that 's -- <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not the typical position of <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">unions</COREF> /.
No /.
<COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> usually want <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">a strong anti-drug policy</COREF> *PRO* to make a better workforce /.
Well of course <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's also for safety reasons at the workplace /.
But about uh b- *PRO* let 's get back to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="248" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">MLB</COREF> <COREF ID="248" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Major League Baseball</COREF></COREF> /.
Do you think Bud Segal -- do <COREF ID="m_0" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Steven_Lynch">you</COREF> believe 0 <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the whole major league uh establishment</COREF> has been benefitting from <COREF ID="255" TYPE="IDENT">all these homeruns</COREF> *ICH*-1 all these years and big muscles that *T*-2 produce <COREF ID="255" TYPE="IDENT">these homeruns</COREF> /?
Absolutely /.

if <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">those two gentlemen</COREF> uh you know were guilty of <COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and there 's -- there 's some evidence that <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were *?* uh <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> put people back into the seats /.
