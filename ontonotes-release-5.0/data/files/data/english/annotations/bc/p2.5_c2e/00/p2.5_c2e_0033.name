Since the ability of criminals to avoid detection is so strong , what methods have you come up with to counter them when working a case .
Um .
Well , we might have an undercover investigation .
We act as buyers looking to purchase plates or permits .
The adversary then makes contact and communication for us .
Uh-huh .
So , through contact and communication , right , we found out basic area of operation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten</ENAMEX> or so cell phones was around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiyuan</ENAMEX> .
After that , the military and the local police jointly established a case and jointly adopted measures to directly hit and encircle the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> points , thereby realizing a pinpoint strike against them .
We saw the close facsimiles of license plates they 'd made , ha .
That , they should have been most likely made from molds .
Then , where did the molds come from .
Did they make them by themselves too .
Um , from what we understand , eh , this , the molds came from <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> directions .
Uh-huh .
On the one hand , they were from common tools that they 'd bought in markets .
Uh-huh .
On the other hand , there were specialized tools that they had somebody make .
For example , the steel mold , or , in another example , the mold for the vehicle license plate frame .
They brought these <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> separately acquired tools together and in the end formed a contiguous and complete set of tools for making forged copies , ah .
How much would they sell a set of military license plates for .
This , from what we 've seen during our campaign , prices vary .
Uh-huh .
Some stolen authentic plates can sell for up to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">sixty thousand yuan</ENAMEX> .
Some criminals who make fake plates sell or rent them as real plates .
The highest has reached <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">thirty thousand yuan</ENAMEX> for one set .
Wow , that 's really a huge profit , ah .
Yes .
