Of course , what all investors are most concerned about is , how long will this wave , this trend of appreciation last .
Also , eh , to enter at a time like this , for example , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , he can directly invest in the Renminbi , would it be profitable to enter the market right now .
Uh .
I believe that the appreciation of the RMB will , eh , it will , er , be on a rising trend for a quite long time to come , because this is related to the , this , conditions of savings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> itself .
And behind the change in savings is a factor of demographics .
Right now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's , this , eh , a relatively large proportion of the population are young adults , and these people have higher savings , as they have to save for their children 's education , and for their own retirement .
Yes .
Therefore , during , eh , the middle of this stage , er , the high savings has resulted in a larger surplus in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's regular accounts .
So this appreciation , ah , may hold -- this pressure , this trend will last for a period of time .
But the issue is that the appreciation right now should be viewed as a gradual appreciation on a small scale .
So right now if you ask whether or not it will be profitable , eh , to exchange , this , other currencies into Renminbi , we will need to look at , this , this , the deficit .
