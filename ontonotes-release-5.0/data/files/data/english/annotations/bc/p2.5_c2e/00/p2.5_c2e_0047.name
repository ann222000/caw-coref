Among these programs , what do you appreciate most .
This , it is too difficult to say , I think I should say maybe it 's the next program ah --
The next program .
Then , from these programs that we 've seen , for instance from the surface , like the dragon dance , uh , it is easy and we do n't need to understand much about it , or like the fan dance , ah , or bowls - balancing dance , ah , it 's a completely beautiful thing , a kind of artistic expression .
Then , for instance , eh , I saw a program about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yue Fei 's</ENAMEX> total dedication to his country , uh , and the words his mother etched on him .
Yes , yes .
Then , if these children do not know <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> history very well , do you think they can understand the program .
Eh , through the form of theatrical performances , it is still quite popular .
Of course , if for instance it is about telling a story , eh , then perhaps they may not have any perceptual understanding of it , oh .
I remember an example just like this from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Eh , after some children watched the program , they said , oh , the story this my parents told me <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</ENAMEX> is actually like this .
He can actually feel it , after all , his story has become <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</ENAMEX> - dimensional .
If it 's simply a story , they probably can not remember after listening to it .
Eh , I think there are <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> programs like this in each performance , and it is very educational , with deep , er , and profound significance .
