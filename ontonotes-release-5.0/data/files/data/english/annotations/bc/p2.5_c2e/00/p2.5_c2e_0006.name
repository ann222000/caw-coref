A moment ago , looking at the experience of our reporter , I was thinking that if now I was the family member of a sufferer and the sufferer 's symptoms were also very critical , for example , something like heart disease , ah , the kind of illness where you are racing against the clock , well , the process of waiting for that voice prompt would definitely be too tortuous .
Seeing that just now , my first reaction was that it was extremely irresponsible .
And why .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Ministry of Health</ENAMEX> asked that health care organizations focus on the patient .
This set up is completely centered on itself .
It is extremely indifferent and at the same time is unable to guarantee emergency treatment .
So , among the advanced emergency systems of this kind that you have had contact with , what do you think is the most suitable model .
The establishment of a consolidated emergency center .
I see .
This emergency center , when we dial its telephone number , it is immediately able to display our location .
It has a regulation and control system and as well it has established many branch centers , or emergency stations .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Then , eh , immediately , based on the principle of proximity , it assigns corresponding emergency personnel to carry out the relevant treatment .
Uh-huh .
We became aware , eh , that local healthcare administration departments were still some biased toward the understanding that only one emergency center can be established in a district .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
One emergency center does not mean that there is only one emergency station .
Under an emergency center , there can be branch centers and emergency stations .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , the principle of emergency care is rapidity , proximity and capability .
That is also to say , that a facility only needs to have emergency treatment capabilities , then following examination and approval by the health administration , it can become an emergency care center or emergency care station .
