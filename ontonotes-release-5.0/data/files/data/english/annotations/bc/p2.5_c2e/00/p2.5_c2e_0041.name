Um , well , initially how did you get the feeling that it would be really hard to get a deposition .
Er , when we were looking for the victim , she did not want -- avoided us -- did not want to meet with us .
She hid after you made the inquiry .
Even if after you found her , she also -- once asked questions -- this thing did n't happen to me .
Mainly out of fear , fear of retaliation , right .
Yes .
Uh-huh .
--
He was , for one thing , afraid of retaliation , and moreover , he was not sure whether this time you the police agency could execute a thorough crackdown .
Right .
He could n't perceive your resolution and your capabilities .
Uh-huh , how could you make a breakthrough .
We did <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> things to make a breakthrough in getting the deposition .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , we publicized to the masses our determination this time to fight against evil .
Another thing was to publicize through scrolling media headlines .
Well , their municipal bureau did some , did several runs of this kind of propaganda advertising , this kind of propaganda report on , um , TV , for example , saying that fighting evil has no timetable ,
So , the public was very afraid that you would fight for a while and then you would stop .
Uh-huh .
Was n't the investigation done in secret .
How could there be propaganda advertisements .
Well , on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December 11</ENAMEX> , I said , that is , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</ENAMEX> criminal suspects who participated in special case 1009 also turned themselves in , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huainan City</ENAMEX> , another of our cities .
So , by interrogating them , the details of the case became clear as well .
Well , subsequently we thought that based on the information we previously obtained ; it was time to go public .
Uh-huh .
