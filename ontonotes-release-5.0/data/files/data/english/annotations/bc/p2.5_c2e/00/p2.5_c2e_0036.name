Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> said , ah , just now that all large trucks over <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten</ENAMEX> tons to a very large degree could be fake military vehicles .
In that there is such a clear symbol , so why ca n't they be blocked and directly inspected at some toll booths , eh , and customs posts .
This problem , from the time of the case we have handled , um , is mainly that they hang fake military license plates .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Ah , local law enforcement agencies , road inspection agencies and toll booths can not readily conduct more supervision .
At the same time , why can not this fleet of fake military vehicles be promptly captured .
Judging from the recent period of investigation , inquiry and understanding , it is probable that they are also disguised as they carry out the operation .
As they came out from the mining area and the , um , railroad stations , they normally hang local plates .
Just before they reach a toll booth or an inspection station , they put on military vehicle plates .
After they pass through the toll booth or the inspection station , they put the local plates back on .
Uh-huh .
So , the stretch over which they used military vehicle numbers , fake , fake military vehicle numbers is relatively short .
So , it would be usually difficult to spot .
What if a watch was , um , set -- set up to conduct checks at toll booths .
It 's because our public inspection stands , these agencies , uh , only have an administrative authority .
For example , registering and collecting fees when people arrive , ah .
However , they do n't have a , um , law enforcement authority or this punishment power required for a , um , administrative penalty .
Uh-huh .
Um , so when they encounter these fake military vehicles , they too feel very much that their hands are tied .
It is not like a public security agency .
Public security agencies have a certain , um , this , law - enforcement authority .
