In terms of the addiction of young people to the Internet , it has not been a matter of just one or two days that we talked about it .
For example , many people know about the case of a child in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tianjin</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Xiaoyi</ENAMEX> ; he was finally extremely addicted to the Internet , which in turn tormented him such that he chose to resist it by ending his own life .
Because in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , there is a very high rate of Internet addiction , as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 percent</ENAMEX> .
Yes .
Among young people these days , there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 percent</ENAMEX> of them suffering from this kind of Internet addiction .
Yes , high .
Nearly , nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 million</ENAMEX> children with Internet addiction quit school and stay at home .
Oh .
Why exactly are children attracted .
Well , you will find that behind each Internet addicted child , there is a very distorted family story .
That is to say , in order to sever this Internet addiction , is n't the best way to help them find an effective way to communicate with the real world .
You are absolutely right .
In fact regarding the management of Internet cafes , we have clear administrative regulations , such as prohibiting minors below the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">18</ENAMEX> from entering .
But there are still some people who turn a blind eye to it , so some places should have this kind of business ethics .
Yes .
Also --
I think , for some businesses , they should not just think of making money .
That 's right .
The state should enhance its management of businesses such as Internet cafes , and the most important thing is to help these children to get rid of Internet addiction , and this should start from the adults around these children .
The problem of getting rid of Internet addiction is not something raised for the kids , but for the entire society .
