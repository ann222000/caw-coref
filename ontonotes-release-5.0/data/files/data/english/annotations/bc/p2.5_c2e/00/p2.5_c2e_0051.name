Ah , what a gratifying event !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendao</ENAMEX> will go to court !
What do you mean gratifying , Gosh !
There 's been a lot going on lately , ah .
I frequently go to court .
Before you saw that I forgot to make a customs declaration and had to go to court .
Later on , I neglected to declare and had to go again .
Today I 'll go in a while , yes .
Today , it 's , um , it 's to give --
Who did you offend .
I did n't offend anybody .
I was selected as a juror .
To serve on a jury , to serve on a jury .
Oh , you offended the accused .
No , no , no , today it 's like this .
He first makes the selection , then the lawyers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> sides take a look .
I still do n't know if I will be chosen .
He still does n't know if he will be selected or not .
It 's like this ; the lawyers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> sides have to look to see how the person is .
Then everybody makes the selection together , the person has to be acceptable to all .
So both people have to think that he will be beneficial to both sides .
Beneficial to one 's own side .
Right , Right , that 's right .
Only then can he become a juror .
So , that is --
Normally , normally they will do their best not to select people like us , ah , who work in media .
Ah .
Oh , they 're afraid you are biased or , or will have influence --
They 're afraid you are biased or that you will spread information , or that your opinions are too extreme , and so on and so on .
Oh ,
There are times when it 's not easy to fool them and things like that .
Right , Right , that 's right .
Ay Today , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendao</ENAMEX> , so when you mentioned court , I thought of this kind of controversy over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qiu Xinghua</ENAMEX> court case .
The controversy , eh , actually caused me to feel deeply that we have to admit that our country , uh , is still a rather backward country .
Economically , we are already very , very strong , but in reality when you talk about whether a country is , er , advanced or not , you do n't just look at the economy .
That is also to say , ah , you would have a lot of hard time for the so - called western legal provisions , uh , to work here , ah .
You are assuming that western legal provisions are advanced .
Um .
And our , eh , law , socialism , ah .
I did n't make that assumption .
My that --
My meaning is that we are all moving in the direction of globalization .
That is not necessarily a question of being advanced or backward .
Your whole --
That is to say , there is no way to implement many of our , uh , provisions .
Whether or not they can be implemented is not necessarily a question of being advanced or backward .
