In addition , we also heard some , er , rumors , ah , that is to say , er , that now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chery</ENAMEX> is also talking with other brand makers on joint venture or collaboration .
It may manufacture for others , give , bear others ' brands .
Is that true .
Er , because General Manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yin</ENAMEX> , eh , is personally taking charge of the area of joint ventures and collaboration .
The final , this , model has not been completely decided .
I think I can tell everyone one thing , that is , it is absolutely different from the joint venture in the past .
It should be a type of subversive joint venture .
Uh-huh .
In the past joint , joint venture auto plants use <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's market , this , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's plants , and then with overseas products , brands , and technologies .
Well , this time it may be exactly the opposite .
It will use the other party 's market and produce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chery</ENAMEX> brand .
It wo n't bear others ' brands .
Market .
Producing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chery</ENAMEX> brand and products .
Er , the details of this have not yet been completely formed .
Uh-huh .
It can not be revealed now .
I am not really clear about it either , because I was not involved in this project .
I 'm very sorry .
In fact , asking this kind of question , er , -- how the company will operate specifically -- ha , is the business of the company .
The kind of concern that everyone has expressed is how strong is our independent brand power .
I should say it will stand unswerved .
Uh-huh .
As our own brands have come to today 's stage , if we can establish such a new joint venture , I should think it will be a time for us Chinese to feel proud .
